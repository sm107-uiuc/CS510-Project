However, it can be hard to assimilate it if you are new to stats, or if you were better in history than mathematics during high school.", "In this tutorial, I\u2019ll guide you through an example of how to run a Binomial Distribution simulation in python, making an Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function plot at the end. I\u2019m not covering the foundation concepts of this subject here, so if you\u2019re not familiar with Binomial Distribution, you can check first this excellent article. That said, let\u2019s get started!", "Oh, but before, you\u2019re welcome to download the notebook with all the code I\u2019m using by clicking here.", "Statistical examples can be very abstract, after all, what is a \u201csuccessful case\u201d, and why those people are obsessed with flipping coins and rolling dices? I believe that the best way to learn something is with problems/situations that you can easily relate to.", "Let\u2019s say we are doing an electoral pool. We will ask 10 random people if they are voting Trump for president in 2020. We will repeat this trail with another group of 10 people again and again until we have the answers of 100 thousand groups. Our goal is to discover the probability of 6 people or more in each group to answer yes.", "But wait, instead of taking your pen and paper and run out to start annoying people on the streets, let\u2019s use the power of python to simulate that instead.", "We begin by checking if we have all the elements of a Binomial Distribution case:", "Perfect, so what we do first? Simulate the answers! We can do that using np.random.random() function. It generates a random number between 0 and 1, so we will consider all numbers that are lower than 0.5 as a NO, and numbers equal or higher than 0.5 will be considered YES. Let\u2019s visualize how to generate the answers for a group of 10 people:", "So from our first group of 10 people, 5 answered that they will vote for Trump. Now we just need to reproduce the same logic one hundred thousand times! To do that we need to do a loop and use the function np.random.binomial(), which needs the arguments: n (number of trails, or in our case the number of people in each group), p (probability of a positive answer) and size (how many times we want to run it):", "It\u2019s important to understand how to interpret this result, as it\u2019s not about if Trump will be elected or not, but instead it shows the probability of, given a random group of 10 people, how likely is for 6 or more persons to answer yes for the question \u201care you going to vote in Trump for president?\u201d.", "Given the complex electoral system on the US, this simulation could be used across different electoral districts, where the initial probability varies. We are assuming there\u2019s a 50/50 chance for a yes or no answer, but this scenario would change if you are in Florida or California, right? By changing the probability (p) of getting a positive answer, look how much the results change:", "One of the coolest ways to visualize a binomial distribution is to plot a ECDF to check the distribution of positive answers. It can be done with a simple plt.scatter(), by putting in the y axis the density of the distribution, which ranges from 0 to 1 (100% of samples), and in the x axis, the number of positive answers we have in each group:", "Take as reference the value of 6 on the x axis. On the first plot on the left, with p=0.4, the number 6 is slightly above the value of 0.8, which means that more than 80% of the distribution is under that value, and less than 20% is above. That matches perfectly with our calculations of p=0.4, or 16.76%, and the the same is true for the other 2 plots.", "Take few minutes to compare the plots and values. Once you get the idea, you\u2019ll notice how powerful and simple to understand the ECDF plot is.", "On this practical tutorial I wanted to take you out of the all-the-same kind of examples we have when learning Binomial Distribution, and also show you how to make your first simulation using different p values and how to visualize the results with ECDF plots. I hope this post helps you to sharpen your statistical skills, and please feel free to share your thoughts on the comments.", "Your home for data science.
