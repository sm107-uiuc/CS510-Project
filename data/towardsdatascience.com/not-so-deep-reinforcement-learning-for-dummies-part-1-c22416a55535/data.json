This series of blog posts are more like a note-to-self for me. I hope, in writing these posts, I clear my concepts, and maybe help someone understand them as well. In this post, we\u2019ll talk about what reinforcement learning is, and get an overview of a basic reinforcement learning environment.", "The idea that we learn by interacting with our environment is probably the first to occur to us when we think about the nature of learning \u2014 Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction", "The above line, is what reinforcement learning is all about, learning from interaction; from experience. As humans and animals newly born to the world, we don\u2019t know how the world around us work. It is only after years of interaction with the world that we start to understand how it responds to our actions and only then can we take specific actions to achieve our goals.", "Similarly, in reinforcement learning, we have an agent interacting with an environment. At each time step, the agent receives the environment\u2019s current state, and the agent must choose an appropriate action in response. After the agent executes the action, the agent receives a reward and a new state.", "Let\u2019s take the above example. In the above environment which has states from 0 to 4, we have an agent ( the robot ) that can take two actions Left and Right. The goal of the robot is to reach state 3. If the agent chooses to move left when at position 0 or right at position 4, the agent just remains in place. Also, the environment gives the agent a reward of -1 everytime the agent takes an action and gives +10 on reaching state 3. To understand the first diagram, let\u2019s take one timestep into consideration.", "The agent\u2019s current state is 1, and takes the action Left randomly. So, the environment gives it an award of -1 and also it\u2019s new state 0. Let\u2019s take a few episodes into consideration to clear things. An episode by the way, is one iteration of the agent applying random actions until it reaches it\u2019s goal, and then terminates.", "In the first episode, the agent starts at state 1, S(1) with a reward of 0, R(0). Then it takes an action Left and receives a reward of -1, R(-1) and ends up in the next state 2, S(2) \u2026 Eventually after a few more action, it reached S(3) and terminates. At the end of the episode the agent ends up with a reward of 0\u20131\u20131\u20131+10 = 7", "Similarly, the agent accomplishes the second episode. But notice that this time, the reward earned by the agent is 0\u20131+10 = 9, which is higher than the first action.", "Thus, reinforcement learning is learning what to do; to map a particular action with a situation/state, so as to maximise a numerical reward. The agent must explore the environment and understand which actions yield the most reward by trying them out. The actions taken by the agent may affect the immediate reward as well as the next state, which in turn affect all subsequent reward. You can imagine this as the butterfly effect where one small action can result in a large reward or a very bad reward in the future.", "The above example that we looked into is what we call an Episodic Task, which has a well defined end point. There\u2019s another type of task which is called a Continuous Task, which goes on forever. One awesome example of Continuous Task that was mentioned in the course is a stock trading bot which continuously analyses the market and makes decision accordingly without every stopping. We\u2019ll learn algorithms used for continuous tasks later down the line.", "Deep Learning is when you use a deep neural network to predict the actions of an agent. In this series we\u2019ll talk about the traditional algorithms, developed decades ago, which forms the basis of Reinforcement Learning.", "In the next few parts, we\u2019ll talk about the various algorithms available for reinforcement learning. Some examples are SARSA, SARSA-Max, Monte Carlo Methods etc. So, stay tuned.", "Part 2 is out. Check it out here.", "Your home for data science.
