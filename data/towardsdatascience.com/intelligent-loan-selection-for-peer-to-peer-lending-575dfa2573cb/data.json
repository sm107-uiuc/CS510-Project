I also cover how to test the model, how to adjust the risk in loan selection, and how to use the model to make automatic investments using Lending Club\u2019s API.", "To keep you interested, here is a preview of the result of back testing:", "The chart on the left shows the returns of a simulated portfolio with randomly selected loans, filtered by the grade that is assigned by Lending Club. The chart on the right shows returns when loans are selected by the neural network with different levels of risk adjustment.", "Lending Club (www.lendingclub.com) is a platform that allows anybody to invest in consumer loans with as little as $25 per loan. Loan amounts can range from $1000 to $40000 with terms of 36 or 60 months. Many borrowers take out loans to consolidate debt, but there are various other purposes; for example: home improvement, medical expenses, business loans, etc.", "Lending Club primarily makes money by charging loan origination fees in the range of 1% to 6% to borrowers, but they also deduct 1% of any payment made to the lenders. That means that Lending Club\u2019s primary motivation is to issue as many loans as possible, no matter the quality, and investors have to be careful when selecting which loans to invest in. There is an option for automatic investment based on a customizable filter, but that approach is not very flexible. Some third party companies offer more sophisticated portfolio management services for a fee.", "Lending Club allows investors to open normal taxable accounts, and also tax-deferred retirement accounts. The latter is preferable because consumer loans are a very tax inefficient investment option. The reason is that interest income is taxed at the income tax rate (22% or 24% for most people), while the principal lost on loans that are charged off can usually only be used to offset long-term capital gains (at a tax rate of 15% for most people).", "Lending Club provides historical data on all loans that were issued on the platform. The data includes everything that was known at the time of the loan application and also performance data, such as the loan status (current, late, fully paid, or charged off), the amount of repaid principal, and the amount of paid interest, late fees, and recoveries.", "For the purpose of this project I considered loans issued between June 2007 and December 2015, filtering out loans that are not fully paid or charged off yet. The total number of loans considered is 829000. Below are the outcomes of these loans.", "Data on the loans that are currently listed on the platform can be retrieved in JSON format with a simple web API. It is also possible to invest in loans using an API.", "New loans are listed on the Lending Club platform seven days a week at 6AM, 10AM, 2PM, and 6PM Pacific Time. There are numerous investors who use software to automatically invest in loans very quickly as soon as they become available.", "To get a feeling for how fast the best loans are funded I set up a script that queries loan listings every 5 seconds, starting one second after the time of listing. The charts below show the funding levels of loans. Each chart was recorded at a different listing time on the same day.", "It can be seen that some loans (presumably the best ones) are fully funded after 5 to 20 seconds, while after 20 seconds the activity tapers off.", "While Lending Club issues over 50000 loans per month, at the time of writing only an average of 1200 of them are made available for manual investment or for investment using the API. The vast majority of loans are offered to institutional investors or to individuals who have automatic investment set up. It is not clear how loans are allocated between these groups and whether the allocation is random.", "The loan data provided by Lending Club is a bit of a mess and needs extensive cleanup before it can be used. For example, the employment length in the historical loan data has values like this: \u201c< 1 year\u201d, \u201c3 years\u201d, or \u201c10+ years\u201d, while the same field in currently listed loans simply has the number of months. There are many more examples like this. Also, the column names are different between historical and listing data.", "In addition to the cleanup I made a few more adjustments to the data to make it more suitable:", "For back testing I implemented a loan and portfolio simulator. A portfolio consists of a cash balance and a collection of loans. The simulator works with discrete time steps of one month. Each month, for each loan in the portfolio, installment payments are made that increase the cash balance of the portfolio. Once a loan is fully paid off (including recoveries), it is removed from the portfolio.", "Lending Club doesn\u2019t provide data regarding the exact payment dates and amounts. What they provide is the date of the last received payment and the total amounts for received principal, interest, late fees, and recoveries. For the simulator I had to make some assumptions:", "The actual back test takes a table of cleaned loan data with an additional \u201c_score\u201d column that contains the output of the scoring algorithm. The score can come from the neural net or from a random number generator to do randomized tests for comparison. Loan data is then grouped by the months where the loans were issued.", "To get the portfolio started, $1000 is added to the portfolio each month for the first 12 months. After that, only proceeds from loans are available for reinvestment. Each month, the available cash balance is invested in loans that were issued in that month, investing the minimum amount of $25 in as many loans as possible. For example, if $1132 is available in a given month, then the 45 (=floor(1132/25)) highest scoring loans are funded with $25 each.", "In the beginning Lending Club didn\u2019t issue that many loans every month. After splitting the data set into training and test data there are not enough loans in the first few months of the test data set to give the algorithm a choice. For that reason the simulation starts later, at a point where four times as many loans are available per month than are required for investing.", "Once the table of historical loans is exhausted, the back test winds down the portfolio by withdrawing any cash balance every month until all loans are fully processed. At that point the portfolio value is back to 0 and the rate-of-return on the portfolio can be calculated.", "When simulating a taxable account, the portfolio\u2019s cash balance is reduced each month by the tax liabilities that were created that month. The tax liabilities are the received interest, late fees, and recoveries multiplied by the income tax rate, less the remaining principal of charged-off loans multiplied by the applicable long-term or short-term capital gains tax rate. All simulations in later sections use these tax rates: 24% for income and short-term capital gains, 15% for long-term capital gains.", "The simulation also computes the default rate, which is the percentage of principal that is charged off each year. To compute that, the simulation keeps track of a hypothetical scenario where there are no defaults, but instead of being charged off, the remaining principal of defaulted loans is distributed as if the loan were paid off early. The difference between this no-default scenario and the actual rate of return is the default rate.", "Computing the rate of return of a portfolio that has multiple deposits and withdrawals is not trivial.", "My approach is based on a list of transactions, where each list entry represents a fixed time period, such as one month. The boundary condition is that the portfolio has zero value before and after the list of transactions.", "Starting with an empty portfolio, deposit 1000 before the first and second periods, withdraw 300 before the 6th period, 1000 before the 7th period, and 800 in the end, bringing the portfolio balance back to 0.", "This example has a net gain of 100 (the sum of the withdrawals is 100 more than the sum of the deposits). Here the result is an average return of 0.00854 (0.854%) per period. If the period was one month then the annualized return is 10.74%.", "sim(list, ror)simulates a portfolio with the transactions from the list and a per-period rate-of-return (ror). The function returns the value of the portfolio after the period covered by the list. If the ror argument equals the actual rate-of-return of the portfolio then the result should be zero (based on the boundary condition). If the ror argument is higher than the actual rate-of-return then the sim function will return a positive value. The opposite is true if the ror argument is too low.", "The root_scalar function searches for the value of ror that makes the result of sim(list, ror)zero.", "The same method can be used to calculate the rate of return of a single loan.", "A loan with a value of 1000 was issued and paid back with 11 equal installments of 100 each. The average return is 1.623% per period or 21.31% annualized if the period is one month.", "The following chart shows the annualized rates of return for different loans that default after x months. The loans have two different terms (36 and 60 months) and three different interest rates (5%, 10%, 15%).", "For example, a 36 month loan with 10% interest that defaults after 24 payments gives you a -21% annual rate of return. Unfortunately this doesn\u2019t translate easily into the rate of return of a whole portfolio. If you were to invest in this loan, and if you were to invest all proceeds immediately in loans with exactly the same properties, then your whole portfolio would also exhibit a -21% annual rate of return.", "For the neural network I used the Keras and Tensorflow libraries that do pretty much all the heavy lifting for you. Tensorflow is the backend that allows you to construct a computational graph that can be mapped to the available CPU and GPU resources. Keras adds the neural network aspects on top of that, like the layer definitions, activation functions, and training algorithms.", "Before the loan data can be fed into the neural network there is still some more processing to do. There is still categorical data to convert \u2014 for example, the loan purpose (\u201cDebt consolidation\u201d, \u201cHome improvement\u201d, \u201cBusiness\u201d \u2026), or the state of residence (\u201cCA\u201d, \u201cNY\u201d \u2026). These need to be converted to a one-hot encoding:", "If categories have only a few members it is useful to combine them into an \u201cothers\u201d category to help prevent overfitting. In the example above, another column \u201caddr_state$OTHERS\u201d could be added to capture all states with fewer than 1000 loans.", "The leading underscore added to the \u201caddr_state\u201d column is my convention to indicate that the column should be removed before feeding the data into the neural network. The same applies to columns that are not available in new loan listing data because they relate to the outcome of the loan, which is not yet known (loan_status, total_rec_int \u2026).", "These are the options I evaluated:", "It is also possible to interpolate between the binary and the smooth output as shown in the code below. A \u201csmoothness\u201d parameter value of 0 chooses the binary output, while a value of 1 chooses the smooth output.", "Using a binary output discards valuable information because the neural net doesn\u2019t get to know when a loan defaults. A default that occurs a few months before the end of the term is much better than a default before the first payment. At the same time, choosing the fully smooth output makes a loan that defaults shortly before the end look very similar to a loan that is fully paid, even though there is a significant conceptual difference.", "The fully smooth output has one intuitive advantage: It is linear and the results of multiple loans can be averaged to arrive at the payout fraction of a combination of these loans. For example, if there are three loans with very similar parameters in the training data set and the outcomes are 1.0, 1.0, and 0.7, then the average is 0.9. That corresponds to the return fraction if investing in all three loans. It makes sense for the neural net to produce this output when it sees a loan like that. The same loans, when using the binary option, will have scores of 1.0, 1.0, and 0.0, averaging 0.67. As a result, the model using the binary option is expected to be more risk averse.", "More on controlling risk aversion and comparison charts can be found in the section Controlling Risk.", "At this point we have x- and y-data that is fully numeric and it is possible to convert the data from a pandas DataFrame to a numpy array that is expected by the Keras framework. It is important at this point to store the sequence of column names so that later, when applying the trained net to loan listings, it is possible to prepare the listing data so that the columns are in the correct order and the one-hot encoding of categorical data is equivalent to the training data.", "The final step is to scale the data such that all input values have roughly the same magnitude. I evaluated a few options:", "The last option produced significantly better results than the first two. Again, it is important to save the scaling parameters for each column so that the same scaling can be applied to listing data.", "The exact structure of the network appears not to be very critical. I performed some tests with randomized structures and unless they are quite degenerate they produce similar results.", "The input layer takes approximately 160 columns from the loan data (one-hot encoding of the state of residence produces many columns).", "The output layer consists of a single neuron with linear activation function.", "Inspired by \u201cEvolving Parsimonious Networks by Mixing Activation Functions\u201d (Hagg, Mensing, and Asteroth) I used layers with mixed activation functions, but without any evolution during training:", "To reduce overfitting I found Gaussian noise layers to be most effective. Adding dropout layers can also help, but I had no success with regularizations.", "There is still some overfitting, but in back tests the rate of return is only around one percentage point higher when using the training data compared to the test data.", "The output of the neural net can be interpreted as the fraction of total payments (installment times the term in months) that we can expect to receive. For example, a loan with an installment of $500 and a term of 36 months has a total payout of $18,000. If the model output is 0.9 for that loan it means that the model expects the payout to be 0.9 * $18,000 = $16,200.", "What we really want to know in order to assign a score to loans is the expected payout over three years as a fraction of the initial principal:", "Note that the number of months in this formula is fixed at 36 even for 60-month loans to make them comparable. So even for 60-month loans the score corresponds to the expected return normalized to 36 months.", "Here are the charts again from the introduction, comparing the returns of portfolios with various investment strategies.", "The chart on the left shows the rates of return of portfolios where loans are filtered by grade, but are otherwise picked randomly. The grade is assigned by Lending Club to correspond to the probability of default and it determines the interest rate that borrowers have to pay. One can see that the default rate (the percentage of outstanding principal that is charged off every year) becomes lower as the grade becomes better.", "The chart on the right shows the rates of return of portfolios that use the described model to score loans and make investment decisions. The output of the model is post-processed to adjust the risk. This is described in more detail in the following section, Controlling Risk.", "When using a model to make investment decisions it is desirable to tune the loan selection to aim for a low default rate while keeping the investment return high. Adjusting the risk level of the selection algorithm can be done in two places: while training the model or as a post-processing step when using the model\u2019s output. The latter is more practical because changes can be made more quickly without having to train a new model and the same model can be used for different strategies.", "By default, the score of a loan is computed from the model\u2019s prediction (y) according to this formula:", "This is the point in the previous chart where the risk adjustment parameter is 0.0.", "At the extreme end, where the parameter is -1.0 (representing the highest risk), the model\u2019s prediction is not used at all and only the interest rate goes into the score:", "This picks only the loans with the highest interest rate.", "At the other end, where the parameter is +1.0 (representing the lowest risk), only the model\u2019s prediction is used without any adjustment for interest rate:", "This aims to minimize the default rate.", "It is possible to interpolate between these cases by adjusting y before it is used in the default formula:", "The risk adjustment function with different parameters is shown in the preceding figure, on the left. The critical property of the adjustment function is that it changes the slope of the curve near the point (1,1). The function takes the square root of y when adj=-0.5, it doesn\u2019t change y when adj=0.0, and it raises y to the power of 2 when adj=0.5.", "In any case, the function raises y to some power that is determined by adj, with special treatment for the corner cases:", "When adj is below zero, the predictions for bad loans are adjusted to make them look better by reducing the relative differences compared to the prediction for good loans. When adj is above zero, the predictions for bad loans are adjusted to make them look even worse by increasing the relative differences.", "The figure on the right shows the scoring of three different loans (L1, L2, and L3) with three different risk adjustments (a, b, and c). The blue bar represents the adjusted prediction (risk_adjust(y, adj)), while the combined blue and orange bar represents the final score. The orange bar shows the impact of the interest rate on the final score.", "In the center (L1b, L2b, and L3b) there is no risk adjustment and the predictions and interest rates of the loans are chosen for this example such that the final scores are the same. We can see that loan L1 receives the lowest prediction (highest chance of default), but it has the highest interest rate to make up for the difference. Loan L3 has the highest prediction (lowest chance of default), but it also has a lower interest rate such that the final score is the same as for the other loans.", "On the left (L1a, L2a, and L3a), a risk adjustment of -0.5 is applied, which boosts the original predictions closer to 1, reducing the relative difference between them. Now the loan with the highest interest rate, L1, wins against the other loans, despite its expected higher risk.", "On the right (L1c, L2c, and L3c), a risk adjustment of +0.5 is applied, which pulls the original predictions closer to 0, increasing the relative difference between them. Now the loan that is deemed safer, L3, wins against the other loans, despite its lower interest rate.", "I chose this particular function for risk adjustment because of these properties:", "There are various ways to control risk in loan selection when training the model:", "These methods control the intrinsic risk that is built into the model. At the same time the risk-adjustment method by post-processing can be used:", "The figure on the left comes from a model that intrinsically picks less risky investments. It was trained with a smoothness parameter of 0.5 and by boosting weights for charged-off loans by a factor that is proportional to the ratio of fully paid loans to charged-off loans.", "The figure on the right comes from a model that intrinsically picks riskier investments. It was trained with a smoothness parameter of 1.0 and with the same weights for all samples.", "The reference model (from the figure in the results section above) was trained with a smoothness of 1.0 and a boost of weights for charged-off loans.", "The plateau where the rate of return is near 11% is smaller in these example compared to the reference model. It appears to be best to train the model with an intrinsic risk bias such that the width of the plateau is maximized and only limited risk-adjustment is necessary during post processing.", "Training and configuring the model and selection algorithm to maximize the rate of return, as determined by back testing, is a valid approach only if economic conditions are stable. It is also interesting to see how the model would perform under different conditions that impact the default rate.", "The figure above shows the hypothetical rates of return with different default rates. The blue line shows the return under the assumption that there are no defaults (0%), the green line is the reference with no change in default rate (100%), and the purple line shows the return under the assumption that the default rate has doubled (200%).", "As I mentioned earlier, Lending Club makes only a small fraction of loans available for API-based investing. If the selection of loans is limited, a larger percentage of offered loans must be chosen in order to invest the available cash balance. To illustrate this effect I ran simulations that pick a random subset of loans each month that the algorithm can choose from.", "As expected, the rate of return of the portfolio decreases as fewer loans are available to choose from and hence a larger percentage of loans are chosen. It is also clearly visible that the average score of selected loans, as assigned by the scoring algorithm, is very well correlated with the rate of return.", "Before the model can be used to actually invest in loans there is one more hurdle to overcome that requires additional testing. In the back testing that I discussed earlier the algorithm had access to all loans listed in a given month and was able to pick the best of them until there was no more cash balance left.", "In real life we don\u2019t have the luxury to wait that long. Loans are listed in small batches, four times per day, and decisions must be made in real time to avoid that other investors snatch up the best loans.", "A strategy where we pick the best loans out of every batch until the cash balance is depleted is not optimal because some batches can have a high proportion of good loans, while others may have only bad loans. A better strategy is to aim for a certain cash balance greater than zero in order to keep a reserve to buy good loans if several of them are listed simultaneously. At the same time the cash balance should not be too high to avoid losing out on returns (Lending Club doesn\u2019t pay interest on the cash balance).", "As discussed earlier, the model assigns a score to each loan that roughly represents the expected total return. The goal now is to find a threshold for this score, which can be used to decide whether or not to invest in a loan, while keeping the cash balance reasonable. In other words, I needed to implement a control loop that regulates the selection threshold based on the available cash balance.", "My approach is based on a PI (proportional-integral) controller. The graph below shows the cash balance and selection threshold of a controller that is set to keep the cash balance around $200.", "The controller is relatively insensitive to changes in parameters. I tuned them to make the selection threshold relatively smooth and to keep the cash balance from deviating too much. A controller with only an integral term is also possible but it leads to larger swings in the cash balance.", "The portfolio simulator now splits the list of loans issued in a certain month into 120 random batches (4 per day for 30 days) with an approximately equal, but randomized, number of loans in each batch. At the same time, payments received during that month are split evenly into 120 parts. The simulator then runs the control loop and selection algorithm for each of the batches.", "Simulated portfolios using this controller produce returns that are indistinguishable from the returns of portfolios simulated with the earlier method that had access to all loans issued in a single month.", "To set up automatic investments it is necessary to run a script four times per day when new loans are listed. A task or cron job starts the script a few minutes before a listing time.", "It is also necessary to avoid investing in the same loan multiple times. There is an option when querying listings from Lending Club to only include loans that were listed at the most recent listing time. As long as the script gets the timing right the same loan listing will not be retrieved more than once. As an additional precaution one can also verify that the listing time that is part of each loan record is current and as expected.", "The script can be run locally and triggered by the Windows task scheduler, for example. This is a bit impractical unless one has a dedicated computer that is powered and online at the required times.", "A better solution is to move the script to a cloud service and let it run there. There are various options that are geared towards web hosting, such as Google Cloud or Heroku. Migration to these services can be a bit tricky because they expect the application to be a web service and they don\u2019t offer a persistent file system. Therefore, all file IO needs to be converted to use a remote file system or a database.", "In the end I wound up using PythonAnywhere, which offers a cloud-based environment that behaves like a regular user account on a Linux system, including persistent file storage and the ability to schedule tasks.", "While the results of the simulations look promising and the automatic investment script is doing its job, it remains to be seen what the impact on my returns will be. So the final analysis will have to be deferred until it is possible to make the first estimate of the default rate.", "Changes in the economy will have an impact on the results. It is also safe to assume that Lending Club used their loan data to come up with better predictions for loan performance and improve their algorithm to assign interest rates. This will reduce or even eliminate the relative performance difference between a portfolio with randomly selected loans and a portfolio that uses my model.", "Your home for data science.
