Moreover, recent advances in managed services has put these ML solutions within reach of virtually any organization.", "In this anonymized example we explore how a company with no data science expertise was able to use managed ML services to implement an ML-powered pricing strategy that performed 2x above traditional approaches and resulted in estimated revenue growth of 11%.", "FitCo is a premium fitness brand, based in Los Angeles, that operates a portfolio of over 600 gym and fitness center locations across the United States.", "Having grown rapidly by acquisition over the past several years, management attention had now turned its attention to boosting organic revenue growth, which had been stubbornly flat on a per-studio basis.", "FitCo had identified FitClass \u2014 its suite of specialty fitness classes \u2014 as a prime source of organic growth. Specifically, it had identified pricing of these classes as a major potential area of improvement.", "FitClasses are a popular offering across FitCo\u2019s brands. They are premium experiences catering to niche fitness demand and sold on a pay-per-class basis on top of standard memberships.", "Whilst FitCo had ensured a consistent user experience across its portfolio, local operators were still able to set schedules and prices for FitClasses in their studios with nearly total independence. As a result, prices varied widely between classes and locations.", "Whilst FitCo understood that some of this variance reflected local conditions, they also suspected there was considerable room for improvement in the way prices were set across its portfolio.", "FitCo had undertaken a pricing exercise two years ago in which prior management had opted to centralize FitClass pricing and institute a blanket price increase of between 10% and 20% across the board.", "This blunt approach had not been successful. It had failed to take into account the price elasticity of demand of its customer set across the wide range of classes and locations, and the price increases actually resulted in overall revenue declines of 2% as the subsequent reduction in demand in many classes outstripped the increases in price. They were forced to unwind the price changes a couple months later.", "Though painful, that experience had at least been useful in giving FitCo a pretty solid dataset on price elasticity of its FitClass customer set. It could chart how class demand changed in response to price increases for each of three utilization bands \u2014 high (>85%), medium (50\u201385%) and low (<50%). Modeling out the various impacts of price increases on demand, FitCo estimated a revenue full potential of 15% from more efficient pricing.", "To capture that higher revenue potential, FitCo now only needed to be able to accurately predict demand for classes into the future \u2014 whether current or new \u2014 to accurately model price impacts on revenue. This would enable FitCo to determine whether and how much of a price increase each class could profitably sustain.", "FitCo had initially attempted this using traditional rules-based methods \u2014 effectively a series of if/then statements to set bands based on certain conditions. With some extensive trial and error they had managed to write a function that was estimated to generate about 5% in additional revenue. This wasn\u2019t bad, but this approach had two primary limitations: (1) it failed to fully account for interrelationship of the wide variety of factors relevant to each class \u2014 it incorrectly predicted too many classes in the wrong band, causing a decline in usage \u2014 and (2) it failed to generalize to new class schedules or details at any given location \u2014 it couldn\u2019t adequately account for new combinations of factors or scenarios.", "Looking for alternative approaches, FitCo turned to ML.", "ML is well-suited to these types of classification problems precisely because of its ability to process a wide range of factors and generalize to unseen or new situations.", "However, like most organizations of its size and in its industry, FitCo did not have ML capabilities or a team of data scientists on hand to design, build and deploy an ML solution. This had previously been a major barrier to ML adoption. Today though, the availability of ML managed services have largely democratized access to ML capabilities.", "For their solution, FitCo chose Amazon SageMaker, which featured among other things, an AutoML capability called AutoPilot that could take a simple tabular dataset and automate the process of building an ML workload around it.", "With AutoPilot, FitCo no longer needed a team of data scientists to get the benefit of ML. Instead, they were able to drive this initiative with a three-person project team consisting of the CFO as business owner, CTO as technology owner, and a single back-end developer responsible for building and integrating the solution.", "To build their training dataset, FitCo gathered historical utilization data for each of their classes over the past two years.", "Utilization for each class was expressed as a percentage of total places filled. FitCo converted the data in this column into \u2018high\u2019 , \u2018medium\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 based on the utilization bands above and named this column \u2018target\u2019. This would be the column to be predicted by the ML model.", "They then combined this data with a set of internal features they thought likely to indicate utilization. They also added a range of external data that they expected to be relevant. The result was a dataset with 800K instances and which contained the following features:", "FitCo did some basic feature engineering to better organize and format this data set, converted it to csv format and saved in an S3 bucket. They now had a dataset with which they could train their ML model.", "FitCo chose Autopilot for its ability to simplify and streamline the core components of the machine learning process. AutoPilot automates the process of exploring data, engineering features, testing different algorithms, and selecting the best model. All it requires is that you provide a tabular dataset.", "In addition, it automatically surfaces the code base it used, adding visibility and reproducibility into the process. This was an important differentiator for FitCo\u2019s CTO because it gave FitCo the opportunity to explore, and learn from, the steps that had been taken to generate the model, as well as giving it a code base that it could modify and optimize it into the future.", "To start the AutoPilot process, FitCo used the no-code interface available within Amazon SageMaker Studio. This required three key steps:", "Once these details were entered, they simply hit Create Experiment and FitCo\u2019s ML model build was underway, running a range of trials to determine the best performing ML approach.", "This process took about an hour to complete. Once it had concluded, FitCo could then simply sort the list of trials to find the best performing model. They were able to generate the notebook that contained the code of this model, and they were also able to deploy the model to a SageMaker endpoint that enabled them to further test the inferences (predictions) generated by the model on new data, or even put it into production.", "When modeled against FitCo\u2019s test dataset, the ML model outperformed their rules-based approach by 2x, increasing revenue by an estimated 11% overall.", "This performance improvement stemmed primarily from the higher precision of the ML predictions vs the rules-based approach. In a multi-class classification problem, the challenge is not only to predict the right class, but to minimize the cost of inaccuracies. For example, it is less costly to inaccurately predict a low demand class as \u2018medium\u2019 than as \u2018high\u2019. Specifically with FitCo\u2019s price elasticity profile, the cost of that particular error was approximately 4x greater in the form of lower demand.", "A comparison of this performance between traditional and ML approaches can be seen below, and illustrates that the traditional approach actually outperformed ML in accurately predicting high demand classes. The issue is that it was unable to do so while also accurately predicting medium and low demand classes. Moreover, it made costly errors in inaccurately predicting low classes as high demand classes. The ML model was better able to more holistically map the shape of the data to account for both situations.", "These errors came at a considerable cost to revenue for the rules-based approach that the ML model could avoid. For example, inaccurately predicting a low demand class as high demand resulted in a demand decline of nearly 50%, far offsetting the 30% higher price paid by the remaining members.", "The matrix below shows the revenue growth impact of each type of prediction, expressed as the difference in performance between traditional and ML methods.", "Though traditional methods managed to beat the ML model in correctly labeling a higher proportion of high classes as high (a metric known as \u2018recall\u2019), it did so by also inaccurately labeling many more \u2018medium\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 demand classes as high too (known as \u2018precision\u2019).", "As a result, although its accurate high predictions generated 1.4% higher revenue, that came at a cost of losing 2.8% of revenue from the demand declines of incorrectly charging higher prices to higher elasticity medium and low classes. A similar pattern emerged in low predictions; the ML model\u2019s greater accuracy meant that it only reduced the price of classes for which one would expect to see higher demand.", "As a result of this higher precision \u2014the more accurate prediction of both high and low classes \u2014 the ML model was able to generate 5.5% higher revenue overall, more than double that of rules-based approaches.", "Pricing optimization is a powerful lever for revenue growth, and the application of ML provides a powerful solution, which can often outperform traditional approaches.", "In FitCo\u2019s case, the application of ML to their challenge generated a 2x uplift in revenue growth vs their best performing rules-based alternative, and produced an estimated 11% uplift in revenue.", "FitCo\u2019s example helps demonstrate both how ML can be applied to optimize pricing, as well as the way managed services like SageMaker AutoPilot are able to put these powerful ML solutions within reach of virtually any organization.", "Have an AI opportunity you\u2019d like to explore?
