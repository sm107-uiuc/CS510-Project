Linear Regression attempts to model the linear relationship between predictor variables (X) and a numeric target variable (y). For each observation that is evaluated with the model, the actual value of the target (y) is compared to the predicted value of the target (\u0177), and the difference in these values are known as residuals. The goal of a linear regression model is to minimize the sum of the squared residuals. The equation for a multiple linear regression is shown below.", "For beginner students, one of the most common ways to learn linear regression is by building a model to predict the price of a house based on specific features of the house. For this project, the Ames Housing Data Set was used. This data set includes information for houses sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. There are 2930 observations and over 80 features included in the data set.", "Below, I will describe the steps that I took to build a linear regression model to predict house prices. All code is hosted on GitHub.", "The Ames Housing Data Set was provided to me through a Kaggle competition hosted by General Assembly. (However, the data set is also available to the public here.) Before I could begin exploring the data or modeling, I imported the libaries shown in Code 1 below. I also cleaned missing values and ensured that were were no abnormal values and that each feature was of the appropriate data type.", "In a previous post, I discussed the importance of EDA for discovering patterns in a data set. For this project, EDA was equally important for exploring the relationship between the different features and the target (house sale price). For numeric features, I created a correlation matrix and specifically looked for any features that had a correlation coefficient with an absolute value of 0.5 or higher. This step helped me identify several features that were strongly correlated with the sale price, including the overall quality of the house, the living area, and the size of the garage (both in terms of number of cars and square footage).", "For categorical variables, understanding the relationship between the different categories and sale price was a little more complicated. In total, this data set contained over 20 categorical features, and some features had over 10 different categories. In order to reduce dimensionality of the model, I knew that simply one-hot-encoding the categories was not an option. To solve this issue, I created bar plots for each categorical feature to explore the differences in mean sale price between the different categories. Interestingly, as shown in the plot below, I began to notice that some of the categories of various features began to cluster together. By recognizing these clusters, I was able to engineer features to represent the categorical variables.", "Once I had finished exploring the data and engineering features, it was time to prepare my data for modeling. During this step, I used pd.get_dummies() to dummify any categorical variables of interest, and I split my data into training and testing sets using train_test_split().", "Modeling was an iterative process in which several models were built in order to inform my final model. In total, six models were built. All models were evaluated using the R2 score.", "Model 1: This model was the baseline/null model created using DummyRegressor(). It was conducted to explore the R2 score when the mean was predicted for each observation.", "Model 2: This model was a linear regression model using features identified to be important during EDA.", "Model 3: After seeing that the linear regression model had room for improvement, I put all possible features into a model to create an overfit model that could then be regularized.", "Model 4: The first type of regularization that I tried was Ridge Regression, which uses an L2 penalty.", "Model 5: The second type of regularization that I tried was LASSO Regression.", "Model 6: The final model was a linear regression with features identified to be important during EDA and the LASSO regression. Because the target was not normally distributed, for this model, it was log-transformed.", "After I had built my models, I compared Training and Testing R2 Scores to pick the best model.", "For me the best model with the Linear Regression build with features identified in EDA and LASSO. This model explained 87.8% of the variation in sale price of the testing set.", "After selecting my best model, I further evaluated its performance by calculating the root mean squared error (RMSE) and by comparing the actual values to the predicted values.", "According to the value of the RMSE, the predictions for Sale Price made by the Linear Regression model are likely off by about $23,625.19. This is less than 1/3 of the standard deviation of the Sale Price in the training data. Although it would be nice to improve this number, this is an okay starting point to improve from.", "How do the predictions of sales price compare to the actual values?", "By plotting the predicted prices against the actual prices, I was able to see that this model does not perform equally well at predicing all prices. Specifically, the model seems to be good at predicing the price of properties within the range of $90,000 to $225,000, but it does not do a good job at either extreme. In the original testing data set, 75% of the houses were priced at or under $214,000. The model might not perform well at extreme values due to insufficient training data for these cases.", "Although the linear regression model that was created in this post is not perfect, it is able to account for approximately 87.8% of the variation in Sale Price of a property, and it also is able to predict the Sale Price within $23,625.19. Further exploration of the residuals of this model revealed a specific weakness in this model at predicting extreme values. Specifically, the ideal range for predictions appeared to be within $90,000 to $225,000. In order to better predict prices outside of this range, some changes could be made to the model. Ideas for improvement include log transforming features and coding some categorical variables as ordinal.", "Have you participated in the Ames Housing challenge?
