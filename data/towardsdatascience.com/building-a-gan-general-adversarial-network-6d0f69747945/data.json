GANs were something that interested me from the start because of their ability to create new photos and data sets that don\u2019t exist. In this article, I\u2019ll go over what a GAN is and then a bit about the code I used.", "A GAN or a General Adversarial Network is a network that utilizes two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. The generator\u2019s job is to create new data, while the discriminator\u2019s job is to decide whether the data spit out by the generator is fake or not. In my case, the generator created images, for which the discriminator decided if the image was authentic or not. During training, the generator\u2019s goal is to generate better and better images that fool the discriminator, while the discriminator\u2019s role is to get better and better at deciding if the image is fake or not. The goal is for the discriminator to not be able to distinguish if the image comes from the training data or not. As you can see, this creates a positive feedback loop for both algorithms, thus improving the final images developed by the generator.", "I specifically built a DCGAN, a Deep Convolutional General Adversarial Network which works a bit differently. Instead of using multi-layer perceptrons in the generator and discriminator, it utilizes Convolution Nets.", "This benefits us because less training data and time is required. ConvNets are based on the idea that data is related. In my case, it allows the algorithm to relate pixels on one side of the image to the other side. This allows it to assign importance to different structures within the image and differentiate between them. This is very helpful for images because while a regular multi layer neural net looks and trains each pixel individually, a ConvNet can train one area, and apply it to other pixels. In addition, instead of using Pooling, the DCGAN uses Stride. This is because pooling only cares if an object in the image is present, whereas Stride also cares about location. In all, DCGANs enable a smoother and more efficient process, which is why it is the most common GAN.", "I\u2019ll go over the code used and what the code means in relation to how a DCGAN works.", "As mentioned above, the generator\u2019s job is to generate an image that fools the discriminator. So, how exactly does it do that?", "The input of a generator is a Latent Vector. A Latent Vector is a hidden set of points which are mapped in latent space which are applied to a vector algorithm. The vector algorithm builds relationships between the points such as distance and topographical data.", "The latent vector is then fed into a series of strided two dimensional convolutional transpose layers. This basically consists of a kernel striding(or skipping over) the input matrix. To increase the size of the image, up-sampling is required. Up-sampling is when the program doubles the dimensions in order to get a larger and denser image of certain dimensions.", "Next we run it through batch normalization to make training easier. By normalizing the layers, it reduces the amount the latent values shift around. This stabilizes the activation of the layer, allowing the most optimal weights and decreasing the loss function.", "Next we run it through a ReLU activation. What makes Relu special is that although it appears to look like a linear line in the right half of the photo, it is not, as can be seen in the left half. This is a basic activation function which allows a program to move beyond linear regression and learn more complicated data such as videos, audio or in my case, images.", "Finally, I output my data into a tanh function which in turn outputs the data in a range between -1 and 1. This normalizes the data and returns it to the original range.", "As mentioned before, the discriminator takes the image generated as an input and outputs a probability that the image came from the training data. The discriminator simply does the reverse of what the generator did. First it inputs the data into a 2dConv network with striding, this time without up-scaling(because we are down-scaling). Then it feeds it through batch normalization and Relu. Finally, it outputs the probability using a sigmoid activation function as opposed to the tanh in the generator. The benefit of this is that it outputs a probability between 0 and 1.", "Now that we have the generator and the discriminator squared away, we have to actually train the network and get results. We start off by first training the discriminator on the training data, then generating an image from the generator and running the discriminator on the generated images.", "That is the GAN loss function as mentioned in Goodfellow\u2019s Paper. D(G(z)) is the probability that the output of the generator (G) is a real image. D, the discriminator, tries to maximize the chance that it classifies the generated images correctly (log(D(x)). G on the other hand tries to minimize the probability that the discriminator classifies the image as fake (log(1\u2212D(G(x))). This forces both the generator and discriminator to get better at their jobs.", "After 1 epoch of training, this is what the results look like:", "After 10 epochs of training, results looked like this:", "What\u2019s crazy is that all the people generated are 100% fake. That\u2019s INSANE! The applications for this are numerous. From image editing to security and banking, GANs have huge potential. Being able to generate new data sets is a critical component in understanding and creating new things", "Creating this GAN was quite an experience for me that I enjoyed thoroughly because I had to really figure out how all the intricate pieces are put together. Stay posted for my next build!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Hi! I\u2019m Vikram Menon!
