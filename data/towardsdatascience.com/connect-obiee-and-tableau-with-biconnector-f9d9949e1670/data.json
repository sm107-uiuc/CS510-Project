Do you wish that you could just easily (and securely) connect it to Tableau?", "BI Connector allows you to securely access and use your OBIEE and Taleo data in Tableau, PowerBI, and Qlik.", "(Full disclosure: I\u2019ve been doing a little work with BI Connector lately and have definitely gotten paid by them and have had access to what they have to offer. That being said, I now know a couple of people over there and can vouch for what an awesome team they are!)", "If you want to use visualizations to communicate the results of an analysis, you probably want to work with modern and easy-to-use tools like Tableau. But there\u2019s no simple way to do this with your OBIEE data!", "While OBIEE is amazing in terms of data and business analysis, it isn\u2019t as fun as Tableau in terms of simple and intuitive visualizations.", "It\u2019s just not as cool to play with! (Especially if aren\u2019t an OBIEE expert\u2026)", "You wouldn\u2019t believe how many companies out there are paying tens of thousands of dollars in wasted time and effort for exports, imports, SQL staging areas, and more because they don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a tool that allows them to securely connect their OBIEE data directly to Tableau with just a few clicks.", "Connecting OBIEE data to Tableau manually usually means wasting a ton of time creating, exporting, and importing OBIEE data into something like Tableau. With BI Connector, it\u2019s simple. It barely takes any time at all! You log in with your OBIEE credentials, which means that you\u2019re able to use your existing business logic. You don\u2019t have to make any changes to OBIEE.", "You save time and you save money.", "BI Connector is perfect for anyone working in machine learning, data analysis, data visualization, business analysis, data science, and predictor analysis. It makes life easy for beginners and it gives advanced users something that they can have fun with.", "It\u2019s simple, secure, and efficient. Setup takes less than five minutes!", "You can run direct query-based live connections to both subject areas and reports and immediately use your results to create gorgeous, responsive, and intuitive visualizations. You\u2019ll avoid common errors and make faster decisions at the same time. It saves you an incredible amount of time and effort!", "If you\u2019re serious about data, there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019re already using OBIEE. It\u2019s amazing for data reporting and intelligence. It can hold a huge volume of data. It also handles complex schemas incredibly well. Plus Oracle has developed pre-defined BI solutions that are available in OBIEE. It offers interactive dashboards and reporting, actionable intelligence, proactive detection and alerts, Microsoft Office integration, and a lot more.", "That being said, there are just not as many visualization options available in OBIEE as there are in Tableau. The ones that are available are definitely not as user-friendly. OBIEE also has a limited ability to work with other tools and often requires you to purchase an extra license if you want to use them. And you need to have some serious education if you want to use OBIEE the right way.", "It\u2019s also not as easy to connect your OBIEE data to Tableau as it could be. You can export your data and import it into Tableau, which leads to duplicate data, duplicate logic, and potentially inconsistent results. You could create and maintain a SQL database staging environment. But that takes time, money, and resources.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that both of these options put your data at risk of unauthorized access and other security issues.", "Tableau, on the other hand, offers gorgeous, easy-to-create visualizations. It\u2019s intuitive and user-friendly, with simple drag-and-drop responsive charts and dashboards, one-click formulas, filters, and a lot more. (There are also some fun new features in 2019.2, including vector-based maps! You can check out the new features here.) But while Tableau can handle a lot of data, it can\u2019t manage the huge volume of data that OBIEE can handle with ease. It\u2019s tough to use when you have more than 25 tables or more than 16 get columns.", "And everything in Tableau needs to be developed from scratch.", "These two tools aren\u2019t replacements for each other. They actually do amazing work together! But getting them to work together can be challenging.", "That\u2019s where BI Connector comes in!", "BI Connector is the simple and secure way to connect OBIEE and Tableau. With BI Connector, you can create visualizations in Tableau using OBIEE data in no time. BI Connector uses the OBIEE security model, so your data is protected.", "It automates the process of moving your OBIEE data into Tableau and it keeps your data safe.", "BI Connector sits right on top of the OBIEE layer and lets you effortlessly integrate your favorite data visualization tool, whether that\u2019s Tableau, Qlik, or Power BI. It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s intuitive, and it bridges the gap between technologies. That saves you an incredible amount of time and money!", "BI Connector gives you plug-and-play access from what you\u2019ve already built in OBIEE. You run your results right from your data warehouse. Plus it\u2019s fun and secure! You\u2019ll build Tableau visualizations while protecting your data with OBIEE security.", "BI Connector is incredibly easy to install. It takes less than five minutes. You can find a helpful step-by-step guide here and really helpful videos here that will walk you through the process if you run into any issues.", "First, you\u2019ll need to go to the BI Connector website to download BI Connector. You can click the button that says \u201cTry it free\u201d and drop down the menu to \u201cVisualize OBIEE data in\u201d and click on \u201cTableau.\u201d", "Enter your information, click the button that says \u201cTry BI Connector for Tableau\u201d and your download will start. There\u2019s no credit card or commitment required. You have 30 days to try it out with no risk.", "You\u2019ll double click on the \u201cBIConnector-Desktop-Edition-x64-Tableau.exe\u201d file to unzip it. Specify the location and then start the installation. You\u2019ll click on the button that says \u201cInstall\u201d and follow the prompts.", "At the end of the installation process, you\u2019ll see a popup window that lets you know that your installation has been completed. Make sure the box is checked next to the line that says \u201cLaunch ODBC Administrator\u201d and click \u201c Finish.\u201d", "Next, you\u2019ll want to create a new data source. Go to the ODBC Database Administrator and click \u201cAdd.\u201d A box will pop up where you can activate your 30 Day trial license. Enter your personal information and then either leave the trial license number as-is (it shows up automatically) or change it to the key for the license you purchased and click \u201cActivate.\u201d This will send you back to the window where you can now create a new data source.", "Click on the button that says \u201cAdd.\u201d", "Enter the data source name (OBIEE Connect here) and your server name, port, user ID, and password. This is the information you use for your Oracle BI server.", "If you log in to OBIEE with something like \u201chttp://obieefunstuff.websitename.com:9704/analytics\" then your server name will be \u201chttp://obieefunstuff.websitename.com\" and your port will be 9704. Your user ID and password are your OBIEE user ID and password. It\u2019s a good idea to take a look at the official step-by-step guide for more information. It walks you through some common scenarios, including what to do if you don\u2019t see your port number in the URL.", "Now click \u201cTest connection\u201d to make sure everything is working.", "In the next window, you\u2019ll see two little radio buttons that allow you to select either \u201cSubject Areas\u201d or \u201cReports.\u201d If you want to connect to your pre-built analysis in the OBIEE catalog, choose \u201cReports.\u201d If you\u2019re interested in building a new analysis from your subject areas, choose \u201cSubject Areas.\u201d", "After you make your choice, click \u201cSave.\u201d You can always go to this screen again any time you want to change or update your information.", "Now it\u2019s time to head over to Tableau! Launch Tableau, then click \u201cMore Servers\u201d and then go to \u201cOther Databases (ODBC).\u201d Now you can select the data source that you created and click \u201cConnect.\u201d Make sure your server name, port, and User ID are exactly the same as the ones you used previously and enter the same password here as well. Test your connection and hit \u201cOK.\u201d You\u2019ll click \u201cOK\u201d again on the \u201cOther Databases (ODBC)\u201d screen.", "You\u2019re ready to go! Start visualizing your data!", "Go ahead and select your database from the dropdown menu and click \u201cOK.\u201d", "You can drag and drop your information just like you normally would! Create filters, add color, labels, tooltips, and everything else you normally do with Tableau. You have your OBIEE data at your fingertips and you can work with it in exactly the way you want to.", "You can even blend OIBEE data with other data files right in Tableau in exactly the same way that you normally would. Start with the same process, then click \u201cAdd\u201d in the upper left corner or drop your Data menu down to \u201cNew Data Source.\u201d Select \u201cText File,\u201d for example, if you have data in a CSV file. That will open a window where you can select your file.", "Now you\u2019re all set to work with your additional data!", "It\u2019s really that easy. You\u2019re minutes away from being able to combine the power of OBIEE with the ease and appeal of Tableau.", "What are you waiting for? Try BI Connector today!", "Thanks for reading!
