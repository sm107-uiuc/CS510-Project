A data analyst might be contributing to all kinds of work \u2014 including MIS, reporting, data engineering, database management, etc. in a real scenario. It\u2019s not necessarily bad. But here, what we\u2019ll be talking about is the actual job of a data analyst \u2014 not what companies make them do. A data analyst literally means a person who analyses data \u2014 not engineers pipelines to get it flowing, not maintaining databases\u2014just the analysis. Find out what the data means. Identify trends. Support the business teams to make better decisions and improve overall efficiency. It\u2019s a role that tends more towards hardcore statistics than hardcore computer sciences.", "With that in mind, for a data analyst, it is useful to go through with the following two steps before starting to find what the data means \u2014", "This is not a comprehensive write-up about all the methodologies you can use to perform these two steps. It\u2019s just a basic overview of some of them.", "Visualize the Completeness of a Data Set using missingno \u2014 data incompleteness is a major problem \u2014 both in machine-based data collection and human-based data collection. Both methods are prone to error. The completeness of data is less of a problem if it is identified before analyzing any given dataset. It can be quite a disaster if decisions are made on incomplete data. Food for thought \u2014 consider cases where no data is better than incomplete data to arrive at a reasonably sane conclusion/inference.", "The idea is to check for the incompleteness of data", "The following chart/plot shows that data for db and tp is scarce in the dataset, while data for tb, sf, and gen is abundant.", "Identify correlation between the availability of data for two or more fields", "For large datasets, take a random sample from that dataset and plot the data to identify how frequently the data is missing. Also, plot a dendrogram to identify the correlation between the availability of data for two or more fields, using the following line of code:", "And moving towards simplicity, visualize the data using a bar chart \u2014 with absolute numbers displayed where a particular variable contains data.", "Now that we have some idea about the distribution and availability of data, we can explore the data.", "The first thing that one might wonder is what the dataset actually looks like. To get this hint, one might print out the first n number of records in the dataset. NaN means that the data is not available. We\u2019ll come to the NaN values at a later point.", "And now that we have some idea about how our data looks, it\u2019s time to explore the data using Seaborn.", "The idea is to see how are two given variables in a dataset are related to each other?", "After looking at the data, the first analytical question that comes to mind is how two variables in this dataset related to each other are? Or, how does one variable change its value when some other variable is changed? Or whether a relationship exists between these two variables at all.", "Get the above chart using this simple code.", "Along with the contents of the previous chart, to visualize the distribution of values of these variables plotted in the previous chart, rather than sns.lmplot, one can use sns.jointplot using the following line of code:", "Let us look into one of the most useful EDA methods for visualizing data \u2014 Box Plots.", "The idea is to study the distribution of a variable in a dataset", "Box Plots are essentially used for studying the distribution of a variable in a dataset. Although Histograms can also be used for that, comparatively, Box Plots provide a better summary of the data in some cases. A box plot tells us about the shape, variability, and center of the data. Although, when we\u2019re only keen to know about the distribution in a way that tells us which side the data is skewed \u2014 histograms can serve our purpose, saving us from other details.", "The same data that has been visualized above can be visualized like this using a factor-point plot in Seaborn.", "Cleaning the data \u2014 obviously, this needs to be done before we start our analysis and is the part of prepping the data for use \u2014 hence, it is a part of the Initial Data Analysis phase rather than EDA.", "While you used the missingno library to visualize where the data was missing, you did not clean the data for usage. The first part is removing nulls from the dataset. And then removing the duplicates.", "This was a basic introduction to a couple of examples that you can use in the first two steps of the process of analyzing data, namely,", "The first two steps are important, especially if there\u2019s a lack of trust in the data. This lack of trust can arise from various reasons like how you collected the data, the source of the data, whether the data is biased, data has been intentionally tampered with, and so on. Performing the first two steps, i.e., initial data analysis and exploratory data analysis, it is easy to identify issues with the data set and not spend any time making false and erroneous models and predictions.", "Your home for data science.
