The alternative hypothesis states the opposite; that is, the given treatment does effect the target variable.", "For example, say that we want to determine if minimum wage laws results in a higher unemployment rate.", "The null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis might be as follows:", "Null hypothesis: minimum wage laws do not effect the unemployment rate.", "Alternative hypothesis: minimum wage laws increase the unemployment rate.", "Usually, researchers want to reject the null hypothesis. (Rejecting the null hypothesis lends credibility to the alternative hypothesis).", "However, how should we reject the null hypothesis?", "This is where the p value comes in.", "The p value is a number between 0 and 1 that tells researchers the probability of observing a certain value, given that the null hypothesis is true.", "Suppose that we want to test our minimum wage hypothesis. We collect a random sample of American cities \u2014 some with minimum wage laws and some without \u2014 and find that the unemployment rate for cities with minimum wage laws is half of a percentage point higher, on average, than cities without minimum wage laws.", "Is this a victory for free market capitalism? Should we strike down minimum wage laws across the world?", "In standard academic research, p values greater than 0.05 are generally not considered statistically significant \u2014 a fancy phrase to mask an arbitrary cutoff point.", "Suppose that we get a p value of 0.78. That is, if we assume that the null hypothesis is true, then there is a 78% probability that we would see the half a percentage point difference between American cities with minimum wage laws and American cities without such laws.", "If we tried to submit these results to an academic journal, then the editors of the journal would likely laugh us back to Medium (jokes on them, of course, because more people read Medium than the American Journal of Political Science \u2014 but I digress).", "In standard academic research, p values greater than 0.05 are generally not considered statistically significant \u2014 a fancy phrase to mask an arbitrary cutoff point.", "So, the p value is 0.78. That sucks. The research we worked so hard on has proved to be pointless.", "Perhaps one advantage of the arbitrary cutoff point is that it prevents false research from entering prestigious academic journals.", "Or does it? We\u2019ll come back to this.", "We\u2019ve just gotten rejected from our favorite academic journal because our p value is too high.", "However, we are certain in our results. We were raised on the teachings of Friedman, Greenspan, and Bernanke. We know that minimum wage laws unleash havoc on the labor market.", "So, we return to our research to see if we can lower our p value. First, we include more cities into our study: cities from Canada, China, Brazil, Europe, and Russia. Because the p value has a negative relationship with the sample size, increasing the sample size lowers our p value.", "Second, we decide to change our model. We control for features that could arguably have an effect on the city\u2019s unemployment rate \u2014 population size, location, tax rate, etc.\u2014 and features which have a more inexplicable relationship with the unemployment rate \u2014 the number of Starbucks in the city, for example. Generally, increasing model complexity can reduce the p value because our model can account for more randomness in our sample.", "Now we have a p value of 0.1. Better, but still unpromising.", "Finally, we change our test statistic. Perhaps we used the Student\u2019s t test but now we decide to use a Chi-squared test and\u2026", "Perfect. Our results are now statistically significant. The academic journal decides to publish our research.", "The above procedure \u2014 affectionately labelled \u2018p hacking\u2019 by statisticians \u2014 is a form of manipulating the data analysis process to such a degree as to obscure more information than it provides.", "As a researcher, you do not:", "Unfortunately, p hacking is widespread in academic research, and it generally leads to conclusions that are difficult to reproduce. (If a research article reports a p value of 0.049, you can be reasonably sure that the researcher did some p hacking).", "If the null hypothesis is true, then there is a 4.9% chance that we would observe the half of a percentage point difference in the unemployment rate between cities with minimum wage laws and cities without minimum wage laws.", "According to applied researchers, this means that we can now safely reject the null hypothesis. That is, we have disproved that minimum wage laws have zero effect on the unemployment rate.", "And this is where many applied researchers go wrong.", "A low p value, by itself, says nothing about the truthfulness or falsehood of the null (or alternative) hypothesis.", "Here is what the American Statistical Association (ASA) had to say on the topic:", "P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.", "The 4.9% probability that the observation would occur if the null hypothesis was true does not translate to a 4.9% probability that the null hypothesis is true.", "This conclusion should be obvious from the definition of the p value:", "The p-value is a number between 0 and 1 that tells researchers the probability of observing a certain value, given that the null hypothesis is true.", "We\u2019re measuring the probability of observing a certain value, not the probability that a hypothesis is true.", "We\u2019ve already seen how easy it is to manipulate the p value:", "However, the p value makes many other assumptions which may be inapplicable in the current research.", "For example, the p value assumes that we are comparing similar groups. That is, the American cities are similar to the Chinese cities. This is an unlikely assumption to make, even with our overly-complex model. For one, cities in China are in a drastically different political system than cities in America. Our model cannot quantify this difference.", "As well, the p value assumes that the treatment (minimum wage) is applied randomly.", "Of course, this is not true. The fact that one American city has a minimum wage and another does not has less to do with randomness and more to do with political and economic differences.", "Suppose we fudged with our model again. Now, we get a p value of 0.004. If we assume the null hypothesis is true, then there is now only a 0.4% probability that we would observe a half a percentage point difference between cities with minimum wage laws and cities without minimum wage laws.", "For a moment, let\u2019s ignore all the other problems with p values, and let\u2019s assume that our results represent the ground truth.", "Should we prevent millions of people from getting a living wage because that might increase the unemployment rate by half a percentage point?", "Oftentimes, a low p value masks the fact that the predicted causal impact is trivial. The ASA is correct when they write:", "Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold", "Unfortunately, many applied researchers ignore causal impact and use small p values to make policy recommendations.", "Returning to our minimum wage example, it would be incorrect to decide on a policy only by considering the p value. We have to take a more holistic approach.", "We\u2019ve shown how the p value can be misleading. This would not be a big problem if not for its near-universal acceptance as a sufficient indicator of causality. After all, many statistics, by themselves, can be misleading.", "Thus, it begs the question: should we stop reporting the p value?", "In 2015, the Basic and Applied Social Psychology (BASP) journal banned papers from reporting p values \u2014 a drastic step, in my opinion.", "I believe the solution is to educate people on the use (and misuse) of p values.", "The p value was never intended to be the raison d\u2019etre of statistical research. Rather, when Ronald Fisher \u2014 the godfather of frequentist statistics \u2014 developed the p value in the 1920s, he intended it to be used as one step, among many, in causal analysis.", "Despite its misinterpretation among many, the p value still provides some interesting information. It has to be used in combination with other statistics, domain knowledge, and (a little) common sense.", "Your home for data science.
