This opens up some great possibilities \u2014 discovering new content online that suits our interests, self-driving cars that let us relax or catch up on some work while they take us where we need to go.", "Unfortunately, it can also open up room for things to go wrong in unexpected ways. For example, Youtube\u2019s recommendation algorithm has learned that the best way to keep users on the site it to feed them content that\u2019s more outrageous and polarising in its content, and self-driving cars can crash (and kill) in seemingly mundane settings.", "When machines are left to teach themselves how to perform a function well, they can find ways to solve this problem that we wouldn\u2019t naturally anticipate.", "In his book Deep Medicine, Eric Topol describes some of the major advances in machine learning that point toward our inevitable future in machine decision making.", "One of the examples he describes is a landmark paper that came out in Nature in 2017. The paper described a deep neural network that had been trained to diagnose skin cancer, matching the accuracy of twenty-one board-certified dermatologists.", "The paper included some key examples, which highlight the parts of the image that are being used to make the predictions. These all looked reasonable, with most of the focus of the algorithm being placed on the skin lesion itself. Overall the paper looks very impressive, and since its publication in 2017, it has been cited over 1000 times.", "But, after its publication, the authors of the study noticed a bias in their algorithm \u2014 it was more likely to label an image as malignant cancer if there was a ruler in the image. Dermatologists often use a ruler to measure the size of a skin lesion in the photo if they\u2019re particularly concerned about it, so a photo with a ruler in it is more likely to be cancerous.", "If the algorithm sometimes relies on rulers to make diagnoses, is this something to be worried about?", "The importance of this bias depends on how many samples it affects, and how this error is distributed among patients. If a random error is made every 1,000 patients, and there\u2019s no more accurate approach, this is usually considered an acceptable error rate. But, if a high rate of errors are made, or errors seriously affect a particular group of patients, ethically this is more concerning.", "For example, if one clinic decides to always include rulers in their photos, the algorithm will consistently over-predict cancer in patients attending that clinic. This can lead to a systematic disadvantage for patients living in the area. Also, if dermatologists decide to do away with rulers because they\u2019re relying completely on this algorithm, the accuracy of the algorithm could drop.", "In fact, in classifying lesions into their nine major clinical categories, the deep neural net was 55.4% accurate, compared to 55.0% and 53.3% for two dermatologists. Even if the effect of the rulers on accuracy was very small, this could easily tip the balance in favour of the dermatologists.", "Another issue is the authors\u2019 suggestion that with algorithms like these, people may not even have to see a dermatologist anymore \u2014 they could just snap a picture of a suspicious-looking mole with their smartphones and find out if it\u2019s anything to be concerned about. This is a great idea in concept \u2014 it would democratise access to specialist healthcare and make regular checkups much easier.", "\u201cThis fast, scalable method is deployable on mobile devices and holds the potential for substantial clinical impact, including broadening the scope of primary care practice and augmenting clinical decision-making for dermatology specialists.\u201d \u2014 Original Nature paper", "The problem is, while this was a major claim made by the paper, smartphone photos weren\u2019t tested by the algorithm. The types of photos people will take of their own skin are likely to differ from dermatologists\u2019 in terms of lighting, photo quality, zoom and a number of other factors, which puts the algorithm outside of its original training conditions. We know that when machine learning algorithms are given data that\u2019s different to what they were trained with, they can behave unpredictably.", "My phone does a terrible job of capturing a mole close-up, suggesting you need one of the newer, more expensive phones to get this to work. This means the reduced cost of using the algorithm would be available only to people who can afford to buy a new phone with a nice camera.", "Also, the photos of lesions shown in the paper are very similar in skin colour. Interviews with people testing the use of AI to detect skin cancer with smartphones say that variation in skin colour is a major factor that the algorithm needs to be trained to deal with, along with simple factors like how hairy someone\u2019s arm is.", "The reliance of the algorithm on rulers wasn\u2019t covered in the original Nature paper \u2014 the realisation made its first appearance in the media almost a year later.", "When you look up articles on \u201cskin cancer\u201d, \u201cneural network\u201d/\u201dmachine learning\u201d and \u201cruler\u201d, you get 10 news articles, four of which cover the bias discovered in this algorithm, among around 4,500 articles describing neural nets/machine learning algorithms for detecting skin cancer. It seems people are much more excited to hear about impressive new results than failures of these hyped algorithms.", "This is a classic problem of publication bias, where successes are published happily, but negative results get rejected by journals and news outlets and usually don\u2019t see the light of day. The fact that this algorithm is still being used as an example of the impressive power of AI to change the way we practise medicine in Deep Medicine, which was published in March 2019, shows how hard it is for information on the limitations of these algorithms to permeate popular opinion.", "Topol dedicates a section of his book to the shortcomings of AI, and mentions other algorithms that haven\u2019t lived up to the hype, but has missed the limitations of this one. Because of the lack of transparency of these algorithms, it can take time and a more diverse set of tests before weaknesses become clear. As a result, it can be really hard to keep on top of growing understanding of these algorithms once they\u2019ve drifted from the headlines.", "While steady progress is being made in the field of AI in healthcare, algorithms are being released that can be used to make diagnostic decisions without independent testing and with little understanding of how they\u2019re making their predictions. There\u2019s little incentive to publicise an algorithm\u2019s weaknesses, and often no ability for interested parties to perform their own testing.", "This leaves stakeholders, like patients and clinicians, in a position of having to take the creators of the algorithms\u2019 word for its reliability. As evidence of unexpected algorithm biases and weaknesses grows, this is likely to become an uncomfortable position for consumers.", "A demand for greater openness should improve this situation. The paper came with nine examples of the features in an image the algorithm was using to make decisions. If the algorithm had been trained on an open dataset, then these examples could have been provided for all images, which would have made bias more easily discoverable by the public.", "\u201cRestrictions apply to the availability of the medical training/validation data, which were used with permission for the current study, and so are not publicly available. Some data may be available from the authors upon reasonable request and with permission of the Stanford Hospital.\u201d \u2014 Excerpt from the paper\u2019s data availability statement", "Fortunately, in this case, the authors of the paper relied on a combination of images from publicly available images and images from Stanford hospital, meaning we can take a look at a subset of the training data. Otherwise, we\u2019d have absolutely no idea that rulers could have been a bias without the authors choosing to admit it, and we\u2019d have no idea how many images this bias might affect (take a look for yourself).", "On top of expecting more openness around how these algorithms work, publicising the mistakes these algorithms make as well as their triumphs helps people to develop an intuition for how machine learning algorithms may fail. Advancing AI literacy among the public \u2014 around where it\u2019s being used, where the training and testing data have come from, what decisions it\u2019s making, how confident we should be in these decisions and how the decisions are being made \u2014 is critical to improving the public\u2019s trust, as well as keeping companies developing these algorithms in check.", "Progress is being made into improving the explainability of AI. If consumers push to make this a mandatory part of approving algorithms for important uses, we may be better placed to avoid unexpected biases creeping into these algorithms in the future.", "Your home for data science.
