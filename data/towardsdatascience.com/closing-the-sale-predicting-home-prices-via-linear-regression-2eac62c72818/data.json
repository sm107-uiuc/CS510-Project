Specifically, we were asked to create a model predicts the expected home value and minimizes the root mean squared error (RMSE).", "This data set has been used in a very popular Kaggle competition series and serves as a great learning tool to practice applying the full data science model workflow: from importing / cleaning to model predictions.", "For this challenge, our cohort was limited to only using Linear Regressions to find the expected value of subset of testing data that had been pre-split. This is important in a few respects:", "Nevertheless, as data scientists we must make certain assumptions and work within the confines of the data that is currently available.", "Cleaning and EDA are important for this challenge as this data set contains many ordinal / categorical features that may be important in categorization and will need to be converted to numerical values.", "As a baseline, I imported the following libraries to clean, explore and model the training data.", "One of my first preprocessing steps was to convert all object types into numerical features that can be used in a Linear Regression. According to the data dictionary, there were several categorical features that were ordinal in nature. Using my personal discretion, I converted values that would seem important to a perspective home buyer on a scale from 0 (if NA was an option) or 1 (if NA was not an option) upward (depending on the number of features).", "While I could have used the get_dummies method, by using a range of values (which can then be scaled) allows for more nuance and reduced number of a features overall.", "Additionally, there were many missing / null values within this data set that needed to be imputed. For features with a large number of missing values (e.g. \u2018Lot Frontage\u2019), it is was more desirable to impute these with \u201creal\u201d versus \u201cdummy\u201d values (e.g., 0s) . This can be done by using the mean, median, mode, or some other correlated function.", "For the sake of simplicity and time, I did not use a calculation to impute for all missing values. I instead focused on the variables with the largest proportion of nulls. For all other features, I used .fillna(0). Using a basic, and somewhat arbitrary assumption, I imputed the missing values for lot frontage via the following:", "I prepared the non-ordinal categorical features to be transformed via .get_dummies by converting certain numeric features into strings:", "Finally in order to corroborate my initial assumptions on features importance, I created a Seaborn heatmap which calculated Pearson\u2019s coefficient in relation to my target feature: sale price.", "A key skill for all data scientists is the art and science of feature selection. This requires both rigorous statistical testing and subject matter expertise (or intuition) to filter signals from noise. One interesting point that arose while conducting my initial data exploration was an apparent correlation between parcel ID and sale price. Through a scatter plot, we can spot both the bifurcation in the parcel IDs (5 vs 9s) and the tendency for homes with a PID beginning in 9 to be clustered at lower values. While this may be statistically significant, I did not conduct a hypothesis test to validate. And as a result, I considered this noise and dropped the PID column.", "Because of the characteristics of this data set (multiple, related features) there is the potential for redundancy and multi- collinearity. While we can use certain regularization techniques (i.e. Lasso) to compensate, I also decided to create feature interactions to hopefully isolate / amplify the most impactful features.", "Because my resulting features are using different scales, I appliedStandardScaler to normalize as a pre-processing set before fitting the model.", "In order to validate the performance of my LinearRegression model, I instantiated and cross-validated four variations: Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet. Although my training data contained 350+ features, by using a regularizing function I was able to more accurately fine tune my predictions. Ultimately the Lasso was the best performing in terms of both RMSE and R\u00b2 .", "While my very specific Lasso Linear Regression performed fairly well on my training data and on the 30% hold out of the test data within the Kaggle Challenge (less than $20K RMSE), I was ultimately undone when the model was applied to the remaining 70% of the hold out data. Because of the significant outliers (which I dropped within my training set), my model did not generalize and was overfit.", "Notwithstanding, I\u2019m hopeful that some of the techniques I have demonstrated through this post will be useful for other aspiring data scientists learning the ins-and-outs of regression modeling.", "Your home for data science.
