Then, we run transform method on both datasets, the transformation process is completed according to mapping done during fitting and we get full-numeric datasets in return.", "As the second part of the feature pre-processing, we will handle missing values. An easy option is to drop them. However, we already have only 8500 data points to train the model. Therefore, we are going to proceed by filling them. \u200bProcess of filling missing values of features is called imputation. We are going to use the following strategies for different features:", "One important consideration during imputing is, whatever imputing strategy is selected, both training and test sets are imputed with the same values.
