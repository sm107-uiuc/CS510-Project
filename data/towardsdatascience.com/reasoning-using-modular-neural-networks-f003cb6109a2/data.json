This concept has a biological basis. There are functionally specialized regions in the brain that are domain specific for different cognitive processes. Within a part of the brain, called the thalamus, lies the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), which is divided into layers that separately process color and contrast: both major components of vision. Modular Neural Networks use this idea to solve complex AI problems. Several independent neural networks are trained simultaneously for a specific sub-task and their results are combined at the end to perform a single task. The benefits of modular neural networks include:", "As we all know, an AI does not inherently have language, so this is our job to train our model to do reasoning over a given text. By reasoning, we mean tasks like arithmetic, sorting, comparisons, and counting.", "Suppose we want to create a Question Answering System, Figure 1 and 2 illustrate how the QA model works!", "Consider the question \u201cWhat does the sign say next to the traffic light?\u201d in Figure 1. Multiple reasoning steps are needed to answer such a question: find all \u201csigns\u201d in the image, find the \u201ctraffic light\u201d, select the sign \u201cnext to the traffic light\u201d, and then find \u201cwhat it says\u201d. Or the question in figure 2: first we need to find all the truancy rates in the given text, pick the highest one, and then find \u201cWhich area it is tied for\u201d. We would like to develop models that are capable of understanding the compositional semantics of such complex questions in order to provide the correct answer.", "NMNs are capable of providing such reasoning. Using the given question, the model assembles a concrete network architecture and then executes the assembled neural module network to output an answer which is shown in Figure 3 and 4.", "Many non-identical model layouts have been made in order to address QA. A recent review of the literature on this topic found that most of them are outperforming on a specific form of question. Flexible Layout component is created to take advantage of all those different models. In order to find the best layout l for a specific question q, the probability distribution p (l|q) needs to be calculated first and then using beam search, the maximum-probability layout will be defined later. Assume each layer as a sequence of modules:", "Since we have a sequence form of modules, attentional LSTM model can be used to find the probability distribution for each possible layouts. First, we hand over the question features fQ(q) to LSTM model to generate a hidden states:", "The attention weights of input question words are predicted as:", "Where e_ti is the alignment model which is defined as", "Where h_i and h_t are the encoder and decoder LSTM out-puts respectively. Then the context vector is calculated as", "This context vector will be used to calculate the probability for the next module", "Finally, the probability distribution of l is defined by", "Modules are created to perform basic reasoning tasks independently. Think about them as functions that take attentional vectors, text or image features and they have some internal parameters to perform a certain calculation. Let's take a look at some examples:", "Find module in VQA convolves every position in the input image with a weight vector (distinct for each x) to produce an attention.", "Given a passage, this module first computes a number token distribution T, then use this to compute the probability that each number token is the one with the maximum value.", "And and Or modules take two image attention as inputs, and return their intersection or union respectively.", "The relocate module change the input image map to a new attention map, which can be useful for spatial relation.", "Like other neural networks, during the training process, the goal is minimizing the loss. But the difference here is that the model jointly learn the predicted layout p(l|q) and the parameters in each module.", "Hu R, Andreas J, Rohrbach M, Darrell T, Saenko K.
