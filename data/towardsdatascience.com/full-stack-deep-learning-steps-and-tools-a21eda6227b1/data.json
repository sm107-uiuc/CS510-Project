Today, I\u2019m going to write article about what I have learned from seeing the Full Stack Deep Learning (FSDL) March 2019 courses.

What I love the most is how they teach us a project and teach us not only how to create the Deep Learning architecture, but tell us the Software Engineering stuffs that should be concerned when doing project about Deep Learning.", "When we do a Deep Learning project, we need to know what are the steps and technology that we should use.

The course also suggest that we do the process iteratively, meaning that we start from small progress and increase it continuously. For example, we start using simple model with small data then improve it as time goes by.", "This step will be the first step that you will do. We need to state what the project going to make and the goal of the project. We also need to state the metric and baseline of the project. The substeps of this step are as follow:", "First, we need to define what is the project is going to make. There are two consideration on picking what to make. They are are Impact and Feasibility.", "We need to make sure that the project is Impactful. What are the values of your application that we want to make in the project. Two questions that you need to answer are", "Where for cheap prediction produced by our chosen application that we want to make, we can produce great value which can reduce the cost of other tasks.", "Feasibility is also thing that we need to watch out. Since Deep Learning focus on data, We need to make sure that the data is available and fit to the project requirement and cost budget.", "We need to consider the accuracy requirement where we need to set the minimum target. Since the project costs will tend to correlate super linearly with the project costs, again, we need to considerate our requirement and maximum cost that we tolerate. Also consider that there might be some cases where it is not important to fail the prediction and some cases where the model must have a low error as possible.", "Finally, we need to see the problem difficulty. How hard is the project is. To measure the difficulty, we can see some published works on similar problem. For example, search some papers in ARXIV or any conferences that have similar problem with the project.

There are:", "Here are some example how to combine two metrics (Precision and Recall):", "After we choose the metric, we need to choose our baseline. Baseline is an expected value or condition which the performance will be measured to be compared to our work. It will give us a lower bound on a expected model performance. The tighter the baseline is the more useful the baseline is.", "So why is the baseline is important? Why not skip this step ? We can measure our model how good it is by comparing to the baseline. By knowing how good or bad the model is, we can choose our next move on what to tweak.", "To look for the baseline, there are several sources that you can use:", "The baseline is chosen according to your need. For example if you want a system that surpass human, you need to add a human baseline.", "Create your codebase that will be the core how to do the further steps. The source code in the codebase can be developed according to the current need of what the project currently going to do. For example, if the current step is collecting the data, we will write the code used to collect the data (if needed).

Time will be mostly consumed in this process. Although you can also use public dataset, often that labeled dataset needed for our project is not available publicly.", "We need to plan how to obtain the complete dataset. There are multiple ways to obtain the data. One that you should be considered that the data need to align according to what we want to create in the project.", "If the strategy to obtain data is through the internet by scraping and crawling some websites, we need to use some tools to do it. Scrapy is one of the tool that can be helpful for the project", "This is a Python scrapper and data crawler library that can be used to scrap and crawl websites. It can be used to collect data such as images and texts on the websites. We can also scrap images from Bing, Google, or Instagram with this. To use this library, we need to learn from the tutorial that is also available in its website. Do not worry, it is not hard to learn.", "After we collect the data, the next problem that you need to think is where to send your collected data. Since you are doing the project not alone, you need to make sure that the data can be accessed by everyone. Also, we need to choose the format of the data which will be saved. Below is a solution when we want to save our data in cloud.", "For storing your binary data such as images and videos, You can use cloud storage such as AmazonS3 or GCP to build the object storage with API over the file system.

You need to pay to use it (there is also a free plan).", "Database is used for persistent, fast, scalable storage, and retrieval of structured data.

Reproducibility is one thing that we must concern when writing the code. we need to make sure that our codebase has reproducibility on it.", "Before we dive into tools, we need to choose the language and framework of our codebase.", "For choosing programming language, I prefer Python over anything else. Python has the largest community for data science and great to develop. The popular Deep Learning software also mostly supported by Python. The language is also easy to learn.", "There are several choices that you can made for the Deep Learning Framework. The most popular framework in Python are Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Use the one that you like.", "For easier debugging, you can use PyTorch as the Deep Learning Framework. Keras is also easy to use and have good UX. It is a wrapper of Tensorflow, Theano and other Deep Learning framework and make it easier to use. Tensorflow is also a choice if you like their environment. Tensorflow can be wise decision because of the support of its community and have great tools for deployment.", "Do not worry about the deployment. There is exists a software that can convert the model format to another format. For example, you can convert the model that is produced by Pytorch to Tensorflow. We will see this later.", "I think the factor of choosing the language and framework is how active the community behind it. Since it will give birth of high number of custom package that can be integrated into it.", "One of the important things when doing the project is version control. When we do the project, we don\u2019t want the inability to redo our code base when someone accidentally wreck it. We also need to keep track the code on each update to see what are the changes updated by someone else. This will not be possible if we do not use some tools do it. Git is one of the solution to do it.", "Okay, we know that version control is important, especially on doing collaboration work. Currently, git is one of the best solution to do version control. It also be used to share your code to other people in your team. Without this, I don\u2019t think that you can collaborate well with others in the project.", "There are several services that you can use that use Git such as GitHub, BitBucket, and GitLab.", "There is also important thing that should be done, which is Code Review. Code reviews are an early protection against incorrect code or bad quality code which pass the unit or integration tests. When you do collaboration, make someone check your code and review it. Most of the version control services should support this feature.", "When we first create the project structure folder, we must be wondering how to create the folder structure. Then, we give up and put all the code in the root project folder. It\u2019s a bad practice that give bad quality code.", "One of the solution that I found is cookiecutter-data-science. It give a template how should we create the project structure. It also give how to give a name to the created file and where you should put it. Be sure to use it to make your codebase not become messy. Consider reading the website to use it.", "IDE is one of the tools that you can use to accelerate to write the code.

This IDE can be used not only for doing Deep Learning project, but doing other project such as web development.

The difference of your library and their library can also be the trigger of the problem.", "To solve that, you need to write your library dependencies explicitly in a text called requirements.txt. Then run Python virtual environment such as pipenv. This will solve the library dependencies. Nevertheless, it still cannot solve the difference of enviroment and OS of the team.
