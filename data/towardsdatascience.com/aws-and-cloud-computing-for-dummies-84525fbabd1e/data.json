This is going to be an introductory article for beginners who don\u2019t have any prior knowledge of AWS or cloud services. The article is meant to develop an understanding for those new to the domain of cloud computing. The article will cover the following:", "When we log into our computer and browse over the internet via some web browser like Google Chrome to access our favorite websites such as YouTube.com or Facebook.com, a lot is happening behind the scenes. Many different physical and virtual, human, and nonhuman components are working in conjunction to enable a user to visit their favorite website or service.", "For any organization, however small or large, when they have to provide access to any of their service, over the internet, to their users they need different components to do that. A traditional IT infrastructure for a web-based service includes the following core components:", "This arrangement works pretty well if the number of users of a particular service is not that large. But as the service becomes more and more popular and the organization grows, scaling up the physical infrastructure and providing instant and uninterrupted access to users all the time becomes a daunting task. Take Facebook for example. About 2.6 billion users are using the platform. They have very large custom-built data centers, 15 as reported in 2019 around the globe, with more than 180,000 servers that are enabling these 2.6 billion users to get steady and uninterrupted access 24/7 to Facebook.com. At the core of each of these data centers are the above-mentioned components i.e. servers, storage, networking, and labor.", "So we can see that not all organizations can afford this much physical hardware, labor, and operational space for their day to day activities.", "To simply put, cloud computing is just data centers like any other data center having servers, storage, networking, labor and space, and all other necessities of a data center that are just not being managed by you. A trusted and independent party lends its entire infrastructure via the internet to the customers that are other organizations that either can\u2019t afford to have their on-premise infrastructure or don\u2019t feel the need to have one.", "Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources with pay-as-you-go pricing. Access as many resources as you need and provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources, almost instantly.", "Cloud service providers provide their customers with all the core services that are involved in a traditional on-premise IT infrastructure with added services and benefits in terms of pricing, availability of services, scaling up or down, security, maintenance, and much more. The customers usually pay for what they use at very reasonable costs and just have to worry about the kind of infrastructure they want and its deployment all virtually. Everything is accessible over the internet through some interface provided by the cloud service provider and users log in and simply deploy the kind of infrastructure they want.", "Over the years cloud computing has seen massive growth with more and more organizations giving up physical data centers and moving to the cloud. In 2020, Top 3 cloud service providers would be:", "Some popular services that are operating on these cloud services are Netflix, Airbnb, McDonald\u2019s, Activision, NASA, Walmart, Ford, T-Mobile, Disney, Colgate, eBay, Spotify, and many more.", "Cloud services are becoming more and more popular among organizations with new startups building their products around cloud services while old organizations migrating to the cloud. Cloud computing has become a billion-dollar industry with AWS alone earning about 35 billion us dollars in 2019 and has Over 1,000,000 active users.", "Let\u2019s take a look at what kind of cloud services are being provided by different providers:", "The following image helps to understand the level of abstraction provided by each type of cloud service to the user.", "Now that we know what comprises traditional IT and the cloud we can easily draw a comparison between the two. Cloud platforms come with several added benefits compared to setting up an on-premise data center. The following table can help us understand why the cloud emerges to be the preferred choice among the majority:", "Having a cloud-based infrastructure has the following benefits:", "When we talk about cloud computing, Amazon Web Services(AWS) is the first name that comes to mind. AWS is the pioneer of cloud computing in the cloud industry. Having launched in 2004 with just one service(SQS) they have come a long way. AWS, without a doubt, is the most mature cloud service provider and the current market leader in the cloud industry.", "With more than 212 services including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things. AWS operates globally with 216 Points of Presence (205 Edge Locations & 11 Regional Caches) in 84 cities across 42 countries.", "AWS allows customers to build highly scalable, robust, and sophisticated applications at very minimal costs for a very diverse set of industries. Their on-demand and pay as you go pricing model reduces the costs massively and as the user base grows larger and larger AWS further reduces the cost via their massive economies of scale pricing strategy.", "AWS allows access to all the resources via a well-built web-based console. Other means include accessing via CLI, SDKs, and APIs.", "AWS provides all three types of cloud services i.e. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS. Popular uses cases of AWS include:", "With more than 200 services AWS has at least one product relating to your needs", "AWS also provides domain-specific solutions and you can leverage from already implemented solutions and build your well-architected applications.v", "If you\u2019re a beginner and just started with cloud computing AWS provides one year of the free tier (visit the following link).", "In this article, we learned what is the difference between traditional IT infrastructure and cloud services. What is cloud computing, its advantages over traditional IT and added benefits, and what is AWS?", "Feel free to reach out to me in case of any queries.
