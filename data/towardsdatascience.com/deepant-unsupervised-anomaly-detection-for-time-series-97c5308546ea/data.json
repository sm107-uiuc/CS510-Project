And here we are going to discuss a method which can detect all (almost) anomalies within the data, in near real-time format.", "In this article, we will try to learn about detecting anomalies from data without training the model before-hand, because you can\u2019t train a model on data, which we don\u2019t know about! That\u2019s where the idea of unsupervised learning comes into the picture. The reason to select time series data is, they are one of the most occurring real world data, we analyze as a data scientist.", "Coming to the model \u2014 \u201cDeepAnT\u201d is an Unsupervised time based anomaly detection model, which consists of Convolutional neural network layers. It works really well in detecting all sorts of anomalies in the time series data. But this might have a caveat of also detecting noise, which can be handled by tuning of hyper-parameters like kernel size, \u2018lookback\u2019 (time series window size), units in hidden layers and many more.", "The link for the code and data is provided in the Github link here \u2014", "Number of features in data = 27 (Including \u2018timestamp\u2019 feature)Data type of features = Numerical", "Now that we know about the data, let\u2019s get into the code base and work upon the problem we have. Problem Description :- We have around 80 years of climate data for Canada (frequency of data = daily), and we want to identify the anomalies from the climate data.", "The modules are imported and file is loaded into Kaggle kernel\u2019s environment.", "In the above code snippet, we are reading the data from file, which is present in the environment. After reading, we are converting the index of data, to timestamp. The main motivation of making timestamp as index of data, is to have better analysis through dataFrame plots and resampling, if required.", "Here, we are normalizing the data within the range of [0,1] and then modifying the dataset by including \u2018time-steps\u2019 as one more dimension into the picture. The idea is to convert data set of dimension from [Batch Size, Features] to [Batch Size, Lookback Size, Features]", "We are creating model DeepAnT architecture (more on the paper can be found in the link \u2014 Research Paper in IEEE). It contains two layers of convolution layers and is very efficient in determining the anomalies within the temporal pattern of data. The kernel size and number of filters can be tuned further to perform better depending on the data.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the model architecture for better visual understanding \u2014", "Function make_train_step is to create the iterator, which can provide data in mini-batches to the computation model.", "The MSE loss function is passed on to the make_train_step function, and Adam optimizer is used for loss function optimization and convergence after multiple epochs.", "The final step is to run the model through data (in batches). We are using MSE loss function along with Adam optimizer, and running in 30 epochs. After this, we are generating the hypothesis and calculating losses, which are the anomaly confidence scores for individual time stamps given in the data set.", "Looking at the above two graphs, we can conclude that timestamps, which has anomaly confidence scores more than 1.2 are those, which can be treated as potential anomalies, and further actions can be taken with the analysis :)", "For those who want to directly run on Kaggle Kernel :)", "For any queries, kindly reach out to me personally at bmonikraj@gmail.com", "Your home for data science.
