LBP, HAAR are some of the popular algorithms which are widely used for face recognition and yield excellent results. But, most of these algorithms are not suitable for real time recognition in unconstrained environment. Recently, state-of-the-art deep learning techniques have become new favorite over traditional machine learning algorithm. Face recognition application works with images which are nothing but combination of pixel values in range (0\u2013255). Algorithm finds a discriminating pattern in those gray values and consider it as a feature which is considered to be unique for each image. However, in 3D images, no pixel information is present, but only position (x, y, z) of each point is available. This makes it difficult to find pattern in 3D images.", "Recently, I started working on FRGC2.0 3D face dataset and initially, I was not able to find enough resources to process 3D images. Finally, after some time, i came across a paper based on 3D face recognition , by Ajmal Mian whom I would like to thank for helpful suggestions and references. I also would like to mention my colleague Jayeeta Chakraborty who equally contributed to develop this project. In this article, I will discuss per-processing steps for development of 3D face recognition system so that other looking for similar work can have head start.", "A 3D image of an object contains height, width and depth of each point in the object. Generally, 3D raw dataset such as FRGC 2.0 face database, Collection F and Collection G 3D ear database having images files in the .abs, .abs.Z, or .abs.gz format. An images samples of FRGC 2.0 3D face database is shown in figure 1.", "These images are compressed ASCII text files. It is suggested to not to unzip dataset beforehand as expansion of these files may require large disk space. Each image file has a three-line header giving the number of rows and columns. This is followed by four images. The first is the so-called \u2018flag\u2019 image, where a pixel value of 1 means the corresponding (x,y,z) values at that pixel are valid. If the flag value is zero, you should ignore the (x,y,z) components for that pixel. Following the flag image is the image of X-coordinates, the image of Y-coordinates, and the image of Z-coordinates. All are floating-point images. You can use the 3D coordinates of each range pixel, or you can throw away the X and Y images, and concern yourself with the Z-value only. Note that the `aspect ratio\u2019 of the image doesn\u2019t have to be 1. The following section of code can be used to get x, y, z and flag values.", "You can print x, y, z using imshow() function, this will show images captures when camera is facing towards x-axis, y-axis and z-axis. Concatenate all you can see image as shown in figure 2.", "We extracted cloud points, converted it into .ply file and displayed it to visualize3D shape of image. Following figure 3 shows the 3D view of face. As raw image contains face image including neck and shoulder which is not required for feature extraction process. Therefore, we have to crop only face region from whole image which will be discussed in the next section.", "Figure 3 : Above figures are of same subject. Figure (a) represents 3D visualization using Matlab while figure (b) is produced when it shown in Meshlab tool.", "To extract only face region from whole image we utilized depth information. If you notice image shown in Figure 4, it can be observed that subject is facing towards z-axis and frontal face is captured by sensor. Therefore, the noise tip point will have minimum depth from camera.", "If you closely look at figure 3, you will notice that depth value increases from 1500 to 1700 as we go towards ear from nose point. If still the concept of nose tip is not clear, have a look on figure 5.", "You will notice that z-value (depth) of nose tip (P) shown by black dot is around 1450 to 1480, lets say it is 1460. Now considering nose tip \u2018P\u2019 as a center we have drawn square of size 140 unit as shown in figure 6.", "the size of square is empirically found suitable to cover face region. Only points lies in that square is selected to represent face area. Finally, cropping facial part from whole image we get face shown in figure 7.", "Figure 7 (a) and 7(b) represents cropped face images when visualized at different angles. Once you get cropped face region, next step is to perform de-spiking, hole filling and de-noising.", "Despiking: The 3D faces are noisy and contain spikes thus requires smoothing techniques to be applied. In our study, we have extended the concept of 2D weighted median filtering technique to 3D face images. The studied technique performs filtering of 3D dataset using the weighted median implementation of the mesh median filtering.", "Hole filling: Removal of spikes results creation of holes, therefore it is necessary to fill those holes. For this purpose, we have used 3D interpolation. Among all interpolation techniques, we used \u2018cubic\u2019. In cubic interpolation method, the interpolated value at a query point is based on a cubic interpolation of the values at neighboring grid points in each respective dimension. This interpolation is based on a cubic convolution.", "Noise removal: Digital images are susceptible to different kinds of noise. Noise is the consequence of mistakes in the method of image acquisition resulting values that do not represent the actual scene\u2019s true intensities. Again there are many methods to remove noise, we used 3D Gaussian filter.", "Here is the final image after all pre-processing steps, shown in figure 8.", "The source code used for face region detection, cropping face, despiking, hole filling and denoising is shown below.", "After all the steps, final output we got is a mesh image. This mesh image can be used for feature extraction techniques as per application requirement. In our case, we extracted PCA features, and line, point and area features which I will discuss in the next post. In another experiment, we applied ICP to the mesh images to match which produced better results. It is recommended to have GPU if you want to run ICP algorithm.", "The complete code is available at GitHub repository. You can download and use it for pre-processing of your own 3D face dataset. Feel free to upvote if you find this post helpful.", "In the next post, I will share feature level and score level fusion based face recognition using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Iterative Closest Point (ICP) [Edit: Due to some permission issue, I am not sharing code of PCA and ICP for now.].", "Your home for data science.
