["2017 brought AI bias into mainstream awareness, and public concern has only surged since then. Much has been said on the causes of bias in AI and, more vexingly, the difficulties in eradicating it. Most of these commentaries acknowledge that machine bias is a reflection of human bias; however, far fewer of the proposed solutions actually address the root cause: humans.", "That absence is unsurprising. Bias has existed in our species throughout our history; it would be a gargantuan bug to solve for. In comparison, it is much more tempting to focus externally on how to adjust a misbehaving AI.", "It might be time to shift that focus. One of the benefits of replicating our decision-making processes in machines is that we have a chance to see a reflection of ourselves and learn from it. As it turns out, the lessons we\u2019ve learned from tracking down bias in AI can provide a useful framework for addressing bias in our own, imperfect human decision-making.", "Why is this internal operating system upgrade especially important now? After all, we\u2019ve managed to muddle through the negative effects of bias for this long.", "Two factors make this work urgent. The first is a not-quite-new phenomenon that nonetheless is making itself increasingly evident: the unprecedented scalability of technology means any errors in design have a correspondingly scaled impact. The second factor is that we are at an inflection point for technological governance. Governments, technologists and concerned stakeholders \u2014 let\u2019s call this collective group \u201cDesigners\u201d \u2014 are embarking eagerly on a new stage of regulation.", "Just as each time AI designers create a system, they risk building their blind spots into it, so too do these governance Designers risk projecting their own blind spots into the solutions they propose. When that happens, both technology and the systems of governance that will regulate it have the potential to amplify errors in decision-making at an unruly scale.", "If we hope to design solutions to technology\u2019s unintended consequences and anticipate future problems, we must first examine the machine behind these machines: ourselves.", "Of the many ways bias can be introduced into AI, three phenomena are particularly relevant for examining our own decision-making. (For more on AI bias, see Karen Hao\u2019s summary here. Selected passages quoted below.)", "Let\u2019s examine how bias is introduced through problem framing, dealing with blind spots, narrow social contexts.", "Framing the problem. The first thing computer scientists do when they create a deep-learning model is decide what they actually want it to achieve. A credit card company, for example, might want to predict a customer\u2019s creditworthiness, but \u201ccreditworthiness\u201d is a rather nebulous concept. In order to translate it into something that can be computed, the company must decide whether it wants to, say, maximize its profit margins or maximize the number of loans that get repaid. It could then define creditworthiness within the context of that goal. That choice may cause unintended consequences or harmful behavior; if profit maximization is the goal, the computer may recommend predatory loans.", "Unknown unknowns. The introduction of bias isn\u2019t always obvious during a model\u2019s construction because you may not realize the downstream impacts of your data and choices until much later. Once you do, it\u2019s hard to retroactively identify where that bias came from and then figure out how to get rid of it.\u201d", "Lack of social context. Similarly, the way in which computer scientists are taught to frame problems often isn\u2019t compatible with the best way to think about social problems.", "These AI design errors sound, unsurprisingly, similar to biases in human decision-making.", "Humans often don\u2019t see the bigger picture, and our narrow understanding leads to choices we might not have made if we\u2019d had better data, or a more perfect understanding of our environment. We make choices without knowing their downstream impacts; indeed, we make choices without knowing the upstream influences that have shaped our decision.", "One way to think of it is that our Decisions (D) are a function of several variables: the information (I) we have, the values+experiences (VE) that inform how we interpret that information, and finally the priorities (P) of a given situation, which give weight to different elements of our interpretation and allow us to choose a course of action. How often can we say we are truly conscious of all those variables?", "Spoiler: Not often. We are conscious of a very small proportion of our decisions, emotions, actions and behavior. Moreover, our unconscious, emotional cognition is often communicating with our conscious cognition when we form decisions, and we retroactively deploy conscious cognition to explain to ourselves how we came to the decision. Even when we think we\u2019re aware of our own process, we\u2019re often not.", "[*Another arena for AI bias that has clear comparisons to human cognition is flawed data: it is possible to train AI on data sets that either 1) are unrepresentative of reality; 2) reflect existing prejudices; or 3) become biased in the preparation stage, when designers select which attributes should matter to the AI system. This post focuses on addressing social contexts, framing the problem and blind spots, but for more reading on how flawed data bias manifests, see gender and race bias in crime and recidivism prediction tools trained with flawed data.]", "Regulating AI isn\u2019t the only space where governance Designers will be bringing our imperfect human decision-making to bear.", "The array of governance challenges in technology \u2014 especially regarding the internet \u2014 is growing daily. It includes everything from vanishing data privacy; to concerns about the attention economy and recommendation algorithms sowing radicalization; to navigating the balance between maintaining free speech and preventing harmful content; to fake news and the erosion of information integrity; to trolls and bots drowning out genuine discourse and perpetuating online harassment (which, on top of everything, disproportionately affects women and minorities); to filter bubbles that isolate communities and impinge civic discourse, even before we begin to address direct election interference. All of these challenges are compounded by the fact that a handful of platforms dominate the online media market, threatening the diversity of content options and triggering other monopoly concerns.", "That is an complex landscape of challenges for our Designers to address, to put it mildly. To meet this challenge, they must not only be technically adroit programmers and legal practitioners; they must also navigate a knotty series of moral, philosophical and social trade-offs. Consider some of the tough questions in front of these different actors.", "Should online platforms maintain a free and open marketplace, allowing the consumer to be the ultimate arbiter of what s/he consumes? Or should they engage in proactive curating of content to protect their consumers from harmful side effects of their products? If the latter, how do companies avoid inadvertently abusing their censorship power?", "Is commodification of user data a sustainable business model for society? To what extent should companies prioritize financial return for shareholders, versus pricing in externalities (like protecting consumer privacy or election integrity)?", "How should governments weigh the democracy-promoting effects of a free and open internet, against the democracy-undermining effects of a free and open internet? Consider: the US, Germany, the UK, EU Commission, France, Malaysia and Czech Republic are already taking steps to curb fake news and/or hate speech. However, such legislation can also be used by authoritarian governments for democracy-repressing efforts, as may well be the case in Russia, which immediately copied Germany\u2019s NetzDG law upon its passage; human rights experts anticipate Russia will use it to silence government opponents under the guise of shutting down fake news.", "How should governments ensure their own tech-enabled actions don\u2019t undermine citizens\u2019 rights in the course of trying to protect them?", "Should principles of sovereignty and state-specific rules apply to the cyber landscape? Even within states that have ratified UN\u2019s Article 19 (the global right to information) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, citizens who seek justice for abuses will face the same difficulties of enforcement that already complicate the international governance arena.", "How should companies respond when the demands of governments in international markets violate their domestic government\u2019s laws? For example, Global Network Initiative member and US based company Microsoft has pledged to protect users\u2019 privacy rights in response to government requests for surveillance; despite this, they are collaborating with China on AI that may aid China\u2019s already substantial state surveillance. Microsoft is hardly alone: all international companies that wish to operate in China must abide by its requirement to store data within the country, allowing China\u2019s security forces to access critical user data.", "Those examples are a tiny fraction of the questions our Designers are navigating. Given the stakes, we cannot afford for bias to slip into the answers. We need Designers to interrogate their own decision making processes rigorously: have they properly framed the problem? Are they confident that their information isn\u2019t flawed? Are they aware of their upstream and downstream blind spots? Most critically, have they placed these issues in the appropriate social context?", "Let\u2019s explore one of the ways Designers can ensure their answer is \u201cyes.\u201d", "Recently, a technology firm sent a group of its seniors leaders for a week-long learning expedition to a small town in southern West Virginia. On the surface, the location was a strange choice: with a population of ~3000 and a negligible web presence, the town was not a meaningful user market, especially for a company that measured its business on a global scale.", "As the visiting executives spoke to local business owners, government officials, and families, the connections to their business began to emerge. The region had been devastated after automation disrupted the primary source of jobs (mining), and the visiting executives found themselves immersed in a multi-generational sense of hopelessness, fueled by an entrenched lack of opportunities. Holy sh*t, several of them realized, we\u2019re about to do the same thing with our autonomous driving. Others reflected on the similarities between the towns built around their overseas data centers and the remnants of US company towns, which were decimated when the mining companies abruptly moved elsewhere. We\u2019re so focused on scaling, they realized, that we forgot to pay attention to the local impact.", "This experience prompted a robust examination of the company\u2019s role and responsibilities in the world, culminating in a recalibration of these executives\u2019 decision-making processes.", "The information they learned was hardly new. Indeed, some of the visitors had probably connected these dots before. However, humans are surprisingly bad at acting on information alone; experience and emotion is a much surer way of landing the kind of understanding that drives decision-making. These executives had widened their social context through immersive experience, become aware of blind spots, and in doing so, developed empathy not only for their colleagues and end users, but also for the wider ecosystem impacted by their actions.", "Widening our social context can be an effective way to both break up problems that our biases have seemingly made intractable as well as anticipate unforeseen consequences.", "In 2017, a group of sustainability experts made a similar immersion trip. Having achieved a monumental victory with the passage of the Paris Agreement, this group had been facing stiff headwinds in their subsequent attempts to deliver on the Agreement\u2019s commitments. They decided to widen their social context. After a week of immersion in a town that was fiercely loyal to the coal industry \u2014 a demographic the visitors would have once labelled as strictly adversaries \u2014 the group\u2019s framing of their challenges began to change. One of the visitors, the head of sustainability for a global consumer goods company, put it this way: the top priorities of my professional life have been \u2018kill coal\u2019. I\u2019ve just realized, to achieve my goals, my priority needs to be \u2018Create jobs for coal miners.\u2019*", "* He also intended to maintain other priorities, but the spirit of his point remained: he felt he had been thinking about the problem the wrong way.", "The group\u2019s overarching goal of helping the world meet carbon emission commitments hadn\u2019t been lost, but now they were thinking about the problem differently. Returning to our lessons in AI bias: before the immersion, the group had been operating like a robot that\u2019s been programmed to clean; unfortunately, if its designer fails to consider the wider environment beyond the immediate goal of cleaning, this robot may inadvertently break any vases that stand in its way. Likewise, this group\u2019s policies could have generated unintended negative side-effects (i.e. unemployed miners) if they ignored the wider environment around their goal. Worse still, those side-effects might have caused even bigger consequences down the road [see: one example of unintended side-effects contributing to the 2016 election result]. By expanding their social context and reframing the problem, the group had learned to value and account for the wider environment in which they were operating. They avoided a broken vase.", "In both these instances, reflection and open dialogue was critical to the recalibration of decision-making. Every day, facilitators helped the visiting groups process what they\u2019d experienced, teasing out the implications for their businesses\u2019 current and future operations. Through this highly structured process, the group was able to take advantage of their widened social context, notice their blind spots and reexamine the upstream influences and downstream impacts of their choices.", "These immersions were led by Leaders\u2019 Quest, an organization which specializes in delivering this kind of internal recalibration [disclosure: I have worked for them for nearly 5 years]. That said, there are plenty of instances of immersion causing people to recalibrate their decision making without professional guidance. Derek Black, the 13-year-old coder who designed the children\u2019s page of Stormfront, the Internet\u2019s first and largest white nationalist site, is the perfect example.", "Derek was home-schooled, raised almost entirely in the insular world of white supremacist ideology. He came from a notable lineage of white supremacists: (his father, Don Black is the founder of Stormfront and a KKK Grand Wizard; his godfather David Duke is also a KKK Grand Wizard), and Derek was heavily involved in the movement from an early age. Many expected him take over his father\u2019s and godfather\u2019s mantle as a leader in the community.", "These days, however, Derek works to educate people on the dangers of the movement he helped build, after having publicly disavowed it and left his community behind. He credits the shift to the weekly Shabbat dinner he began attending in college, hosted by an Orthodox Jewish classmate. At these dinners, Derek was challenged with new information by other guests and built relationships with individuals outside his usual context. Derek\u2019s context changed and, with the help of rigorous reflection over many patient conversations with the other dinner guests, so did his views.", "These stories reflect a phenomenon we\u2019ve all intuitively experienced, albeit not quite so dramatically. More often than not, widening our social context is a rather quotidian experience, one which has incremental effects: we experience widened contexts through vacation travel, or on the pages of our subway commute reading material \u2014 or, indeed, via the subway ride itself. (Though, in the case of my hometown NYC subway, that may be a little too much immersion for some\u2026).", "Ironically, the more we move up our professional ladder, acquiring scope and impact for our decision-making, the more our opportunities for widening our social context diminish. Sometimes this isolation is physical: the executive whose day is so managed that he or she travels directly from home, via private transportation, to the office and back, rarely encountering the world beyond the environments s/he knows and controls. The isolation can also be intellectual: with so many demands on senior decision-makers\u2019 time, it is an act of rebellion for them to engage in the kind of patient, non-transactional immersion described in the stories above. Far more common is the expectation that these leaders\u2019 every engagement be optimized for maximum utility.", "Such trade-offs are short-sighted. Ultimately, the investment we make in rooting out our bias pays dividends in the crises we\u2019ll avoid down the road.", "As we\u2019ve seen, immersion in different communities is an effective way of ensuring we have the most universal perspective possible. When paired with open, honest reflection, it can expose blindspots and lead to changes in how we make decisions. It\u2019s a process that looks something like this:", "Unfortunately, immersions like the ones described above are expensive and limited in their replicability. The good news is that operational structures and policies can reproduce some of the value of immersions. Diverse teams, multistakeholder governance and transparency are several such structures or policies.", "Diversity: The homogeneity of Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill presents a critical risk that blind spots will creep into tech products and governance solutions alike. Changing hiring practices and recruiting can help address those blind-spots, but that fix won\u2019t solve for all issues.", "To gather a wider cross-section of viewpoints, companies have begun dipping their toes in the water of soliciting input from the public or multidisciplinary commissions. It\u2019s the right intention, but the execution still has a few kinks yet to be worked out.", "Technologists and lawmakers alike would do well to look to examples of multistakeholder governance, an approach that not only brings the benefit of diversity but also functions with unique agility, transparency and inclusivity. While there is no single multistakeholder model, the success of this approach in governing technology, as well as other fields, has been proven repeatedly.", "Finally, providing transparency into decision-making processes is an important fail-safe. If Designers do not sufficiently root out internal biases, and if formal team structures do not provide the necessary diversity of thought, then transparency could enable a wider audience to probe Designers\u2019 decision-making, potentially catching biases. Already, efforts at increasing transparency are occurring, including research into \u2018explainable AI\u2019 (XAI), in which AI systems\u2019 decision making process is taken out of its usual black box (though many technologists debate XAI\u2019s usefulness). The same approach should be taken with governance and regulation: Designers need to provide transparency into what trade-offs were considered, and how they chose between them.", "There are many other levers that can enable bias catching. The key is to seek out methods that encourage multiple perspectives, empathy and relationship-based cooperation. Regardless of what methodology we employ, the overarching imperative remains: long before we ask our Designers to flex the precise, didactic language of coding, law or policy to design solutions, we need them to be fluent in the complexity, nuance and diversity of human experience. The path to that fluency is through addressing internal bias.", "If you\u2019re interested in reading more about human bias and AI, specifically the tools being developed to catch bias, check out Jennifer Sukis\u2019s fantastic piece here. Her example of Daryl Davis prompted my inclusion of the Derek Black story.", "Thank you to Stanford Global Digital Policy Incubator for the research on multistakeholder approaches and governance challenges.", "Your home for data science.
