They are an efficient sampling framework for recovering unbiased estimates of Causal Effects that would have been recovered from a full Cohort study, without actually conducting said Cohort study.", "Like nearly all methods in Causal Inference, Case-Control designs were initially developed within medical and public-health related fields; much of the language and nomenclature in these design paradigms reflect this fact. However, these are powerful methods that can (and more commonly are) leveraged in any domain interested in recovering unbiased estimates of Causal Effects in non-Randomized settings, with practitioners of interest including Statisticians, Data Scientists, and Machine Learning practitioners.", "Let\u2019s specify the following toy example. We would like to recover an unbiased estimate of the Causal Effect of binary intervention A on binary outcome Y in a non-randomized setting. The figure below shows a Causal DAG of our framework under the null of no Causal Effect of A on Y, but confounding by C. If this were a Cohort study, we could adjust for C using standard methods and recover an unbiased estimated of the Causal Effect of A on Y.", "However, suppose it\u2019s very expensive or time consuming to source data for every observation in this cohort? Rather we only want to source a small fraction of observations to use in our analysis. And what if the binary outcome Y is highly imbalanced, with Y=1 representing only a small percentage of the cohort population? Therefore, simply taking a marginal random sample over the entire cohort is not feasible. And unlike traditional Machine Learning where we are purely concerned with prediction, we can\u2019t just conveniently \u201cbalance\u201d our dataset in a way that optimizes our ability to predict the target; this could very much distort the empirical relationship between A and Y in a way that makes recovering the unbiased estimate of the Causal Effect of A on Y impossible.", "So, is there a valid method (or family of methods) we can leverage to sample our Cohort efficiently, conduct our analyses, and still recover unbiased estimates of Causal Effects we are interested in? The answer is yes. Using the family of Case-Control Designs, we include Cases and an efficiently sampled portion of Controls in our analysis; but we do so in a way that still allows us to unbiasedly estimate the Causal Effects of interest.", "As someone personally well trained in the use of these paradigms, I have found the educational materials and resources on these methods to be lacking as compared to other methods. There are also common misconceptions and areas of confusion around these methods. It is my objective this article helps alleviate these challenges.", "The contents of this article are as follows:", "For illustration purposes, let\u2019s specify a simplified toy-example. Let\u2019s say we have a binary intervention of interest A and a binary outcome of interest Y. In our toy example, there are 13 individuals in total in our cohort. All individuals start with outcome Y=0 at the beginning of their follow-up. Each individual is followed for a variable period of time, with a total of 3 individuals experiencing the outcome Y=1 by their end of follow-up. These 3 individuals are observations 7, 9, and 13, and are labeled with circles in the plot below. I have color-coded these 3 observations differently, which will become clear later.", "A few key point to keep in mind:", "With Incidence Density Sampling, we sample controls from the total pool of Person-Time within the study base that gave rise to the cases. An example of sampled controls is illustrated below, with sampled controls represented by the corresponding colored Xs. For each Case, we match two Controls. A plot of the three Cases and their corresponding six matched controls are shown in the table below.", "There are three key points to keep-in-mind with the Incidence Density Sampling scheme:", "We now have Cases, and we have Controls. We know we can compute the Case-Control Odds Ratio estimator:", "We can show mathematically that, in the case of leveraging Incidence Density Sampling, the Case-Control Odds Ratio estimator is an unbiased estimate of the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) we would have estimated had we performed a full cohort study. This is conditional on the assumption that the sampling fraction for sampling Controls is the same in both the intervention A=1 and A=0 population. This is the reason why Controls must be sampled independent of intervention status.", "A mathematical proof of the above statements is shown below:", "2.1.1: Note on the \u201cOdds Ratio\u201d in Case-Control Analyses", "A common misconception with regards to Case-Control Studies is the following:", "\u201cCase-Control Studies estimates the Odds Ratio, and the rare-outcome assumption is required to estimate the Risk Ratio\u201d", "As we have seen from our detailed walkthrough of Incidence Density Sampling, the above statement is (in general) incorrect. Much of the confusion stems from the poor language developed around Case-Control Study Designs.", "The Odds Ratio estimated from a Case-Control analysis is not the same empirical metric as the Odds Ratio estimated from a Cohort analysis. Algorithmically, it appears the same metric. However, with reference to Case-Control studies, the sampled \u201cControls\u201d are not really Controls. Rather the sampled \u201cControls\u201d were drawn from some underlying study-base randomly sampled independent of intervention status. This \u201cstudy-base\u201d may be the Person-Time at Risk, the total population of observations at risk, the total population of observations at risk who never developed the outcome prior to censoring, etc. The specification of the \u201cstudy-base\u201d changes the interpretation of the Odds Ratio that is empirically recovered from a Case-Control study.", "As we have seen above, a Case-Control analysis with Incidence Density Sampling recovers an empirical Odds Ratio that is an unbiased estimate of the Incidence Rate Ratio we would have estimated had we conducted the full cohort study. And note, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with the \u201crare-disease\u201d assumption.", "Note, that there is a sampling scheme (Cumulative Density Sampling) in which the Case-Control Odds Ratio estimator is an unbiased estimate of the Odds Ratio that would have estimated had we performed the full cohort study (see section 2.3).", "Let\u2019s move on to our next sampling scheme, Risk-Set Sampling", "Risk-Set Sampling is almost identical to Incidence Density Sampling, except the Controls are sampled with the corresponding Cases matched on Person-Time. Just as with Incidence Density Sampling, the Case-Control Odds Ratio estimate produced as result of Risk Set Sampling is also an unbiased estimate of the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) we would have estimated had we performed a full cohort study.", "In the event where length of Person-Time is a confounder of the intervention A and outcome Y casual relationship, and Person-Time needs to be adjusted for later in the analysis, it may be beneficial to use Risk Set Sampling instead of Incidence Density Sampling for statistical efficiency and positivity related reasons.", "Starting with the same toy example, again shown below is an example realization of this sampling scheme.", "Cumulative Incidence Sampling is the last sampling technique under the classical \u201cCase-Control\u201d banner. It\u2019s also (I believe) the simplest to understand.", "For each observation that doesn\u2019t become a case by the end of their follow-up monitoring, we randomly sample Controls from this population of observations. Note, that we are no longer matching on time (like in Risk Set Sampling) or randomly sampling Controls with weighted randomly sampling based on length of Person-Time (like in Incidence Density Sampling). Rather each observation in the cohort that is still Y=0 by their end of follow-up has an equal likelihood of being sampled as a control.", "Again, shown below is an example realization of this sampling scheme.", "With Cumulative Incidence Sampling, the Case-Control Odds Ratio estimator is an unbiased estimate of the actual Odds Ratio (OR) we would have estimated had we performed a full cohort study. This is again conditional on the assumption that the sampling fraction for sampling Controls is the same in both the intervention A=1 and A=0 populations.", "A mathematical proof of the above statements is shown below:", "The Case-Base Design shares certain similarities to the Case-Control design with Cumulative Density Sampling. The difference being:", "Therefore, with the Case-Base design, we sample from the underlying cohort of observations that gave rise to the Cases.", "Shown below is an example realization of this sampling scheme.", "With the Case-Base design, the Case-Control Odds Ratio estimator is an unbiased estimate of the Risk Ratio (RR) we would have estimated had we performed a full cohort study. This is again conditional on the assumption that the sampling fraction for sampling Controls is the same in both the intervention A=1 and A=0 population.", "A mathematical proof of the above statements is shown below:", "The Case-Cohort Design shares certain similarities with the Case-Control design with Risk-Set Sampling. In some ways, the Case-Cohort Design sampling scheme is more simple; though it requires a more complex statistical analysis than any other sampling scheme discussed in this paper.", "The steps for the Case-Cohort Design are as follows:", "Shown below is an example realization of this sampling scheme, where observations 2 through 10 were randomly sampled as the \u201csub-cohort\u201d.", "Some notes to keep in mind:", "Regardless of the sampling scheme used, in Case-Control Analyses it is common to conduct our sampling procedure and match Cases and Controls within levels of a confounder. In terms of the motivation for why this is done, a common misconception is the following:", "Note, the above statement is INCORRECT.", "The purpose of this matching is NOT to adjust for confounding (at least not at this step in the analysis). I believe much of this confusion stems from comparisons to matching in Cohort studies.", "In a Cohort study, matching intervention A=1 and non-intervention A=0 observations (with some specified matching rate) within levels of confounder C DOES produce a matched population where C is marginally independent of A. This, again in a Cohort study, sufficiently adjusts for the confounding by C. Assuming the conditions for causal inference are met (consistency, positivity, and exchangeability), within the matched population the empirical mean marginal effect of A on Y recovers an unbiased estimate of the mean causal effect of A on Y.", "Again, the above is the result of matching in a Cohort study. This is not the case in a Case-Control study.", "In a Case-Control study, when sampling controls we often match Cases and Controls within levels of confounder C. This does not adjust for confounding by C (at least not in this step of the analysis). Rather after matching, we still need to adjust for confounding by C, whether that be by using standard methods (conditioning), Propensity Score adjustment, Marginal Structural Modeling, G-Estimation, etc. The reason we match Cases and Controls within levels of C is for two important study design considerations:", "By matching Cases and Controls within levels of confounder C, we guarantee that we have at least some examples of observations of both Cases and Controls within each level of C, making it more likely we have the sufficient data we need for it be even possible to adjust for C later. This relates to the requirement of Positivity for Causal Inference.", "This can also be understood graphically by examining the causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) below. Note, that these example DAGs are drawn under the null hypothesis of no causal effect of intervention A on outcome Y (hence the lack of directed arrow from A to Y).", "In Figure 1 we start with the full cohort in question. We would like to estimate the causal effect of intervention A on outcome Y. We can see that variable C is a common cause of both A and Y. By the rules of d-separation, the path from A to C to Y is open, with C confounding the causal effect of A on Y.", "In Figure 2 we create our Case-Control population by taking all Cases (Y=1) and a sample of Controls, from some underlying study-base, matched on Cases within level of confounder C. Given the same ratio of Cases to Controls are matched within levels of C, in this matched population C is no longer a direct cause of outcome Y (hence the lack of arrow from C to Y).", "However, C directly informs our criteria S for selecting Controls as does the outcome status Y, hence the directed arrows C to S and Y to S. Note that S is collider between C and Y. Additionally, given we condition our Case-Control analysis to only our matched population, we condition on selection criteria S (hence the box around S). By d-separation, by conditioning on collider S we open the associational path from C to Y through S. Therefore, conditional on our sampling criteria S, the associational path from A to C to S to Y is still open, leaving variable C still confounding the causal effect of A on Y.", "This is the reason why matching our Cases and Controls within levels of confounder C does not in-itself adjust for the confounding by C of A on Y. We still need to adjust for C later.", "Finally, Figure 3 shows us adjusting for C using standard methods (conditioning) in our Case-Control population. Conditional on C the associational path from A to C to S is now closed. Hence if we estimate the mean conditional effect of A on Y conditional on C in the population matched on S, we will recover an unbiased estimate of the mean causal effect of A on Y.", "In an effort to solidify the above proofs and concepts, a computational simulation study was carried out. A simulated cohort of 1 million observations was specified as per the following DAG:", "In the simulated cohort, length of follow-up time was randomized to observations anywhere between 30 and 100 units. The objective is to recover an unbiased estimate of a relative causal effect of interest of A on Y. As per the DAG above, this can be achieved via standard methods of conditioning in an outcome model on C. Therefore, the conditional estimate of A on Y conditioned on C recovers an unbiased estimate of the Causal Effect of A and Y.", "Given we have access to the entire cohort in our simulation study, we have the benefit of recovering the true \u201cCohort based\u201d Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR), Rate Ratio (RR), and Odds Ratio (OR). In our simulation, we will implement each of the five Case-Control sampling approaches discussed in this article, and show how they produce very close estimates to their corresponding \u201cCohort\u201d estimates.", "From the simulation output above, we have the following results. We can see the Case-Control Odds Ratio estimates closely match the corresponding Cohort relative measures they are estimating.", "If you would like to learn more about Case-Control Analyses, particularly primary vs. secondary base, and Control selection considerations, I would strongly suggest reading the 3-part series by Wacholder et al.", "Selection of Controls in Case-Control Studies I: Principles", "Selection of Controls in Case-Control Studies II: Types of Controls", "Selection of Controls in Case-Control Studies III: Design Options", "Additionally, if you would like to learn more about methods and considerations for Causal Inference, I would suggest textbooks \u201cCausal Inference: What If\u201d by Miguel Hernan and Jamie Robins at Harvard (two of my former Professors), \u201cCausality\u201d by Judea Pearl at UCLA, and \u201cProbabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques\u201d by Daphne Killer at Stanford and Nir Friedman at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. These are all fantastic texts. I plan on writing more in-depth pieces on Causal Inference in the future.", "Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques", "I hope the above is insightful. As I\u2019ve mentioned in some of my previous pieces, it\u2019s my opinion not enough folks take the time to go through these types of exercises. For me, this type of theory-based insight leaves me more comfortable using methods in practice. A personal goal of mine is to encourage others in the field to take a similar approach.
