Understanding differences between\u2026 | by Hamza Kazmi | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Old vs New Drake Lyrics With AI", "description": "Understanding differences between Drake's old vs new songs using text classification and LSTM models"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Have Drake\u2019s lyrics changed over time? If so then how?", "I use machine learning to identify old Drake lyric from the new Drake lyric with 86% accuracy! This shows that there is a difference between old and new Drake song lyrics. Now let's find those differences and test what songs the model predicts as old and new Drake.", "This article is divided into 7 sections:", "1) Data exploration, cleaning and processing", "2) ML modelling using count vectorizer", "3) ML modelling using Tfidf vectorizer", "4) Parameter tuning on top models from 2 and 3", "5) Analyzing the top 40 features from models to find the difference between old and new Drake.", "6) Let's see the model in action by predicting singles and mixtape songs as old or new Drake.", "I gathered dataset for Drake lyrics using Genius API. I only include songs from his official albums. Therefore no singles and features", "The data did not need much wrangling. I just converted all text to lower and removed any characters outside of the alphabet and numbers.", "New drake songs are songs after 2014, and old drake songs are before 2014. Two reasons for these are:", "1) It is widely agreed that Drake\u2019s best projects are before 2014.", "2) 2014 is a good middle point and gives us a fairly balanced dataset for each class.", "I also perform random sampling and create a more balanced dataset. I will show results using both datasets.", "Here you can see drake album and songs distribution", "Next, I divide my dataset into training and testing where 80% is used for training and 20% for testing. Furthermore, I will also use K-fold validation for testing accuracy as it is more accurate for a smaller dataset such as this one.", "Now it is time to test models with count vectorizer. Count vectorizer counts the word frequencies in a text and creates an array with the word frequencies.", "Next, I create the following models for text classification:", "Note: I test models using both train/ test/ split and cross-validation. Below are cross-validation accuracies as they are more accurate for smaller datasets such as this one.", "I am not including code for these to save space. The code for them is available on my Github.", "Next, I repeat the same steps, but this time I use a TF-IDF vectorizer instead of Count vectorizer. TF-IDF does the same thing as count vectorizer but the value increases proportionally to count and is inversely proportional to the frequency of the word.", "The accuracies with TF-IDF vectorizer are:", "Alright, so now we know that Naive Bayes is performing best with count vectorizer, and Linear SVC performs best with the TF-IDF vectorizer. Now let us try to further optimize model parameters:", "Comparing accuracy before and after tunning on the same testing dataset.", "Remember accuracies in previous sections were cross-validation accuracies. Here I am comparing train test split accuracies on the same testing dataset to see direct comparison in performance on the same data.", "Overall the models trained on the balanced dataset perform slightly better. Later when I test against some more new data I noticed that models trained on the original dataset were slightly overfitted on old songs as they were predicting old songs perfectly but new song accuracy was not as good as that of models trained on the balanced dataset. The models trained on the balanced dataset had a slight decrease in old song prediction accuracy, likely due to some important old song features being left out by removing 30% of the dataset. Therefore in the future when Drake drops another album, I will retest it with more data.", "So now we have models with over 80% percent accuracies. This shows that there are features that help to successfully distinguish drake songs as new or old drake. Now let\u2019s find to features and understand what exactly makes new Drake different from old Drake.", "For this, I will be looking at the model coefficient values. Also, I am only analyzing the top models.", "As mentioned in code all credits go to Tobique for this method. This method is looking at the model coefficients and is then ordering them based on the most negative and most positive. It also maps the coefficients to the feature names which makes it easy for us to understand them. In our case, the most negative coefficients relate to old Drake song lyrics, and the most positive coefficients relate to new Drake song lyrics. Here are the top 40 features from two models:", "Old Drake Key Words: uh, bout, huh, money, dollar, car, ho, hoes, bitch, girl, love, she, her, you, loved, missing, low, brand, faded, dream, ball, crew.", "New Drake Key Words: yeah, ayy, woah, still, nah, momma, preach, pray, God, working, shift, dedicate, wifey, feel, lonely, babe, baby, six, side, crib.", "The first change to note is that old Drake uses phrases uh, bout, huh, ho commonly, whereas new Drake uses ayy, woah, nah instead.", "Old Drake talks more about love/relationships, women, materialistic things such as money/cars/brands, his crew (friends), and being faded (high).", "New Drake has moved past talking about women, relationships and materialistic as much and is now singing/rapping about a variety of different things including God/prayer, his mother, Toronto (a.k.a The six), working, and his feelings.", "Lastly, Drake has also changed the way he talks about women. In his older songs, he is using words b*tch, hoes and girl, whereas new Drake uses babe, baby, and wifey.", "Therefore, as Drake has matured as a person, his song lyrics have also matured. Furthermore, his new lyrics also seem to be more diverse and targeted at a bigger audience.", "Now, let\u2019s test the best models with some more songs. I gathered some more songs lyrics from his singles and newest mixtape Dark Lane Demo Tapes. The data I gathered includes 14 songs, 7 new and 7 old. Here you can see exactly what songs the model predicts correctly.", "On this dataset, both models Naive Bayes and Linear SVC got 12/14 correct predictions!!!", "Linear SVC thinks of Desires as an old Drake song, while the Naive Bayes model thinks of Trust Issues as a new Drake song. Do you think that Desires resembles old Drake and Trust Issues sounds like new Drake?", "Another interesting point to note is that both models predicted Chicago Freestyle as an old song when it is a new Drake song. Do you think that Chicago Freestyle sounds like old Drake?", "The project has been successful in identifying changes in Drake\u2019s old song style and new song style.", "Let me know if there are any songs you would like me to test.", "Lastly, for those interested, I also performed sequence analysis using LSTM to see if words used in particular sequences distinguish old from new Drake. For that, I further divided lyrics into 4462 rows of one-line sentences to see if there are any sequences in Drake\u2019s old and new lyrics. However, the LSTM model gave a 60% accuracy.", "Therefore, I do not think that there is much of a sequential relationship between old Drake and new Drake lyrics. The difference comes down to the use of words and not so much the sequence they are used in.", "Please feel free to leave any feedback and suggestions.", "My next project is to understand the difference between old and new rap songs. Stay tuned for that.", "Your home for data science.
