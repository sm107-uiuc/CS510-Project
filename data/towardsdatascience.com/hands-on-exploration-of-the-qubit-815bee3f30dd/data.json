A quantum system can be in a state of superposition. A popular notion of superposition is that the system is in different states concurrently unless you measure it.", "For instance, the spin of a particle is not up or down but it is up and down at the same time. But when you look at it, you find it either up or down.", "Or, let\u2019s say you flip a quantum coin. In the air, it has both values heads and tails. If and only if you catch it and look at it, it decides for a value. Once landed, it is a normal coin with heads up or tails up.", "Another notion of superposition is that the system is truly random and therefore distinguishes from the systems we know. Tossing a (normal) coin, for instance, seems random, because whenever you do it, the conditions are slightly different. And even tiny differences can change the outcome from heads to tails. The coin has a sensitive dependence to initial conditions.", "If we were able to measure all conditions precisely, we could tell the outcome. In classic mechanics, there is no randomness. Things in our everyday world, such as the coin, seem random. But they are not. If measured with infinite precision, randomness would disappear. By contrast, a quantum system is truly random.", "Maybe you wonder: Ok, it\u2019s random. Where\u2019s the big deal?", "The big thing is the consequences. In a classic system, a system sensitive dependent to initial conditions, the answer to a question is already determined before we ask it.", "Rather than watching the baseball match tonight, you spend the evening with your friends. When you return home, even though you don\u2019t know the results, the match is over and there is a definite result. There could be different results, but you simply don\u2019t know the result until you look at it.", "Contrarily, in a quantum system, the answer to a question is not determined up until the time you ask it. And since it is not determined yet, you still can change the probabilities of measuring distinct states.", "If you have doubts, good! Not even Einstein liked this notion. It led him to his famous statement of God does not play dice.", "Many physicists, including Einstein, proposed the quantum state, though hidden, to be a well-defined state. This is known as the hidden variable theory.", "There are statistically distinct behaviors between a system following the hidden variable theory and a quantum system following the superposition principle. And experiments showed that the quantum mechanical predictions were correct.", "For now, let\u2019s accept the quantum state is something different. Later in this book, we will have a closer look at it. And its consequences. But this requires a little more theory and math.", "We turn to the quantum computer. Let\u2019s say you have a quantum bit. We call it qubit. Unless you observe its value, it is in a superposition state of 0 and 1. Once you observe its value, you'll get 0 or 1.", "The chances of a qubit to result in either one value don\u2019t need to be 50:50. It can be 25:75, 67:33, or even 100:0. It can be any weighted probability distribution.", "The probability distribution a qubit has when observed depends on its state. The quantum state.", "In quantum mechanics, we use vectors to describe the quantum state. A popular way of representing quantum state vectors is the Dirac notation\u2019s \u201cket\u201d-construct that looks like |\u03c8\u27e9|\u03c8\u27e9. In Python, we don\u2019t have vectors. But we have arrays. Luckily, their structures are similar.", "Let\u2019s have a look. We start with the simplest case. Let\u2019s say, we have a qubit that, when observed, always has the value 0. If you argued this qubit must have the value 0 even before it is observed, you wouldn't be completely wrong. Yet, you'd be imprecise. Before it is observed, this qubit has the probability of 1 (=100%=100%) to have the value 0 when observed.", "These are the equivalent representations (ket, vector, array) of a qubit that always results in 0 when observed:", "Accordingly, the following representations depict a qubit that always results in 1 when observed:", "Ok, enough with the theory for now. Let\u2019s have a look at the code of such a qubit.", "You\u2019ll need a Python environment. And I\u2019ll recommend having a Jupyter Notebook running in a virtual environment. I\u2019ve put together a brief explanation of how to set up such an environment.", "Besides the general setup, we\u2019ll need two libraries: Qiskit and Matplotlib. Qiskit is IBM\u2019s Python SDK for quantum programming. Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python", "You can install both with pip:", "Install Qiskit in your home directory. Use --user to not depend on any special privileges (i.e. admin rights) during the installation.", "If you haven\u2019t configured your workstation yet, have a look at the brief explanation of how to set up the working environment (section \\ref{configuring-your-quantum-machine-learning-workstation}).", "Now, open the Jupyter notebook and test whether Qiskit works.", "If you get a response like this, Qiskit works. Great! We\u2019re ready to create our first qubit.", "The fundamental unit of Qiskit is the quantum circuit. A quantum circuit is a model for quantum computation. The program, if you will. Our circuit consists of a single one qubit (line 4).", "We define [0,1] as the initial_state of our qubit (line 7) and initialize the first and only qubit (at position 0 of the array) of our quantum circuit with it (line 10).", "Remember [0,1]? This is the equivalent to |1\u27e9=[0 1]. And in plain English, it is a qubit resulting in the value 1 when observed.", "This is it. It\u2019s now time to boot our quantum computer. In case you don\u2019t have one, no problem. We can simulate it. (In case you have one: \u201cCool, let me know\u201d).", "Qiskit provides the Aer package (that we import at line 1). It provides different backends for simulating quantum circuits. The most common backend is the statevector_simulator (line 4).", "The execute-function (that we import at line 1, too) runs our quantum circuit (qc) at the specified backend. It returns a job-object that has a useful method job.result(). This returns the result object once our program completes it.", "Let\u2019s have a look at our qubit in action.", "Qiskit uses Matplotlib to provide useful visualizations. A simple histogram will do. The result object provides the get_counts method to obtain the histogram data of an executed circuit (line 5).", "The method plot_histogram returns a Matplotlib figure that Jupyter draws automatically (line 8).", "We see we have a 100% chance of observing the value 1.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to a more advanced case. Say, we want our qubit to result in either 0 or 1 with the same probability (50:50).", "In quantum mechanics, there is the fundamental principle superposition. It says any two (or more) quantum states can be added together (\u201csuperposed\u201d) and the result will be another valid quantum state.", "Wait! We already know two quantum states, |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9. Why don\u2019t we add them? |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9 are vectors. Adding two vectors is straight forward.", "A vector is a geometric object that has a magnitude (or length) and a direction. Usually, they are represented by straight arrows, starting at one point on a coordinate axis and ending at a different point.", "You can add two vectors by placing one vector with its tail at the other vector\u2019s head. The straight line between the yet unconnected tail and the yet unconnected tail is the sum of both vectors. Have a look at the following figure.", "The sum of u and v is:", "Accordingly, our superposed state should be \u03c8\u2217:\u2217\u03c8 (\u201cpsi\u201d) is a common symbol used for the state of a quantum system.", "We have a computer in our hands. Why don\u2019t we try it?", "It didn\u2019t quite work. It tells us: QiskitError: 'Sum of amplitudes-squared does not equal one.'.", "The amplitudes are the values in our array. They are proportional to probabilities. And all the probabilities should add up to exactly 1 (100%). We need to add weights to the quantum states |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9. Let\u2019s call them \u03b1 and \u03b2.", "Amplitudes are proportional to probabilities. We need to normalize them so that:", "If both states |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9 should have the same weight, then \u03b1=\u03b2. And therefore, we can solve our equation to \u03b1:", "And we insert the value for both \u03b1 and \u03b2 (both are equal). Let\u2019s try this quantum state:", "Phew. In this post, we introduced quite a few terms and equations just to scratch on the surface of quantum mechanics. But the actual source code is pretty neat, isn\u2019t it?", "We introduced the notion of the quantum state. In particular, the state of a binary quantum system. The quantum bit or qubit.", "Until we observe a qubit, it is in superposition. Contrary to a classical bit that can be either 0 or 1, a qubit is in a superposition of both states. But once you observe it, there are distinct probabilities of measuring 0 or 1.", "This means that multiple measurements made on multiple qubits in identical states will not always give the same result.
