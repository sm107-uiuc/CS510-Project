Writing software, of course. But that wasn\u2019t always the case.", "Back in the days, each application had its own server. And as each server has a finite amount of resources, developers constantly had to think about not overloading the server\u2019s capacities. If an application was needed to run from a different server, the whole thing had to be set up again.", "Enterprises soon realized that this was rather inefficient: on the one hand, developers weren\u2019t happy because they had to worry about other things than their code. On the other hand, plenty of compute resources were going unused whenever an application didn\u2019t take up 100 percent of the server\u2019s capacity.", "Fast-forward to today: when was the last time you worried about some server architecture? Probably a while back.", "That doesn\u2019t mean that we gotten rid of all considerations regarding memory, RAM, storage, and so on. Even though developers are getting liberated of such issues more and more, the process is far from over.", "As of now, we\u2019re not at the end of the road of virtualization and never worrying about servers again. And it\u2019s not clear yet which technology will be the winner of it all. Will it be virtual machines? Containers? Or serverless computing? It\u2019s an ongoing debate, and one that is worth studying in detail.", "Enter the 1960s, when virtual machines (VMs) were first invented. Instead of using bare-metal servers for one single application at a time, people started thinking about spinning up multiple operating systems (OS) on one server. This would allow multiple applications to run separately, each on its own OS.", "At IBM and other companies, they achieved just that: they emulate the physical server, i.e., they make virtual representations of it. A so-called hypervisor is in charge of allocating compute resources to the VMs and making sure that the VMs don\u2019t interfere with one another.", "Not only are compute resources of one server used more efficiently this way. You can also run an application on many different servers without having to reconfigure it each time. And if a server doesn\u2019t have a VM with the right OS, you can just clone another VM.", "In addition to all that, VMs can make servers more secure because you can scan them for malicious software. If you find some, you can just restore the VM in an earlier version, which essentially erases the malware.", "With these advantages in mind, it\u2019s no wonder that VMs dominate the space, and bare-metal applications are pretty rare. Linux and Ubuntu are often-seen guests in many VMs. Java and Python run on stripped-down versions of VMs, which enables developers to execute their code on any machine.", "A virtual machine emulates the hardware it runs on. In contrast, a container just emulates an OS, usually Linux. That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t contain a virtual copy of the hardware it\u2019s running on.", "Like VMs, containers can\u2019t go without an OS, an application and its libraries and dependencies. But letting go of the hardware emulation results in the fact that containers are even more lightweight, fast, and portable. That\u2019s why containers only take seconds to start, while VMs usually need a few minutes.", "On the other hand, containers aren\u2019t always as secure as VMs. If malevolent software gets onto a containerized system and makes it through to the OS, it can potentially hijack the whole machine.", "In contrast, VMs keep different operating systems separate from one another. So even if malware gets through to the OS of a VM, all other VMs on the machine remain untouched from the attack. This adds an extra level of security that can be crucial when dealing with confidential data, for example.", "Another advantage of VMs over containers is that you can use different operating systems. This is more work, of course, because you might need to implement bug fixes on each OS separately. But if you have an application that ought to run on anything else than Linux, containers aren\u2019t the way to go.", "On the other hand, containers are great for anything with a microservice architecture, i.e., where a single application is composed of many smaller services that are only loosely coupled and can be executed independently. Each individual service can be put in its own container. Then, the only thing that developers need to watch out for is that the containers communicate properly among each other.", "There\u2019s one technology that\u2019s synonymous with container engines: Docker. But there\u2019s another technology that\u2019s often mentioned in the same sentence: Kubernetes. So what\u2019s going on \u2014 are Docker and Kubernetes friends or foes?", "As Microsoft puts it, comparing Docker and Kubernetes is a bit like comparing apples to apple pie. Docker is a file format for containers and open-source technology to run applications from anywhere. Kubernetes coordinates and schedules many containers, and ensures that they communicate properly with each other.", "Docker has its own container orchestration service, Docker Swarm. Here, however, the winner is clear: Kubernetes is way more extensive than Docker Swarm. Kubernetes can run across an entire cluster of machines, whereas Docker Swarm runs on a single node only.", "So unless you\u2019re deploying containers on a single node, or otherwise have no need for the sophistication that Kubernetes brings, there\u2019s no need to give Docker Swarm a second thought. If you think container orchestration, think Kubernetes.", "On top of managing containers, Kubernetes allows you to orchestrate a cluster of VMs \u2014 yes, VMs \u2014 and schedule containers to run on seletcted VMs, based on the available compute resources and the requirements of each container.", "You heard that right: VMs, Docker, and Kubernetes in one workflow. So far, this sounds less like a battle and more like a symphony. But wait, because there\u2019s one more to come.", "If VMs took physical hardware off a developer\u2019s plate, and containers stripped away any worries about operating systems (I\u2019m talking containers like Docker plus optionally Kubernetes), serverless takes this journey another leap forward.", "You can see this visualized in the figure below: With serverless, developers don\u2019t even have to worry about when and how their application gets executed, which containers they ought to put it in, or how many compute resources it will consume. They still need to write the applications, of course, but after they\u2019ve uploaded it to their AWS Lambda, Aurora, or CloudFront service, they can call it a day.", "Their code will then lie dormant until it gets executed. You only pay for the machine-time that you really used, which makes the whole thing pretty economic. In contrast, you need to pay a monthly fee for Docker, and a per-cluster-per-hour fee for Kubernetes, regardless of how much you use it.", "That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that serverless is king. It\u2019s a fairly new technology, and at the moments there still are limits wherever you go.", "For example, at the moment it\u2019s quite difficult to pull off A/B testing on serverless, or make other sophisticated deployment options work. Also, serverless needs some time to get code initialized. So if you need your application to be very fast, you should use containers instead.", "In addition, serverless comes with restrictions regarding compute resources. So if you have a task that takes rather a lot of RAM or runs for a long time, you\u2019d be better off using containers.", "All these limitations to serverless aren\u2019t innate, so we can expect serverless to win more ground over containers in the years to come. It\u2019s also gaining traction because it\u2019s more beginner-friendly than container orchestrations, scales very easily and is very flexible and cost-effective regarding workloads.", "It\u2019s therefore no wonder that the serverless architecture market is projected to triple in the next few years, grossing more than $21 billion by 2025. But that doesn\u2019t mean that VMs and containers will die out.", "It\u2019s quite unlikely that we\u2019ll only see serverless technologies in a decade or so. Just look at VMs, which have been around for half a century and are still very much in use. Instead, we\u2019re quite likely going to see more symbioses of containers with serverless, just like containers and VMs work pretty well together. Services like AWS Fargate let you combine containers with serverless pretty seamlessly already.", "All these solutions \u2014 VMs, containers, and serverless \u2014 are good solutions and come with their specific strengths and weaknesses. Even though they\u2019re sometimes competing on overlapping spaces, the good news is that you can mix-and-match them to suit your needs.", "Big tech\u2019s journey with virtualization is far from over. Except for increasing developer efficiency, we don\u2019t even know what the destination will look like. But all the signs speak for an interesting, fascinating, and quite lucrative path looking forward.", "For all we know, serverless might not be the last step. Who knows, really, what technologies we\u2019ll be playing with in the future?", "Your home for data science.
