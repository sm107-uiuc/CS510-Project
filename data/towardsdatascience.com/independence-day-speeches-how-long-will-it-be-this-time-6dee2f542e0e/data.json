For obvious reasons.", "And that question led me to another question \u2014 \u201cKnowing that it will be different, what will the Prime Minister say this time?\u201d", "That is the one thing that nearly a billion people around the country would be eagerly waiting to hear.", "Because this year we have faced odds and seen tragedy on a scale never seen before in the recent past. And so, the words of the Prime Minister should reflect the sentiment of a nation, slowly getting back on its feet.", "But I have another question \u2014", "How long would would he speak this time?", "In other words, how long would the traditional independence day speech be, this time around?", "Historically, on the Independence Day, Prime Ministers in the past have spoken at length about the various schemes their governments had initiated, the achievements, the troubles and the road ahead.", "I thought this would be a good opportunity to revisit the past, peek into the speeches of yore and perhaps, predict how long the speech would be, this year.", "I am relegating the code snippets to the end of this post because (surprise, surprise) data visualisation first!!", "You can find the entire project on my GitHub repository.", "I browsed the public webpage of the PMO archives and downloaded the independence day speeches of the current and the last 2 Prime Ministers, all the way back to 1999. India has had the following Prime Ministers in the recent past \u2014", "A word of caution \u2014 these downloaded texts are the English rendering of the speeches that were spoken in Hindi at the time.", "I used the Natural Language Processing library, NLTK, to -", "In the end I was left with a set of 21 speeches that contained only the essential content written in them.", "Over the last 21 years, the top words spoken in the Independence Day speeches were, quite obviously, \u2018Country\u2019, \u2018Government\u2019, \u2018Year\u2019, \u2018Today\u2019, \u2018India\u2019, \u2018World\u2019, \u2018Brother\u2019 and \u2018Sister\u2019.", "It is interesting to see that these words were used very frequently in the last few years by the incumbent Prime Minister, Shri. Narendra Modi as compared to his predecessors. On the other hand, \u2018India\u2019 has been almost equally mentioned by all the Prime Ministers (which is expected).", "In his 5 years as a Prime Minister, Shri. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who is popularly called as the True Statesman of Modern India, reflected this moniker in his speeches. It can be seen that words like \u2018World\u2019, \u2018New\u2019, \u2018State\u2019, \u2018Nation\u2019 was frequently used in his Independence Day speeches.", "The academic and economist Prime Minister who led India from 2004 to 2013 spoke at length about \u2018Development\u2019, \u2018Education\u2019, \u2018Work\u2019 etc. in his Independence Day speeches.", "The current Prime Minister who got elected for a second term recently, stressed on the benefits for the \u2018Poor\u2019, the \u2018Farmer\u2019, \u2018One\u2019, \u2018Crore\u2019 and the Indian \u2018Dream\u2019 in his speeches on Independence Days in the past.", "Looking at the duration and text length of the speeches, it was surprising to see that Vajpayee\u2019s speeches were the shortest in duration and length and Modi\u2019s speeches were the longest yet.", "Over the past 21 years the speeches have become steadily longer, with a massive jump seen after Modi got elected. There was a noticeable drop in speech length in 2017. According to this article, the Prime Minister had received letters complaining of his long speech the previous year (2016) and so that prompted him to keep it crisp and short!", "But that was only for that year, because the next two years saw the speeches become lengthier again.", "Having seen the length of speeches in the past, I thought of using a simple Auto-regressive (AR) model to predict this year\u2019s speech length.", "It seems to me that these Independence Day speeches seem to be carefully written and controlled and also look towards history to make sure that things stay true to tradition (at least they did till 2013).", "At the most, the speech length this year, might depend on the speech length last year (as evidenced by the anecdote I wrote earlier) and so a lag of 1 should be good enough for the AR model. Also, since this is a non-stationary time-series, I differenced it once to make it stationary before fitting the model.", "To test this simple model, I trained it on successive year\u2019s speech lengths beginning from 2010 and carried out a rolling forecast. The output for the years 2011 to 2019 are shown below.", "So the model shows large error in 2014 when the new PM was elected and his speech was longer than his predecessor! Since then, this simple model has shown error in 2017 and 2018 because \u2014 It is just an Auto-Regressive model for God\u2019s Sake!! It just depends on it\u2019s previous year\u2019s value to predict the next year\u2019s value.", "Anyway, the model appears to have a an error of +- 23 minutes and the prediction for this year, 2020, is", "So it would seem that the Prime Minister might speak for a maximum of about 120 minutes and a minimum of about 70 minutes, this Independence Day!", "Update \u2014 The PM spoke for 86 minutes this year, which is well within the prediction error!", "Here I present snippets of the code I wrote to generate the data visualisations and text cleaning.", "A function to clean and preprocess the text \u2014", "A function to read-in the text from the local directory and clean it with the previous function \u2014", "Here is the code snippet to separate the nouns \u2014", "And here is how you can plot the heat map \u2014", "Here is a function to generate a wordcloud using the nifty wordcloud library \u2014", "To plot the time series, you can write this piece of code \u2014", "To make a rolling forecast and check the prediction error you write this simple snippet of code (Thanks to Jason Brownlee at www.machinelearningmastery.com !)\u2014", "Your home for data science.
