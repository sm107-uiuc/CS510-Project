When evaluating skills in the operating room, assessments typically rely on expert surgeons who score a resident\u2019s technical performance. Surgical evaluations of this kind can do better, and there are clear reasons why:", "Conventional assessments are slow, heavily subjective, and limited by the number of expert surgeons.", "Operating rooms of the future will be different. Equipped with robot-assisted surgical systems, trainers and trainees gain access to troves of digitized procedural data \u2014 setting the stage for a new generation of analytics to support effective, objective, and well-timed operative feedback.", "In this article, we demonstrate an application of deep learning in the delivery of fast and accurate surgical skill evaluations.", "The JIGSAWS dataset originated from a collaboration between Johns-Hopkins University and Intuitive Surgical, a pioneer in the design and manufacture of robotic systems. To date, it is the only publicly available dataset on minimally invasive robotic surgery.", "We use the Kinematic Motion Sensors (76 in total) as our input variables, each a series of motion data collected from eight surgeons with varying surgical experience. Every surgeon performs three surgical tasks \u2014 Knot-tying, Needle-passing, and Suturing \u2014 repeating each task 5 times.", "We use Skill Level as our target variable. Skill levels are reflected as self-reported labels based on the number of practice hours by the trainee. An expert is one who reports more than 100 hours, an intermediate is one between 10\u2013100 hours, and a novice is one below 10 hours of total surgical robotic operation time.", "Our experiment attempts to solve a classification problem using only the motion data. The process involves manipulating the motion data into a multivariate time-series, which is used to output expert (E), intermediate (I), or novice (N) labels, depending on the level of skill exhibited in the data.", "JIGSAWS provides an extensive directory of files \u2014 a lot of which we don\u2019t need for this tutorial (i.e. video data, experimental data). To simplify our navigation, let\u2019s create a separate directory by copying only the text files containing kinematic motion and skill levels (meta_files):", "For the Python code to read in multiple text files from multiple folders, see the notebook.", "At this point, we\u2019d like to merge the labels that are contained in the meta_files to their respective surgeon. For example, we need to identify surgeons \u201cKnot_Tying B\u201d as N, \u201cKnot_Tying C\u201d as I, and \u201cKnot_Tying D\u201d as E. We apply a custom function,merge_labels() to simplify this procedure:", "Each time-series has a typical length of between 1 and 5 minutes. With 8 surgeons and 5 trials per surgeon per procedure, the JIGSAWS dataset contains only 40 independent samples for training each surgical task\u2019s model. To overcome the training limitation, we follow a two-step data augmentation procedure used in this paper by Wang et al:", "This data augmentation procedure on the original dataset enables the model to be fed 8754, 6052, and 4134 crops for Suturing, Needle-passing, and Knot-tying, respectively. All in all, a much more defensible number of inputs for training our recurrent neural network!", "For more on data augmentation, Wang et. al\u2019s manuscript inspired our strategy.", "Before we are ready to turn our attention to model building, we need to prepare our data in a format appropriate for Keras. You can dig in further in the notebook if you like, but for brevity, here are the main ideas:", "For more on how recurrent neural networks (RNN) work , Andrew Karpathy\u2019s post of RNN computation and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a great read.", "We use the Keras Sequential model type to build a recurrent neural network, which allows building layer by layer. We choose 3 different architectures to train a separate model for each surgical task, making 9 RNNs for comparison. While there are more sophisticated ways to structure the RNN than those shown below, the single-layer LSTM set-up to work well. Here are the layers used for each architecture:", "The LSTM RNN outperforms both the shallow and deep RNNs. This makes intuitive sense, because LSTM uses a more powerful update equation that is better equipped to capture information from long sequences of input.", "The highest accuracies from related works reach up to 99% using feature fusion techniques. LSTM seems to perform just as well as those methods without overfitting (the learning curves are shown in the notebook). Now, in writing this, I have learned that the F1 score is often a better measure than Accuracy for classification problems, especially when the cost associated with false positives is greater than the cost of false negatives (or vice versa). Our results are only given using the Accuracy measure, so it would be worth comparing F1 in a repeat experiment.", "In this article, we show an approach to modeling motion time-series data with recurrent networks. We find strong support that the LSTM can be an effective tool for conducting operative skill evaluations.", "As the attention of operating rooms turn to robot-assisted surgical systems, the need to operationalize the data from these platforms will become the focus. Skill prediction represents an exciting new direction for health worker training, but by itself, is not impactful without significant investment in hospital staff to deepen their knowledge on (1) what machine learning can do, and (2) what actions to take once predictions are made. Equipped with knowledge of skill level, how might we help the surgeon reach or surpass the benchmark score? For patients, how do we ensure that the highest standards of safety and quality are upheld in light of new digital capabilities?", "The next era of surgery will require excellence in data science and development, but also in change management and implementation.", "The source code/notebook related to this post can be found at https://github.com/teamlu/roboticsurgery.", "Your home for data science.
