You can talk inputs and outputs all at once\u2026 and you understand the difference. My advice may surprise you: resist temptation! Just don\u2019t talk about inputs yet. Seriously. I know you can, but don\u2019t. Here are two reasons of many.", "This is the obvious one. Some of your stakeholders are not as fluent as you and they get confused easily. In the early days, you might be pitching your idea to them in the hopes of securing resources for your project and you really don\u2019t want them to misunderstand why your system is worth having. Don\u2019t confuse them! Stay focused.

You stop questioning the point of working on y in the first place and end up building things that don\u2019t need to be built.", "Let\u2019s imagine that automating the Y/N labelling of teas is the use case you\u2019re going for.

Analytics (a.k.a. data-mining) is a great idea for every project, whereasML/AI is only for projects where the goal is to use data to automate thing-labeling. Although the underlying math is often the same, the processes are very different. Data-mining is all about maximizing the speed of discovery, while ML/AI is all about performance in automation. In data-mining, there\u2019s only one mistake your team can make, whereas ML/AI has an impressive list of potential kablooies. Sign up for those headaches only when you have a use case that\u2019s worth the bother.", "Who is your dazzling invention for? Who benefits?

Have I thought about usability for indirect beneficiaries, for society-as-a-whole, for other businesses, for machine systems using the output as input, for engineers engaged in debugging, and so on? To avoid shoddy UX design, please take the time to think about all your myriad user categories before you proceed. User doesn\u2019t just mean customer or end user in the most obvious sense.", "What if your idea isn\u2019t uniformly beneficial to everyone? While mapping out your ideal use cases, consider those who might be harmed by the existence of your system. I don\u2019t just mean competitors in your industry. Can any humans be harmed by your application? This is especially important if your technology scales to millions or billions.", "Think about the humans your creation impacts! Who benefits and who might be harmed?", "If you care about developing technology in an ethical and responsible manner, it\u2019s your duty to think about all the people your creation could affect. Thinking about them after you\u2019ve built it is irresponsible. The time for it is now! An ethicist can help you shoulder some of the burden. Bringing them on board as an advisor is a great idea if your project has the potential to strongly affect human wellbeing. Along with your UX specialist, their participation in the project will help you ensure that groups affected by your creation are given a voice.", "Once you can clearly articulate what labels you\u2019re after, it\u2019s time for a quick reality check: do you have data about this business problem?", "No access to data means no point in proceeding.

This is just a quick overview of questions for identifying a nonstarter.", "Once you\u2019ve cleared the reality checklist, it\u2019s time to start recruiting, which you can do in parallel with wading through the rest of this guide. My advice on the roles you\u2019re looking for is here.", "The next bit can get a bit tricky if you\u2019re new to it. You\u2019re in charge of deciding how much each kind of outcome is worth. Is the disgusting cup of tea that got a Y twice as bad as the delicious one we missed out on? 3.4823 times? Up to you!", "Struggling? Grab someone who likes numbers and have them help you brainstorm. Qualitative experts are specially trained for this, but your standard calculator-slinger will do in a pinch. If you want the best helper, utter the formal jargon for it (eliciting indifference curves) out loud in a pentagram to summon an economist.", "Economists make surprisingly useful advisors for AI projects.", "Now that you\u2019ve figured out how to trade off various results on one single output, it\u2019s time to think about how you\u2019d like to score a few thousand of them at once. Using the average is an average choice, but you needn\u2019t be average. Again, decision-maker is boss here. The right way to score it depends on what\u2019s right for your business.", "Tricky, complex projects benefit tremendously from simulation. That\u2019s where an analyst specializing in generating fake but plausible data can help you see the potential consequences of the choices you\u2019re making in this article.", "A dress rehearsal helps opening night go smoothly.", "Simulation gives you a dress rehearsal, which helps you get a bunch of kinks ironed out before you have to start your project for-realsies. Like analytics, it takes some of the burden off the decision-maker\u2019s mandate to meditate hard and think of everything.", "There are many different ways to make a metric. In our tea example, you could go for the really simple one: accuracy a.k.a. \u201cDon\u2019t be wrong.\u201d Every mistake is equally bad (0), every correct response is equally good (1), then you take an average (which you\u2019ve been itching to take \u2014 someone needs to put a central limit on how appealing people find averages).", "Hang on, maybe instead you have FOMO when it comes to good teas and you\u2019re quite happy to have duds along the way? Well, that\u2019s a different metric called recall. Or maybe you don\u2019t want to have your time wasted and you need to be sure that when the system says Yummy it\u2019ll really be worth drinking, but you\u2019re okay with missing out on tasty teas. That\u2019s an entirely different metric called precision. We\u2019ll slow down and deep-dive on metrics in another post. For now, nevermind what they\u2019re called, just make one up that reflects what\u2019s right for your business.", "Need help? Has your economist wandered off already? No problem! Perhaps you have a friend who loves designing games? Games geeks have unknowingly been training for this their entire lives! If you don\u2019t hang with that crowd, you can call your qualitative expert instead, since it\u2019s their job to help decision-makers clarify their thoughts on this kind of thing.", "In applications where human wellbeing is substantially on the line, seek a consultation with a panel of experts to verify that it isn\u2019t possible to get a high score on your metric in some perverse and harmful way.", "Which experts? Have you heard the one where a decision-maker, an ethicist, an AI control theorist, a statistician, a user experience researcher, a behavioral economist, a domain expert, and a reliability engineer walk into a bar\u2026?", "Sure, this can be overkill on benign business applications, so your qualitative expert\u2019s introductory-level familiarity with each of these disciplines has you covered and your game designer friend\u2019s instincts are also tapping into a similar vein.", "When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll hear an angelic chorus. You\u2019ve created your business performance metric!", "This is not the same thing as a loss function (we\u2019ll talk about those later). When it comes to metrics, the possibilities are endless and it is up to the decision-maker to figure out what\u2019s actually important. In case you\u2019re feeling anxious about tackling this, I\u2019m brewing a few more articles to help you master metric development.", "Here\u2019s a nuanced thing you can skip until we dig into it in a later post, but if you know what a loss function is then you\u2019ll realize we\u2019ll have two metrics in play. If that means nothing to you, let\u2019s not worry about it for now, your job here is only to ensure your ML/AI experts read the next paragraph. Many of them missed this lesson in school.

Maybe an Olympian is stronger than your average Joe, but having such a strict hiring bar might leave you with no workers at all. Lower your standards to where they make good business sense, but no lower. Setting the testing bar at your bare minimum is incentive-compatible, as economists might say.
