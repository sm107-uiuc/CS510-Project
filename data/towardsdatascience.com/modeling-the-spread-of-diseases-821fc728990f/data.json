The first is quite obvious: this article is intended for informational purposes only and does not provide any medical advice nor it is a substitute for professional medical treatment. The second one is that, as a habit of mine, I have chosen to use hand-drawn formulas since I find it rather annoying using latex on Medium. I apologize in advance for the calligraphy.", "In epidemiology, there is a family of mathematical techniques, called compartmental models, used for the modelling of infectious disease. In these models, as the name suggests, population is divided into separate groups, with the assumption that individuals in same compartments share the same characteristics.", "Let\u2019s consider the SIR model, which is one of the simplest ones. In this model, population is divided into three groups: the susceptible individuals, S, the infected individuals, I, and the recovered individuals, R. It should be noted that here the term \u201crecovered\u201d indicates individuals that may have healed and developed an immunity or may have died, but in any case, they can no longer be infected.", "The SIR model relies on a few but important assumptions.", "Before defining the model we need to introduce two basic epidemiological quantities:", "The ratio between the infection rate and the recovery rate gives us another fundamental measure, the basic reproduction number R\u2080:", "The basic reproduction number represents the reproductive ratio of the disease and is the expected number of cases directly generated by an infected individual in a population of susceptible individuals.", "When well-estimated, it is a very important number as it makes the difference between a self-extinguishing disease (R\u2080<1), an endemic disease (R\u2080=1) and an epidemy (R\u2080>1).", "In order to start the modeling, let define the set of variables.", "Given the model assumptions, the following equation holds:", "To generalize the model, and simplify the calculations as well, we will consider from now on the fractions of each group with respect to the population:", "Given the above assumptions, how should these quantities change in time?", "The number of susceptibles decreases as people contract the disease, so the change must be negative. A single (infected) individual infects \u03b2 (susceptible) individuals per time unit, so the total fraction of infected persons in the time unit is equal to:", "On the other hand, if a fraction of \ud835\udefe infected individuals recovers in the unit time, the total fraction of recovered individuals in the unit time is:", "Now, using the correct signs, we can write the differentials equations of the model:", "They reflect the assumption of the model: no one becomes susceptible again, susceptibles can become infected, and all infected individuals, eventually, recover (or die), without further options.", "Time to run the model. I have been trying to find the parameters known about the COVID-19 virus so far. According to [1], the median time for recovery is approximately 2 weeks, and therefore \u03b2=1/14. Another source [2] estimates the basic reproduction number being R\u2080=2.28, from which we can deduce that \ud835\udefe=0.16. Finally, despite some statements claim the contrary, the most accepted hypothesis is still that an individual, once infected, acquires immunity against the virus.", "To integrate the equations of the model I have used the odeint function of scipy. By the way, [3] provides a nice example for coding a SIR model. I have assumed an initial number of infected people equal to 0.1%.", "According to this model, and without any intervention to contain the spread, the virus would be extinguished in about 180 days, saving less than 20% of the population.", "SIR model is of course a very simple model, not suitable for shaping complex dynamics, especially those which involve large and different populations. Still, it could hold for small and homogeneous populations, where it is easier to respect the assumptions underlying the model (for instance, the outbreak occurred on cruise ship Diamond Princess).", "How can the measures ordered by the authorities contain the spread of the virus? The isolation and quarantine measures, recently implemented also in some European areas, are obviously aimed at limiting the possibility of infection as much as possible. In our model this is reflected in a sudden decrease of the factor \u03b2.", "As a matter of fact, by reacting promptly with a drastic lowering of beta factor an immediate reduction in the number of infected people is achieved, which thus tends asymptotically to zero.", "Your home for data science.
