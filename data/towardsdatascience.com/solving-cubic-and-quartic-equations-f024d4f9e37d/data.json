Quadratic equations are second-order polynomial equations involving only one variable. However, the problems of solving cubic and quartic equations are not taught in school even though they require only basic mathematical techniques. In this article, I will show how to derive the solutions to these two types of polynomial equations. Exact solutions (or roots of the polynomial) can be found using methods of algebra or trigonometry (this article, however, will be restricted to algebraic methods only).", "I will start by providing a quick overview of the history of the subject.", "Cubic equations have been studied for centuries, since the ancient Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, and Egyptians (for more details see the Wiki article). The oldest cubic equation to be studied was the algebraic version of the famous geometric problem of doubling the cube, the so-called Delian problem (which in algebraic terms is equivalent to solving the equation x\u00b3=2).", "Several renowned mathematicians solved special cases of cubic equations, but a general solution was found only in the 1500s. This solution was first published by the Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano in his important algebra book, Ars Magna (1545). A version of the book in Latin can be found here.", "However, Cardano was not the original discoverer of this result. The first to find the solution to the cubic equation was the Italian Renaissance mathematician Scipione del Ferro. Del Ferro passed on his formula to his student, the mathematician Antonio Fiore (when he was on his deathbed).", "The Italian mathematician and engineer Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia also discovered the solution (independently). Later he was convinced by Cardano to disclose his secret (the solution), on the condition that Cardano vowed never to publish it. However, when Cardano learned that del Ferro had independently found the solution before Tartaglia, he decided to include it in his Ars Magna (though Cardano credited both Tartaglia and del Ferro for the original discovery, Tartaglia wasn\u2019t pleased about his secret being revealed!).", "However, Cardano noticed that Tartaglia\u2019s solution sometimes involved what we now call complex numbers, so he did not really recognize the full implications of the result. The Italian mathematician Rafael Bombelli later studied this issue in detail. For this reason, Bombelli is regarded by many as the discoverer of complex numbers.", "The quartic equation was solved in 1540 by the mathematician Ludovico Ferrari. However, as we shall see, the solution of quartic equations requires that of cubic equations. Hence, it was published only later, in Cardano\u2019s Ars Magna.", "We will now show how to find the solutions. Let us start with cubic equations since they are needed to solve the quartics.", "Our aim is to show how to solve the following cubic equation:", "This equation is called a depressed cubic. Though they are simpler than the general cubic equations (which have a quadratic term), any cubic equation can be reduced to a depressed cubic (via a change of variables).", "The left-hand side of Eq. 1 is an example of a polynomial function p(z), which is an expression involving a sum of powers of variables multiplied by coefficients. Eq. 1 is the polynomial equation corresponding to the polynomial function p(z). As mentioned before, the zeroes of the equation are called roots.", "To find z in Eq. 1, we first choose two auxiliary variables u and v such that u + v = z, and substitute this expression in Eq. 1. A convenient grouping of the terms gives:", "Now, u and v can have any values, as long as their sum is z. The most obvious choices for u and v here should obey", "since, with this choice, the middle term in Eq. 2 vanishes. We obtain a system of two equations:", "Eq. 6 represents the solutions of a quadratic equation. The variables z and w are then equal to:", "Using u + v = z, we obtain the solutions we are looking for:", "Recall that this solution assumes Eq. 3 to be obeyed. Let us now see how to solve quartic polynomials.", "The strategy that will be followed here is to obtain the solutions of the quartic equation in terms of the solutions of the cubic equation (which we know how to solve). This approach was developed by Leonhard Euler, one of the greatest mathematicians in history. Since the quartic equation without the x\u00b3 term, known as the reduced quartic equation, can be obtained from a general quartic equation using only a trivial change of variables, we need only to solve the former (the reduced equation).", "Following Euler, our goal is to prove that the reduced quartic equation", "provided the three \u03b8s are zeroes of the following cubic polynomial:", "As mentioned before, this equation can be trivially transformed into a depressed cubic equation, which we know how to solve (see the section above).", "To find our proof we proceed as follows. Summing the four equations in Eq. 10 or using one of Vieta\u2019s formulas (which establish the connection between the coefficients of a polynomial to its zeroes) we find that the zs of Eq. 10 satisfy:", "Now we make the following definitions:", "Solving for the four zs in this system of equations, we obtain Eq. 10. Substituting Eq. 10 into Eq. 9 we get:", "A direct application of Vieta\u2019s formulas implies that the \u03b8s in Eq. 12 are the roots of the cubic polynomial", "which we previously learned how to solve. This concludes our proof.", "Thanks for reading and see you soon! As always, constructive criticism and feedback are always welcome!", "My Github and personal website www.marcotavora.me have some other interesting material both about math and other topics such as physics, machine learning, deep learning, and finance!", "Your home for data science.
