So that it would become easier for you to identify your least productive employees (and then supposedly fire them-just supposedly). Well if that\u2019s the case, Cheers! \ud83c\udf89 \u2014 because this blog post will introduce you to a Machine Learning Algorithm (Regression) to build this AI Application!", "provide a complete insight of training a Regression Model", "anyone looking for an in-depth yet an understandable explanation of mathematics behind Regression", "you will have a complete know-how of what exactly goes under the hood of Regression\ud83d\ude03 Your ML understanding will be leveled up \ud83d\udc4d And yes, you will be able to identify your least productive employees!", "Milestone # 1 : What is Regression and how it differs it from Classification?", "Milestone # 2.1 : Training a Regression Model \u2014 Deciding loss function as an evaluation metric for Regression Models", "Milestone # 2.2 : Training a Regression Model \u2014 Gradient Descent", "Milestone # 2.3 : Training a Regression Model \u2014 A complete walk through of a simplistic Regression Model using Gradient Descent", "Milestone # 3 : Using the Trained Regression Model for Intelligent Predictions!", "Milestone # 4: And Finally the Concluding Notes\u2026.", "Before moving to define Regression, lets first define continuous and discrete variables.", "A continuous variable is the one which can take any value from its infinite set of possible values \u2014 the number of possible value are simply countless.", "A discrete variable is the one which can take any value from its finite set of possible values \u2014 the number of possible values are countable.", "In the context of above discussion, we can now clearly distinguish between Classification and Regression. Classification is predicting a value (i.e a class) from a finite set of values (obviously the ones we had during training) while Regression is predicting a value from an infinite set of possible values. For example, a model that predicts weight of an individual is a Regression Model as there are infinite possibilities for its predicted weight value. An individual could have a weight of 12.0 kg or 12.01 kg or 12.21 kg \u2014 the possibilities are limitless and hence, a Regression Model.", "A few examples to further clarify the difference between Classification & Regression", "Assume that we have a training data set of employees happiness index and employee\u2019s productivity, and plotting them yields the following graph.", "The graph shows that the underlying pattern of training data is a Linear Relationship between the two variables. Hence, training a generalized Regression Model will model this Linear Relationship/Function i.e finding a best fit line among the many possible lines. Following this, an unseen data point (test time example) will then have its value predicted according to the Linear Function/Trend learned during the training phase.", "Assume that we already knew that a line will fit the given data set well. To model a line for a given data set, we now need to find best possible/optimal values of the gradient (m) and the y-intercept (c). So during training, we are trying to learn the best possible values of m and c. Once we have these, we can then simply plug in the value of a given happiness index (i.e x) in the learned equation, and predict it\u2019s corresponding employee productivity i.e y.", "Just assume that we trained a Regression Model and now we need to evaluate how good it is on the test set(ideally speaking the validation set). So we plug in all validation set data points (x values) into the Linear Function and predict their corresponding y values.", "Using accuracy as an evaluation metric for a Regression Model will always lead to a train,validation, and test set accuracy of 0! Why? because practically speaking, predicted values can be very close to true continuous values but can be hardly exactly equal to the true labels. So, as the predicted and true labels won\u2019t match, accuracy will always be zero.", "The example above shows that although the predicted values were close to the actual ones, but being not exactly equal, accuracy is totally 0. So its not at all wise to use accuracy as an evaluation metric for evaluation of a Regression Model. We need to define an another evaluation metric that could evaluate our model\u2019s performance.", "We need an evaluation metric such that it reflects the effectiveness of our trained model i.e how well is it generalized. Its shouldn't simply output a value of zero simply because the predicted and the actual values do not match exactly. Rather, it should have the ability to somehow demonstrate how good our best possible model is in comparison to an ideal model(a function which has all the ideal thetas/weights but this is hardly possible in real life scenarios).", "Defining L1-Loss Function as the Evaluation Metric", "A Smaller Loss ValueIf the total difference between the predicted values and the actual ones is relatively small, the total error/loss will be smaller value and thus, signify a good model.", "A Larger Loss ValueIf the difference between the actual and predicted values is large, the total error/value of loss function will be relatively larger as well to imply that the model is not trained well.", "Loss Function as Mean Squared Error", "L2 Loss/Mean Squared Error/Quadratic Loss \u2014 all are same", "The Goal of Training a Regression ModelThe goal of training a Regression Model is to find those values of weights against which loss function can be minimized i. e difference between the predicted values and the true labels is minimized as much as possible.", "Why Predicted and True labels Never Match Exactly?because the weights being learned can minimize loss as much as possible but never minimize it to exactly zero!", "Up till now, we assumed that we already did have weights for our Regression Model. But it is actually the process of finding the best possible values for these weights that accounts for minimizing the loss value. This finding process is where a well known algorithm \u201cGradient Descent\u201d comes into play as explained below.", "Assume that you just randomly landed on a mountain and you are blind folded. Your aim is to reach the base of the mountain as soon as possible. What would you do? A possible solution could be to descend/move in the direction which is the most steepest and continue doing so while you have not reached the base of the mountain.", "While descending you were particular of a few things to make sure that you did reach the base point", "Training a Regression Model aims to find/learn weights which will minimize L2 Loss by converging the function in the same way as we did while descending to mountain\u2019s base.", "Now that we are familiar with the working of Gradient Descent, lets clarify it a bit more with the help of a few examples.", "We did assume a couple of things while for the sake of above example. Below figure compares these assumptions with real world scenarios.", "This marks the completion of your Milestone # 2! \ud83d\udc4d \ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d", "Once we have trained/adjusted the weights in training phase, prediction for a given test example is extremely simple \u2014 simply compute dot product of trained weights and given features of test example.", "The following figure clarifies this a bit more\u2026", "Features should be range normalized in the data preprocessing step. Otherwise the training predictions will most probably be biased by features with extreme positive/negative values. And since feature values do influence their corresponding derivatives, extreme values can make the learning process longer or the function may not converge very well to the base point \u2014 learning becomes difficult. So its usually a good idea to normalize your features.", "You might be wondering why didn\u2019t we make use of L1-Loss instead of L2-Loss. The reason for this is that the derivative of L1 loss is undefined at X=0 and Gradient Descent assumes that the Loss Function can be differentiated every where. Therefore, we usually donot prefer using L1 Loss.", "You can now proceed towards building your own AI Model to predict your employees\u2019 productivity!", "If you have any thoughts, comments, or questions, feel free to comment below or connect \ud83d\udcde with me on LinkedIn", "Your home for data science.
