I work in the domain of semiconductor devices and have started learning about and practicing machine learning (ML) and related data science (DS) concepts and techniques only for past one year or so.", "Apart from taking numerous online MOOCs and building my GitHub repos, I have taken time to write some articles on Medium on the topic of data science and machine learning. Some of them have got good responses and stimulated interesting discussion. During this time, many of my friends, who are from similar technical background, have asked me how I have continued to study and what I have focused on to learn the essential ML/DS concepts. Also, I have silently observed hundreds of such questions on some social media forum I am part of. I have received emails from complete stranger in my personal Inbox, discussing issues with my Github code or seeking tips on how to manage time for studying data science after a full day\u2019s hard work as a mechanical engineer!", "In response, I am trying to list down the most essential insights I have had and found valuable during my journey so far. Of course, these may look pretty regular and commonplace for an experience practitioner. However, my goal is to give some introductory ideas to the beginners like me. At the same time, I will try to write down answers to some oft-repeated questions I have received in my inbox from friends and strangers alike.", "This will be highly biased by my own experience.

And please, DO NOT go straight to Coursera and register in Prof. Ng\u2019s course just because somebody gushed about it on internet or you saw the certificate on your friend\u2019s LinkedIn profile.", "\u201cWhat are some good books to read on AI/machine learning/deep learning?\u201d", "\u2014 There seem to be plenty of solid answers on this question. Instead of stacking up my own bias, I am inclined to point you to some top links which show most useful curated collections,", "\u201cNow tell me about some best online courses for beginners\u201d", "\u2014 Again, couple of links and some words of advice. First the links,", "The advice is that only you can decide the right sequence and pace of study through these MOOCs. Some people are highly attuned to take online courses and can keep themselves motivated enough to download all the programing material and practice them. Some others passionate but cannot keep awake in online video lectures. And there are plenty in between. You can get great amount of knowledge and build solid foundation as a beginner, from online courses but you have to pace them and approach them right.", "\u201cOK, so what are your special tips for taking online courses? Are paid courses/certificates worth it?\u201d", "Copying Leo Tolstoy but making an inverse of it, \u201cevery bad course is similar, every great course has an unique element of greatness about it\u201d.

You have to acquire knowledge, practice, and internalize concepts as you go. But even then, some general points can be made for a structured learning approach. Again, this is from my very personal experience and therefore is subject to complete re-tuning based on your personal situation and goal.", "That\u2019s it for Part-I. In Part-II, I hope to cover most important Q/A on two more aspects,", "If you have any questions or ideas to share, please contact the author at tirthajyoti[AT]gmail.com.
