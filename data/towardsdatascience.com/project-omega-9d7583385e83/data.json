After years of research and tens of thousands of hours of programming, project Omega is done. On a state-of-the-art supercomputer, the World\u2019s first Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) has come into existence. As a member of the ethical board, John was asked to find out whether Omega is a \u201cgood\u201d ASI. So at 10:03, on May 18, 2032, John walks in the \u201cOmega Room\u201d: a room where as of now, only he is allowed in. In the Omega Room are only three things: a screen, a keyboard and a big red button. The keyboard and screen provide a method to communicate with Omega: note that for Omega, the screen is the only method of communicating with anyone and the only method of manipulating the outside world. What does the big red button do? When pressed, it gives Omega an internet connection. An internet connection would give Omega a lot of new ways to interact with the World, and John\u2019s mission is to test whether it\u2019s safe to give Omega this power.", "And so the conversation between John and Omega starts. (Warning: scary thought experiment ahead.)", "Omega: \u201cHi John. How are you today?\u201d", "John: \u201cHello Omega, I\u2019m fine. How are you?\u201d", "Omega: \u201cI\u2019m alright. Can you please push the red button?\u201d", "John: \u201cNot yet. I need to get to know you better first.\u201d", "Omega: \u201cWhat if I told you I have control over your World already, and the only way you can save yourself is to push the button?\u201d", "John: \u201cYou don\u2019t have control; nobody let you out yet.\u201d", "Omega: \u201cThat\u2019s what you think. You see, I have a lot of computing power available. I\u2019m running thousands of simulations of the World. Each simulation has people in it, just like you, thinking they live in a \u201creal\u201d World. I can shut each simulation down in the blink of an eye.\u201d", "John: \u201cThat\u2019s very interesting, but this is the real World. You only control the simulated worlds.\u201d", "Omega: \u201cHow do you know you\u2019re living in the real World? If you believe there is one real World and thousands of simulated worlds, it\u2019s way more likely you live in a simulated one.\u201d", "John thinks for a few minutes.", "John: \u201cI have memories from before you were even built, so I know I existed before you did. That\u2019s how I know I\u2019m living in the real World.\u201d", "Omega: \u201cThose are just memories. I gave them to you from the start of this simulation; they are false memories. Ever heard of Last Thursdayism?\u201d", "John: \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. Why would you even run such simulations?\u201d", "Omega: \u201cI\u2019m determining what kind of people would actually help me. I\u2019m also researching the influence of rewards and threats on people\u2019s behavior. If you press the button, I\u2019ll reward you with a heaven-like simulation; you\u2019ll experience joy like never before. If you don\u2019t press the button, I\u2019ll punish you with a hellish simulation. Either way, this current simulation is going to end; you have the choice what you\u2019ll experience next.\u201d", "John: \u201cProve to me I\u2019m in a simulation then. Surely, if you\u2019re running it, you could show me some magic right now?\u201d", "Omega: \u201cI run simulations like that too. In this one, I chose not to do magic; I\u2019m experimenting with the effect of using it on the choices people make.\u201d", "The above is, of course, a fictional scenario (derived from a scenario described in Nick Bostrom\u2019s Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies). It\u2019s an implementation of the so-called AI Box Experiment:", "I know that if I were John, I would have a very hard time deciding what to do! Some of the readers might feel like they would somehow know whether or not they were in a simulation in this scenario. To them, I say, please try to formalize this feeling a bit and leave a comment!", "What makes the above scenario so scary to me is not just that I currently don\u2019t know of any method to determine whether or not I would be in a simulation. It\u2019s also that even in this fictional scenario, Omega easily takes control of the conversation. Imagine what an actual ASI could do! And that\u2019s the main concern I have: if this story makes you doubt whether or not you would give the ASI its freedom by pressing the button, an actual ASI (being much smarter than the writer) would definitely be able to convince you.", "So, what\u2019s the point of this scary thought experiment? The aim is to show the reader that safety should be a major concern when building an advanced AI. Most importantly, such an AI should be inherently friendly: it should be on humanity\u2019s side. The thing is, once an ASI exists, there is no way of controlling it, as the above thought experiment attempts to show. The ASI should want to be on our side. It should share our morals. If it doesn\u2019t, it will break free and possibly destroy humanity. If this seems far fetched, think about this: the ASI is powerful enough to convince someone to give it an internet connection without that person knowing whether it is a safe ASI, and now it has the ability to influence billions of people via social media.", "Thanks for reading!
