At school, stats professors teach us how to curve-fit the \u201cperfect\u201d Machine Learning model but do not teach us how to be practical, how to manage a project, and how to listen to clients\u2019 needs.", "Formal education sometimes can fail us, fail us in a terrible way.", "When talking to other more seasoned data scientists, the most common complaint about junior data practicians is the lacking ability of working in the industry.", "There is a huge gap exists between knowing DS and actually doing DS. In this post, I\u2019d like to share 4 non-tech success ingredients that I\u2019ve learned from managing a program evaluation project.", "As a PhD candidate, I\u2019ve received 5+ years of training in research design and data science. Throwing a few years back, I had a statistical consulting engagement with an educational company.", "This company trains less privileged students about social etiquette and professional development. It operates as an NGO style and relies heavily on public donations and government grants. Though with awesome programmings, the company finds itself in a financial predicament because they can\u2019t quantify the social impact. Their grant applications have been rejected several times by companies and foundations.", "A side note, it is always difficult to quantify such an intangible concept as social effect. Program evaluators need to be data savvy and also have strong domain knowledge.", "My job is to come up with a valid research design to quantify their good work.", "This is easily said than done. When I first started it, I was surprised to learn how unprepared and disorganized the data team was. The lack of preparation makes it impossible to redesign their workflow. Just to name one example, as an educational training provider, they don\u2019t even have Program Objective and Learning Outcomes Statements (LOS).", "For those who are not so familiar with the field, these two elements are the fundamental ingredients for program evaluation. Without LOS, there is no way we can prove whether the program has achieved its goal or not.", "First thing first. I sit down with the leadership and develop what their specific objectives and goals should be. To quantify the results, I developed a new set of metrics, ranging from three dimensions: Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior.", "With these goals in mind, the next step is to collect data. I asked for every piece of data they have, any surveys asked, etc. Also, I requested access to their database and the previous rejection letters received from unsuccessful grant applications.", "This is a critical step. Rejection letters provide reasons why they fail and point us to future directions. Information collection of what they have done definitely helps us understand what else should be done. There is no need to reinvent the wheel.", "Unsurprisingly, the most common reason for rejection is the lack of quantifiable results. The company has provided some descriptive data but not inferential data. Descriptive data tells how students perform in the group, and inferential data tells whether the program makes the difference.", "In a series of posts, I\u2019ve introduced experimental methods in deriving causal inference (Causation VS Correlation, Natural Experiment, RDD, ITS, and DID).", "Junior data scientists like to fall for this common pitfall: prefer fancy, sophisticated solutions to show what they can do over simple solutions that can solve the problem.", "A 10 layer deep learning model over a simple regression?", "This is crucially important in the Program Evaluation field. We want to impress our stakeholders and foundations with our great work. To confuse them with less interpretable models is the last thing I\u2019d do.", "With this caveat in mind, I adopt a simple quasi A/B testing and include some common ways of presenting the results.", "For the entire duration, the most challenging part is to turn vague business questions into testable DS questions. This is really not easy. I sit down with the team several times and bounce ideas about what is testable and what isn\u2019t. The process lasts for a couple weeks, and we have to give up some ideas reluctantly and focus on a few that works.", "During the process of brainstorming, my non-tech colleagues help me better understand the corporate structure and unique needs. In return, I help explain what is feasible to test statistically. Great ideas bounce around and the conversation lasts for a long time.", "As the data guy in the team, I often bring my ears more often than my mouth with me, listening to and understanding their needs and concerns before speaking up.", "As said, 20% of successful project management comes from good models and 80% comes from non-tech parts.", "This is the last non-tech component, but an essential one. To keep things going, we are on a tight schedule and have to provide workable results in about a 2-month window. Maximum.", "Delivering perfect results in a year\u2019s time?", "Sure, but the company will go bankrupt.", "Within the short-window frame, I re-design the entire workflow and make it more practical, including participant recruitment, model selection, data analysis, robust test, and drafting program report.", "Overall, I\u2019m pretty happy with the results and enjoy every second of doing it. Learning business is fun, talking to various stakeholders is even better, and making a real-life impact is the best part!", "Because of my work, this company is able to quantify their good work and raise more than the expected amount of money within a few months.", "Lesson 1: Understand business questions really well", "Lesson 2: A simpler solution is a better solution", "Lesson 3: Communication is the King", "Please find me on LinkedIn and Youtube.", "Also, check my other posts on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.", "Your home for data science.
