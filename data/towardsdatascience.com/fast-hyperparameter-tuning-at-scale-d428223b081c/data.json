Most existing hyperparameter search frameworks do not have these newer optimization algorithms. And once you reach a certain scale, most existing solutions for parallel hyperparameter search can be a hassle to use \u2014 you\u2019ll need to configure each machine for each run and often manage a separate database.", "Practically speaking, implementing and maintaining these algorithms requires a significant amount of time and engineering.", "But it doesn\u2019t need to be this way. There\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t easily incorporate hyperparameter tuning into your machine learning project, seamlessly run a parallel asynchronous grid search on 8 GPUs in your cluster, and leverage Population Based Training or any Bayesian optimization algorithm at scale on the cloud.", "In this blog post, we\u2019ll introduce RayTune, a powerful hyperparameter optimization library designed to remove the friction from scaling experiment execution and hyperparameter search.", "Beyond RayTune\u2019s core features, there are two primary reasons why researchers and developers prefer RayTune over other existing hyperparameter tuning frameworks: scale and flexibility.", "Leverage all of the cores and GPUs on your machine to perform parallel asynchronous hyperparameter tuning by adding fewer than 10 lines of Python.", "With another configuration file and 4 lines of code, launch a massive distributed hyperparameter search on the cloud and automatically shut down the machines (we\u2019ll show you how to do this below).", "With Tune\u2019s built-in fault tolerance, trial migration, and cluster autoscaling, you can safely leverage spot (preemptible) instances and reduce cloud costs by up to 90%.", "Tune integrates seamlessly with experiment management tools such as MLFlow and TensorBoard.", "Tune provides a flexible interface for optimization algorithms, allowing you to easily implement and scale new optimization algorithms.", "You can use Tune to leverage and scale many state-of-the-art search algorithms and libraries such as HyperOpt (below) and Ax without modifying any model training code.", "Let\u2019s now dive into a concrete example that shows how you to leverage a state-of-the-art early stopping algorithm (ASHA). We will start by running Tune across all of the cores on your workstation. We\u2019ll then scale out the same experiment on the cloud with about 10 lines of code.", "We\u2019ll be using PyTorch in this example, but we also have examples for Tensorflow and Keras available.", "Tune is installed as part of Ray.

Tune and Ray make this seamless.", "First, we\u2019ll create a YAML file which configures a Ray cluster. As part of Ray, Tune interoperates very cleanly with the Ray cluster launcher. The same commands shown below will work on GCP, AWS, and local private clusters. We\u2019ll use 3 worker nodes in addition to a head node, so we should have a total of 32 vCPUs on the cluster \u2014 allowing us to evaluate 32 hyperparameter configurations in parallel.", "To distribute your hyperparameter search across the Ray cluster, you\u2019ll need to append this to the top of your script:", "Given the large increase in compute, we should be able to increase our search space and number of samples in our search space:", "You can download a full version of the script in this blog here (as tune_script.py).", "To launch your experiment, you can run (assuming your code so far is in a file tune_script.py):", "This will launch your cluster on AWS, upload tune_script.py onto the head node, and run python tune_script localhost:6379, which is a port opened by Ray to enable distributed execution.", "All of the output of your script will show up on your console. Note that the cluster will setup the head node first before any of the worker nodes, so at first you may see only 4 CPUs available. After some time, you can see 24 trials being executed in parallel, and the other trials will be queued up to be executed as soon as a trial is free.", "To shut down your cluster, you can run:", "Tune has numerous other features that enable researchers and practitioners to accelerate their development.
