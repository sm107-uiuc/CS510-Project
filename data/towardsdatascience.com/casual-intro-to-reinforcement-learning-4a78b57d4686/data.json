I definitely will share my learning experience during this boot camp through my articles. So, please stay tuned to know and learn more about my boot camp experience!", "In this boot camp, 8 other participants and I will be prepared for AWS DeepRacer League. For those of you who do not know, AWS DeepRacer basically is an autonomous scaled race car and AWS DeepRacer League is the first global autonomous racing league.", "In order to race autonomously, AWS DeepRacer needs to learn how to drive itself, just like a professional racer drives his car. This learning mechanism is also similar to a toddler that learns how to walk. Similar to the previous example, AWS DeepRacer also applies this method of learning, which is called reinforcement learning.", "At this point, you may be wondering what reinforcement learning means. To put it simply, reinforcement learning is learning by interacting with the environment. It is active and sequential, which means the future depends on earlier interactions. In addition to that, it directs towards a goal and the system can learn without examples of optimal behavior (trial and error).", "For an autonomous car, you might ask the following question.", "Why can\u2019t we program the car to do exactly where to turn left and right?", "Well, there are two reasons to learn. Firstly, we want to find previously unknown solutions. For example, a program that can beat a human chess master. Secondly, we want to find solutions for unforeseen circumstances. For instance, an autonomous car that can navigate tracks that differ greatly from any known tracks.", "In other words, reinforcement learning is the science of learning to make decisions from interaction with the environment. This concept is applied in many fields, ranging from computer science to economics.", "Several characteristics make reinforcement learning different than other types of learning. First, there is no supervision, only a reward signal is given. It just tells you how much it likes a decision, but it does not give you what you have to do. Another characteristic is that the feedback can be delayed, not obtained instantaneously. Sequence also matters as earlier decisions affect later interactions.", "To better understand reinforcement learning, we need to look at an example of a decision problem. One example is managing an investment portfolio, in which you make a decision based on a reward (profit). This reward may be short-term or long-term, which means the reward is delayed. Moreover, the buy-sell sequence also may influence your portfolio. It shows that it is an example of a reinforcement learning problem.", "Characteristics of reinforcement learning are reward signal, delayed feedback, and sequence.", "There are several aspects that we must know when understanding reinforcement learning. They are environment, reward signal, and agent. An agent also includes agent state, policy, and value function.", "The interaction between the agent and the environment can be described as follows. At each timestep, the agent receives observation and reward, while executing an action. On the other hand, the environment receives an action and then emits observation and reward.", "A reward is a feedback signal which indicates how well the agent is doing at each timestep. The agent\u2019s job is to maximize cumulative reward from the present until the future. Cumulative reward is also called as a return. This shows us that reinforcement learning is based on the reward hypothesis.", "Any goal can be thought as the result of maximizing a return.", "Now, I want you to think about it. Do you accept or reject this hypothesis?", "Based on the return, we are also interested in value, which is the expected return from the present. The word \u2018expected\u2019 means that we are taking into account the probability of future rewards happening. Therefore, the goal of the agent changes to maximize value by picking the best actions.", "However, actions may have long-term consequences, and rewards may not be instantaneously received. Under some circumstances, it may be beneficial in the long run to sacrifice immediate rewards. For instance, a financial investment could take years until it becomes highly profitable, although it may take some losses at the beginning.", "Three basic components of an agent: agent state, policy, and value function.", "Actions depend on the state of the agent. A state can be defined as the information used to determine what happens next. In the simplest case, there is only one state. However, there could be many different states depending on the circumstances. For example, when we want to buy food, we unconsciously access the state of our body, such as the level of hunger and food preference.", "A mapping from state to action is called a policy. A policy defines the agent\u2019s behavior according to its current state. Taking myself as an example, I would want a hot chocolate every time it rains. Conversely, I would drink a cold lemon tea on a hot day. In other words, my behavior is determined by my policy which translates the weather condition (state) to my beverage choice (action).", "While state and policy determine the agent\u2019s behavior, the value function calculates the expected return or prediction of the future reward. It is used to evaluate the desirability of states and which actions are the most beneficial. Sometimes, it is useful to use a discount factor, which trades-off the importance of immediate versus long-term rewards. A low discount factor means that you only care about immediate reward and vice versa.", "Although reinforcement learning solves many decision-making issues, there is a problem called exploitation and exploration. Exploitation means that the agent exploits known information to maximize reward. On the other hand, exploration is finding new information to hopefully gain more rewards.", "For example, when deciding what you want to eat, you can think the reward is your eating satisfaction. To get the most of it, you can always choose to eat your favorite meal (exploitation). Alternatively, you may try new dishes to find something that tastes even better (exploration).", "In a nutshell, reinforcement learning refers to learning by trial and error, during which the agent should discover a good policy that maximizes return by interacting with the environment.", "If you want to learn more about reinforcement learning, I suggest you check these sources as I did.", "Thank you for taking the time to read this article! I hope you learn something new and can incorporate this idea into your life. Make sure to stay tuned for my upcoming articles regarding the details of reinforcement learning and AWS DeepRacer. I hope you have a good day!", "Alif Ilham Madani is an aspiring Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiast who is passionate about gaining insight from others.
