Based on the data in hand, EDA may include correlation analysis of features and labels, distributional analysis of samples, scatter plots, histograms and much more. EDA is quite useful to derive insights from the data that can be leveraged during the modeling and prediction phases.", "Graphs are a special kind of data structure in the sense that certain samples (adjacent vertices) are known to be somehow more related. Unlike most ML data sets, graphs may not have explicit features. In such scenarios, discovering the structures in the graph becomes even more prominent, since it is the only thing in the hand.", "In this story, we will consider a taxonomy of bacteria habitats (OntoBiotope). I and Selen Parlar are interested in this taxonomy as a part of a semantic search project. OntoBiotope is a hierarchy of environments that bacteria can live in. OntoBiotope specifies the hierarchy by defining is_a relations between habitats (vertices) and this is the only interaction type in the data. However, each vertex is associated with an ID to identify them in the ontology and a name to map to real-life names. OntoBiotope is shared under the BioNLP tasks and its 2016 version can be found here.", "We process OntoBiotope to create an undirected networkx graph, where two nodes are adjacent if there is an is_a relation between them. Let us first see how many nodes and edges there are. Note that we store the networkx graphs in a variable named graph.", "Since OntoBiotope is a taxonomy, it is expected that the number of edges is fewer than a regular graph with this many nodes. To analyze the graph structure, let us compute the depth, diameter and max clique size. To compute the depth, we compute the shortest paths from the root to every other node and find the maximum shortest path distance.", "We see that the farthest node to the root is at distance 10, whereas the farthest pair of nodes are at distance 20. Given that our graph has a tree-like structure, the diameter\u2019s being double of the depth is an ordinary result. On the other hand, we can see that it is not a tree exactly since it contains a clique of 3, which a forbidden structure for trees. Below we can see a 3-clique from OntoBiotope.", "Having a peek at the overall graph structure, now let us consider the nodes alone. The centrality measures are frequently used to describe the characteristics of a node. Though there are many variants, we will consider the only degree and eigenvalue centralities since most of the variants behave similarly. Computing these scores are straight-forward thanks to networkx.", "When we analyze the results we see that experimental medium has the highest centrality score in both cases. This node is at depth 1 and is adjacent to lots of habitats since it has a quite comprehensive definition.", "Based on our analysis up to know, we can say that OntoBiotope a loosely connected graph with small cliques and few central nodes. Thus, we need to enrich its content to gain more insight. To do so, we utilize the PubMed abstracts provided with the taxonomy. In the provided abstracts, mentions to these habitats are already annotated.", "Assuming that the habitats that co-occur in an abstract is related, we can make them adjacent in the graph.", "When we use this assumption, we introduce more edges to the existing graph and create new relations. We can now re-compute the previous statistics.", "Here we see that the number of edges increased significantly. Accordingly, the diameter shrank from 20 to 16 and the clique number increased to 15 from 3, which is a drastic change! On the other hand, the depth of the tree is still the same, which means that the distance from the root to the leaves did not change. Yet, based on the decrease in the diameter, we can conclude that new paths between the leaves are introduced by the co-occurrence relations.", "Now let us observe the change in the centralities. We plot the histograms of degree and eigenvalue centralities of both graphs together. We take the logarithm of the centrality scores to deal with small numbers.", "In the histogram above, we see that enrichment caused a shift towards high centrality nodes. This means that certain nodes are mentioned much more in PubMed abstracts than the rest. Accordingly, frequencies of low centrality nodes decreased.", "Eigenvalue centrality histogram has a different characteristic than degree centrality. We observe that in the initial graph, centralities are mostly grouped in the same bin. Applying the enrichment, dispersed this group towards the sides. Thus, enrichment created a variance in the data, which can be exploited by machine learning models.", "In this story, we have analyzed OntoBiotope taxonomy in a couple of different aspects. During the analysis, we observed that the graph is not information-wise rich and we applied an enrichment based on textual co-occurrence. Re-computing the stats we have seen the increased variance in the centralities and enlarged substructures such as a 15-clique. Note that EDA is a never-ending iterative process that feeds and is fed by the modeling phase.
