Knowing the market\u2019s distribution of overall traffic/data volume is very useful if you are looking to pull high amounts of data over time, and do not want to be integrating multiple data streams coming from smaller market players.", "In the UK\u2019s online home rental market, the majority of the traffic and listings is distributed between the top 1\u20135 players, and those companies (the left of the curve in the below illustrative distribution) are therefore the ones on which you want to focus your data collection efforts on.", "This is of course a double-edged sword, as the big players from which you are going to be sourcing from have high leverage when it comes to entering data-sharing agreements, which allows them to:", "1) act as de-facto gatekeepers to a particular market and set their own data usage policies, especially in a less regulated market scenario", "2) charge more per the same unit of data volume when entering data sharing agreements", "3) effectively monitor potential competitive threats to their core-business from startups who require access to their data and who are thus more dependent on their services", "At the same time, given a skewed distribution of market share and in the absence of enforcing anti-competitive regulation, this is where the true value of the data resides, and thus aspiring Data Science teams which want to put their hands on this data need to pay a price to tackle the majority of the market and access high volume, high quality data points.", "N.B For non commercial or research purposes, you are probably OK just scraping data off these websites (although the activity is not always appreciated when done at high frequency and volume \u2014 this is purely a practical consideration, I do not encourage web scraping on websites which have policies against it, and you are always better off respecting the terms and conditions of the data provider).", "Once you have identified the main data sources, your first bet is looking through their developer resources and figuring out:", "Zoopla, for example, has an API page, which can be useful to return a few features and listings data. Zoopla\u2019s specific API has not being updated in a while and has apparently drawn criticism previously documented on Medium, but this type of information is what you want to look for when comparing different data sources.", "When moving on to RightMove, you are directed to their Data Services page, per their official website. They do not seem to have or authorize any official API at the time of writing. OnTheMarket.com also does not seem to have any API as well.", "Checking the main players is incredibly useful to determine your next steps in your data collection strategy. You can get some sample data if you find an active API and decide:", "No matter the case, do not skip this step as it provides very valuable information, even if you are not immediately given access to what you need.", "In my case, I decided to dig a bit deeper and thus got tentatively in touch with RightMove & Zoopla, via email and LinkedIn, by searching for Analytics roles and by reaching out to viable prospects.", "I recommend doing this as you can always find people on the other side who are interested in supporting developers and hearing out interesting use cases. You may also uncover information which you did not previously noticed while reading through the various documentations.", "In my case, I found RightMove to be very restrictive of their data\u2019s usage, and thus the only thing I really obtained from them was a cold shoulder. Same with Zoopla, which merely referred me back to their existing API, whose data richness I doubted after having tested it briefly with a Python script.", "At this point, I decided to search online to identify applications and platforms which already made use of data coming from either one of the two main providers, and see if I could extract further information on how they had done so and potentially at what cost.", "I could have also doubled down on Zoopla & RightMove and decided to propose a data-sharing agreement, but as a single individual, how much leverage would I realistically possess in such a conversation?", "In similar cases in which you are trying to decide where and how to collect your data from, I suggest you either:", "After having identified your main data sources and having checked for APIs and their usage potential, you\u2019d also want to reach out to other market players who are exploiting those same data sources and see if you can uncover further insights.", "I found this to be an incredible little steps in getting some great-quality contextual information around data collection costs.", "For example, I found a great website, Property Data, which cites the same data sources I was looking for, and thus I immediately sent an email using their contact form.", "To my surprise, the founder himself replied, mentioning the amount of money one provider was charging PropertyData to get them what they needed, as well as confirming they had not been able to convince another provider to send over their data, no matter the price point proposed, thus confirming my previous negative experience when reaching out to most of them via email/LinkedIn.", "-(below is the extract from the email response I got from PropertyData, sanitised where possible for confidentiality reasons)-", "\u201cWe pay Source 1 \u00a3XX per month. That did the trick to get us what we needed!", "Source 2, no amount of money makes them interested!", "I always recommend taking the time to reach out to who has done it before and just ask, you might get positively surprising and helpful responses in return!", "By this point, you should have collected all the information needed to calculate the monthly running costs for data collection, which can be estimated by:", "(Number of data sources * Avg. Monthly Subscription Costs of API/Data Agreement)", "To this, you might want to factor in any Cloud Computing resources, which are going to be dependent on your data collections scripts and the amount of processing resources (time, data size driven) you are going to be utilizing to get your data into your data lake/data warehouse for later processing and analysis.", "Aside from the mere numbers, at this moment you should also develop a sense for the overall technical feasibility of the approach given your project set up, and whether it can make sense to proceed or to completely pivot your data collection strategy.", "Having a sound data collection methodology and approach can really set your data science project up and running in the best way, while getting the best possible data at the best possible price given your market domain knowledge and the data providers available.", "You can greatly increase your chances of developing a sound approach for data collection and maximize your chances of getting great data in an efficient way.
