Although used for the occasional funny meme, in the wrong hands, deepfakes can cause public distress and financial crises.", "Deepfakes are the result of a generative adversarial network (GAN) and unsupervised machine learning. After getting initial data, the computer teaches itself henceforth, using a Generator and a Discriminator.", "The generator creates the initial fake image, audio, or video and sends it over to the Discriminator for examination. If it determines the image is fake, the Generator modifies the file based on the Discriminator\u2019s feedback. Then, using the data provided, the Generator alters the file again and sends it back to the Discriminator for appraisal. This continues until it fools the Discriminator into thinking the fake file is real.", "However, there can be problems with this process. If the Discriminator is weak, it could flag a fake image as \u201creal\u201d too early creating a subpar deepfake. This is called a \u201cshallow fake\u201d and is used in the media frequently.", "Shallow fakes aren\u2019t as convincing as deepfakes. Because it lacks the same depth of realism, it\u2019s much easier to detect a shallow fake with your senses.", "An example of a shallow fake image would be a poorly Photoshopped face swap. Or a floating cut-out head in a video. Or a robotic voice pretending to be a human (like the ones often used in robocalls cams).", "Shallow fakes may be easier to detect than deepfakes, but that doesn\u2019t make them any less harmful.", "Jim Acosta, a CNN reporter, was a victim of a popular shallow fake video. In it, Acosta was seen \u201cattacking\u201d a White House intern. But in the true undoctored version, Acosta did no such thing \u2014 it was the intern trying to take the microphone away from Acosta.", "Even though it was disapproved, this shallow fake still held consequences. Fans of Acosta still support him, but anyone who didn\u2019t like him is more likely to believe he\u2019s capable of attacking innocent people \u2014 even though he didn\u2019t in the first place. Blindly believing in a source, whether it\u2019s true or not, is a problem of confirmation bias. And it\u2019s one of the main reason shallow fakes and deepfakes go viral.", "Although it\u2019s difficult to detect a deepfake with our eyes and ears, this isn\u2019t the primary issue with deepfakes.", "A new study involving more than 3,000 adults has revealed major issues in how we perceive data. After showing the participants fake images with fake text, it revealed that confirmation bias impacts how they (and we as people) view deepfakes.", "Meaning, if it reinforces our beliefs, we\u2019re more likely to share information (like deepfakes), regardless of the validity of the source. It can quickly go viral and have consequences on public opinion (like with Acosta) or cause financial damage to companies.", "The cybersecurity company, Symantec, says three companies have fallen for deepfake audio scams. In the scam, the attacker pretends to be the CEO by using deepfake audio. Then, as the \u201cvoice\u201d of the CEO, they call the senior financial officer for an urgent money transfer.", "Millions of dollars gone, just like that.", "Deepfakes aren\u2019t only used for financial gain, but revenge. The app, deepnude, swaps the clothes of women with artificially developed naked bodies. Creating and distributing these images without the consent of the woman is called revenge porn. And it\u2019s already prompting new legislation against digitally doctored images and videos.", "That\u2019s if you can spot a deepfake, which is incredibly difficult with our eyes and ears. So how can we find them? Using the same type of algorithms needed to create deepfakes.", "New algorithms can detect deepfakes, but unfortunately, it\u2019s not a quick process.", "One aspect of a successful detection algorithm involves studying a deepfake image pixel by pixel. For this to be effective, the recurrent neural network must study thousands of real and deepfake images to decipher the differences.", "One such difference is the smoothed edges in a deepfake image. When a new image is inserted, it can leave the edges unrefined. The computer will smooth the edges a little too much to compensate. As such, this unnatural smoothness can reveal the image as a deepfake instead of disguising it.", "This algorithm may work on videos but right now, it\u2019s not exactly up-to-par. It would need to analyze a video frame-by-frame and examine the pixels of each frame. By the time the algorithm finishes and determines it\u2019s a deepfake video, the damage may already be done.", "Technology advances every day and deepfakes aren\u2019t any different. Each day bad actors are learning new ways to create highly realistic deepfakes. Our current algorithms for detection might be obsolete in a day.", "Kiesha Frue is a professional copywriter, editor, and proofreader. She\u2019s obsessed with words, clarifying messages, and french vanilla cappuccinos (that last point isn\u2019t as important, maybe. Unless that\u2019s your thing!).", "Your home for data science.
