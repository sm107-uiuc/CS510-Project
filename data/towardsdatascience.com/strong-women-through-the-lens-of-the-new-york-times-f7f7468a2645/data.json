First, you have to obtain the API key here. It\u2019s free! The NYT just likes the concept of the regulated flood gate. Since this type of the API is good for the bulk data collection, it doesn\u2019t allow for effective prior filtering. Please follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebooks posted on Github if you wish to re-create the experiment. If you prefer a video version of this post, you can access it here.", "All the instructions, code notebooks and results can also be accessed through my project repository on GitHub for smoother replication.", "Before I proceed any further with my analysis, I decided to run topic modeling on the bulk of the articles from The New York Times between January 2019 and present day, September 2020, to analyze the headlines, keywords and the lead paragraphs. My goal was to distinguish the most prevalent issues and enduring topics in order to make sure that my research goes along the lines of the NYT mission statement, and I\u2019m not misrepresenting their journalism style.", "The data collection blueprint for this part of the analysis was inspired by a very informative tutorial by Brienna Herold.", "Let\u2019s import the necessary tools and libraries:", "Determine the timeframe of the analysis:", "Breaking the data into the monthly groups:", "The following set of helper functions (see the tutorial) extracts the NYT data through the API and saves it into the specific csv files:", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at the helper functions:", "Once we get our monthly csv files for each year within the range, we can concatenate them for further use. glob library is an excellent tool for that. make sure your path to the headlines folder matches the path in your code. I used a relative path as opposed to the absolute path for mine.", "big_frame is a DataFrame that consists all our files from the headlines folder concatenated into one frame. This is the expected output:", "Now, we are ready for topic modeling. The purpose of the analysis below is to run topic modeling on headlines, keywords and lead paragraphs of The New York Times articles for the past year and a half. I want to make sure that headlines are consistent with the introductory paragraphs and keywords.", "Since we are looking at three different columns of the DataFrame, three different instances of the corpus will be instantiated: a corpus that holds headlines, a corpus for the keywords and a corpus for the lead paragraphs. This is meant to be a sanity check to make sure headlines and keywords and lead paragraphs are consistent with the article\u2019s content.", "In order to for the text data to be usable, it needs to be pre-processed. In general, it will look like that: lowercasing and punctuation removal, stemming, lemmatization and tokenization, then stop-word removal and vectorization. The first four operations are shown as a cluster, because the order of those operations often depends on data, and in certain cases it might make sense to switch the order of operations.", "Let\u2019s decide on the optimal number of topics for our case:", "Remember: even though the algorithm can sort the words into the corresponding topics, it\u2019s still up to a human to interpret and label them.", "A variety of topics showed up. All of them are very serious and important in our society. In this particular research, we are going to investigate gender representation.", "We will use the previously mentioned helper functions in order to get the data from January 1st, 1950 to present day, which is September 2020. I recommend using smaller increments of time, e.g. a decade in order to prevent the API timing-out.", "The data will be collected into the headlines.csv and then concatenated into one dataframe using the methods illustrated above. Once you get the dataframe that you worked so hard to get, I suggest pickling it for further use:", "Here\u2019s how you extract the pickled files:", "Let\u2019s convert the date column into the datetime format so that the articles can be sorted chronologically. We will also be removing nulls and duplicates.", "I used my personal judgement to determine which keywords are relevant to the topic of strong women and their representation: politics, social activism, entrepreneurship, science, technology, military achievement, athletic breakthroughs and female leadership. This analysis is not in any way meant to exclude any groups or individuals from the notion of strong women. I am open to additions and suggestions, so please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you think there\u2019s something that can be done to make this project more comprehensive. A quick reminder if you find the code in the cells challenging to copy due to formatting issues, please refer to the code and instructions in my project repository.", "Above is a sample query for relevant keywords. A more detailed explanation on relevant keyword search and article headline extraction can be found in this notebook.", "Now, let\u2019s examine the headlines that have to do with women in politics.", "First, we normalize them by lowercasing:", "Examine the headlines that contain words like woman, politics and power:", "\u2018wip\u2019 stands for \u2018women in politics\u2019.", "Our search returned only 185 headlines. Let\u2019s look at the keywords to supplement that.", "The DataFrame above contains 2579 articles based on relevant keywords. We will perform an outer join on the keywords and the headlines dataframes in order to obtain a more comprehensive one:", "Using the same techniques, we will be able to obtain more data about women in military, science, sports, entrepreneurship and other forms of achievement. For example, if we were to look for the articles about feminism:", "Regular expressions and fuzzy matching allow for nearly endless possibilities. You can see more queries in this notebook.", "The final DataFrame, after all the querying is complete, will further be referred to as project_df in the code notebooks on GitHub and in this article.", "Let\u2019s look at the article distribution over the years:", "If we were to superimpose these two graphs, the blue one nearly disappears:", "The coverage of women\u2019s issues appears to be modest. I believe it may be due to the fact that the keywords weren\u2019t always coded properly: some were either missing or misleading, thus making it more difficult for a researcher to find the wanted material through the Archive API.", "Throughout my analysis, I made an interesting discovery. In the early 1950\u2019s, according to the analysis of n-grams, there were many mentions of professional opportunities for women. A lot of them graduated from universities to become doctors in order to join the navy. I attribute this spike of publicity to the aftermath of the World War II: women were encouraged to join the workforce in order to supplement the military efforts. Remember the Rosie the Riveter poster?", "Even though it\u2019s heart-warming and uplifting to see those kinds of opportunities available to women during the times when not too many doors were open for them, I really wish it wasn\u2019t due to warfare.", "To explore overall term frequencies in headlines:", "We can also create wordclouds based on features such as various timeframes, or specific keywords. Refer to the notebook for more visuals.", "Let\u2019s talk about sentiment analysis. We are going to analyze the sentiment associated with the headlines, using the NLTK\u2019s Vader library. Can we actually pick up on how the journalists felt about an issue while writing an article?", "The code above allows us to have a timeline for our sentiment. To simplify the sentiment analysis, we are going to create some new categories for positive, negative and neutral.", "As you can see, the sentiment fluctuates. It\u2019s not at all unexpected, since women\u2019s issues often encompass heavy subject matter, such as violence and abuse. In these cases, we expect the sentiment to be skewed towards the negative end of the spectrum.", "I created a Tableau Dashboard where viewers can interact with the visualization. It\u2019s available through my Tableau Public profile. This dashboard illustrates the keyword distribution over the decades.", "The New York Times has visibly improved on equal gender representation throughout the years. If I were to make a suggestion, I would recommend adding on to the keyword listings. When we go further into the past of the Archive API, more comprehensive and robust keywords could facilitate the search.", "It is important to keep showcasing female leadership, until it becomes just leadership. Imagine the world, where the adjective \u201cfemale\u201d is no longer needed to describe achievement, as it becomes redundant. Imagine the world, where there are no \u201cfemale doctors\u201d or \u201cfemale engineers\u201d: just doctors and engineers. Founders and politicians. Entrepreneurs, scientists and trailblazers. Our goal as a society is to develop a solid mental model of these titles being held by diverse groups of people. Together, we can achieve that by constantly reminding ourselves and the society around us, that no gender or nationality can be barred from those opportunities.", "Your home for data science.
