A well-crafted tone can make the audience feel joy, sadness\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://www.amazon.com/Data-Visualisation-Handbook-Driven-Design/dp/1526468921", "anchor_text": "Data Visualisation: A Handbook for Data Driven Design", "paragraph_index": 3}], "all_paragraphs": ["Behind every great story is an underlying tone the storyteller attempts to convey to draw the audience into feeling a particular way. A well-crafted tone can make the audience feel joy, sadness, anger, or hope, and possibly all of these emotions at the same time. Most of us can remember certain books, movies, TV shows, photographs, and art so vividly because of the feelings we felt viewing it for the first time. Credit the creators for crafting the tone of their stories in a very impactful way.", "As a data analyst or data scientist, we have vast amounts of data that we can harness and draw insights from by creating visualizations. We can be well-versed in our industry\u2019s technologies, but a substantial part of our job is to use this data to help people act on the information we provide. Depending on the situation, we will have to craft our narrative in a particular way to influence how the audience will interpret and perceive the story we want to tell. Creating a tone for your visualization helps craft a narrative.", "The tone for creating a visualization for finding a company\u2019s highest-selling products may be different than if you were trying to convince an entire country that staying home will help save lives during a pandemic. These two cases are on opposite sides of the spectrum, but as the visualizer, setting the tone of your visualization will be the difference of someone remembering your analysis and acting on it or brushing it aside and moving on.", "In Andy Kirk\u2019s book, \u201cData Visualisation: A Handbook for Data Driven Design,\u201d he does the best job in summing up the tone of a visualization in one sentence:", "\u201cTone: The distinction between \u2018reading\u2019 and \u2018feeling\u2019 data.\u201d", "Just like any creative endeavor, such as writing a story, photography, or painting, there is a story the creator wants to tell, and there is a particular way they may want their audience to perceive it. In writing, the writer establishes a tone by their diction, different points of view, and different levels of formality. A photographer may establish a tone by their use of colors or how they frame their subject. There are many similarities when establishing the tone of your visualization, with the main goal being how you want your audience to interpret and perceive your visualization. Your choice of charts, color, typography, size, and shapes all play a role in establishing your tone for your visualization.", "As with other mediums, it is especially important to establish a tone for your visualization. There is a story you want to tell when visualizing data, but as the creator, you have no control over your audience\u2019s attitude towards your subject matter. However, you do have control over how your audience interprets and perceives your subject. Establishing your tone helps in influencing your audience to perceive and understand your visual in the way you create it.", "You can determine what kind of tone you need to set for the audience if you have defined the purpose of your visualization. As Andy Kirk states in his book, there are two types of tones you would want to use depending on the purpose of your visualization. The first is using a reading tone, and the second is a feeling tone.", "Use a reading tone when trying to optimize the efficiency in which the audience can interpret your data and pull detailed information from it. You want to hit your audience with quick facts and metrics without having to worry about providing too much visual stimulation. The goal is not to create visuals and story points to make your audience feel certain emotions, but to provide key, detailed information to drive action.", "Because you want your audience to have the ability to draw quick insights from your data, charts such as line graphs, bar charts, or text tables with heatmaps are ideal for setting a reading tone. These charts are great for showing the magnitude of values where the audience can identify quickly who the high performers are and where there could be areas of improvement.", "The use of this tone is apparent in an executive dashboard, like the one shown above, which shows key metrics within a company. Stating the number of each metric shows the audience the magnitude of each metric. Using line graphs show the dips and spikes in each metric over time. Color contributes to the tone of this visual by making it easily identifiable if a metric as exceeded or missed their target.", "If you are speaking to people with limited to no knowledge about the subject of your analysis but need to spark a call to action or influence a change of perception about a particular topic, what would you do? Throwing out metrics and hard numbers wouldn\u2019t do your audience any good because they don\u2019t have the knowledge to interpret the data correctly. Choosing a \u2018feeling\u2019 tone for your visualization will aid in how the audience perceives your topic.", "If the audience\u2019s knowledge about a subject is limited, it will take more than numbers to influence them otherwise. As seen in other media forms, there is nothing like sparking emotion to help move a person\u2019s perception of a topic. Whether attempting to convince people staying home and washing your hands will save lives during a pandemic or showing the importance of donating to charitable organizations to provide clean water to Africa, it takes a mix of great storytelling and visual stimulation to get your point across.", "You will usually notice a more pronounced use of graphics, pictures, annotations, and typography to help craft the story. As with the \u2018Clean Water for Africa\u2019 visual above, notice the use of writing and labeling to help explain the crisis at hand, and the use of color and bold lettering to bring the audience\u2019s attention to shocking statistics. Also, the use of bar and line charts, which I mentioned, were best used when using a \u2018reading\u2019 tone, but in this case, it\u2019s utilized well to deliver visual stimulation to the audience while giving them enough information to bring attention to the seriousness of the situation. The use of the color blue and the water droplets is also a nice touch to bring together the visualization theme.", "Visualizations with a feeling tone will not always be looking to convince the audience to take action on something. Sometimes, the analyst\u2019s goal is to inform the audience about a particular topic and have them come up with their own conclusions. Using a feeling tone with this goal in mind may involve using fewer words and more visually stimulating graphics that keep the audience engaged in your work. There may be a loss of detail in the data because of the focus on more engaging visuals. The goal is to make the audience understand the subject at a high level to make it easily understandable.", "Michael Jordan is my favorite athlete, so the visualization shown above is very intriguing to me. I wouldn\u2019t need too many visuals to keep me intrigued, but for someone who doesn\u2019t know as much about Michael Jordan, the beautiful firework charts may be enough to keep that person engaged. Because of the interactive nature of Tableau, if you hover over each bar in each firework chart, it will reveal the number of points Michael Jordan scored in each game he played over his career. However, if you were to view a static picture of the viz, it still delivers a good overview of Michael Jordan\u2019s scoring prowess. With the use of color and bars, it is easy to recognize that he had his fair share of 30\u201349 point games. This assessment is pretty accurate from just looking at the visual because Michael Jordan is the NBA\u2019s all-time leader in points per game. When implementing a feeling tone, identifying your purpose and your audience are the most important factors in knowing how to spark emotions and engagement that audience.", "Like with all forms of consumption medium, setting the tone of your visualization may be the difference between keeping your audience engaged and taking action on your analysis or having your analysis thrown to the side. After defining the purpose of your visualization, I encourage you to define a tone that will help deliver your point and engage the audience in a way they may not have otherwise engaged with your subject matter. There are many great stories to tell with data, so setting the tone from the get-go is of utmost importance!", "Your home for data science.
