They add sense and meaning to the world around us, allowing us to visually understand the spatial relationship of our lives. Physical maps represent adventure, nostalgia, and discovery \u2014 guiding us on magical journeys as we explore the world.", "I\u2019ve used Strava (a GPS activity tracking app) for over 10 years and most recently, acquired a Garmin watch which I use to track all of my activities: mainly cycling and hiking. I\u2019m fascinated by the data: I love examining the route I just completed, digging into my stats, and inspecting the visual manifestation of my adventure on a screen.", "Since moving to Spain in 2016, I\u2019ve become enamored with \u2018El Camino de Santiago\u2019 (known in English as St. James Way, but in this article, it will be lovingly referred to as The Camino). The Camino started over 2,000 years ago as a religious pilgrimage to a Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain. In modern times, it has become a multi-day hiking and cycling adventure route that attracts participants of all ages and nationalities. A more detailed explanation of the Camino from my personal blog:", "It has religious roots (pilgrims have been walking for 1,000\u2019s of years) \u2014 but these days, the majority of people do it as a form of adventure and hiking tourism. There is also an element of soul-searching and spiritual growth that draws many people to the Camino. It\u2019s a chance to spend time alone (and with people), reflect on life, clear your mind, meditate on walking, etc. My motives for doing it are all of the above; I\u2019m constantly soul searching and love to think about things, I also enjoy meeting new people, seeing new places, having adventures and of course hiking.", "Over the years, I\u2019ve collected quite a handful of Camino experiences; at least 10 trips in total (both cycling and hiking) with each excursion lasting anywhere from a weekend adventure to a 25-day odyssey. Being the lover of maps and data, the idea for this project has always been clear to me; visually create a representation of all the Caminos that I\u2019ve ever completed.", "After quite a bit of experimentation, testing the limit of Folium, this is the result:", "For the best viewing experience, check out the interactive version (Medium doesn\u2019t allow embedding HTML). You can toggle between each Camino by selecting the radio buttons in the upper right corner. Summary stats can be viewed by clicking the hiking or cycling icon at the midpoint of the Camino. The \u2018Future Caminos\u2019 option represents additional Caminos that I would like to complete one day.", "This workflow exists within a Jupyter notebook; I recommend installing Anaconda to quickly get a notebook environment up and running.", "The first step in building an interactive map is to download your GPS tracks in the form of GPX \u2014 short for GPS Exchange format. Most activity tracking services will have GPS tracks available for download in this format. My preferred tools are Strava and Garmin:", "Convert GPX files into Dataframe of GPS coordinates using gpxpy. This very useful package parses the GPX XML and converts it to a neat Dataframe, ready to be analyzed using Pandas. Another option is to parse it yourself using the python module ElementTree or lmxl.", "The resulting Dataframe is structured as follows:", "Initiate the Folium map and select tiles. Folium is a python library that is built on the powerful mapping framework, leaflet.js. The first step to creating a map is to choose the map tiles (essentially a map skin). An excellent collection of tile can be found here. The following syntax allows for creating multiple tiles on the same map and giving a personalized name to each tile.", "The end result is a radio button allowing the user to select their desired tile:", "Draw route using points. We use the GPS coordinates tuple (named \u2018points\u2019 from our gpxpy function) to draw the line of the GPS route. Folium allows for plenty of customization of the PolyLine \u2014 color, thickness and opacity can be adjusted. For my purposes, red lines signify cycling routes and green is for hiking.", "Build a starting marker (circle and triangle). I hacked together a \u2018start\u2019 icon for the route with a triangle superimposed on a circle using Folium\u2019s various marker classes.", "Add clickable icon with stats of GPS route. For each Camino, an icon of a bicycle or hiker (using font awesome) is added to the midpoint of the track. Summary stats such as speed, distance, and altitude gain are pulled into the Dataframe and converted to an HTML table. The \u2018popup\u2019 functionality is used to create a nice info box that displays stats about the GPS track when the icon is clicked.", "Use vector layers to create an \u2018end of day marker\u2019. Each Camino consists of multiple days \u2014 on average about 10 days. If you zoom in on the interactive map, these day markers can easily be seen \u2014 the purpose is to show the Camino on a more granular level \u2014 individual days on a single track can be visualized. Upon clicking on the shaded circle, info is displayed about the length and day number of that section of the Camino.", "The size of a \u2018vector_layers.Circle\u2019 entity is based on meters whereas \u2018folium.Icon\u2019 is on pixels. Essentially, this means that icons will remain the same size regardless of zoom level whereas \u2018vector_layers.Circles\u2019 will get bigger as the user zooms. For this reason, I chose to use \u2018vector_layers.Circle\u2019 to indicate the end of each day on a specific Camino \u2014 it is interesting information that can only be seen when the user zooms in. It gets too busy to include in the zoomed-out view. I used the \u2018tooltip=\u2019 parameter to add additional text info in a popup form.", "End Marker. The ending marker (circle and square) is built in the same as the starting marker.", "Full-screen Option. A helpful option for giving the ability to expand to full-screen.", "Feature group. This functionality is very useful; it allows for grouping of elements within the map (such as specific routes) \u2014 each group can be made visible on invisible by the user. In my case, I used it to allow the user to toggle the display of each Camino on or off.", "Well, that\u2019s it! There\u2019s an abundance of additional features that Folium contains \u2014 I could pass hours fiddling around with the various functionality. The options for customization are plentiful.", "Wikiloc is a useful activity tracker that allows users to explore and share hiking and cycling routes. It\u2019s based in Spain and extremely popular here. It\u2019s a fantastic service, mainly for discovering new routes \u2014 it allows users to find useful routes and follow them, GPS-guided, during the activity.", "Being a huge fan of bicycle touring, I decided to do a project that involved web scraping all the bicycle touring routes on Wikiloc. (For more details on web scraping, check out my article about scraping the English Teacher website, TusClasesParticulares).", "This project could be an article on its own, but in the interest of staying on topic and keeping this article concise, let\u2019s dive into the map I created based on the scraping results.", "I parsed the data to only include Camino-related routes and created the following visualization which shows just how many different possible Caminos there are to reach Santiago.", "This article summarizes the basic steps needed to turn raw GPS track data into an interactive map.
