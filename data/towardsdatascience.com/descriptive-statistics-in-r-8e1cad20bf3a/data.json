graphically. To learn more about the reasoning behind each descriptive statistics, how to compute them by hand and how to interpret them, read the article \u201cDescriptive statistics by hand\u201d.", "To briefly recap what has been said in that article, descriptive statistics (in the broad sense of the term) is a branch of statistics aiming at summarizing, describing and presenting a series of values or a dataset. Descriptive statistics is often the first step and an important part of any statistical analysis. It allows to check the quality of the data and it helps to \u201cunderstand\u201d the data by having a clear overview of it. If well presented, descriptive statistics is already a good starting point for further analyses. There exist many measures to summarize a dataset. They are divided into two types:", "Location measures give an understanding of the central tendency of the data, whereas dispersion measures give an understanding of the spread of the data. In this article, we focus only on the implementation in R of the most common descriptive statistics and their visualizations (when deemed appropriate). See online or in the above mentioned article for more information about the purpose and usage of each measure.", "We use the dataset iris throughout the article. This dataset is imported by default in R, you only need to load it by running iris:", "Below a preview of this dataset and its structure:", "The dataset contains 150 observations and 5 variables, representing the length and width of the sepal and petal and the species of 150 flowers. Length and width of the sepal and petal are numeric variables and the species is a factor with 3 levels (indicated by num and Factor w/ 3 levels after the name of the variables). See the different variable types in R if you need a refresh.", "Regarding plots, we present the default graphs and the graphs from the well-known {ggplot2} package. Graphs from the {ggplot2} package usually have a better look but it requires more advanced coding skills (see the article \u201cGraphics in R with ggplot2\u201d to learn more). If you need to publish or share your graphs, I suggest using {ggplot2} if you can, otherwise the default graphics will do the job.", "Tip: I recently discovered the ggplot2 builder from the {esquisse} addins. See how you can easily draw graphs from the {ggplot2} package without having to code it yourself.", "All plots displayed in this article can be customized. For instance, it is possible to edit the title, x and y-axis labels, color, etc. However, customizing plots is beyond the scope of this article so all plots are presented without any customization. Interested readers will find numerous resources online.", "Minimum and maximum can be found thanks to the min() and max() functions:", "gives you the minimum and maximum directly. Note that the output of the range() function is actually an object containing the minimum and maximum (in that order). This means you can actually access the minimum with:", "This reminds us that, in R, there are often several ways to arrive at the same result. The method that uses the shortest piece of code is usually preferred as a shorter piece of code is less prone to coding errors and more readable.", "The range can then be easily computed, as you have guessed, by subtracting the minimum from the maximum:", "To my knowledge, there is no default function to compute the range. However, if you are familiar with writing functions in R, you can create your own function to compute the range:", "which is equivalent than max \u2212 min presented above.", "The mean can be computed with the mean() function:", "The median can be computed thanks to the median() function:", "since the quantile of order 0.5 (q0.5) corresponds to the median.", "As the median, the first and third quartiles can be computed thanks to the quantile() function and by setting the second argument to 0.25 or 0.75:", "You may have seen that the results above are slightly different than the results you would have found if you compute the first and third quartiles by hand. It is normal, there are many methods to compute them (R actually has 7 methods to compute the quantiles!). However, the methods presented here and in the article \u201cdescriptive statistics by hand\u201d are the easiest and most \u201cstandard\u201d ones. Furthermore, results do not dramatically change between the two methods.", "As you have guessed, any quantile can also be computed with the quantile() function. For instance, the 4th decile or the 98th percentile:", "The interquartile range (i.e., the difference between the first and third quartile) can be computed with the IQR() function:", "or alternatively with the quantile() function again:", "As mentioned earlier, when possible it is usually recommended to use the shortest piece of code to arrive at the result. For this reason, the IQR() function is preferred to compute the interquartile range.", "The standard deviation and the variance is computed with the sd() and var() functions:", "Remember from the article descriptive statistics by hand that the standard deviation and the variance are different whether we compute it for a sample or a population (see the difference between sample and population). In R, the standard deviation and the variance are computed as if the data represent a sample (so the denominator is n\u22121, where n is the number of observations). To my knowledge, there is no function by default in R that computes the standard deviation or variance for a population.", "Tip: to compute the standard deviation (or variance) of multiple variables at the same time, use lapply() with the appropriate statistics as second argument:", "The command dat[, 1:4] selects the variables 1 to 4 as the fifth variable is a qualitative variable and the standard deviation cannot be computed on such type of variable.

Note that the variable Species is not numeric, so descriptive statistics cannot be computed for this variable and NA are displayed.", "The coefficient of variation can be found with stat.desc() (see the line coef.var in the table above) or by computing manually (remember that the coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean):", "To my knowledge, there is no function to find the mode of a variable. However, we can easily find it thanks to the functions table() and sort():", "table() gives the number of occurrences for each unique value, then sort() with the argument decreasing = TRUE displays the number of occurrences from highest to lowest. The mode of the variable Sepal.Length is thus 5. This code to find the mode can also be applied to qualitative variables such as Species:", "Another descriptive statistics is the correlation coefficient. A correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables.", "Computing correlation in R requires a detailed explanation so I wrote an article covering correlation and correlation test.", "table() introduced above can also be used on two qualitative variables to create a contingency table. The dataset iris has only one qualitative variable so we create a new qualitative variable just for this example. We create the variable size which corresponds to small if the length of the petal is smaller than the median of all flowers, big otherwise:", "Here is a recap of the occurrences by size:", "We now create a contingency table of the two variables Species and size with the table() function:", "The contingency table gives the number of cases in each subgroup. For instance, there is only one big setosa flower, while there are 49 small setosa flowers in the dataset.", "To go further, we can see from the table that setosa flowers seem to be larger in size than virginica flowers. In order to check whether size is significantly associated with species, we could perform a Chi-square test of independence since both variables are categorical variables. See how to do this test by hand and in R.", "Note that Species are in rows and size in column because we specified Species and then size in table(). Change the order if you want to switch the two variables.", "Instead of having the frequencies (i.e.. the number of cases) you can also have the relative frequencies (i.e., proportions) in each subgroup by adding the table() function inside the prop.table() function:", "Note that you can also compute the percentages by row or by column by adding a second argument to the prop.table() function: 1 for row, or 2 for column:", "See the section on advanced descriptive statistics for more advanced contingency tables.", "A mosaic plot allows to visualize a contingency table of two qualitative variables:", "The mosaic plot shows that, for our sample, the proportion of big and small flowers is clearly different between the three species. In particular, the virginica species is the biggest, and the setosa species is the smallest of the three species (in terms of sepal length since the variable size is based on the variable Sepal.Length).", "For your information, a mosaic plot can also be done via the mosaic() function from the {vcd} package:", "Barplots can only be done on qualitative variables (see the difference with a quantitative variable here). A barplot is a tool to visualize the distribution of a qualitative variable. We draw a barplot of the qualitative variable size:", "You can also draw a barplot of the relative frequencies instead of the frequencies by adding prop.table() as we did earlier:", "A histogram gives an idea about the distribution of a quantitative variable. The idea is to break the range of values into intervals and count how many observations fall into each interval. Histograms are a bit similar to barplots, but histograms are used for quantitative variables whereas barplots are used for qualitative variables. To draw a histogram in R, use hist():", "Add the arguments breaks = inside the hist() function if you want to change the number of bins. A rule of thumb (known as Sturges\u2019 law) is that the number of bins should be the rounded value of the square root of the number of observations. The dataset includes 150 observations so in this case the number of bins can be set to 12.", "By default, the number of bins is 30. You can change this value with geom_histogram(bins = 12) for instance.", "Boxplots are really useful in descriptive statistics and are often underused (mostly because it is not well understood by the public). A boxplot graphically represents the distribution of a quantitative variable by visually displaying five common location summary (minimum, median, first/third quartiles and maximum) and any observation that was classified as a suspected outlier using the interquartile range (IQR) criterion. The IQR criterion means that all observations above q0.75+1.5\u22c5IQR and below q0.25\u22121.5\u22c5IQR (where q0.25 and q0.75 correspond to first and third quartile respectively) are considered as potential outliers by R. The minimum and maximum in the boxplot are represented without these suspected outliers. Seeing all this information on the same plot help to have a good first overview of the dispersion and the location of the data. Before drawing a boxplot of our data, see below a graph explaining the information present on a boxplot:", "Now an example with our dataset:", "Boxplots are even more informative when presented side-by-side for comparing and contrasting distributions from two or more groups. For instance, we compare the length of the sepal across the different species:", "A dotplot is more or less similar than a boxplot, except that observations are represented as points and there is no summary statistics presented on the plot:", "Scatterplots allow to check whether there is a potential link between two quantitative variables. For this reason, scatterplots are often used to visualize a potential correlation between two variables. For instance, when drawing a scatterplot of the length of the sepal and the length of the petal:", "There seems to be a positive association between the two variables.", "As boxplots, scatterplots are even more informative when differentiating the points according to a factor, in this case, the species:", "In order to check the normality assumption of a variable (normality means that the data follow a normal distribution, also known as a Gaussian distribution), we usually use histograms and/or QQ-plots.1 See an article discussing about the normal distribution and how to evaluate the normality assumption in R if you need a refresh on that subject. Histograms have been presented earlier, so here is how to draw a QQ-plot:", "Or a QQ-plot with confidence bands with the qqPlot() function from the {car} package:", "If points are close to the reference line (sometimes referred to as Henry\u2019s line) and within the confidence bands, the normality assumption can be considered as met. The bigger the deviation between the points and the reference line and the more they lie outside the confidence bands, the less likely that the normality condition is met. The variable Sepal.Length does not seem to follow a normal distribution because several points lie outside the confidence bands. When facing a non-normal distribution, the first step is usually to apply the logarithm transformation on the data and recheck to see whether the log-transformed data are normally distributed. Applying the logarithm transformation can be done with the log() function.", "For some statistical tests, the normality assumption is required in all groups. One solution is to draw a QQ-plot for each group by manually splitting the dataset into different groups and then draw a QQ-plot for each subset of the data (with the methods shown above). Another (easier) solution is to draw a QQ-plot for each group automatically with the argument groups = in the function qqPlot() from the {car} package:", "It is also possible to differentiate groups by only shape or color. For this, remove one of the argument col or shape in the qplot() function above.", "Density plot is a smoothed version of the histogram and is used in the same concept, that is, to represent the distribution of a numeric variable. The functions plot() and density() are used together to draw a density plot:", "The last type of descriptive plot is a correlation plot, also called a correlogram. This type of graph is more complex than the ones presented above, so it is detailed in a separate article. See how to draw a correlogram to highlight the most correlated variables in a dataset.", "We covered the main functions to compute the most common and basic descriptive statistics. There are, however, many more functions and packages to perform more advanced descriptive statistics in R. In this section, I present some of them with applications to our dataset.", "One package for descriptive statistics I often use for my projects in R is the {summarytools} package. The package is centered around 4 functions:", "A combination of these 4 functions is usually more than enough for most descriptive analyses. Moreover, the package has been built with R Markdown in mind, meaning that outputs render well in HTML reports. And for non-English speakers, built-in translations exist for French, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Turkish.", "I illustrate each of the 4 functions in the following sections. Outputs that follow display much better in R Markdown reports, but in this article I limit myself to the raw outputs as the goal is to show how the functions work, not how to make them render well.

To display column or total proportions, add the prop = \"c\" or prop = \"t\" arguments, respectively:", "To remove proportions altogether, add the argument prop = \"n\". Furthermore, to display only the bare minimum, add the totals = FALSE and headings = FALSE arguments:", "This is equivalent than table(dat$Species, dat$size) and xtabs(~ dat$Species + dat$size) performed in the section on contingency tables.", "To display results of the Chi-square test of independence, add the chisq = TRUE argument:3", "The p-value is close to 0 so we reject the null hypothesis of independence between the two variables. In our context, this indicates that species and size are dependent and that there is a significant relationship between the two variables.", "It is also possible to create a contingency table for each level of a third categorical variable thanks to the combination of the stby() and ctable() functions. There are only 2 categorical variables in our dataset, so let\u2019s use the tabacco dataset which has 4 categorical variables (i.e., gender, age group, smoker, diseased). For this example, we would like to create a contingency table of the variables smoker and diseased, and this for each gender:", "The descr() function produces descriptive (univariate) statistics with common central tendency statistics and measures of dispersion.
