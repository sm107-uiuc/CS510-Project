An ability to process the right data by Fintech companies provides them a huge competitive advantage . This is because artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm can process these data and provide opportunities for (i) better allocation of resources (ii) identifying demographics of target clients (ii) realizing the client needs and allow quality customer decision making. Hence organizations are allocating a portion of their investment on data management.", "However there are different types of fintech companies, including: Personal finance, Wall Street, Crypto, Investment, Lending, Payments and Real Estate. Each of these categories require different sets of data volume that requires updating at different frequencies. There ARE an approximate 52% increment in Fintech startups by February 2020 according to statista.com. Hence having knowledge on the \u201cuseful\u201ddata gives a competitive advantage over other startups in the same field.", "Examples of big corporations or organizations that depend heavily on data would be amazon, google and facebook. They collects data of their users/clients as they navigate through their platform. This census gives them advantage to acquire information regarding their target audience demographics and their interest. Businesses can easily utilize these data and with the application of AI and machine learning (ML) they can create better products and perhaps improve their services to their clients. Also regression analysis and programming can allow to forecast future events. These can eventually help companies to plan ahead and allocate their resources accordingly.", "Basic terminology used in data science", "2. Data velocity: It is the rate at which data is being processed. There are five different data velocity categories. Real time, near real time, batch, custom and analytical. To get a competitive advantage fintech companies need their data velocity at real time or near real time. However, it also depends on the category of fintech companies. For example, data pertaining to wall street, crypto and investment needs to be executed at real time or near real time because of the volatility involved in the process. However, payment and lending companies can allow 1\u20132 business days to settle any transactions of funds. This gives additional advantage to avoid any fraudulent transactions.", "3. Data variety: It is the diversity of data involved during data collection and processing. For example, complex systems are difficult to accurately model and predict. Stock prices are a perfect reflection for this model. Spontaneous actions occurring in Wall Street market can create abrupt and highly volatile price fluctuations. A \u201cgood news or a research breakthrough\u201d could lead to exponential stock price appreciation or filing for bankruptcy is definitely detrimental for the stock price.", "4. Data- as- a- service: It involves aggregation and providing access to wider range of public and private data by partnering with data providers.", "5. Analytics as- a -service: It utilizes advanced analytics to generate predictive modeling.", "According to a Schmidt et al. (2018), the data primarily relies on core business model, key activities and value proposition. Fintech companies use a combination of data provided by consumers and also rely on external acquired data to compliment.", "Payment fintech companies usually focus on secure online payments solutions. Most of their business model usually does not require to store individual client payment data but rather uses the data of the transaction on the online shop. They focus on optimizing the transaction and services with the banks. Security and swept payment option is their priority because their revenue is dependent on the usage. Certain payment companies only charge a 3% transaction fee for their service. Hence for payment platforms, the focus is rather shifted from individual client data to optimizing and securing transactions.", "Real Estate fintech companies focus on processing vital data and presenting it in a readable format to its users. They perform internal descriptive analytics to determine the risk-return analytics for any project portfolio. They focus on acquiring data from various sources and transforming it into client readable format. For real estate fintech companies the revenue is dependent both on sales and usage by client. Similarly for real estate, the focus of their data is analytics and risk management so that their client can make a knowledgeable investment.", "Data volume and data velocity are of critical importance when dealing with Wall Street fintech applications.New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) alone has to process over Terabytes of data/day.Similarly, the Forex market which has almost $5.1 trillion transactions/day also require real time or near real data.", "One of the biggest challenges that fintech companies face at the moment is that their data algorithm are more geared towards solving technical problems rather than addressing to target their business solutions. Some argue that part of this reason is because the majority of data scientist are not actively involved in the financial sector and share a more technical perspective . This eventually leads to difficulty in utilizing these data effectively for business growth and improvement. Nevertheless, the industry is growing at a large scale with almost 52% increment in the fintech startups as of 2020 since 2019 and hence it has plenty of scope for future opportunities and growth potential. Like any other organizations the fintech companies are gonna benefit strongly from efficient management of data through utilization of machine learning.", "[1]Ghasemaghaei, M. (2019).
