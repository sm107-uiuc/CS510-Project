What are the best tools to be selected? Are there some of the tools better than others? What do we need to use if we are just looking for certain functionality such as handling the storage of huge amount of data or realtime analysis?", "These questions and more may create this confusion that will make most people with quite a good level of expertise get lost in the field. These questions are to be answered in the coming sections.", "I would prefer to say no! you don\u2019t need to know all of the tools available and just try to know what you need.", "In order to remove the confusion, the tools in the market are split into different categories based on their functionalities as follows:", "In this article, I will be discussing in detail the data storage frameworks and I totally know that one article is not enough for such a huge set of tools and framework, thus, I will be considering more the heart of Big Data with all its different architectures and I will try to list multiple of other tools that are considered of high importance in the market nowadays.", "In brief, I would like to mention that Hadoop was created based on the Google File System (GFS) paper that was published in 2003. This paper was the core work that leads to the era of Big Data. After revealing the secrets of GFS, the development of Hadoop started to put into practice as a project named Apache Nutch that was moved to the new Hadoop project in 2016 in which the first version was released. Hadoop was the first open-source, reliable, scalable computing framework that is capable of processing petabytes of data. Its core is based on Java programming with some native code in C and shell scripts.", "What you need to know is that Hadoop mainly consists of two important layers which are the Data layer -known as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)- and the Processing layer -known at first as Map and Reduce Framework (MapReduce). We will focus more on the HDFS side due to its importance and no other file system can replace it for the moment. Whereas, the processing side was replaced in the market by a few other tools such as Spark, Flink, etc. HDFS is still is the main focus of any Big Data Application, especially, if we are looking to preserve the different entities of the data (raw data, processed data, etc.).", "Hadoop was evolving at a very high speed. Even if you are familiar with Hadoop 1, that does not mean you are familiar with Hadoop 2 or Hadoop 3. Things are being changed entirely, some components were replaced, others were removed and new features are being added. I will make sure to cover this evolution due to its importance. You may rethink to update your Hadoop if you didn\u2019t do it yet.", "As I mentioned in all Hadoop versions, the only component that stayed robust and well-maintained without replacement is the HDFS which really concerns us.", "Differences between Hadoop 1 and Hadoop 2", "Any curious person to knowledge, would like to know what is the difference? Why do I need to move to Hadoop 2 at that time?", "The answer to that question is pretty simple: we can have multiple masters as the main highlighted difference. It seems that the answer is too foggy. I will start explaining in detail what happened.", "Hadoop 2 added a new layer in the architecture of Hadoop called YARN \u2014 known as Yet Another Resource Negotiator- which is responsible for managing the resources used by applications, monitoring those applications, and scheduling the jobs on top of HDFS [1]. This layer leads to a new hierarchy in the detailed-architecture where it can be seen as follows:", "This architecture that was introduced in Hadoop 2 was the key to play a role in facilitating different purposes such as:", "Differences between Hadoop 2 and Hadoop 3", "Besides the changes that were made in Hadoop 2, here we come to address the new changes in Hadoop 3. I will distinguish the important differences between both versions as follows:", "In the Hadoop eco-system, we notice a wide range of tools and frameworks and here I will introduce you to three main data storage and querying tools that are set up on top of Hadoop. These tools will be listed as follows:", "Despite the fact that Hadoop is the center of understanding the storage of Big Data, it is noticed that Hadoop is somehow complicated in terms of installation, administration, and monitoring. Besides that, not all big data applications will require the complexity of using Hadoop as they may be concerned by sort of lighter data storage and more database-like. Some of the database-like storage tools are known as NoSQL storage tools \u2014 NoSQL stands for Not Only Structured Query Language \u2014 . These NoSQL tools will facilitate the characteristics described above concerning replicating and partitioning the data, the availability of the data, and querying over those data. Few of the most well-known NoSQL storage tools are listed as follows:", "Whenever we are building our Big Data application, we should keep in mind that there are a lot of tools that we might need to understand and cope with. Not only these tools are great in number, but also with their versions and features. We should be careful in choosing the right technologies to address the well-matched problem. After looking into Hadoop the heart of the Big Data era, we can notice clearly that the evolution is still going and new features are being added on a daily basis and so we have to invest our time checking if the newly added-features are going to simplify the process of the development of our application. Moreover, I introduced a couple of other important tools that might help to build the required application.", "Your home for data science.
