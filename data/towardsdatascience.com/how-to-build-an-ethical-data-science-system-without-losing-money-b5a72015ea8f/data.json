But even so, until now enterprises don't want or can't approach effectively those problems, because of cost-of-change constraints.", "So how can we fix this?", "A possible solution might be based at the center of a Software Architecture:", "For those who already studied the Clean Architecture model of software systems, Hexagonal, Ports and Adapters, etc, know that the most stable part of the system is the domain part of it.", "The business rules, that we programmers, Data Scientists follow, are ruled by the customer experience, problems, and desires that define use cases.", "The rest of the system is developed around it.", "If the Customer is at the center of the system domain, it means that ethics should be in the Domain region of our Architecture also.", "That might be the road for a good, sustainable solution in today\u2019s production model.", "Because when we delegate Customer Centrism, Ethics as a detail \u2014 as Robert Martin says in Clean Architecture \u2014 we are making the system less and less dependent on it, and that means we are implicitly saying:", "This does not matter now, we can delegate.", "And this is actually wrong from a professional perspective.", "By telling customers we want to make their experience the best with their data, but are not we thinking about them in the process, the social implications of our work, using their information and behavior solely for our own production and profit optimization, we are lying.", "If we don\u2019t make Ethics part of the core of our development cycle, we won\u2019t experience really concrete our proposal to the customer.

It's not sustainable, the same thing is happening again in Data Science, and the consequences are showing up very quickly.", "But, if we embed the ethical logic in the core of the system, the Domain Layer, in our core practices, we enforce ethical values not only in our Data Platform, but in our daily practice.", "And that could be our strategy.", "The architectural reason is that, ideally, the core of the system is as abstract as stable.", "That means that most of the modules depend on business rules, in our case, all data products depends on the Customer Problem, Use Cases, and Business Rules.", "If we include Customer Ethics in this domain, we protect it and make it almost obligatory.", "So in summary, all you need to do is to include a Customer Ethics in the Domain Layer.
