Their analytics systems have around 30% of the user\u2019s purchase history and only 20% of the products have users rating history. What method will you use for this type of problem? What will be your evaluation technique?RMSE, Precision, MRR, nDCG, or any other?", "In this article, we will build a recommender system for the product detail page to recommend items to users based on their rating history.", "We will evaluate Eight different models to get ourselves the best working recommender system.", "If you want to dig deeper into the recommender systems, I suggest starting with this course here. Mentors not only teach all the ins and outs of the algorithms but also explain the applications with real-world examples, valuable for anyone who wants to advance in this domain.", "We will be using Amazon find dine food review data set to implement our recommender model. Here is how the dataset looks.", "You can find the code notebook here.", "We will be only using three features, namely User Id Product Id and Score`.", "Notice that some users have given ratings to the same product multiple times.", "We can take an average of ratings to get one score per user per item. Note: We can also take the last rating given or the median of multiple ratings.", "Here are the 5 rows of our final data set.", "The data set has about 74,258 unique products and 256,059 users. EDA with help understand users\u2019 interaction and the score they have given to the products.", "60% of the ratings are five stars, and 20% are four stars. Hence 80% of the ratings given were positive.", "The average rating by the users, the red line in the chart below, is 4.17. With overall ratings being left-skewed.", "Similarly, the average rating of products is 4.16.", "Most of the users rated no more than two times. Very few users rated the products more than ten times. This is quite normal in real life, very few users rate multiple items.", "Contrary to user interaction, the average count of the product rated is 4.49. It is a good sign as we have more product rated which we can use in our recommender systems.", "If we see the distribution of the number of times users rated any product, We see two things. First, regardless of how many users rated, the average rating (median) is above 4. Second, The users with a lower rating count, between 1 to 20 ratings, have more spread on their ratings.", "A similar trend can be seen on the product level. Product with the lower number of ratings has more spread, meaning they also received low ratings.", "This is a good finding. The more rating the product receives the more positive its rating gets.", "We now have a good understanding of the data set. let\u2019s work to build a recommender model.", "We will train several algorithms to compare their performance to get us the best working model.We will be using:", "So we have 7 algorithms. Will discuss the eighth one at the end.", "We will evaluate how each model performs and select the best working model for our recommender system.", "We will use recommenderLab, an R package, to help us create and evaluate the models we need.", "Note: I have skipped IBCF for you to explore and implement.", "RecommenderLab runs on realRatingMatrix dataset. Therefore, we have to convert our data frame into it.", "For the sake of similarity and to run the model quickly we will only consider users who have rated more than 30 times and products that were rated more than 100 times. Once we build our code structure and understand the flow we can run the same on the entire dataset.", "To model assessment, we will be using cross-validation with four iterations. Also, we have set good ratings to be 4.", "Before we start the training we have to mention algorithms to use for model training. Here is how to do it.", "Although we need to recommend three products on the product page, we will also assess how the model performs if more than three products were needed.", "Our objective is to build a recommender system for the item details page. One of the main requirements is that we can only suggest three items. Therefore, we have to make sure that highly relevant products get selected. Precision can help us evaluate just that.Read here for more details about evaluation techniques for recommender systems.", "Here is the ROC curve of all the algorithms", "We can see that SVD, that uses the matric factorization technique, outperforms all the other models.", "IBCF_Pearson is close to SVD with a low number of item suggestions i.e. up to three suggestions. But as the number of suggestions increases, SVD turns to be the absolute winner.", "One more thing to note here is that, although SVD is better, with a large number of suggestions the gap between SVD and IBCF_Pearson is reducing. It could be possible that IBCF_Pearson may better SVD where more product suggestions are needed such as 50 product suggestions on the product listing pages. Something for you to try and explore.", "Let\u2019s see the precision and recall of these models.", "SVG has the highest precision for three items suggestions of all the models. Hence, this is the model we should likely use when we choose with recommender system we would like to use.", "Below is the confusion metrics for the top two models", "Even though SVD was our best model, IBCF with Pearson similarly also had better performance and can beat the SVD if had to suggest more number of products.", "To further improve our recommender model we can combine both the models to train a hybrid system that can derive the power of both.", "Since SVD performs better we will give more weightage to it than IBCF.", "We see a slight improvement in the model\u2019s performance. Below are the confusion metrics for SVD and the Hybrid model to help compare.", "Remember we had subsetted the dataset? You know how to implement the recommender system. Now it is on you to train the model on the entire dataset and see how it changes the final output. Does precision improve when the model is trained on more data set?", "This article aims to help you understand how you can implement the \u2018product you may like section\u2019 on your website page to help your reader suggest similar items.", "There are other approaches as well such as content-based recommender systems that can help you suggest items similar to one being viewed or the market basket analysis technique to help suggest items on cart pages. But you get the idea of how the recommender system works.", "The same principles can be employed to generate a personalized email containing products relevant to each individual.", "Your home for data science.
