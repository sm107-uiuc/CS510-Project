The content is meant for people in the data science community, as well as tech-savvy individuals who are interested in the field of ML.", "Back in 2015 when I started picking up ML at Stanford, the concepts and definitions around it were fairly structured and easy to map out. With the rapid growth of Deep Learning in recent years, the variety of terms and concepts used has increased immensely. This can leave newcomers to the field, who wish to learn more about the subject, frustrated and confused.", "The trigger for writing this installment of \u201cStructuring Machine Learning Concepts\u201d was the concept confusion that recent breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision have brought to the table. People are starting to realize that some techniques that were previously regarded as Unsupervised Learning should more aptly be named Self-Supervised Learning. Let\u2019s expand on that.", "When people talk about the different forms of Machine Learning, they usually refer to Supervised Learning (SL), Unsupervised Learning (UnSL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the three learning styles. Sometimes, we add Semi-Supervised Learning (SemiSL) to the mix, combining elements of SL and UnSL. In 2018, a new breed of NLP algorithms started to gain popularity, leading to the famous researcher Yann LeCun to coin the concept of Self-Supervised Learning (SelfSL) in 2019.", "There are two things worth mentioning about these four learning styles:", "As already hinted at, most of the UnSL being done in Computer Vision and NLP recently is better described as SelfSL. This new learning style is not supervised using a given ground-truth, but using information contained in the training data itself. However, there are still parts of the \u201cold family\u201d of UnSL algorithms, which are truly unsupervised, that use some metric of closeness or proximity between data points to decide what is a good fit (and guide our loss function).", "Also, if you think about it, SemiSL should not be a part of these \u201cpure\u201d learning styles. One, it is rather a mix of two \u201cpure\u201d learning styles and two, its basic setup involves having two different datasets, one labeled and one unlabeled. Therefore, we have saved SemiSL for the second installment of the Structuring Machine Learning Concepts series, where we will talk in more detail about processing unlabeled data.", "I am proposing a simple 2x2 matrix, which maps SL, UnSL, SelfSL, & RL onto two axes, answering the following questions:", "YesFor SL and SelfSL, there is a ground-truth we are using to build our loss functions and metrics. Be it the \u201ccat\u201d label on an image for SL, driving the \u201ccategorical cross-entropy loss\u201d and the \u201caccuracy\u201d, or the \u201chidden\u201d word in a sentence (Marry [loves] her husband) for SelfSL, where we use \u201cnegative log-likelihood\u201d as a loss and measure \u201cperplexity\u201d.", "NoFor UnSL and RL, there is no such ground-truth. We have measures that describe \u201cgood fit\u201d or \u201cdesired behavior\u201d, but nothing similar to \u201caccuracy\u201d. In \u201ck-means clustering\u201d of UnSL for example, we can measure the \u201caverage distance to the cluster mean\u201d, and in RL, we are trying to maximize the \u201ccumulative reward\u201d we are receiving from the environment.", "ExplicitIn SL and RL, we have an explicit choice of what we want to get out of the data or our agent. For SL, it is our choice to turn a \u201ccats and dogs breeds classification\u201d problem into a simple \u201ccats and dogs classification\u201d problem, by re-assigning the labels. When using RL for mastering multi-player computer games, we can choose to incentivize our agent to act as a team player by rewarding the actions taken for the benefit of the group or to act as an egoist by solely rewarding individual actions.", "ImplicitHowever, we cannot extrinsically dictate the nature of an image or language in SelfSL. We can surely change some details, but the \u201creconstruction loss\u201d will always compare two images, and for language models, we will always come up with learning tasks looking at the sentences themselves. With classical UnSL, we are implicitly stuck with finding data points that are close to each other, e.g., two users leaving behind similar behavior data on social media platforms.", "In this post, we have redefined the \u201cpure\u201d learning styles in ML by separating UnSL and SelfSL and leaving SemiSL out of the equation. This brings us to the four concepts of SL, UnSL, SelfSL, and RL, which we can arrange in a simple framework (full disclosure: I did work in consulting for a while). The 2x2 matrix structures them according to whether a ground-truth exists and whether the objective is explicitly or implicitly given.", "If you have any other unconventional mappings, thoughts on the matter, or are interested in our work at Luminovo, I would love to hear from you.
