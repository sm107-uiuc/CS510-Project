I mean, who hasn\u2019t been guilty of reinventing the wheel? While it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing (because you know exactly what your code should do), often there are smarter ways to achieve the same.", "Today I want to share with you 3 functions that I wasn\u2019t using as much as I should so far, and I also want to show you what exactly I mean by reinventing the wheel. A couple of weeks back I\u2019ve written a similar article, only related to pure Python. If you are someone who reinvents the wheel much, don\u2019t hesitate to check it out:", "Okay, enough talk, let\u2019s dive into some Pandas.", "As with many of my articles, I\u2019ll be using the famous Titanic dataset. I\u2019m sure you know how to import it, so here\u2019s what you should have before proceeding:", "Are we on the same page? Good, let\u2019s proceed.", "In a nutshell, those functions will return the ID (the index position) of the desired entry. In the Titanic example, maybe you want to find the index position of the youngest/oldest person. Let\u2019s go even further, you\u2019re interested only in the name of that person.", "A typical programmer approach would be to reinvent the wheel because you aren\u2019t aware that idxmin() and idxmax() exist. Here\u2019s one approach:", "You\u2019re basically subsetting and returning the value for the desired attribute. Not the cleanest of code, but could be worse. Here\u2019s how to achieve the same by utilizing previously mentioned functions:", "Yes, the results are identical, obviously, but the code is a bit shorter and much cleaner. Let\u2019s proceed to the next one.", "In the fewest words possible, you should use cut() when wanting to bin values into discrete intervals. For example, the Titanic dataset has this Age attribute, which is continuous. In your analysis, you maybe want to calculate the ratio of Survived/Died for some age group and not age as a scalar value.", "I won\u2019t even try to reinvent the wheel with this function, let\u2019s dive straight to the point. The idea is to bin Age column into 5 buckets:", "Not a fan of those stock labels? Not a problem:", "Or you don\u2019t care about the labels what so ever and want plain integer representation:", "Whichever you choose, you can assign the whole expression to a new column in the DataFrame and continue with your analysis.", "Pivot tables create a spreadsheet-style pivot table as a DataFrame. If you\u2019ve used Excel before I am in no doubt that you\u2019ve used them. Needless to say, they can be implemented in Python without much effort.", "Let\u2019s say you want to find out the average survival rate among males in the third class. You could use default Pandas and it\u2019s filtering capabilities to obtain this information:", "But what if you want to find the average survival rate for both males and females? In all 3 passenger classes? Pivot tables to the rescue. You can simply set the index to Sex, columns to Pclass (passenger class) and values to Survived, and then use any aggregate function you want, but let\u2019s stick to the mean:", "Well, that was easy. One more thing to note, you can also add an additional row for grand totals:", "Those three functions should set you on the right track. The ultimate goal is to spend more time thinking about what is an optimal thing to do, and not spending much time on the implementation itself.", "Whenever you feel your code is longer than it should be, use google to find if there\u2019s a shorter way. Most probably there already exists a function for doing what you need, but you were unaware of its existence.", "Thanks for reading.
