The options were Football, Rugby and the rest was grouped together in Other; The results of the test are displayed in Figure 1.", "Figure 1 is not quite a probability distribution, but if we want to get the probability distribution we can simply divide each number in Figure 1 by 500 (number of observations) and the result will be the image in Figure 2.", "The Joint probability is a statistical measure that is used to calculate the probability of two events occurring together at the same time \u2014 P(A and B) or P(A,B). For example, using Figure 2 we can see that the joint probability of someone being a male and liking football is 0.24.", "Note: The cells highlighted in Figure 3 (the Joint Probability Distribution) must sum to 1 because everyone in the distribution must be in one of the cells.", "The Joint probability is symmetrical meaning that P(Male and Football) = P(Football and Male) and we can also use it to find other types of distributions, the marginal distribution and the conditional distribution.", "In probability theory and statistics, the marginal distribution of a subset of a collection of random variables is the probability distribution of the variables contained in the subset. It gives the probabilities of various values of the variables in the subset without reference to the values of the other variables (Source: Wikipedia) \u2014 If that was too much jargon, to put it simply, the marginal probability is the probability of an event irrespective of the outcome of another variable \u2014 P(A) or P(B).", "Note: Whether we ignore the gender or the sport our Marginal Distributions must sum to 1.", "A fun fact of marginal probability is that all the marginal probabilities appear in the margins \u2014 how cool is that. Hence the P(Female) = 0.46 which completely ignores the sport the Female prefers, and the P(Rugby) = 0.25 completely ignores the gender.", "The conditional probability concept is one of the most fundamental in probability theory and in my opinion is a trickier type of probability. It defines the probability of one event occurring given that another event has occurred (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence).", "To make sense of this let\u2019s again use Figure 2; If we want to calculate the probability that a person would like Rugby given that they are a female, we must take the joint probability that the person is female and likes rugby (P(Female and Rugby)) and divide it by the probability of the condition. In this case, the probability is that the person is a female (P(Female)) which we can work out from the margin to be 0.46 hence we get 0.11 (2 decimal places).", "If we continued to fill in the probability of preferring a sport given the observant is a female then we would have a Conditional Probability Distribution.", "This is guide is a very simple introduction to joint, marginal and conditional probability. Being a Data Scientist and knowing about these distributions may still get you death stares from the envious Statisticians, but at least this time it\u2019s because they are just angry people rather than you being wrong \u2014 I am joking!", "Let\u2019s continue the conversation on LinkedIn\u2026", "Your home for data science.
