It was a great experience to meet people, be exposed to new ideas and increase my motivation to keep learning. I\u2019d like to share my experiences as well as a few things I learned.", "The conference I attended was the LINE Developer Day 2019. It was held on the 20th and 21st of November in Tokyo. For those outside of Asia, LINE is the largest messaging platform in Japan, Thailand and Taiwan. They have 200 million monthly active users. You can contrast this to Whatsapp\u2019s 1.5 billion. While it isn\u2019t as big, it\u2019s certainly on the same scale and effectively has ownership of their core markets.", "In the first place, conferences are a great way to meet fellow minded people. Putting aside the social pressure it\u2019s pretty easy to approach people and start talking with them about interesting topics. For example, I attended various talks about recommender systems and afterwards I chatted with people who I recognised. It was interesting to hear what techniques they were applying as well as the struggles they had. Attendees came from all over Asia so you can be exposed to new ideas which you might not see in your regular domestic market. Not only could I relate to it I found out some interesting problems that I had never thought of.", "For example, LINE uses a recommender system for timeline posts (similar to Facebook or Instagram) and due to the huge sparsity in their data (< 0.00001% !) they can\u2019t apply regular embedding techniques like SVD or ALS, instead they use some interesting and innovating tricks to get there. In my daily job our sparsity is closer to 0.1% so I\u2019m lucky enough to be able to apply the standard techniques but it\u2019s great to see that you can break away from the norm.", "I also did my best to get the contact details of anyone who was facing similar problems. I believe it\u2019s great to keep in contact with fellows in the industry, as you would see in academia, so that you can continually bounce ideas of each other and grow together.", "Aside from chatting with other attendees, I did my best to talk with the speakers. For some reason, at this conference the speakers were almost exclusively left unattended at the end of their talks. I took this opportunity to ask as many questions as I could (I stole 30 mins of one speaker!). There are all the benefits discussed above but a few more.", "Talking with the speakers I found out that even though a lot of them aren\u2019t publishing results, they are really working on interesting and cutting edge techniques. Often problems such as data sharing restrictions, market competition or just plain business prevent them from sharing as much as they\u2019d like to. It\u2019s expected that this would happen but it also points out the value of attending such presentations to find out these techniques.", "Following on from this, another big benefit was being able to find out more behind the paper. Data science research is plagued with problems of reproducibility, meaning that it\u2019s hard to take the work that someone publishes in a paper and apply those techniques to your own work. By attending conferences and talking directly to the publishers you can fill in some of the details that you don\u2019t understand, were missed out of the original paper or ask them about how they got to the results in the paper.", "For example, one of the presenters took us through the CutMix technique for image recognition deep learning networks. Following the presentation it was possible to ask them all sort of fine-grained questions about how they got to the results in the paper and what techniques they tried and failed at.", "This conference wouldn\u2019t have been cheap. With thousands of people, a fancy hotel with lunch and dinner provided, they were certainly shelling out a lot. But I think it was worth it. If you consider that the average recruiter will charge around 30% of an employee\u2019s starting salary, you\u2019re looking at 30K per employee. While a conference like this would cost a few hundred thousand dollars, this cost would be easily recoverable if they can hire 10 new employees from the conference, or around 0.5% of attendees.", "Of course a company like LINE already has quite a strong pull for employees (experienced and fresh grad alike) and they have an internal recruiting department meaning the actual cost of hiring is lower but the economics probably still work out.", "So it\u2019s a great hiring potential for the organisers, but as an attendee you can piggyback on that. While meeting different people as discussed above, you can also be scouting for your next greatest colleague or employee. It\u2019s a comfortable environment and it\u2019s easy to dive into technical discussion without the stress of an interview.", "Finally, conferences are just fun, and we all need a little fun once in a while. I believe that attending the conference has helped fan the flame that drives me to study data science. That\u2019s because ideas are exciting. Talking with people tackling the same problems gives you strong affirmation that the work you are doing is good.", "Of course the perks are nice too. Being in a fancy hotel the facilities were great and the food delicious! They even went ahead and got custom labels printed on the beers at the afterparty \u2014 wow!", "There were other giveaways too, including the standard conference t-shirt, stickers for your laptop (or as coders think, badges), and some small prizes.", "In conclusion, it was a valuable experience for me. I met a lot of smart people, was able to ask questions to people working on cutting edge techniques and increase my passion and drive for being a data scientist.", "If you\u2019ve ever doubted the value of attending a conference, know that if you\u2019re willing to put in a bit of effort there\u2019s a bounty of rewards to be had. Get researching and ask your boss if you can attend the next conference in your region!", "Your home for data science.
