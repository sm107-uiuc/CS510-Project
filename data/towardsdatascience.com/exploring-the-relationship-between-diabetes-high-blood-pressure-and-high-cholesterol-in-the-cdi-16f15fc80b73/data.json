This data came from the CDC\u2019s Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI): Diabetes dataset, which provides a compilation of diabetes-related information for all states and territories from 2010 to 2018.", "In this article, I want to use the data from the CDI Diabetes dataset to explore the relationship between diabetes and its comorbidities: high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Just like diabetes, these two comorbidities are known risk factors for heart disease. I would like to see if one comorbidity is more prevalent than the other, for adults with diagnosed diabetes in the diabetes belt. I would also like to see if there is a sex bias for prevalence of high blood pressure and prevalence high cholesterol among adults with diagnosed diabetes in the diabetes belt.", "This exploratory data analysis was done in Jupyter Notebook/Python. The code used to produce these visualizations and statistical tests used in this article has been posted to GitHub here.", "The diabetes belt, as described by Barker et al. in 2011, includes \u201cAlabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia, \u2026 Mississippi.\u201d In my previous article, I focused on this subset of states, because these states are much more affected by diabetes than the rest of the country and allow for a more focused analysis. In this article, I am going to continue analyzing this data and drawing conclusions for states that constitute the diabetes belt only.", "Before I begin, I want to provide some technical background on this topic. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes are all risk factors for heart disease. High blood pressure means that the blood flow in the blood vessels increases, making the heart work more and weakening the heart (American Heart Association, 2016). High levels of cholesterol (a fat found in the body) can occlude blood flow. If blood vessels are occluded with cholesterol, they become narrow and require a much a higher blood pressure to keep blood flowing, eventually weakening the heart and increasing the likelihood of heart disease. Thus, studying the prevalence of these comorbidities is important for population health research.", "Similar to the previous article, I will continue analyzing data for 2017, because it the most recent year with available data.", "First, I want to look at the overall prevalence of diabetes\u2019 comorbidities: high blood pressure and high cholesterol.", "From the plot above, prevalence of high blood pressure is higher than the prevalence of high cholesterol among adults with diagnosed diabetes. A statistical test confirms that there is a significant difference between the two:", "This observation coincides with data from the CDC\u2019s National Diabetes Statistics Report 2020, which states that 68.4% of adults with diagnosed diabetes had hypertension (blood pressure > 140/90), or were currently prescribed hypertension medications, and 43.5% had high cholesterol levels (LDL cholesterol > 130 mg/dl), from 2013\u20132016. The prevalence of high blood pressure across the diabetes belt and across the Unites States are similar. However, the prevalence of high cholesterol is higher across the diabetes belt than across the United States. This increase in prevalence of high cholesterol could be attributed to the increased density of adults with diagnosed diabetes in the diabetes belt, compared to the rest of the United States.", "Next, I want to look at the gender differences between the prevalence of high blood pressure and prevalence of high cholesterol among adults with diagnosed diabetes.", "Starting with the prevalence of high blood pressure among adults with diagnosed diabetes, I can see that both and male and female adults have a similar prevalence. There is not a significant difference between the two groups, and this is evident through a statistical test:", "The above plot of prevalence of high cholesterol among adults with diagnosed diabetes shows that both and male and female adults have a similar prevalence of high cholesterol. Statistical tests confirm this:", "The CDI Diabetes dataset also included data on ethnicity; however, I am not considering the role of ethnicity in the prevalence of comorbidities because of the volume of missing data. There is too much data missing for the Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic populations for me to make meaningful insights. Nonetheless, I was curious to see what research had been done on the topic of ethnicity differences in diabetes comorbidities. According to Walker et al. (2016), Black (non-Hispanic) individuals \u201cconsistently demonstrated the lowest rates of BP [blood pressure] control,\u201d compared to other ethnic groups. Similar trends were seen in lipid control for Black (non-Hispanic) individuals (Walker et al. 2016). In my previous article, an analysis of ethnicity differences showed that Black (non-Hispanic) individuals had the highest diabetes prevalence and diabetes-related mortality rate across the diabetes belt. With Black (non-Hispanic) individuals being highly affected by diabetes; it follows that they would also be highly affected by the comorbidities of diabetes.", "In my last article, I discussed the limitations of the data. The same limitations apply here. The source of this data is Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFFS), which collects data through surveys and provides data for adults with diagnosed diabetes. Thus, anyone that is not reached through the BRFFS\u2019s survey collection methodology is not included, nor are individuals with undiagnosed diabetes. Further, there is no distinction between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.", "Another limitation is that the data for ethnicity is missing for these two particular questions in the CDI Diabetes dataset. Gender, ethnicity, environmental factors, and sociocultural factors all contribute to diabetes development; therefore, it is difficult to put together a picture without all the pieces.", "In conclusion, diabetes is a complex disease, with numerous risk factors and complications. My analysis of the CDI Diabetes dataset looks at how high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes are linked to each other. In this dataset, there is no sex bias for either high blood pressure or high cholesterol among adults with diagnosed diabetes, but there is a significantly higher prevalence of high blood pressure than high cholesterol among adults with diagnosed diabetes in the diabetes belt in 2017.", "Your home for data science.
