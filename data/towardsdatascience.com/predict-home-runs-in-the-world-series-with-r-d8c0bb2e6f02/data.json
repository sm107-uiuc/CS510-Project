Well, you\u2019re in luck today!", "In this project, we are going to use some freely available historical baseball data with the glm() function in R to see what variables matter in predicting how many home runs happen in games in the World Series.", "There are a couple assumptions with this project. First, you have an R environment setup. I am going to be using an R Markdown (RMD) file in RStudio on a Mac for this project, but the code will work on other operating systems and environments just fine. Second, you have at least a rudimentary understanding of baseball. I am by no means an expert about baseball, but there will not be any significant knowledge required. As long as you know what a home run is, we will be okay!", "For your convenience, the RMD file is available at my GitHub here.", "With that, let\u2019s jump into the objectives and get started writing the code!", "Before we get into the code, we need to talk about the amazing work of Sean Lahman. He and his team have created and made freely available an incredible amount of historical baseball data. They also went through a tremendous amount of work to make an R package and easy-to-use implementations in several other programming languages. I will be citing them frequently attributing the data to them. Their entire project runs by donations only as described by their site. If you are so inclined to help them out, many people in sports analytics use this data set to learn machine learning in a fun way.", "We will be using the tidyverse and Lahman packages throughout this project.", "If you have used R before, pay special attention to the conspicuous lack of importing local data and naming an object. We only need to use the data() function to pull the table we want from Lahman\u2019s data set. By default, the object will come in as a data frame and be called the name of the table, which is BattingPost for our purposes.", "We have the data into R now. We need to clean it up just a little. First, since this is a project about the World Series, we need to make sure that our round column has only \u201cWS\u201d values in it. Second, we need to make sure the yearID column is greater than or equal to 1920. I\u2019m not a baseball historian, but that is when the modern \u201cLive Ball Era\u201d began [2]. If you are into that kind of history take a look at Bradford Doolittle\u2019s article on ESPN about it here [2].", "Let\u2019s clear this up a little bit for those following along. The \u201c%>%\u201d thing you see a couple times is what is known as a \u201cpipe\u201d character [3]. When using tidyverse, specifically the dplyr part of it, for working with data, I like to think of it as saying that each function or condition following that pipe character makes your hypothetical data funnel a little smaller.", "We rarely need all the data in a data set, so \u201cpouring\u201d it through a \u201cfunnel\u201d of smaller and smaller circumference is a good way to visualize what is happening here. Just by applying these two filters, we went from 14,750 rows in the original data to 4,280 rows in our new one. You can get those numbers from looking at your objects in RStudio or by using the nrow() function.", "Let\u2019s demystify what machine learning means in plain English using our example. What we are about to do is known as \u201csupervised machine learning\u201d because we as humans are \u201csupervising\u201d what data is being fed into the machine [3].", "When using real data like this, what we want to do is split some part of the entire data set into \u201ctraining\u201d data and the balance into \u201ctesting\u201d data [3]. This is done for a pretty rational reason. If you want to have a machine be able to make predictions, you need to test it against reality to make sure it actually works right [3].", "Traditionally, and for good reason I might add, the split is 80% training data and 20% testing data [3]. I have seen various other combinations like 70/30 and 75/25, but I like the 80/20 split because I usually get the best results and it sounds the same as the Pareto Principle [4]. Come on, I can\u2019t help myself. My bachelor\u2019s degree is in Economics.", "So, over the next several chunks of code, we are going to split our data into training and testing sets, create a generalized linear model using the glm() function, then improve it over time to get better results. You will see that we can make the machine \u201clearn\u201d what variables matter and what do not to make better and better predictions over time.", "Before we split the data, we really should set a seed [3]. We are going to use a random (well, pseudorandom if you want to be precise) split. What that means is that the code will split the data into different sets every time unless we use the set.seed() function with a number so that we ensure reproducibility [3]. For those following along, this means that your code will line up with mine as long as we use the same number.", "Setting the seed does not have any output. It is just something that makes sure the behind-the-scenes parameters are set properly [3].", "There are a ton of ways to do this, but this is the simplest way I have ever figured out or seen done in practice. Here\u2019s the secret. We are going to create a column that is an arbitrary ID number and add it to the data we have. What this allows us to do is easily use one of the sneakiest functions in R \u2014 the anti_join() function from the dplyr package inside of tidyverse. What this does is gets all the rows from one table that do not have a match in the other table. It\u2019s sneaky. I love it, and you can read all about it at the documentation here.", "Most of the time, machine learning deals with normally distributed data [3]. When you think of a normal bell curve like we have all seen many times, it is called a \u201cGaussian\u201d distribution because mathematicians said so [3]. It looks like this:", "In a normal distribution, there is a mean (mu, the blue line) with standard deviations (sigma, green lines) from the mean. It is not super important to get into the details of that, but it means that ~95% of the data is within 2 standard deviations (2 sigma) from the mean either way [3]. There are numerous reasons for machine learning wanting normal data, but sometimes we get data that is not normal.", "Another distribution is known as a \u201cPoisson\u201d distribution [3]. Of course it is named after another mathematician, but the point is that it is a standard type of distribution where most of the data is heavily skewed [3]. Most of the time, it looks something like this:", "For machine learning, we really care about the distribution of the variable we are trying predict [3]. In our case, runs (R) will be the dependent variable. Let\u2019s make a super quick histogram to check whether we have a normal or Poisson distribution.", "The runs (R) variable looks like a pretty classic Poisson distribution to me!", "Here comes the fun part! We get to build the logistic regression model now! Let\u2019s take a look at the code then talk about it.", "There is a lot to unpack here.", "First, we created a model object called \u201cfitAll\u201d that uses the glm() function with R as the dependent variable separated with a ~ character from all the independent variables separated by a + while also using our training data (remember the 80% from earlier?) and using a Poisson distribution to get more accurate results [3].", "Once we create the model, the summary() function will give us that output above in a simple form.", "The first part of the summary is \u201cCall:\u201d which just says what model was actually used. Not a lot to talk about here.", "The \u201cDeviance Residuals:\u201d are trying to tell us about the difference between reality and expectations when dealing with errors [3]. Realistically, this is not all that relevant to learning about logistic regressions at this point, so we will keep moving forward.", "The \u201cCoefficients:\u201d section is where our focus needs to be. The first column is all of the variables plus the intercept. Do you remember the formula in Algebra I class \u201cy = mx + b\u201d? This is sort of the extreme version of that b value for the intercept [3].", "The \u201cEstimate\u201d column tells us whether the influence of each value is positive or negative on the number of runs being scored as well as how large its coefficient is [3]. This is something like a bunch of different m values with the x value being the number in the actual data set. An equation could look something like this y = m\u2081x + m\u2082x + m\u2083x \u2026. + b with all the different coefficients and values [3].", "The \u201cStd. Error\u201d column is a statistical measure of how wrong we are [3]. The z-value is used in statistics to give a z-score on a distribution curve [3]. It\u2019s not all that relevant for us right now.", "What is the most relevant to us is the column elegantly labeled \u201cPr(>|z|)\u201d which is a really complicated way of saying the p-value [3]. For p-values, what we care about is being a certain level of confidence that what we are saying is significant [3]. Also, p-values range between 0 and 1, so if there are negative numbers or numbers greater than 1, the math is wrong somewhere [3].", "For example, if we are to be at least 95% sure that an independent variable is a statistically significant predictor of the dependent variable, the p-value will be smaller than .05 [3]. If we want to be 90% sure that the variable is significant, then we need to see a p-value smaller than .10 [3]. To be 99% sure, we need to see a p-value smaller than .01 [3]. See where I\u2019m going with this?", "R does a handy little function for us where it labels at what significance level each variable is. Putting a single \u201c.\u201d next to a variable like with the SB and SF variables means that we are between 90% and 95% sure these variables are statistically significant [3]. An \u201c*\u201d next to a variable means we are between 95% and 99% sure the variable is statistically significant with the rest moving up in terms of being strong predictors the smaller the p-values get [3].", "The goal is to end up with a model that has only statistically significant independent variables. So how do we do that? We use a methodology called a \u201cstep-wise regression\u201d [3].", "This is a fancy sounding term that simply means that we take out the single least significant variable then re-run our model and repeat this process until we are left with only statistically significant independent variables [3]. Let\u2019s do an example. Before moving on, find the variable with the largest p-value.", "So, what do you notice? After we took out the G variable for being the least significant, a lot of the p-values changed! This is normal. When all the numbers get crunched, what counts as statistically significant changes as variables are taken away [3]. This makes sense too. When you think about it, it does not make sense that whether or not it is game 1 or 3 or 6 would really affect how many runs get scored.", "Note: As you take away a variable, make sure to also remove the \u201c+\u201d so from the independent variable side of the formula to avoid unnecessary errors! Also be sure to rename your models to different object names to avoid overwriting past work while learning!", "However, it looks like we still have independent variables that are not statistically significant. It looks like the SO variable is next to go.", "Hopefully at this point, you get the pattern. Until the model is left with only statistically significant variables to the 95% confidence threshold (p-value < 0.05), we will look this process.", "Rather than take up a ton of space, I am going to skip ahead to the final model after going through the process of removing non-significant independent variables. On your end, do it until you match up with my answer for learning purposes.", "Now is the time where we see how well we did with our model. Fortunately for us, R has an easy-to-use tool for this \u2014 the predict() function. We will now use our final logistic regression model, test it against our test data (the 20% we reserved earlier), then see how accurate we were!", "Now, I know that the process I am about to show you is not the shortest way to do this. It is, however, what I find to be the easiest to visualize step-by-step, which is better for supporting our goal of learning the technique.", "What we are going to do now is add the predictions we just made to our testing data, select the columns we actually want to make a smaller data set, round the predictions in a new column, and create a column of TRUE and FALSE boolean values so you can easily see behind the scenes.", "We can create a simple table using a couple functions from tidyverse to count our matches and misses.", "Well, ~66% isn\u2019t too bad, now is it? Just quickly dividing 564 right by the total of 856 gets us there.", "Another way we can check our results is to make a quick linear model using the lm() function and look at our R-squared values. We will get two variants of R-squared, but they will be close. That will tell us how much of our dependent variable (R, runs) is explained by our independent variable (roundedPredictions).", "We ended up with a similar answer of being ~63% right when checking this way.", "This project is intended to be educational, fun, and real. There are a lot of experiments we could do such as using different distributions, including post-season games that were not just the World Series, changing the year in which the data started, etc.", "At the end of the day, we used real data to make real predictions and got about 2/3 of them right. We also worked through step-wise regressions and learned a few non-standard tricks of R along the way.", "Let me know if you have any questions, comments, or ideas for future exploration. Enjoy using your new-found logistic regression skills to make predictions for other data!", "Owner at arimasecurityresearch.com.
