In these situations +/- 5 minutes can make a big difference so it\u2019s very important for customer satisfaction that the initial prediction is highly accurate and that any delays are communicated effectively.", "In this article, I\u2019ll discuss my experience building a (real-world) delivery time prediction model for a food delivery startup and how it came to give better predictions than our trained operations team.", "This article will touch on the technical topics of machine learning while focusing on the business knowledge required to create a well-functioning predictive model. Links to external resources for further reading will also be included for your reading pleasure.", "To start, let\u2019s formulate a problem statement that we can work with. This will help us to stay focused on the goal.", "We\u2019d like to build a model which will take data about a food delivery as input and then output the desired pick-up time to be communicated to drivers.", "As an input to our model, we have three categories of data that are typical for this sort of problem:", "An example of the data available for a delivery is:", "Since we have a lot of text, we\u2019ll need to process the data first to get it in a machine-ready format.", "The addresses can be processed using regular expressions to get more structured information. The key points are: floor, building, postcode, area, country.", "After the processing above, the building, postcode, areas and postcodes can be combined with the other variables to perform one-hot-encoding. One hot encoding will create many binary variables for each possible text. These numeric variables can then be fed into our models. You can read more of an introduction on one-hot-encoding here.", "To train the model we will use data from previous deliveries, this includes the predicted time for delivery and the actual time for delivery (the target variable for our exercise). For the purpose of this article, we will work with around 1000 data points.", "Before going any deeper, we should consider what models will be the best to solve the type of problem we have. The below diagram from the Scikit-Learn documentation gives a great way to decide which algorithm you should use.", "Let\u2019s have a look at what we know about our problem:", "With this in mind, we can follow along the chart above to arrive at Ridge Regression and SVR with a Linear Kernel. For the sake of simplicity, we\u2019ll just work with Ridge Regression as well as add a Random Forest Regressor to see how it performs differently with the data.", "If you\u2019re interested in some more background, you can read up on the algorithms on their respective pages in the Scikit-Learn documentation: Ridge Regression, SVR (Support Vector Regression) and Random Forest Regression.", "We should also pay attention to the metric that we will use to judge our model\u2019s effectiveness.", "A common metric that we can use to get a quick idea of our performance is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This tells us the average of the difference between our delivery time estimates and the actual delivery time.", "Going further, we can define two more domain-specific metrics:", "These two metrics tell us how often we\u2019ll upset users. If we\u2019re 15 minutes late or 25 minutes late, it doesn\u2019t really matter to the user, we\u2019re just really late. MAE doesn\u2019t realise this, and will count one worse than the other but in terms of the business, it\u2019s effectively the same thing and it\u2019s important our model understands that.", "Note: We\u2019ll actually use the inverse of these metrics (i.e. deliveries over 5 mins late) as they are a little easier to work with.", "So a quick recap: we know what we need to do, we know what data we have to do it with and we know they way we\u2019re going to do it \u2014 so let\u2019s get doing!", "Let\u2019s think about what is involved in food delivery. We can break it down into three principal components:", "We can predict the time taken for each component and then add these together to get the final delivery time.", "Alternatively, we could train a model to predict the entire delivery time. The reason we should break this up is to create specialty models which will have superior ability over one generic model. If we replace the models with people it makes sense. In your business development team you would have a person who knows the suppliers really well and how long they might take for delivery. In your client service team you would have someone who knows each client well and can predict how long the delivery might take based on their location and building. We\u2019re structuring our process with this in mind.", "Now that we have three stages, let\u2019s dive into them and build our models.", "When a driver arrives at a destination, he is required to find a carpark, pick-up the food and make it back to the car. Let\u2019s explore the potential complications that could occur during this process.", "For this part of the problem we\u2019ll use the following data points:", "After performing the processing as described above, the data can then be fed into our Scikit-Learn models resulting in the following:", "It can be seen that it if we use the basic metric of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) all of the models perform worse than the baseline model. However, if we look at the metrics which are more relevant to the food delivery business we see that each model has its benefits.", "The Random Forest model reduces the orders greater than 5 minutes late by almost 25%. The Linear Regressor does best in reducing the orders which are 10 minutes late, by around 10%. Interestingly, the ensemble model does fairly well in both metrics but notably, it has the smallest MAE out of the three models.", "When choosing the correct model, the business goals come first, dictating our choice of important metrics and thus, correct model. With this motivation, we\u2019ll stick with the Ensemble model.", "Estimating the travel time between destinations is a tricky task for many reasons; there are thousands of routes to choose from, traffic conditions that are constantly changing, road closures and accidents; all of which provide so much unpredictability into any model you could create.", "Luckily for us, there are a bunch of people who have thought long and hard about this problem and collect millions of data points to help better understand the environment. In comes Google.", "To predict point-to-point travel time we will call the Google Maps API with the known pick-up and drop-off points. The results returned include parameters taking into account traffic and worse-case-scenarios which we can be used as input to the model. A call to the API is quite simple, it looks like this:", "With this, we can get a highly accurate result for a problem that has already been well thought-through. It\u2019s important not to redo work,", "Always think if there is already a good enough solution to your problem, don\u2019t reinvent the wheel!", "Previous to implementing this model, our organisation was using the public Google Maps interface to predict the delivery times. As such, the performance of our new model for this part of the journey is identical to the baseline. As such, we won\u2019t calculate any comparisons here.", "An important side-note is that addresses aren\u2019t always properly formed! When querying Google Maps there\u2019s always a chance that they\u2019ll respond saying \u201cUh\u2026I don\u2019t know\u201d, to which we must have an answer. This is a great example of how humans and machines must work together. Whenever an address is not properly formed it\u2019s possible for an operator to step in and clarify the address or even call up the customer to clarify the information.", "With that, we can move on the third part of our model.", "Once the driver arrives at the location they must find a park, get the food to the right person and get a final sign-off. Potential issues along the way include:", "With all of these, postal code is a great indicator as it tells us if we can expect a business district or a residential area. We can also deep-dive further on the address. For example, if we have Level 40 it\u2019s quite obvious the delivery is in a big tower block and will likely have a complicated security process.", "For this part of the problem we\u2019ll use the following data points.", "After performing the typical processing and running our models we see the following:", "Here, we\u2019re able to see a reduction in MAE of 17%, \u2014 much better than before. Similarly, we see reductions in the orders greater than 5 mins late by a humungous 63%. On the other hand, the model does increase the number of orders late from 0% to 6%. Again, we\u2019re faced with a trade-off between models which both have their merits and we must let our business KPIs be the deciding factors.", "We can now combine our models together with the following formula:", "Note the addition of a hyperparameter this time. We\u2019ll add this in to take into account any other weird effects that we see in the data such as the pick-up time always been set 5 minutes earlier to meet the expectations of drivers. We\u2019ll set this parameter in order to minimise the final error metrics after calculating the combined results.", "Putting it all together, we get the final result:", "So our final model has a significant improvement over the baseline model in all metrics \u2014 we did it!", "Most importantly, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in orders greater than 10 mins late of almost 40%! We were able to achieve this by working on three separate models which were optimised to their own specific business problem. Combining them and fine-tuning at the last stage made sure we produced a model which is on the level of trained professionals.", "Having a model which gives even more accuracy would be great, but it would also require a lot more effort due to the law of diminishing returns. Instead, there are other solutions if we think more about the business case and less about machine learning.", "As you may recall from the start, this model is for catering delivery, which means we know the delivery time in advance. One simple way to avoid late deliveries is to take whatever value the model outputs and increase it to make sure that we\u2019re early enough.", "This is not a great solution because being too early also has a problem in that the food could go bad or be unprepared. However, it does bring up the point that we should consider the distribution of \u2018lateness\u2019 and \u2018earliness\u2019. Maybe it is better if we\u2019re 10 minutes early than 5 minutes late. With the metrics used up until this point, we didn\u2019t optimise for such scenarios and so we can reconsider this and optimise accordingly.", "Another thing to consider is how the model is presented to users. If a user is told you\u2019ll arrive at 2pm and you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll be frustrated. If you tell someone you\u2019ll be there from 1:45pm-2pm then you can aim to deliver at 1:50pm and if you\u2019re a little late you have leeway.", "It\u2019s always important to consider machine learning problems as a solution to an actual real-world problem \u2014 this context can often lead to \u2018improvements\u2019 that would otherwise be impossible from the model itself.", "One of the key wins for this model was being able to effectively differentiate between the different preparation times of the suppliers. That tells us that the suppliers must have very different performance.", "Digging deeper, it was found that drivers were spending 3x the time at a few suppliers. With this is information, moving back to the business world, it is possible to discuss with the suppliers and identify the problems which can reduce the time spent at these suppliers and by reducing the variation, improve the overall performance of the model.", "We started with a problem statement for predicting food delivery timings. We decided what data we would use and what sort of processing we should do. We thought about what would be the best models to solve our particular problem. We then broke our problem down into three components to build targeted models and finally put them together to create a fully-functioning predictive model. We didn\u2019t stop there though, we used our business knowledge to improve the effectiveness of our model.", "This resulted in a reduction of 40% in orders that were over 10 minutes late which can be translated directly into dollars saved in refunds. It also helped to lighten the load on the operations team meaning they could focus on more meaningful tasks such as improving supplier efficiencies.", "As outlined, this is the general procedure that can be used to apply machine learning to solve business problems. It\u2019s an approach that makes sure to get the basics right before later optimising for the extra few percent points of improvement. It\u2019s one that I\u2019ve used successfully and I hope you can too.", "If you enjoyed reading this, please don\u2019t forget to leave a clap or two, or three\u2026
