The results from big data can give us seductive quantitative insights that we can use to improve our business. Metrics make us more aware \u2014 the more we are \u201cchecking in\u201d on something, the more we can observe change over time. Metrics motivate us \u2014 it gives us something to \u201cshoot\u201d for. Metrics offer the binary of accomplishment or failure \u2014 if we measure up to an established goal, then we succeed. Otherwise, we fail.", "In business, metrics are used all the time. Metrics provide measurements about a particular process and provide a basis on which to improve, or \u201coptimize\u201d on. Some metrics include:", "Clearly, metrics matter. They play an important role in our lives and in business. They offer quantitative measurements that we can use to \u201ctrack\u201d our progress. But sometimes, metrics can be toxic. Sometimes, the metrics that we target to guide decision-making end up hurting us more than they help us.", "Charles Goodhart, an English economist, wrote what we know today as Goodhart\u2019s Law. The theory states:", "Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.", "\u201cWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\u201d", "Let\u2019s break this down. The first part of the line reads, \u201cWhen a measure becomes a target\u2026\u201d So for a certain metric being tracked \u2014 a bar is set as a goal for people to meet. The second half of the line reads, \u201c\u2026it ceases to be a good measure.\u201d Once people know that a reward awaits if the goal is met, then they will adjust their efforts to achieve the goal, even if the overall outcome for the business is bad.", "A simple example of Goodhart\u2019s Law is the CEO trying to maximize profit for his/her company. A data scientist finds a relationship between increased pay and employee performance. The data scientist then provides this insight to the CEO. Taking the data scientist\u2019s advice, the CEO incentivizes higher employee performance by offering a bonus only to people who meet a certain metric. All of the employees want the bonus, so the metric set by the CEO becomes the priority and everyone adjusts their habits at work accordingly. But Goodhart\u2019s Law tells us that this plan may backfire on the CEO, which would reflect poorly on the data scientist who provided the insight. When providing insights, data scientists must be mindful of unforeseen consequences that may result from targeted metrics.", "\u201cIncentive structures work\u2026So you have to be very careful of what you incent people to do, because various incentive structures create all sorts of consequences that you can\u2019t anticipate.\u201d", "Let\u2019s say that in a boutique cupcake shop, the owner wants to increase profit. The shop has so many customers that they need to bake more cupcakes than they normally can per day. The owner knows that the demand is there and needs to increase efficiency somehow. She doesn\u2019t have quite enough money to hire more bakers, so she decides to make her existing bakers more productive through a tantalizing monetary incentive \u2014 an extra $100 to the baker who bakes the most cupcakes at end of each week. Naturally, each baker wants the money and makes their \u201ccupcake count\u201d the highest priority. So throughout the first week of the incentive plan, customers are streaming in, the bakers are working furiously, and there are always plenty of cupcakes to buy. At the end of the week, the owner checks the books and notices that the profit went up. The owner is thrilled \u2014 it looks like the plan worked!", "However, when she checks her phone, the owner notices that the bakery got a lot of very negative reviews on Yelp over the past couple of days. Some customers complained about goopy, undercooked cupcakes \u2014 with raw egg in them. Some complained that the icing and decoration on top were messy. Others griped about rude customer service and \u201cfeeling rushed\u201d when trying to order and pay. Furthermore, when the owner checks in with her bakers, she notices that they look very tired. She also sees lots of burn marks on their hands and forearms. Upon giving the $100 incentive to the winning baker, a colleague baker hands his apron to the owner and resigns. He says that he doesn\u2019t feel safe working here and claims that the winning baker intentionally \u201csabotaged\u201d one of his bakes, just to win the bonus. As the weeks go by, more and more negative Yelp reviews hurt customer volume and in just a few weeks, the cupcake shop goes bankrupt.", "What once was a high-end cupcake boutique with happy, cooperative bakers crafting high-quality cupcakes, has suddenly produced frantic, backstabbing bakers with cupcake quantity as their only guiding principle. Cupcake quality, customer satisfaction, and employee satisfaction all plummeted. The business suffers multiple unforeseen consequences and ultimately fails as a result of metric incentivizing.", "While this example is a bit dramatic, it illustrates that metrics can be extremely useful, but also disastrous if we are over-focused on them. When a business obsesses over a metric, then other qualities of the business that may not be measured, but are perceivable, can be unintentionally sacrificed.", "So let\u2019s go back to the cupcake shop example. The owner wanted to make some more profit and determined that the number of cupcakes produced per baker was the metric to live and die by. But how about other subtler, but equally important qualities that ensured her business\u2019s success? What about the happiness of her bakers? What about the level of cooperation between her bakers? What about the safety of her bakers? These were underpinning qualities of the bakery\u2019s work culture that kept the business strong, stable, and successful, which really should be the goal at the end of the day.", "So in the context of Goodhart\u2019s Law, we can say that short-term business metrics such as monthly profit goals, the total number of hours worked by employees, and the total number of cupcakes baked, only serve a finite mindset. At its most basic level, measurement should provide a sense or feeling of progress. Through their work, people just want to feel that they are making progress and are advancing a cause that they care about. Businesses should recognize this.", "In \u201cThe Infinite Game\u201d Simon Sinek talks about business as a game that has no beginning and no end. A business can either play the game or stop playing when they are out of resources or are unwilling to continue playing. Sinek argues that good businesses understand that there is no \u201cwinning\u201d or \u201closing\u201d. In the infinite game, there are only businesses in the game and businesses that are not. In this vein, the author suggests that businesses should have an overarching mindset to be sustainable, flexible, and enduring, to continue \u201cplaying the game.\u201d This is opposed to being a business that obsesses over short-term metrics, beating their competition, and constantly racing to \u201cwin\u201d in the short-term.", "\u201c\u2026to succeed in the Infinite Game of business, we have to stop thinking about who wins or who\u2019s the best and start thinking about how to build organizations that are strong enough and healthy enough to stay in the game for many generations to come.\u201d -Simon Sinek, The Infinite Game", "Indeed, metrics matter for data scientists and businesses. However, we must be aware of the temptation of metrics. It isn\u2019t all about hitting the profit target. It isn\u2019t all about optimizing productivity. It isn\u2019t all about being \u201cnumber one\u201d and beating out all of your competitors. For businesses, it\u2019s about staying in the game for as long as you can.", "Your home for data science.
