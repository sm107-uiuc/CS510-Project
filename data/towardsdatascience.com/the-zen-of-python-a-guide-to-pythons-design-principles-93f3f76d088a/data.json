Tim Peters wrote these BDFL\u2019s (Benevolent Dictator For Life, a nickname of Python creator Guido van Rossum) 20 guiding principles for Python\u2019s design but the last aphorism was left for van Rossum to fill in.", "Till today, there are 19 aphorisms as Rossum said that the last aphorism is \u201csome bizarre Tim Peters in-joke.\u201d But, what do these aphorisms mean?. Let\u2019s crack it up!", "Beautiful is better than ugly.Explicit is better than implicit.Simple is better than complex.Complex is better than complicated.Flat is better than nested.Sparse is better than dense.Readability counts.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.Although practicality beats purity.Errors should never pass silently.Unless explicitly silenced.In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.Now is better than never.Although never is often better than *right* now.If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!", "You can open \u201cEaster Egg\u201d in your Python IDE by typing:", "Being a developer, writing code and making it run is not the only job to do. Python is known for its readability and simplicity. So, why tamper it? Writing clean and readable code is an art which is appreciated by other programmers and let them understand every bit.", "In the above code, there is no need to add \u201celse\u201d. It feels unnecessary at the point. Else, to make it better and clean, you can do something like:", "The aphorism speaks for itself. It means that it is better to make the code more verbose and explicit. Doing this will make the code readable. Hiding code functionality might have repercussions as other programs might not be able to understand the code.", "Why build a complex code when you can build a simpler one.", "You can do the in just two lines of code too.", "The above aphorism stated that simple is better than complex. And, now this one says \u201cComplex is better than complicated\u201d. It is getting confusing! A complex problem might require a complex technique to overcome it but it shouldn\u2019t be complicated.", "Complications in code make fellow programmers confused. Even if the program is complex, try keeping it on the simpler side which can be easily read and understand. Complicated code will suck effort and time! And, programmers can\u2019t afford to lose time.", "Coders like to create sub-modules for each functionality. Let\u2019s say, I build a module named \u201cspam\u201d and added submodule \u201cfoo\u201d and in it, I added \u201cbaz\u201d.", "Now, accessing another subpackage from baz will be like:", "Nesting and hierarchies do not add organization but bureaucracy!", "Sometimes we tend to do everything in just one line of code. You might get the correct output. But, what about readability? Can someone understand it without peeking into it for a long time?", "The same could have broken into parts and could have been written to get the same result. Spread out code is a delight and denser one infuriates co-workers.", "Do you go to StackOverflow every time you are stuck with your code? So, what code do you take a look at? Readable one or complicated piece!", "It is said that code is read more than written. So please, for the sake of readers starts writing code that it is readable as it is loved by our fellow programmers.", "Special cases aren\u2019t special enough to break the rules", "A programmer must adhere to good \u201cprogramming practices\u201d. Let\u2019s say, you import a library but it does not adhere to good programming practices. It must help you in getting your task done but keep in mind, libraries and languages should always follow the best \u201cprogramming practices\u201d and known for their consistency.", "Contradictory to the above \u201cSpecial cases aren\u2019t special enough to break the rules\u201d aphorism, this one suggests there might be an exception to the given set of rules. The keyword here is \u201cmight\u201d.", "When a function returns None, that is the time you are in the trap of silent errors. It is better to get errors but not silent errors. If you avoid such errors, it can lead to bugs, and further to crashes.", "That\u2019s why, using the \u201ctry-except\u201d statement becomes important in the code. Wherever you think something fishy can go on, you must add this combo and get to know about these silent errors.", "Sometimes you want to ignore an error in the code, the best practice is to make the error explicitly silenced.", "In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess", "Computers do what we want them to do. Still, these machines have made us superstitious. There is always a reason why a computer code is not behaving properly. Only and only your logic can fix it. So, break the temptation to guess and blindly try solutions until code works.", "There should be one \u2014 and preferably only one \u2014 obvious way to do it", "In Perl programming, there is a saying which says \u2014 \u201cThere\u2019s more than one way to do it!\u201d Using three-four codes to do the same thing is just like having double-edged sword. Not only it consumes time to write it but every fellow must be able to read your 3\u20134 methods without any issues. Flexibility in this practice isn\u2019t worth celebrating.", "Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you\u2019re Dutch", "Referring to Guido van Rossum, Python creator, this aphorism says that the language rule will not be easy to learn or recall unless and until you are the creator of the code. A joke referring to BDFL!", "This little aphorism says that code stuck in an infinite loop or in a never-ending loop is worse than having code that doesn\u2019t.", "Although never is often better than *right* now", "It is better to wait for a program to end than to terminate it early and get incorrect results. This aphorism and the above one \u201cNow is better than never\u201d resemble each other and contradict each other at the same time.", "If the implementation is hard to explain, it\u2019s a bad idea", "If you are explaining your code to someone and it is getting hard to explain it to your acquaintances or co-workers, then there is something wrong with your code. It is definitely not simple and is complicated!", "If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea", "Just opposite to above aphorism, this one simply says a simple, readable code is easy to explain. And, if you are able to do it, you are on the right track.", "Namespaces are one honking great idea \u2014 let\u2019s do more of those!", "In Python, a namespace is basically a system to have a unique name for each and every object. It is a great way to access every underlying object.", "The way Python organizes variables under the hood is just unbelievable. That\u2019s why namespaces are cool!", "Python is amazing! That\u2019s why millions of developers use it, code in it, analyze data with it, and build models using it.
