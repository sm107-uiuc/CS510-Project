It has different population, different population density in the bigger cities, different health systems, and so on. Therefore, what we can also do with Tableau is building a function, which will allow us to compare the countries while taking into account the population of the respective country. In other words, calculating the ratio per 100.000 people. Of course, this doesn\u2019t provide a completely accurate picture but maybe enough to see a trend. Moreover, with this tutorial, we are aiming to learn how to use Tableau and NOT how to draw conclusions based on medical and health data.", "IMPORTANT: Before we jump into the step-by-step guide, please familiarize yourself with these 10 considerations before you create another chart about COVID-19 by Tableau.", "In the logic map below, you can see the logic of Measures, Parameters and Calculated Fields, which we are going to create for our dashboard. We will have to create separate 2 Parameters and use their values as an input to display the value of a specific Measure in our dashboard. As you can see, the relationship between Parameter 1 and Parameter 2 is many-to-many and the relationship towards the Calculated field is one-to-two. In other words, a combination of each value of the two Parameters results in one Measure.", "Here is how the logic would look like using the Tableau SQL syntax:", "We will start from right to left \u2014 by creating the Measures we need. We have already available the Measures for All Cases, Recovered and Deaths from our data source (John Hopkins GitHub repository). The Measure for Active cases is a calculation, which is covered in my previous article, at step. 4.6. The ones that left are:", "In order to calculate these adjusted Measures, we need to have the population of each country. Here is a list of all the countries in the world by population, provided by Wikipedia. You can either scrape the webpage or just copy/paste the table in a Excel/Google Spreadsheet file and use a function to concatenate the text into a Tableau Calculation as shown below.", "Then copy/paste the Tableau Calculation (column F) and create the Calculated field in Tableau for the Population:", "Be sure to convert your new field for Population into a Measure and switch to a Number (whole) as a data type.", "In order to create these Measures, we need to use the following formula, e.g.:", "In order to add other countries, just extend this piece of calculation to all other countries you would like to have. You can use the same approach from step 1.1. and concatenate all countries into one piece of code. Once done, with the countries you would like to have, you can go through the same process of creating a Calculated field for the other Measures, as well:", "If you have completed the steps above, you should have the following Measures:", "This means we are ready with the right part of the logic map:", "To create the first Parameter, go to the white space at the left pane, right click and select Create Parameter.", "Change the data type to String, choose List from the Available Values options and put the values:", "Again, create a new Parameter, change the data type to string, select Available values from a list and use the following values:", "If done correctly, you should have two separate parameters. This means we have one more thing to create now \u2014 the calculated field.", "The next step is to create the function, which will show a specific measure, depending on the values we have with Parameter 1 and Parameter 2.", "Now, we have everything ready to add the components into the visualization. Right click on both Parameters and select \u201cShow Parameter Control\u201d. This will show you both cards, where you can select which metric you want to see, as well as, which version \u2014 adjusted or non-adjusted numbers.", "Then drag and drop the Measure \u201cMetric Selection\u201d on the rows shelf.", "Great job. In my final version of the dashboard, I have used an extension, which you download for free here.
