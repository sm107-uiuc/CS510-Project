However, people don\u2019t know the actual application of statistics in daily lives. Today I want to introduce a famous probability theorem in statistics that applied in real lives, Bayes\u2019 Theorem.", "The concept behind Bayes\u2019 Theorem is not difficult. It calculates the probability of an event based on known knowledge of conditions that are related to this event. This theorem describes how an observed event affects the probability of another event.", "Too abstract? Too difficult? Below I will give you an example.", "As of 8th April, there are around 1.4 million patients in Coronavirus [1] and there are around 7.7 billion people in the world [2]. So the infection rate is around 0.019%. Suppose a pharmaceutical company develops a test kit to test whether a person is infected with Coronavirus. Since the development is very rush, the accuracy of this test kit is not perfect. There is a 2% chance of showing positive on a normal person and a 1% chance showing negative on an infected person. The question is if you take the test and it shows positive, what is the probability that you are infected?", "The formula for Bayes\u2019 Theorem is as below", "In this formula, B is the event that we want to know the probability of occurrence, A is the observed event. P(B|A) means the probability of happening B given the occurrence of A. P(A) and P(B) are the probability of happening A and B respectively. And finally, P(A|B) means the probability of happening A given the occurrence of B. P(B) is also called prior probability because this does not take into account any information from A. And P(B|A) is also called posterior probability.", "In the example above, A represents getting a positive result from the test kit and B represents being infected from the Coronavirus.", "So easily P(B), aka the probability of being infected, is 0.019%.P(A|B) represents that the test kit shows a positive result given that the person is infected. As said before, there is a 1% chance of showing negative on an infected person. Therefore there is a 99% chance of showing positive on an infected person. Thus P(A|B) = 99%. The only missing puzzle is P(A), aka the probability of showing positive results.", "There are two situations of showing positive results. The first one is that the person is infected and the kit shows positive, and the second one is that the person is not infected but the kit still shows positive. Since we know the infection rate is 0.19%. Therefore the probability of a person not being infected is 1\u20130.019% = 99.981%. There is a 2% chance of showing positive on a normal person. By using simple probability rules, we can calculate P(A) = 99.81% * 2% + 0.19% * 99% = 2.01843%.", "After plugging in all figures to Bayes\u2019 Theorem, P(B|A) = 0.93%. This means the person has only less than 1% of actually infected.", "At this moment, you may be very surprised that the result is very small. And this must not be acceptable in real life. Therefore more than one attempt is performed to verify the result. In this case, P(B) will become 0.93% because the probability of being infected is updated by the result from the first attempt. Without changing other variables, P(B|A) will greatly increase to 31.77%. In the third attempt, the result reaches 95.8% which is almost sure the person is infected.", "This simple example reveals the time-consuming procedure of testing a disease for higher accuracy. As a result, although many countries have already contributed extra resources to increase numbers of laboratory technicians and enhance efficiency, only a few numbers of countries can carry out massive screenings on their citizens. Therefore, stay at home. This does not only reduce your chance of being infected but also to reduce the burden in diagnosis.", "Statistics may be too complicated for everyone. However, it is widely used in our daily lives. I hope this article can help you know more about Bayes\u2019 Theorem.
