But, although pretty promising, these Generative Adversarial Networks are very challenging to train, and the data generated by them does not have enough quality to be used for ML workloads as a replacement of real data. There are many other interesting GAN architectures, some of them introducing improvements for more stable training and less prone to mode collapse, and today I\u2019ll be covering the Wasserstein GAN.", "The Wasserstein GAN is considered to be an extension of the Generative Adversarial network introduced by Ian Goodfellow. WGAN was introduced by Martin Arjovsky in 2017 and promises to improve both the stability when training the model as well as introduces a loss function that is able to correlate with the quality of the generated events. Sounds good right? But what are the core differences introduced with WGAN?", "Instead of using the concept of \u201cDiscriminator\u201d to classify or predict the probability of a certain generated event as being real or fake, this GAN introduces the concept of a \u201cCritic\u201d that in a nutshell, scores the realness or fakeness of a given event. This change is mainly due to the fact that while training a generator, theoretically we should seek the minimization of the distance between the distribution of the data observed in the training dataset and the distribution observed in the generated examples.", "We can summarize the major differences introduced by WGAN as the following:", "The changes mentioned before and introduced with WGAN brings a series of benefits while training these networks:", "Now what we\u2019ve completed the imports let\u2019s go for the networks: the Generator and the Critic.", "Similarly to the Generator, I\u2019ve decided to go for a simple Network for the Critic. Here I\u2019ve a 4 Dense layers network with also Relu activation. But, I want to emphasize a bit here the last code line. Different from Vanilla GAN where we add we usually add this as the last layer of the network:", "It uses the sigmoid function in the output layer of the discriminator, which means that it predicts the likelihood of a given event to be real. When it comes to WGAN, the critic model requires a linear activation, in order to predict the score of the \u201crealness\u201d for a given event.", "As I've mentioned, the main contribution of the WGAN model is the use of a new loss function \u2014 The Wasserstein loss. In this case, we can implement the Wasserstein loss as a custom function in Keras, which calculates the average score for the real and generated events.", "The score is maximizing the real events and minimizing the generated ones. Below the implementation of Wasserstein loss:", "Another important change is the introduction of the weight clipping for the Critic Network. In this case, I\u2019ve decided to defined to extend the Keras constraint class, with the below method:", "Now that we\u2019ve covered the major changes, you can find the full implementation of WGAN in this open GitHub repository, supported by YData.", "Although WGAN brings a lot of benefits to the area of data generation, it still has some challenges that need to be solved:", "Since its publication, and based on the fact that WGAN major issues are related to the chosen method for weights clipping, some have been the suggested improvements, being one of the most promising and used the gradient penalties\u2014 WGAN-GP article.", "Now that we\u2019ve covered the most theoretical bits about WGAN as well as its implementation, let\u2019s jump into its use to generate synthetic tabular data.", "For the purpose of this exercise, I\u2019ll use the implementation of WGAN from the repository that I\u2019ve mentioned previously in this blog post.", "The dataset that I'll be using for this purpose is one pretty familiar among the Data Science community \u2014 the Credit Fraud dataset.", "For the purpose of demonstration, I\u2019ve decided to go for a smaller sample of this dataset. In this case, I\u2019ve decided to only synthesize the fraudulent events.", "After a few preprocessing steps on the data, we are ready to feed our data into WGAN.", "In other GAN architectures, such as DCGAN, both the generator and the discriminator model must be updated in an equal amount of time. But this is not entirely true for the WGAN. In this case, the critic model must be updated more times than the generator model.", "That\u2019s why we have an input parameter, that I\u2019ve called the n_critic \u2014 this parameter controls the number of times the critic gets update from every batch of the generator. In this case, I\u2019ve set it to 3 times. But you can set for others and check the impacts in the end results.", "When compared to the training process of other GAN architectures, while using the same dataset, it is possible to perceive that indeed WGAN training was less prone to instability and producing results that are closer to the real dataset distribution, although not perfect.", "I\u2019ve also decided to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, by leveraging both PCA and TSNE algorithms with the choice of 2 components, in order to ease the visualization of the data. Below you can find the plots, where I compare the results of both PCA and TSNE for the WGAN generated data and the original one. It is clear, that WGAN failed to fit some of the behavior captured in the original data, nevertheless the results are quite promising.", "The results shown in this article are still very simple, in comparison with what can be done and achieved with GANs to generate synthetic data with real-value to be used for Machine Learning tasks and shared in a privacy-preserving manner. Compared to other architectures, the introduction of Wasserstein as the loss function, definitely help to make the training more stable and less sensitive to the choice of the Networks architectures and hyperparameters.", "For those that are curious about generating synthetic tabular data and want to have a try, have a look into this GitHub repository. We\u2019ll be updating it with new GAN architectures as well as new dataset examples, and we invite you to collaborate.", "Fabiana Clemente is CDO at YData.", "YData provides a data-centric development platform for Data Scientists to work to high-quality and synthetic data.", "Your home for data science.
