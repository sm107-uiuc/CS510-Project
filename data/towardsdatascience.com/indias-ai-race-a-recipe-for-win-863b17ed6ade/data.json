Indian university or institutes are not yet top notch AI research entities, either measured by citations or other measures such as winning prestigious AI contests. Most recently, Chinese scientists have demonstrated and claimed \u201cQuantum Supremacy\u201d in a race that seems to upend Google and USA.", "However, it is not too late, nor is it to India\u2019s disadvantage not to have the top-notch algorithm developments taking place outside of the country. The reality is that most useful algorithms make it to the public domain quickly and are widely available.", "Algorithms are not hard to get, data is.", "Indeed one could argue that there could be advantages in not getting into the algorithm race, at least as a short term winning strategy. We can let others do the complex and expensive job of creating the algorithms, and focus on India-specific use cases and data instead.", "India\u2019s national goal should to turn data into useful \u201cknowledge\u201d , specific to solving India\u2019s own problems", "In data science, \u201cknowledge\u201d comes from general purpose algorithms and good quality of data. Creating good quality data, which can be anywhere between 5\u201330% of the total data (and rarely more), takes up the majority of the preparation time for any AI work.", "Availability of a large amount of country-specific, contextual, clean training data could be a major source for creating useful, actionable knowledge about data. Hence,", "Rather than focusing on winning the Algorithm race, India should focus on creating a data infrastructure in key areas", "Think of data being the oil (you have heard the cliche before) and algorithm being the refinery. Oil is the asset: the latest refinery can be always be bought or imported.", "The real win for India would be creating a data infrastructure that will improve the quality of life at an everyday level, and significantly enhance governance. This would elevate the interoperability which in turn would reduce the operational cost and serve as a \u201ctemplate\u201d for developing a post-COVID global AI economy.", "This bodes well with India\u2019s well known strength in process driven white-collar and technology jobs, a heritage that goes back to the days of early call centers, business process outsourcing entities, and software development industries. Collectively, they trained millions of people and built formidable, world-class industries that powered the developed world.", "Post-COVID, this proposition is even more important", "Significant increase in data usage in India during COVID has resulted in a significant increase of data. Digital data in India was around 40,000 petabytes in 2010 and this number is projected to shoot up to 2.3 million petabytes by 2020, twice as fast as the worldwide rate. Also, the Atmanirbhar Bharat (English: Self Reliant India) initiative by the government is focused on localisation of manufacturing, products and technology, included data privacy of citizens.", "The key to success would be: solving the most pressing problems in the private sector, public and government services and taking a 5-year view to plan and resource it", "Projects for private sector could be:", "Our estimate is that building AI-based product for associating a location correctly for an address in India can add almost 0.5% of the GDP, or about 12 billion dollars", "Projects for public services could be:", "Projects for government services could be:", "It\u2019s not that hard, India has already done it before", "India has also built its world class payment platform called UPI \u2014 the Unified Payment Interface. The results are dramatic \u2014 UPI did more transactions in the past 18 months than the country\u2019s credit card did in 18 years.", "Besides uplifting 100\u2019s of millions of people, these Planetary scale platforms are now enabling over nine thousand startups to build products and services on top \u2014 expanding the Digital economy rapidly.", "If India could build a public infrastructure for unique digital identify for a billion plus people (\u201cAadhaar\u201d), an open payment system (\u201cUnified Payments Interface\u201d or UPI) that enabled direct payment of government benefits to 100 of millions of poor, India can do the same for Public AI infrastructure.", "Each country will chart its unique course for the AI race. India\u2019s strength plays in a large workforce that can take part in collecting and codifying data for consumption and for creating large scale technology infrastructure.", "We should play to that, rather than focusing on algorithm games like USA or China. While doing so, we should also take advantage of the technologies that protect user privacy and enable generation of unbiased AI decisions to ensure that the recommendations and the outcomes are acceptable in a country as diverse as India.", "The journey is only 1% done and the clock resets on every single day, enabling us to start the race afresh.", "Acknowledgement: the author acknowledges Ritisha Soni\u2019s help in research and contribution to this article.", "Epilogue: I write on Data Science, Machine Learning, Product Management and Career Success Stories.
