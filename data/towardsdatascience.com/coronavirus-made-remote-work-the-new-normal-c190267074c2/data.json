Coronavirus, and the necessity of flattening the curve, has led to its explosion.", "21st-century technology tools have long made it possible for jobs to be location-agnostic, but workers have remained tethered to their cubicles \u2014 until now.", "As it has become clear that flattening the curve is an imperative, offices have shuttered and the future of remote work has begun globally. Social distancing has revealed a robust technology infrastructure that makes remote work not only possible, but effective.", "With remote work becoming the status quo, learning to live and work in the same space will take practice. For three years, I\u2019ve worked remote as a Research & Analytics Consultant. I\u2019ve learned, through many pitfalls, what it takes to stay productive and mentally well.", "While the remote lifestyle is not a panacea for the future, it\u2019s a necessity today, as is the imperative to take care of each other, even while we\u2019re apart.", "TL;DR Settling into this new way of working takes work. Consider these four essential behaviors to stay productive and mentally well while working from home:", "When the novelty of working remotely wears off, a surprising realization is common: it is, in fact, possible to miss a cubicle.", "Born from Taylorism, the 20th-century philosophy where efficiency was king, the cubicle has evolved into a despised symbol of office work. But why? The cubicle was designed to enforce workers\u2019 focus and productivity, and it worked.", "Yet, the 20th century home was designed to support different aims entirely: refueling, gathering, and recharging after a long day at work.", "This difference matters. Considering the functional space of your office vs. your home \u2014 and delineating the two \u2014 is a critical first juncture in remote life.", "Before you focus on your work itself, focus on defining a workspace in your home.", "Two aspects of your work from home setup have an outsized impact on your work and your well-being: environmental factors in the physical space and tools and technologies to do the job.", "Let\u2019s start with the environmental factors.", "The first order of business is to carve out a physical space where you will work that is distinct from the space where you relax after work. Be it a desk or an end table, it is not the size of your workstation, but the sentiment of carving out space to work, that matters most.", "An increasingly robust body of research suggests the environmental factors, such as light, air, and temperature where you work have a significant impact on well-being and productivity. A 2019 study on workplace wellness by View found that one in three reported losing over 60 minutes of work every day due to environmental factors like temperature, lighting, air quality, and acoustics. That\u2019s an astounding eight hours of work a week lost.", "Consider these same environmental factors in your home and what needs to be modified to improve your mental health and productivity. For example:", "When you\u2019ve considered the environmental factors in your home and created the space where you\u2019ll work, pivot to how you will work: what is your arsenal of tools and technologies to do the work that positively impact your productivity?", "We\u2019re talking about more than a laptop. Instead, consider what tools augment and extend how you work to make work more efficient and comfortable. For example:", "Identifying the tools you need in your workspace won\u2019t happen all at once, but investing in yourself and how you work will pay dividends in your productivity and mental well-being.", "2. Rain or shine, go outside", "Americans spend 90% of their time indoors, according to a 2018 study from Alan Hedge at Cornell. Without a commute, remote workers hover far closer to 100% of their time spent indoors.", "Intentionality is critical to working remote and remaining sane. The benefits of an outdoor walk around the block to clear your mind and de-stress are well-documented in science and anecdotally in history.", "It\u2019s a common sense recommendation, but it requires intentional effort. Hold yourself accountable to getting outside during the day. For example:", "3. Routines will keep you sane", "Working remote often means working alone. Office routines that revolved around social interaction no longer break up the day.", "Routines are hard to establish but easy to stop. Consider this: 40% of a human\u2019s actions during the day are the result of habits, not decisions, a fact Charles Duhigg underscored in his bestseller, The Power of Habit. Habits unfold with little thought or effort, but routines require discipline. Consider this: Bad habits often creep back into life when there are disruptions to one\u2019s routine. Shifting from office to remote work is a prime example.", "Without the external motivators of office life \u2014 routines that kept bad habits at bay can easily devolve. At home, extrinsic motivators endemic to the office environment are suddenly gone. Suddenly, intrinsic motivators are the driving force in keeping you productive, but more importantly, strong mental and physical health.", "When routines devolve, so do productivity and sleep, giving rise to stress, bad eating, and lethargy, according to research from Northwestern Medicine.", "The importance of a routine in your day while working from home is not a revelatory finding, but it merits mentioning because routines are easily lost and painfully re-established.", "As you settle into remote life, it\u2019s easy to luxuriate in the newfound freedom causing daily routines to disintegrate. Start by focusing on the basics. For example:", "Routines for remote workers are essential for mental well-being, especially amidst this prolonged period of social distancing.", "4. Exercise your creative juices to bring people together \u2014 virtually", "When teams go remote, building a culture that normalizes virtual collaboration and learning should be a top priority.", "The informal water cooler talk and casual conversations in office cubes is lost when workers go remote. Clear channels for communication, collaboration, and learning, teams and organizations to maintain culture must remain top of mind.", "As we settle into the rhythm or remote work, there\u2019s an unparalleled opportunity for employees to step up as leaders in bringing teams together to collaborate and learn.", "Consider creative ways to leverage existing business operations tools/technologies to create connection points across your team or workforce. For example:", "Create opportunities to learn and grow together from afar.", "Take care of yourself and each other in this virtual landscape.", "Building the \u201cmuscle\u201d to stay productive and mentally healthy while working from home takes practice. Flourishing in this new normal comes down to how you shape your habits and your environment.", "Amidst the Covid-19 crisis, there is all the more reason to focus on setting yourself up for success in the remote landscape: when you take care of yourself, you are better able to care for those in your community.", "Your home for data science.
