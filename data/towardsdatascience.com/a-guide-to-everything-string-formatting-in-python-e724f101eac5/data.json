It allows the computer to interact and communicate with the world, such as printing instructions or reading input from the user. The ability to manipulate and formate strings give the programmer the power to process and handle text, for example, extract user input from websites forms, data from processed text, and use this data to perform activities such as sentimental analysis. Sentimental analysis is a subfield of natural language processing that allows the computer to classify emotions \u2014 negative, positive, or neutral \u2014 based on a piece of text.", "\u201cAll sentiment is right; because sentiment has a reference to nothing beyond itself, and is always real, wherever a man is conscious of it.\u201d \u2014 David Hume", "Python is one of the main programming languages used to analyze and manipulate data next to R. Python is used in data analytics to help access databases and communicate with them. It is also useful in importing and exporting data using different web scraping techniques. Once this data is obtained, Python is used to clean and prepare data sets before they are fed to a machine-learning algorithm.", "There are five ways you can use Python to format strings: formatting strings using the modulo operator, formatting using Python\u2019s built-in format function, formatting using Python 3.7 f-strings, formatting manually, and finally using template strings. We will cover each one of these methods as well as when to use each of them.", "If you wrote code using C or C++ before, this would look very familiar to you. In Python, we can use the modulo operator (%) to perform simple positional formatting. What I call placeHolder here, represents the control specs for formatting and converting the string. The % tells the interpreter that the following characters are the rules for converting the string. The conversion rules include information about the desired width of the result formatted string, the type of the result, and the precision of it \u2014 in case of floats.", "This type of string formatting is sometimes referred to as the \u201cold style\u201d formatting. The placeHolder can refer to values directly or can be specified using keywords arguments.", "If we try to print this string, we will get Yesterday I bought 10 bananas for only 2.67$! .", "As you can see here, I had three placeHolders for three values, the first integer, the string \u2014 bananas \u2014 and the price of the bananas, which is a float. When referring to the float, I decided that a precision of two is all I needed; that\u2019s why only 67 is displayed after the decimal point.", "In the previous example, we replaced the placeHolders with the values directly. There is another way we can achieve this mapping, which is through using keyword arguments or by passing a dictionary.", "Using this method, we need to use the {} instead of the (). Because of that, we can also use a dictionary directly to fill in the placeHolders.", "The complete code for this section:", "In Python 3, a new method to regulate the % operator syntax was introduced to the language. This is done using the built-in format method, also known as the \u201cnew style\u201d formatting. Using the format method has many commonalities with using the % operator. Let\u2019s consider rewriting some of the examples from before:", "We can summarize the differences between the % operator syntax and the format method as:", "However, if we want to pass a dictionary to the format string, we will need to modify the reforestation slightly. Instead of passing the name of the dictionary, we need to pass a pointer to the dictionary, for example:", "Moreover, we can use the same conversion rules of the % operator that can be used in the format method as well. In Python 3 and up to 3.6, the format method is preferred to the % operator approach. The format method presented a powerful approach to format strings; it didn\u2019t complicate the simple case \u2014 such as the examples above \u2014 but, at the same time providing new levels to how we format strings.", "The complete code for this section:", "This, in my opinion, the fanciest and most elegant method to format strings. The f-string was presented in Python 3.8 as a more straightforward approach to string formating. Before we get into f-strings, let\u2019s quickly cover the three types of strings in Python 3.8 and up.", "f-strings present a simple way to format strings by directly embedding expression into the string. Let\u2019s revisit the examples from before, one more time.", "If we want to rewrite this formatting using f-strings, it will look like:", "One way f-string simplifies string formatting is, we can directly pass iterables \u2014 dictionaries, lists, etc. \u2014 to the string, as follows:", "You can also perform simple arithmetic or logic operations within an f-string directly.", "f-strings provide much more freedom to the options we can use inside the string we want to format, such as list indexing, calling list or dictionary methods, or general iterables functions \u2014 e.g., len, sum, min, and max. We can also use conditional statements in an f-string:", "The complete code for this section:", "Manual formatting refers to using standard string methods to format strings. Mostly, we use the rjust, ljust, and center to justify the strings. The rjust method right-justifies a string given a specific width by padding it with spaces on the left. The ljust adds padding to the right and the center method adds padding on both sides of the string. These methods do not modify the original string; they instead return a new modified string. There is another string method that can be used to format strings, which is the zfill method. This method pads a string with a numeric value with zeros on the left.", "Template strings are an alternative to the % operator, but instead of the %, template strings use the $ sign. Both methods provide what we refer to as substitution formatting. Template strings are not built-in in Python, hence to use them, we need to first import the string module. Template strings have three rules:", "These rules ad more are already defined in the string module, so once imported, you can go ahead and use them without the need to define them.", "The template string has two main methods: the substitute method and the safe_substitute method. Both methods take the same argument, which is the substitute mapping. Moreover, both methods return a new formatted string, you can think of the template object as the blueprint for how future strings will be formatted. For example:", "To see the difference between the substitute and the safe_substitute methods, let\u2019s try using a dictionary as our substitution mapping.", "Assume our dictionary doesn\u2019t have all the keys we need for the mapping, using the substitute method will give a keyError. Here's where safe_substitute comes to the help, if this method didn't find the correct key, it will return a string with the placeHolder for the wrong key. For example, this code:", "Will return Hello John, your current balance is $how dollars. where if I had used the substitute method, I would've gotten an error.", "The complete code for this section:", "In this article, we covered five different ways you can use to format a string in Python:", "Each method has its usage advantages and disadvantages. A general rule of thumb, as put by Dan Badar, if the string you\u2019re formatting is user-obtained, template strings are the way to go. If not, use f-strings if you\u2019re on Python 3.7 or the format function elsewhere.", "Your home for data science.
