Have you been 3/4ths of the way done with a data warehouse migration only to discover that you don\u2019t know which data assets are right and which ones are wrong? Is your analytics team lost in a sea of spreadsheets, with no life vests in sight?", "If you answered yes to any of these questions, you\u2019re not alone. Over the past few years, I\u2019ve spoken with hundreds of data teams both energized and overwhelmed by the potential of their company\u2019s data assets, responsible for maintaining an ever-evolving ecosystem of data assets.", "We call this the \u201cYou\u2019re Using THAT Table?!\u201d Problem, and it\u2019s more common than you think.", "Here are three tell-tale signs you might be experiencing it:", "As data teams increasingly make the shift from on-prem data warehouses to Snowflake, Redshift, and other cloud warehouses or between cloud warehouses, the ability to know which data is valuable and which data can go the way of the Dodos becomes evermore important.", "Unfortunately, data validation and cross-referencing is often handled manually, which is costly, time-intensive, and hard to scale. One customer, a data team leader at a global financial services company currently migrating to Snowflake, revealed that they \u201care manually mapping tables in Redshift to reports in Tableau so we know what to migrate over to Snowflake and Looker.\u201d", "Oftentimes when data teams migrate from Redshift to Snowflake, they end up resorting to a manual gap analysis between copies of the same tables in both data warehouses because \u201cknowing which reports are downstream from the table will help us identify and prioritize the migration, or deprecate a table that we don\u2019t need anymore.\u201d", "A second and just as common pain point for data teams is not knowing what data is most useful, let alone at all usable.", "If you and your team have asked any of the following questions, they may be in the midst of a mystery not even Scoobie Doo can solve. Here is a list of common data discovery questions. Maybe they\u2019ll resonate:", "When these questions are frequently asked, there\u2019s a clear lack of both data trust and data discovery at your company, which takes a toll on your company\u2019s ability to leverage data as a competitive advantage.", "Like technical debt, data debt refers to data assets that are outdated, inaccurate, or otherwise taking up precious storage space in your data warehouse. It\u2019s an all-too-common occurrence and bogs down even the most advanced data teams, making it difficult to surface timely and relevant insights.", "What does data debt look like in practice? Here are three strong indicators:", "Data teams are tasked with creating visibility into the business via data-driven insights, but when it comes to their own operations, they\u2019re often flying blind. Instead, teams need a single view into the health of their data, Key Assets which identify the most critical data tables and datasets in your data warehouse.", "Fortunately, the best data reliability and discoverability (catalog) solutions are already incorporating them into their products. By leveraging machine learning, these solutions intelligently map your company\u2019s data assets while at-rest without requiring the extraction of data from your data store, generating a \u201cKey Assets dashboard\u201d.", "But how can teams identify their Key Assets? Among other variables, I suggest that teams look for tables and datasets that are:", "Additionally, Key Assets should include an \u201cImportance Score\u201d for each individual data asset. This score is a composite of key metrics about data usage that indicate which assets matter most to your organization. The higher the score, the more likely the asset is a significant resource for your team.", "As data architectures become increasingly siloed and distributed, I see a lot of potential in Key Assets and similar solutions for optimizing data discovery and restoring trust in data, including:", "Spearheading a data warehouse migration can be a simultaneously exciting and daunting task. More often than not, data teams are forced to handle data validation manually. With Key Assets, teams can automatically identify which tables are in-use and relied on, and which ones can be deprecated, making this process that much quicker.", "It\u2019s likely that analysts across your company are making v1, v2, v3, and v4s of every data set under the sun (or rather, in your warehouse); finding and knowing which ones are actually relevant and important will make all the difference when you\u2019re putting together critical analysis. Bonus points if users can also search for specific data assets. Key Assets support both functionalities.", "Key Assets makes it easier to clean up \u201cjunk\u201d tables and pipelines, allowing you to reduce data debt in your data warehouse or lake by highlighting which data tables are widely used and which ones are outdated or even inaccurate. Traditional methods of data debt reduction rely heavily on code-intensive integrations (i.e., open source) or ad-hoc SQL queries wrapped around workflow orchestration tools. Key Assets provide an easier and quicker way to pull these metrics and more.", "From ingestion to analytics, end-to-end data observability is a must-have for any serious data engineering team. By understanding where your important data lives and how it\u2019s being used at all stages of the pipeline, tables and data sets that have been deprecated can be ignored and key tables surfaced.", "In my opinion, a smart but secure Key Assets dashboard should be generated automatically, leveraging machine learning algorithms that learn and infer your data assets by taking a historical snapshot of your data ecosystem, without actually accessing the data itself.", "An automatically generated, single source of truth that such as Key Assets is a logical conclusion for understanding how tables are utilized, preventing the effects of data downtime from manifesting in your data pipelines.", "With Key Assets, users can search for and identify which data assets need to be closely monitored for likely abnormalities or issues, and which ones can be put on the back-burner. Such a solution can help teams automatically mute noisy alerts for outdated data and keep tabs on only the data assets that are actively used by the business.", "I don\u2019t know about you, but I can\u2019t wait till the \u201cYou\u2019re Using THAT Table?!\u201d Problem is a thing of the past.", "Want to identify your own data organization\u2019s Key Assets?
