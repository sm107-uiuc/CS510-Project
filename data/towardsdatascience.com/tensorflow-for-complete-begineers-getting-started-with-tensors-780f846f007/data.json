But for someone just starting with Tensorflow, the experience can be scary and daunting, as the terminologies and usage of the beautiful library can be confusing for complete beginners. When I first started learning Tensorflow, I faced similar challenges, and hope to simplify some of the intricacies through this article. This article requires a basic understanding of Python to get a clearer picture of Tensorflow.", "The basic (and simplest) way to describe Tensorflow is that it is a cool library in Python (and probably other programming languages as well) which allows us to create computational graphs to develop neural network models. The basic element which comprises Tensorflow objects is a Tensor, and all computations which are performed occur in these Tensors. So literally (in my words), these Tensors flow in an orderly manner when you develop any neural network model, and give rise to the final outputs when evaluated. So yes, learning what tensors really are and how we can use them is the first step to getting started with Tensorflow.", "We are all familiar with data types in programming, right? 1, 2, 3 etc. are integers, numbers with decimal points (1.5,3.141,5.2555 etc.) are floating point values and another common one is strings (such as \u201cHello. How are you today?\u201d). When we have a collection of multiple elements together, we generally term that as a list (e.g. [1,4,7]).", "A collection of lists can be used to develop a matrix/matrices like this one:", "Now, let\u2019s come to Tensors- they are basically higher dimensional representations/generalisations of conventional matrices and vectors. It could even be a 1-D matrix, a 2-D matrix, a 4-D matrix, or an n-dimensional matrix! So we can have multi-dimensional arrays beyond a single list in a Tensor. That\u2019s it- that is what a tensor really is in the most basic sense. Just like we can assign variables values in conventional programming, we could do the same in Tensorflow. Just that there is a specialised way to do it. Similar, just like you could perform multiple operations on conventional variables (or constants) in programming, we can do that with Tensors. We can slice tensors and select a portion of its elements, have various data types for tensors (integers, floating point, strings etc.) and much more.", "Getting started with using Tensorflow in Python", "The very first step is to install the beautiful library! pip is all you need here. Note that if you\u2019re using Google Colab (which is very similar to Jupyter notebooks in Python), you don\u2019t even need to install this library as it is already installed and available ready for use. Thank you, Google!", "As we are using Colab for this article, the message \u201crequirement already satisfied\u201d is shown in the output.", "Tensorflow, at present, has an older version of type 1.x, while the latest releases use 2.x. So let\u2019s select the current tensorflow version.", "Let\u2019s import the tensorflow module using the golden keyword import! And yes, you could check what version of the library you\u2019re using by simply printing its version attribute.", "Now, let\u2019s get started with creating Tensors. We would create some for int, float and string here. Notice the specialised way of creating tensors using tf.Variable attribute. This means that we are creating a Tensor which would be a variable nature, so we can change/modify its values by performing specialised operations, just like we would do in conventional programming with variables. Note that while we would have used int, float and string to declare the corresponding variables for such data types in conventional programming, we will use tf.int16 (which means we are defining a 16 bit integer), tf.float32 (to define a 32 bit floating point value) and tf.string to do so in Tensorflow. Note that we could also use tf.float16, tf.int32 and so on, depending on the requirements for the value we want to store. If you have ever used C++, you would be aware of things like int, short int, long long int, float, double etc. used to declare variables with smaller (or larger) number of bits, so we just do something similar here in Tensorflow.", "And now, it\u2019s very easy to print out the values of these Tensors!", "We can determine the shape and rank of the Tensors, like you might have heard in mathematics modules at school. If not, shape simply refers to the number of elements which are contained along each dimension of the tensor. While rank is the deepest level of nesting within the Tensor. Going into some code might make it more clear.", "So we get a shape of 0 right? It just means that these are scalar values rather than lists or nested lists.", "You can see that the list_tensor1 has 4 elements, so that\u2019s what gives it a shape of (4,). Note that (4,) is nothing but (4,1), just showing 4 elements within a single list. Next, for list_tensor2, observe a shape of (2,3) signifying that we have a nested list- with 2 lists, each containing 3 elements.", "Similarly, if you look at the rank, you see a rank of 1 for the list_tensor1, simply because we just have a single list, no nesting here! Now, for list_tensor2, you can see a rank of 2- signifying that we have a level 2 nesting i.e. a big list contains more lists. Had it been something like one big list, contains another small list, and that small list contains more smaller lists, we would have had a rank of 3. Hope this would make it clear.", "We can change the shape of the tensors (of course, until it is mathematically valid) using tf.reshape. Again, note the specialised way to do this using Python.", "And you get the following outputs. It's too long to probably give a read, but I guess if you check out the Colab Notebook here, it would be clearer. The basic thing happening here is that if you specify [6] here for the shape, tensorflow would reshape your tensors to have 6 elements with a single dimension (so it would be simply a 1D list). If you do a [2,8,1], it would make 2 lists, each with 8 elements. You could also do [8,2,1]- creating 8 lists, each with 2 elements as you would see. If you don\u2019t want to go into specifying the whole of dimensions for the reshape yourself, you could as well simply use a -1. So, a reshape of [1,-1] would reshape the list_tensor3 to create reshaped_list_tensor3, so 1 list with ??? Yes, 16 elements. So note that while you could use reshape however you want, it is essential to ensure that the total number of elements after reshape do not change during the process.", "You could create a Tensor full of 1s (or 0s) using special commands tf.ones or tf.zeros. And then, similar operations could be performed on them too.", "Now, we come to slicing. Just like you could slice and extract some elements from a matrix or a Python list for instance, you could do the same with Tensors. See an example below, wherein, we first create a onefull tensor (my name for a tensor full of 1 values only) and another with zerofull. The dimensions of the tensors you want to create go within the square brackets [], so a [4,4,4,1] creates a 4D tensor, while a [5,5] creates a 2D tensor- with 5 rows and 5 columns (which is nothing but a matrix) in the simplest sense.", "Some slicing operations are shown below for these created tensors. So that you can get the elements you like from the tensors and not consider those you don\u2019t like :-)", "And here is the nice output (better readable in the Colab notebook).", "And again, some cool output (basic but yes, simplest things are the coolest).", "And that\u2019s it. Hope you enjoyed reading this article. Thanks for the read, and apologies for any typos/bugs if any. I hope to cover more on Tensorflow in my next posts.", "If you wish to, you can connect with me on LinkedIn at http://linkedin.com/in/joyjitchatterjee/", "Your home for data science.
