I had a similar experience with Bias & Variance, in terms of recalling the difference between the two. And the fact that you are here suggests that you too are muddled by the terms.", "So let\u2019s understand what Bias and Variance are, what Bias-Variance Trade-off is, and how they play an inevitable role in Machine Learning.", "Let me ask you a question. Why do humans get biased when they do? Or what motivates them to show some bias every now and then?", "I\u2019m sure you had a good answer or many good answers. But to summarise them all, the most fundamental reason that we see bias around us is \u2014 ease of mind.", "Being humans, it\u2019s easy to incline our thoughts and favors towards something we like, we admire, or something we think is right, without bending our thoughts much.", "For most of our life\u2019s decisions, we don\u2019t want to put our brains into analyzing each and every scenario. Now one might be investigative, meticulous, or quite systematic while doing things that are important and consequential, but for the most part, we are too lazy to do that.", "But how this human intuition of being biased is related to Machine Learning? Let\u2019s understand how.", "One could easily guess that this figure represents Simple Linear Regression, which is an inflexible model that assumes a linear relationship between input and output variables. This assumption, approximation, and restriction introduce bias to this model.", "Hence bias refers to the error which is observed while approximating a complex problem using a simple (or restrictive) model.", "This analogy between humans and machines could be a great way to understand that inflexibility brings bias.", "Observe the figure below. The plots represent two different models that were used to fit the same data. Which one do you think will result in higher bias?", "The plot on the right is quite more flexible than the one on the left. It fits more smoothly with the data. On the other hand, the plot on the left represents a poorly fitted model, which assumes a linear relationship in data. This poor-fitting due to high bias is also known as underfitting. Underfitting results in poor performance and low accuracies and can be rectified if needed by using more flexible models.", "Let\u2019s summarise the key points about bias:", "So how can we get rid of this bias? We can build a more flexible model to fit our data and remove underfitting.", "So should we keep building more complex models until we reduce the error to its minimum? Let\u2019s try and do that with some randomly generated data.", "Now take a few seconds to observe these plots and see how increasing the complexity of our model to train on the same data reduces bias and underfitting, thus reducing the training error.", "So, which one of these four would you pick for your problem?", "If you picked Figure 4, which many of us would be tempted to do, then you are most likely to suffer the curse of High Variance.", "Suppose you were to take an exam of a subject you hate. You have difficulty understanding the concepts, and so to clear the exam, you decided to learn things word for word, without really caring why what\u2019s written, written. Now, you might impress your friend before the exam if he asks you the same questions from the textbook that you read. But you would most likely perform badly in the exam if in case the questions there are not the same as you expected or if they require you to use some logic instead of memory.", "In Machine Learning, when a model performs so well on the training dataset, that it almost memorizes every outcome, it is likely to perform quite badly when running for testing dataset.", "This phenomenon is known as overfitting and is generally observed while building very complex and flexible models.", "Variance is the amount by which our model will have to change if it were to make predictions on a different dataset.", "Let\u2019s simplify the above statement \u2192 Our model should not yield high errors if we use it to estimate the outputs of unseen data. That is if the model shows good results on the training dataset, but poor results on testing, it is said to have high variance.", "Hence, a good model is not the one that only performs well on the training dataset. It should be able to yield good results on any other dataset as well. Let\u2019s just say, you don't want to make a self-driving car which only drives well in the streets of Bangalore, whereas shows too many errors as soon as it leaves the town.", "Hence, building a very complex model can come at the cost of overfitting. One must understand that too much learning can bring high variance.", "Let\u2019s see some of the key points about Variance.", "So how do we get rid of both bias and variance? It looks like solving one causes the other to sneak in.", "We saw that restricting the model can cause high bias and underfitting while training. On the other hand, increasing its flexibility can cause variance and overfitting.", "It is important to keep in mind that some bias and some variance will always be there while building a Machine Learning model. Both bias and variance add to the overall error in the model.", "To minimize the reducible error (bias+variance), we must find the sweet spot between the two, where both bias and variance coexist with minimum possible values. This is called Bias-Variance Trade-off. It\u2019s more of a trade-off between Prediction Accuracy (Variance) and Model Interpretability (Bias).", "So that\u2019s it for Bias & Variance. I hope this post helped you understand these terms. Keep learning and applying. Stay tuned.", "Your home for data science.
