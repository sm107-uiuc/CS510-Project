It\u2019s that they think about all the other things beyond the code they write. They understand the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing, they know they will make mistakes, and they realize the benefits of making their own lives, and those of their colleagues, easier. The following are three fundamentals about writing better code that are focused on these surrounding aspects.", "Firstly, I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t optimize your code, or go for a more efficient implementation. What I am saying is that you shouldn\u2019t trade off the readability of your code for it. There are some areas of software engineering where efficiency is the fundamental driving requirement that must be prioritized at all cost, but this is the 1%. Most code is running on machines with more than enough resources and has more than enough time to execute. All production code though will need to be maintained. It will be read by someone 6 months after it was written and likely by someone who did not originally write it. Even if you did write it, chances are 6 months later the code looks like someone else wrote it and you don\u2019t have a solid memory of how it works. This is why human readable code is a top priority. Human readable means many things but should include: descriptive variable, class and methods names; the logical progression of data processing steps; and comments (but please keep the comments up-to-date with the code changes). By making the code clean and simple, you are lowering the bar to maintaining and expanding the code in the future. Trust me, future you, and your replacement, will thank you.", "If you cannot test your code, you can not efficiently expand it, build new features on top of it, or fix bugs in it. If writing unit tests is difficult because of interwoven dependencies, then modifying that code in the future will be difficult for the same reason. Additionally, if you do not have unit tests, you will not have confidence that any changes you did manage to make actually work. And more importantly didn\u2019t break the existing expected functionality. The reason unit tests are crucial here is that while you may catch the error in larger functional or integration tests, you will then have a much larger surface area to debug through to find the issue. Debugging a unit test failure essentially points you to the handful of lines where the problem exists before you\u2019ve even started.", "Unit tests are the fundamental requirement, beyond that the possible and suitable testing levels available vary by project and environment. Sometimes full end to end feature tests are feasible, but sometimes the cost of the simulated setup required for that outweighs the net new issues it would catch. Sometimes component level integration tests make sense, sometimes they add little value beyond the individual unit tests and shared contracts. Whether your team calls them functional tests, feature tests, integration tests, or one of the many others different names and types available, the important first line of defense are Unit Tests.", "This applies equally to systems as a whole as well as code. If they have been designed and/or built in isolation, by a lone dev, they are not ready for production use on any meaningful scale. The code/system may well function perfectly fine, and sure that\u2019s acceptable for a personal project. But when you work as part of a team, on projects used by thousands or millions of people, just \u2018functioning correctly\u2019 is not the measure of production ready.", "So what is missing when things are done in isolation? At the very least, outside perspectives, experience, and questions would not be taken into account. The resulting creation is unlikely to be satisfactory to all who have a stake in it. Allowing stakeholders to have a voice and input is essential, whether they be customers of the end product, fellow devs tasked with maintaining and building upon it, business or marketing people focused on \u2018selling\u2019 it, or anyone that has to support, use, or \u2018stand by\u2019 the creation.", "More importantly than this though is that the lone dev would be the sole \u2018owner\u2019 of the result, which is a real problem when something goes wrong. When there is a \u2018lottery factor\u2019 of one, it is bad for the dev who built it, and the others who have to help deal with it. (Side note: I prefer the term lottery factor to bus factor, as the imagery of a colleague winning the lottery vs being hit by a bus is much nicer. Both essentially represent how many people being no longer available would put a project in jeopardy.) A low lottery factor is also bad for the velocity of future improvements to a project. Having a variety of people who understand how something was built and how it works means they can all help move it forward, as well as help share the knowledge to others.", "Your home for data science.
