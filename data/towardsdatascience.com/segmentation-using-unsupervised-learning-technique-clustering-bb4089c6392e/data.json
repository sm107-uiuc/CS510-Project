Segmentation analytics helps a business focus its energy and investment on high value, loyal or untapped customers. This is important to drive growth and revenue. To help you get a bigger picture of how a segmentation exercise is usually carried out in the industry, the author made up a problem statement along with a dummy data to simulate the way these analyses are carried out in real-time.\u201d", "Andias Pharmaceutical is a US-based retail pharmacy with ~3500 stores spread across the US. 20% of the stores operate 24 x 7, however, the rest of them operates during usual business hours. Andias Pharmaceuticals saw an average Q4 result in 2019 where sales grew by 3% but the customer base remained almost flat. In an attempt to procure more patients, it is planning to expand its business, with Detroit (a city in Michigan) being the key focus area. As a part of this initiative, a community pharmacy near Guardian Building which is located just across the W Congress St will be opened during May 2020. This pharmacy will be the first of its kind in Detroit and will operate 24 x 7. It will have trained professionals and pharmacists who will help the patients with their insurance details, refill follow-ups, medicine intakes and even keep a tab of any side effects the pill might have.", "To spread more awareness about the program, The Director of Operations, Mr. Sheldon Mall, wants to reach out to the doctors (also known as Physicians/Prescribers) practicing in and around the pharmacy. Since finance didn\u2019t allocate a higher budget for this initiative they plan to break down their campaign into two parts. Sales Representative (Rep) targeting high opportunity doctors and direct mailers for the lower ones. You are asked to identify 3 to 4 groups of such physicians to whom the campaign can be rolled out.", "The problem statement suggests that the campaign will be rolled out using two different medium:", "Sales Rep targeting \u2014 Where Sales Representative of the pharmacy will go and talk to the prescriber in person. Since the cost involved in a Sales Rep targeting is much higher than a digital or direct mailer campaign, we need to identify high-value prescribers who can bring in more business.", "Direct Mailer \u2014 Where a pamphlet containing information about the store and its services will be mailed to the prescriber\u2019s address directly.", "A technique using which similar data entities are grouped based on certain criteria (also known as variables).", "A form of unsupervised learning \u2014 because the algorithm does not have predefined rules on how different data entities can be grouped.", "So, it\u2019s a method of data investigation \u2014 a way of studying for patterns or structures in the data that are of importance.", "K-Means algorithm is a way of partitioning the dataset into multiple clusters (say K) such that every cluster is distinct, i.e. one cluster doesn\u2019t overlap with the other and each data point belongs to one specific cluster only. It tries to build clusters in a way such that all points inside a cluster (intracluster points) are very similar but points from different clusters (intercluster) are different.", "It assigns data points to a cluster such that the sum of the squared distance between the data points and the cluster\u2019s centroid (arithmetic mean of all the data points that belong to that cluster) is at the minimum. The less variation we have within clusters, the more homogeneous (similar) the data points are within the same cluster.", "Step 1: Outlier treatment: Any data point which is very different from the rest of the data points in your dataset is considered as an outlier. E.g. in the Prescriber dataset most of the revenue metrics lie between $100 \u2014 $300, however, we observe a value of $1200 as well. In this case, $1200 is an outlier. However, in general, one can identify the outlier using the following method often termed as winsorization.", "Step 2: Missing value treatment. Any missing value should be removed or treated before clustering. Missing values are generally replaced with Central Tendency of the dataset, i.e. the mean, median or mode of the variable under consideration. Often enhanced technique like K-Nearest-Neighbor is used in place of central tendency to treat these missing values.", "Step 3: Check if clustering variables are highly correlated. If variables are highly correlated then one can drop one of the variables. This is because correlated variables tend to negate the impact and importance of non-correlated variables.", "Step 4: Standardize all analytical/clustering variables before running the K-Means model. Since K-Means uses Euclidean distance to assign values to their cluster it is important to ensure all variables belong to a similar scale before they are used for the modeling exercise.", "In the example above we see that the clustering variables have a different scale, because of which, variables with a higher magnitude like Revenue, Total Patients & Prescriptions exert a higher impact on the distance calculation than years of experience. Usually, min-max scaling, z-score standardization, and logarithmic scaling are some of the popular standardization techniques used in the industry.", "It is important to decide the number of clusters while running a K Means algorithm. Since K-Means clustering is a form of unsupervised learning, the number of clusters best suited for the dataset is not known beforehand. You can follow the below steps to come up with the best value for K.", "Step 1: For i=1 to n (where n refers to the maximum number of clusters desired) run the steps below:", "Step 2: Plot SSE across K using a line graph", "Step 3: Plot change in SSE across K using a line graph. This will help in visualizing the variation in SSE as the number of cluster increases", "Step 4: Compute outputs like total withinness, betweenness, ANOVA, size and ratio of betweenness to withinness for every cluster value", "Once the results are out, it is important to make a business sense of your results. These are some of the best practices I follow:", "Finally, if time permits do a quick pre-post analysis to check if the descriptive statistics for these clusters change with time.", "About the Author: Advanced analytics professional and management consultant helping companies find solutions for diverse problems through a mix of business, technology, and math on organizational data.
