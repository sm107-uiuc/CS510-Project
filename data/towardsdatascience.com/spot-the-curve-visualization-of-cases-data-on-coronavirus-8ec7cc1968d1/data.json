Though there was already some news about a new kind of virus spotted in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, The outbreak in western countries just started. During the self-quarantine, it came to my mind that it would be interesting and possibly inspiring if we use the data to compare each country regarding the epidemic, instead of being bombarded with random information and number by mainstream media. As a result, I took the time of my spring break to get into this small project.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning. We are not health professionals or epidemiologists, and the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice. To learn more about the coronavirus pandemic, you can click here.", "When I was thinking of visualizing the condition of each country, the first thing that came to my mind is \u201cthe curve.\u201d About the start of the March, social networks and media all suddenly filled with the idea of \u201cFlattening the Curve.\u201d The concept promotes the recognition of the virus for the general public, and it works like a charm in western societies.", "In this popular and excellent medium post (by Tomas Pueyo), the author explained it pretty well. In general, the curve means the distribution of active patients that the society needs to take care of. The logic behind the graph is that we shouldn\u2019t expect to stop all the spread, but to delay and let the nation has the capacity to resolve the cases.", "So our goal is not to eliminate coronavirus contagions. It\u2019s to postpone them. \u2014 Tomas Pueyo", "Accordingly, I decided to create plots based on this concept, showing the growth of confirmed cases in each country with little variations.", "At the time of writing this article, one of the most referencing data sources is John Hopkins University. It gathers data from WHO and CDC in different countries, and some of the open-sourced developers also build APIs on top of it. So I chose to use its datasets.", "I first found the confirmed case data of each country to do the data cleaning, making sure the data is in the time-series format. Then I used the Python visualization package (Matplotlib) to make the graph.", "Here is a little disclaimer: Since the data is in a very incohesive and under-developing condition, I have made compromises and personal decisions at a granular level to make this possible. If you are interested in the details of ETL, please see the GitHub page or just leave the message to me if I haven\u2019t mentioned anything. This is a project of reporting and EDA without any prediction model.", "First of all, to get the first baseline graph, let\u2019s just plot the confirmed cases in China, the first happening place, and in other Asian countries.", "However, I noticed something tricky right away. First of all, the dataset only records the case data starting from 22nd January. This makes it impossible to see the complete trend of the spread (China had its first cases way back in 2019; The earliest record in the data is 548 confirmed cases). Secondly, the data is the cumulative ones, which means that it suppose to only go up. So it is hard to get a sense of the current epidemic status (How fast the spread is) of the country.", "To deal with the representativeness issue, I decided to overhaul the data. First, I converted the value of cumulative cases into the \u201cdaily increase\u201d fashion. In terms of identifying the loading of a country, I consider the total number of cases an inaccurate metric, given that different levels of the population might influence countries\u2019 capacity of public health (e.g. nurse-patient ratios).", "About the population, I acknowledged that the speed of spread, in most cases, is not correlated with the level of population (It should be the population density). So the main point here is to compare the capacity of dealing confirmed cases, not the \u201cgrowth\u201d of COVID-19 in each country.", "Accordingly, I converted it into a new one called \u201cInfection Rate,\u201d the number of confirmed cases per 1 million people (by the population of the country; Source data ), to have a fair comparison with different kinds of countries. Additionally, on the plot, I aggregated the number of daily increased cases into a 2-day format and included records only after the 1st case to smooth the trend (also to have a fair start for each country). With the change, the visualization would also be more apparent since it gets messy when the numbers are big and have too many comparables.", "And then I pick other Asian countries since they are also the first few countries that got affected and have possibly \u201cflattened the curve\u201d in these days.", "From the plot above, we could tell that most of the Asian countries are rather steady regarding the Coronavirus spread. South Korea once had a major infection cluster before, but it has stopped the exponential growth successfully after the incident. It is interesting that we could spot a few \u201ccurve\u201d already on the graph, but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t suffer from any outbreak in the future. From the plot below (removed South Korea for better viewing), Singapore and Taiwan, which have been praised for appropriately dealing with the epidemic, are still facing potential growth in spread lately.", "p.s. India wasn\u2019t included in this chart yet because it just started to have more data on the confirmed case and it has a vastly different population-level from others. I would study it later and separately.", "Hypothetically speaking, strict travel bans and mandatory quarantine can mitigate the spread of the virus. Most of the countries (especially in Asia) have already issued related policies. Nevertheless, because of the 2-week incubation period and the returned citizens from aboard, we should expect that the effect takes another week or two to happen (To Be Updated).", "After the first exploration of Asia, we knew that most of the Asian countries have a more mild spread for now. Next, I pivoted to visualizing what is going on with some of the more serious countries now.", "To identify the most severely-spread countries, I kept using the same metric (infection rate) and ranked the top 10 countries with the latest infection rate (23rd March).", "I kept the same setting in terms of plotting, but I included records only after the 100th case to smooth the trend (Some countries had peak values due to the irregular testing routine, and some also started actively testing potential cases late.)", "As it turned out that all 10 countries in the most serious situation are from Europe (only Iran from the Middle East). Surprisingly, Switzerland actually is in a dire situation among other nations (The exceeding growth rate made it surpass Italy in these two days.). In contrast, although the United States has received lots of attention from the media, it is currently at the 15th place in this standard. Despite that, it is still in its earlier stage of virus spread compared to the European countries, so we should expect more change from it (See the graph below).", "Updated on 3/27/2020: the US is now experiencing a high volume of testing practice so the rank might considerably change in the future.", "Although we have factored in the population, currently the number of confirmed cases still heavily associated with the amount of the testing. Ideally, we would like to have as much detail about COVID-19 tests in each country as possible. However, there is not yet an official database about this.", "p.s. Our World in Data (a group of researchers from the University of Oxford) has gathered a provisional and incomplete version of this information and makes it possible to use this in the visualization (Please see one of their charts below).", "In the future, I will keep adding new stuff based on the work here and build an interactive and self-controllable dashboard on a web app to generate any of these charts for comparison.", "In this article, we used a more considerate approach to examine the current status of Coronavirus in specific countries. We spot a few potential curves along the way and recognize the seriousness of COVID-19 in some countries. Yet, the information also showed that we should beware of any significant change in terms of the spread and also the data.", "Though the content seems little, it was actually a lot of work for a novice to epidemiology and public health like me to analyze and make assumptions on this matter. Besides domain knowledge, the open data of COVID-19 is considerably underdeveloped at this point. The more I look into the data, even from highly-referred sources, the more frustrated I am because the most reliable and credible information, for now, is only the confirmed cases (e.g. JHU\u2019s GitHub has some annoying inconsistency in the data; Multiple APIs keep going on and off from time to time).", "That being said, there is still a group of professionals keeping on making the data complete and actually distill actionable insights. If anyone interested in doing a project on this, you could check out some useful articles and interesting discussions.", "For now, let\u2019s give it more time and doing our part!", "Congrats and Thanks for your reading!
