It is widely believed that the takeout and delivery market (online and offline) in the US alone is greater than $200 billion annually.", "Despite all the growth, many business models have yet to find its way into profitability. For restaurants, many will not find the 30% cut on their sales (in exchange for delivery) sustainable while Uber Eats itself struggles to be profitable. And although Grubhub is the exception for a profitable business model, they have been suffering from declining sales, and as a result uncertainties in being up for sale.", "So enter in the promise of ghost kitchens. Food preparation operated in kitchens not attached to an actual restaurant, ghost kitchens are able to focus solely on making food, unbridled by the complexity and costs of running a store front. A recent development that could propel ghost kitchens in North America is Travis Kalanick\u2019s CloudKitchens which rents out properties outfitted as commercial kitchens to food businesses that wants a working space to serve just the online food delivery market. Call it the WeWork of Kitchens, CloudKitchens fittingly received a $400 million investment from Softbank.", "Silver bullet or eventual dumpster fire, if your love and passion calls you to the food business, running a ghost kitchen might be great way to dive in and experiment new foods and concepts without the risk and complexity of running a restaurant.", "With these thoughts and recent developments, I was interested in uncovering insights that might serve the supply-side of the food delivery marketplace. For an aspiring participant, I wanted to help answer the question: what type of restaurant and food should we serve in a given city? Better yet, what type of dishes should we serve?", "To tackle this challenge, I know of no better candidate for data than Grubhub\u2019s. Though losing market share, Grubhub has been the dominant market player for as long as food delivery market was a market to look at. This means richer and longer range data.", "The data was obtained by scraping data of Grubhub restaurants from 15 major city areas across the US. I obtained data from a city area by simply selecting a longitude and latitude coordinate and configuring the radius mile to capture the greater city area. For example, I selected a midpoint in Manhattan but set a radius mile wide enough to capture Brooklyn, Jersey City and Staten Island.", "The final data set consists of menu and profile details of 30,000 restaurants, excluding fast food chains. Not bad, considering Grubhub has 140,000 total vendors on their platform.", "From the available menu and restaurant data, there were four types of information that seemed helpful to classify restaurants.", "The goal was to incorporate all of this available information into a clustering model. I wanted to capture restaurant similarities not just by their dish name and cuisine type but also their price point and menu variability. I didn\u2019t want to just identify Chinese restaurants, but the Chinese restaurants that has seemingly 50 too many items on their menu and the Chinese place specializing in hand-pulled noodles. I wanted to know if those fancy new American-type Mexican places are trending vs your neighborhood burrito go-to place.", "Menu variability and price were relatively easy to manage since they are numerical and categorical data types. On the other hand, there were 162 different types of cuisines and ~2600 types of dishes. We could try to one hot encode each dish and cuisine type, but that might not give us a fair weight between the four types of information when we toss the four types of data into our clustering algorithm. Another way we could manage cuisines and dishes is to apply NLP to reduce dimensions", "To reduce the dimensions of cuisines and dishes, I used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA is a Bayesian approach to topic modeling whereby each document (or restaurant, in this case) has a probability distribution over a set of latent topics. Each topic is further characterized by a distribution over words. By specifying how many topics LDA should use, the algorithm will assign every word to a temporary topic. The basic assumption of LDA is that documents with similar topics will use similar group of words.", "For both cuisines and dishes, I selected 30 as the number of topics to cluster the 163 number of cuisine types and ~2600 number of dish types.", "Below is a sample of restaurants and their probability distribution over a number of latent topics modeled from cuisine hashtags. The headers are documents (restaurants) while the index column are the dish dimensions we\u2019ll have to identify later. The probabilities as you see do not add up to 1, as the model filters out results that are insignificant noise. We can choose to capture the noise by specifying minimum_probability=0.0 when training the model.", "Below is a sample of topics over their distribution over words for cuisines obtained from the model using pprint(lda.print_topics()).", "One major benefit for using LDA is for its interpretability, which is the reason why I chose this dimension reduction method over LSA and NMF. To illustrate this, I utilized PyLDAvis, a convenient python interactive tool that can help visualize how topics relate to each other and how prevalent each topic is. The right panel of the visualization will represent the terms that are most useful in interpreting the selected topic. As an example, topic 7 and 11 of the fitted model for dishes look like two different flavors of Asian food. Topic 11 seem to lean towards American Chinese food while topic 7 is Thai / Southeast Asian food. Their similarities (both being Asian food) explains their close mapping, although they are two distinct topics.", "Now that we have reduced our cuisines and dishes to 30 dimensions each, we can use all the restaurant information types into our final clustering model.", "There are a handful of clustering methods that can be used. After running DBSCAN, mean shift and K-means, I selected k-means as my final clustering model. Read below for why.", "Below is distribution of restaurant count over 80 topics clustered with DBSCAN.", "Even after simulating the model with the many combinations of parameters, restaurants were mainly clustered to a few groups with DBSCAN and mean shift. I didn\u2019t find this useful for decision making since my intent from the beginning was to be able to identify between two close types of foods / restaurants like New American style Mexican food and your neighborhood taco place. Given the current split, it seems that all Latin American food is clustered together (as an analogy).", "Below is the distribution of restaurant count over 30 topics clustered with K-means.", "One explanation for this is that given the chosen dimensions, most restaurants are located close to one another in distance. DBSCAN clusters observations by how closely they are packed together, while marking as outliers observations that are in low-density areas. Hence, they might be clustering the big food types (e.g. Latin American, Asian foods) while considering Swedish food a single Topic group. Ideally, I want to split Asian to a few groups and cluster Scandinavian / European food together. K-means produces a different result because it positions partitions observations based on their nearest centroid (which is continually optimized).", "Inertia value for K-means over a distribution of specified number of clusters", "Luckily, when plotting inertia distribution over K-means with specified clusters between 2 and 80, the major kink is at 30. Inertia measures how coherent clusters are \u2014 it measures the sum of squared distances of samples to the nearest cluster center. This means that most of the information can be captured with 30 dimensions, which is about as many restaurants I was happy to name and identify. This is great.", "Now that the 30,000 restaurants are clustered to 30 restaurant profiles, they need to be named. A tedious kind of work which I thought I was done with at data cleaning, I also understand that this is the work required of Unsupervised Learning. Using the same 4 types of information in our clustering model, I was able to differentiate the different restaurant profiles:", "Below is a sample of how the analysis went:", "Below are the top 10 restaurant clusters by their review count (spoiler for next blog posts!).", "I hope you had fun reading through the process of identifying restaurant profiles. But we haven\u2019t really done anything to find market gaps or trends that would help you as an aspiring food provider (or just a curious mind). Hence, stay tuned for Part 2 of the series.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "I like all things Markets, Customer Experience and Food.
