Recently, he decided to switch to an Object-Oriented approach to programming and sought my help in understanding the nitty-gritty of the same. In this article, I try to explain the essentials of an Object-Oriented Programming via a conversation that took place between me and Nitin.", "Keywords \u2014 Objects, Classes, Attributes, Instance, Methods.", "Me: Nitin, why are you so interested in learning Object-Oriented Programming, What is the problem with Procedure Oriented Programming?Nitin: I find it quite difficult to structure and modularize my code. Even for a slightly different task, I have no option but to rewrite the code from scratch. Also, apart from the reusability issues, I also find it difficult to debug the code.Me: Yes, you are right, those are some limitations with a procedure way of programming. But Don't worry, we have Object-Oriented Programming to the rescue.", "Nitin: So, What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? Me: OOP is basically a way of programming that concentrates on utilizing & implementing Objects and Classes to design/write a particular application.", "Let\u2019s understand these terms with the help of an example: Consider that you have a mobile shop & want to develop a system to observe the features of Mobile Phones in your shop. For the purpose of illustration, let's suppose you are a trader of Apple, Nokia, and Samsung Smartphones only.", "So, you start with a Mobile class. There is a common characteristic which all the Mobiles posses \u2014 they are \u201cSmartphones\u201d. So \u201cSmartphone\u201d becomes the Class Attribute, a property which all mobiles in my shop posses. There is another kind of attribute which is specific to the object being created, these are known as Instance Attributes. For Example - Different Smartphones have different properties like Company Name, Model Name, Color, Storage, price, etc. These characteristics will be different for different objects being created.", "An example of a specific object/instance - a Mobile phone with Company Name = Samsung, Model Name = Samsung Galaxy S10, Color = Black, Storage = 128 GB. So, a class is a description of what its instances posses. This description is given by our Instance Attributes. Here, we can see that the data is represented as instance attributes of the object.", "Methods are a way by which components of our system interact. Methods are the actions that can perform operations on our instance attributes. Methods describe the behavior of a class. These methods are the common actions all objects of a particular class can perform. So, a class is also a description of what its instances can do via these methods.", "Consider a simple example: suppose we have another instance attribute called \u201ccurrent_battery\u201d, you can define a method Charging, which when called will update the current battery level of your phone. We will see methods in more detail in later sections.", "Nitin: But, what is the difference between a method and a function then?Me: Even though both use a def keyword, a method is typically defined inside a class whereas a function is defined outside of a class. Remember: Methods describe the behavior of a class. Also, functions are processes that are object independent \u2014 methods, on the other hand, are dependent on the state of the object.", "Nitin: This is quite interesting.Nitin: It would be quite helpful if you could also show some code.Me: Sure. I assume that you know some basics of Python programming. Consider the following:", "Now, you might ask What is \u201c__init__\u201d? Is it a method? What is \u201cself\u201d? What is its value? Let's dive into this.", "The name \u201c__init__\u201d is a special reserved method in python. We use __init__ to specify the attributes of the object/instance being created. __init__ lets you customize how python instantiates an object of a class. It is also known as the constructor or Initializer. The __init__ method automatically gets called whenever you create a new instance of a class. (you can check the above code it prints \u201cinit is called automatically\u201d). Here, m1 and m2 are the new instances being created.", "\u201cself\u201d refers to the instance/object being created (m1, m2). self contains the memory of the instance. When we create methods within a class they receive instance as the first argument automatically. This is in contrast to several other programming languages where the self is passed as a hidden argument to the methods.", "Nitin: Can we use constructors multiple times within a class?Me: Yes, we can use multiple __init__\u2019s in a program. But, whatever will be the last defined constructor inside a class, that will be in use. So, essentially you can only use one constructor. Consider the following:", "Let\u2019s proceed further now. You can also manually create an instance variable (attribute) for an instance, eg. m1.batterylife = 45. But there is no benefit of using classes then, you need to manually set the variable every time. Similarly we can also update the value of an instance variable. (m1.price = 620). We can do the same with the help of methods. Consider the following:", "Nitin: Which is better, changing the value with a method or directly updating the value?Me: Changing values via a method gives you more flexibility in the long-term. Suppose, there is a change in units of measurement - the shop was originally meant to work in US dollars and now has to handle Rupees. You just need to multiply by a factor of 70. (self.price = price*70). Imagine the pain if you manually did it for every instance.", "The methods defined above(new_price, discount_price) are regular methods inside the Mobile Class. Regular methods take instance aka self as the first argument and are used to alter the functionality of an object/instance. We also have Class Methods. We need some functionality not wrt an object but wrt an entire class. They are used to modify a class state. These methods are not object-specific.", "We use class methods with the help of a decorator (\u201c@classmethod\u201d). In these methods, we pass the class(cls keyword) as the first argument. Consider an example:", "There is another type of method \u2014 STATIC METHOD. A static method also belongs to the whole class rather than a particular object. These methods cannot alter the state of an object as they are not bound it. We use static methods with the help of a decorator (\u201c@staticmethod\u201d). They don\u2019t take class or instance as the first argument. Consider the following:", "Nitin: So, What is the difference between a static method and a class method?Me: The basic difference is that Static Methods cannot be used to alter the functionality of our program, while Class methods can be used to do so. The class method takes the class as a parameter to know about the state of that class. Static methods do not know about the class state. These methods are used to do some utility tasks by taking some parameters.", "Finally, I hope you enjoyed learning OOPs. I would love to know the feedback of anyone reading this article. I would be happy to answer doubts/questions on any of the concepts mentioned above. You can comment down below or reach me via Linkedin.", "Your home for data science.
