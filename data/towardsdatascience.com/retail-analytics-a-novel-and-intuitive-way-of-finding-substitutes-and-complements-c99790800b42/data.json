With plenty of consumer purchase history available, we can apply data analytics to rightly forecast inventory needs, supply-chain movement, item placements, relationships between items for the recommendation, etc which coins the term Retail Analytics.", "One important part of Retail Analytics is to find relationships between items like bread goes well with butter and toothpaste goes well with a toothbrush. Substitutes are alternative items from different brands used for the same purpose. Examples of substitutes could be Tea and Cofee or Toothpaste from different brands (Pepsodent and Colgate). These items are basically competitors of each other. Complements, on the other hand, are the items bought and used together. These items help to lift the sales of each other in a customer basket. Examples of complements could be Bread and Butter or Flights and Taxi services etc.", "Knowing such relationships helps in making data-backed decisions. The possible advantages after identifying substitutes and complements could be -", "Association Rule Mining is a branch of Data Mining techniques that introduces concepts like Support, Confidence, Lift, Conviction, Apriori Algorithm which helps to find such a relationship. Through this blog post, I intend to suggest an alternative and intuitive way of finding item-relationships. So, one doesn\u2019t need to have any prior knowledge as this is a novel way and doesn\u2019t have any pre-requisites.", "To demonstrate the working and effectiveness of the algorithm, we will run the proposed scheme on Kaggle\u2019s Instacart Dataset. The code used could be downloaded from here.", "Complements are items \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 that are generally bought together. One strategy to find such pairs of the item could be finding the ratio of the number of times \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 are bought together to that of the number of times \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 are bought, across all the customer baskets.", "For items \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 to be a complement, the Complement ratio needs to be as high as possible. It has an upper cap of 1. Across all the item pairs we will find item-pairs with the high compliment ratio.", "Also, from Set theory, we know,", "We will find complements across departments from Instacart datasets. Let\u2019s have a look at the Dataset first.", "There are a total of 3.2 million orders and 32.4 million items ordered in these orders.", "There are a total of 49.6K distinct items.", "There are a total of 21 departments.", "Next, we will perform a cross-join of orders table to find how many times items are bought together. We also join it with the product and department tables to find product details. Final output table when sorted in descending order of complement ratio looks like -", "Let\u2019s see what the algorithm suggests as complements:", "The results look really good. It makes sense that people buy Stevia Clear Sweetener with Alkalized water as a few drops of sweetener when mixed with water gives it a favorable taste.", "Similarly, people prefer having Pizza with some Energy drink and Pita or Potato Chips with Hummus or Onion Dips.", "Substitutes are alternative items from different brands used for the same purpose. Items \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 are substitutes if they are direct competitors of each other and people generally buy one of them. Unlikely from complements, hike or drop of the prices of an item can affect its subtitute sales in a opposite manner.", "For two items, \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 to be Substitutes, we prefer the substitute ratio to be as low as possible.", "Why is there a Minimum function in the formula?", "Some items like Bananas or Apples can be very popular and part of many baskets. A minimum function helps to remove such bias and brings the comparison to a fair standard.", "We will find substitutes within the same department from the Instacart datasets. We will perform a cross-join of orders table to find how many times items are bought together to that of items bought separately. We also join it with the product and department tables to find product details. Final output table when sorted in ascending order of complement ratio looks like -", "The results look fine. It makes sense that people mostly buy Large Alfresco Eggs or Organic Large Brown eggs.", "Similarly people buy 2% Reduced Fat Milk or Organic Milk with Vitamin D or Skim Milk.", "With this blog post, we derived an alternative and intuitive way of finding substitutes and complements. These simple metrics gave me better results than finding support, confidence, lift, conviction or other Association Rule Mining algorithms. As well, these metrics are very intuitive and simple to implement in scale. The results support the goodness of these metrics. The Dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle\u2019s Instacart Dataset.
