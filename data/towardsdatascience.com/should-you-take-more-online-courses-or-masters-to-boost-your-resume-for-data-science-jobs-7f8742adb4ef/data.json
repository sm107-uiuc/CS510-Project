I\u2019ve encountered this too: \u201cDidn\u2019t I just take that Coursera course on CNNs? This [concept] rings a bell, but how come I forgot the details already?\u201d This is a horrible realization to have in general, but imagine if you were in a job interview!", "If any of the above situations resonate with you, I hope this article can help. From years of personal experience, I share what can help you identify when you can stop with online courses and know that you are \u201cready\u201d.", "This rule holds true for self-education with online courses, or additional formal education such as getting a master\u2019s degree.", "Diminishing marginal returns is a concept from economics: Imagine a brand new restaurant getting ready to open for business. They just spent money on a brand new kitchen. When they have no cooks, they have no output, and thus, no customers or returns, no matter how amazing a kitchen they have. When they hire the first cook, the output and returns increases a lot, since they go from serving zero customers, to being able to serve their customers.", "Then, the restaurant gets more popular, and the one cook isn\u2019t able to handle more orders. A second cook is hired. This increases the output and the returns. However, once past a certain point, maybe when they have 3 cooks, hiring more cooks isn\u2019t going to further increase returns. The kitchen could get too crowded, making each cook\u2019s output decrease! At this point, the restaurant shouldn\u2019t hire more cooks, but rather expand in other ways, such as making the kitchen larger.", "This analogy applies to online courses and additional education. If you have zero of it, doing an online course or two will have incredibly high marginal benefit. Past a certain point, you need to look at expanding your skills in other ways, such as doing a side project \u2014 akin to expanding the kitchen in the restaurant example, instead of hiring more cooks.", "Now that I\u2019ve gone through the general rule of thumb, I want to help you apply this logic to your own unique situation. Since there are many types of people that are looking to improve their skills and credibility in the data science field, I want to give you the tools to make the decision based on your own educational background and work experience. Below, I list several broad demographics for you to start with.", "The most common reason and demographic that look to online courses or additional education I\u2019ve seen are aspiring data scientists. Taking online courses and getting certificates of completion is something to put on a resume in order to get an interview, which if the candidate can pass, lands the candidate a job in the data science or machine learning industry.", "I\u2019ll break this demographic down into two types: Type 1 are those that don't already have any job experience, and are fresh out of school or from a bootcamp. Type 2 are professionals who do have job experience in other fields (academia included). They want to transition or pivot into the data science field.", "The next demographic, Type 3, are existing data scientists looking to expand their knowledge or enter a new specialization (for example, from NLP to reinforcement learning).", "One last type are those that just like to learn for fun, without any defined reason. They don\u2019t see online courses as a way to get somewhere else, but simply entertainment or mental fulfillment. If this is you, then you should stay true to yourself and keep taking online courses, as long as you\u2019re having fun!", "Types 1, 2, 3 all have something in common: They have a place they are in the present, and a goalpost (data science/ML job or promotion) they want to move to in the future. They hope that online courses can fill in the gaps to take them from point A to point B.", "We\u2019ve established that no matter which type you are, you aim to use online courses or additional education to reach point B, which is your goalpost.", "I will walk through the following 3 examples, but my intention is that you can then apply the logic to your personal situation:", "\u201cI just graduated from university, but I hear that I need a master\u2019s to get into data science. Should I take an online master\u2019s or get certificates?\u201d", "For this scenario, the goalpost here is actually \u201cgetting a data science job\u201d. Naturally, if they do successfully find a data science job, then they do not need to take more online courses/certificates, or even the master\u2019s. If you get to point B directly with what you have right now, there is no need to take a detour, the detour being those online courses.", "When I get asked this question during a coffee chat, I usually suggest the following:", "It is true that what type of bachelor\u2019s degree it is, matters. However, regardless of the formal name of the degree, what\u2019s more important are how you demonstrate your skills in 2 pillars: statistics and programming. For your very first step, I\u2019d suggest self-assessing from the information in the linked article and use online courses or additional education to brush the 2 pillars up to a baseline level.", "Try applying to jobs (entry level). Treat it as if a bachelor\u2019s degree is enough, given that you have sufficient skills in the 2 pillars, statistics and programming. You must iterate on resume and interview feedback \u2014 if you don\u2019t get callbacks, update your resume or examine how you responded to interview questions.", "Don\u2019t do the same thing that doesn\u2019t work expecting a different result. If in a few months these efforts still don\u2019t land you a job in data science, then consider a master\u2019s degree. If the job takes 6~10 months to get, straight out of a bachelor\u2019s degree, that saves time over doing a 2-year master\u2019s degree to achieve the same thing.", "The main risk here, of course, is \u201cwhat if I spend 10 months trying to get a data science job, fail, and then decide to go with more education \u2014 that will make me 10 months behind my peers in the master\u2019s program / online certificate program / bootcamp!\u201d", "Personal anecdote: For some time I considered taking the OMSCS online CS master\u2019s degree. I was already working as a data scientist at the time, and successfully delivered data science products to millions of customers. I accomplished this goalpost already with a master\u2019s in economics. Conclusion: hold off on the master\u2019s in CS, unless some future career move (more similar to Type 3 scenario) requires it.", "\u201cI want to take this Coursera course because I have little or no machine learning related experience on my resume. I really need at least something to catch the recruiter\u2019s eye to give me a callback and phone interview.\u201d", "For this scenario, keep in mind this person (could it be you?) already has some work experience. Maybe they did project management for 3 years, or engineering for 1 year, or was teaching/researching in academia for 5 years.", "The goalpost in this scenario is \u201cgetting at least an interview\u201d. So, the easiest thing you could do here is just starting applying to jobs! It doesn\u2019t matter if you \u201caren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re ready yet\u201d. Don\u2019t hold off until you\u2019ve completed some magical number of online courses.", "Do the direct action relevant to your goalpost, and if you don\u2019t hear back after two or three weeks, then it could suggest you really don\u2019t have enough resume line items. But you don\u2019t know this until you\u2019ve applied to some jobs. Don\u2019t let your own uncertainty speak for recruiters and hiring managers. You are not them. As to what you can do if you don\u2019t hear back from any job applications, I break down more specific details below, as even in Type 2, there are a lot of variations.", "Here, I usually suggest the following, regarding taking more online courses or additional education:", "If you really have zero (0) resume line items in machine learning / data science, definitely go for it! Take those Coursera courses, do the assignments, and proudly list them on your resume. However, at the point that you have a few courses under your belt, and you\u2019re confident you have the basic knowledge of 2 pillars: statistics and programming (linked article shows you how to self-assess your readiness), I strongly suggest doing a side project. Use the diminishing marginal benefits rule of thumb.", "The reason is simply because when I am screening resumes for data science hires, side projects catch my eye much more than certifications. (This advice is not including online master\u2019s, which I covered in Type 1's analysis as a separate question). I cannot speak for all recruiters / hiring managers / fellow data scientists, but I will shed some light here why I believe that side projects > online courses, assuming you already have learned basic knowledge of 2 pillars: statistics and programming.", "What do data science jobs hire for? They hire people that solve a real life problem with data science techniques; people that can complete projects where there are no textbook answers, and are specific to each unique company. What demonstrates that a job candidate can do those things?", "\u201cI\u2019m interested in moving upward or laterally in my current data science team to a project that uses reinforcement learning (RL). How do I show my manager and coworkers that I am skilled enough in RL?\u201d", "This is great! You\u2019re in the field, and are looking for some growth opportunities. Likely your statistics and programming skills are both at a good baseline (maybe you\u2019re stronger at one than the other), so you don\u2019t need to spend as much time brushing up on them as those straight out of school or transitioning from another field.", "Here, I\u2019d definitely say go for a few online courses to build your basic knowledge in the new topics, by which I mean, take online courses on reinforcement learning specifically, not general machine learning. Additionally, if you feel one of your pillars isn\u2019t as strong as the other, for example if you\u2019re much better at general software development, relative to the mathematical derivations of ML algorithms, consider brushing up on ML algorithms.", "One thing that seems to slip people\u2019s minds (mine included) is that the most direct course of action to the goalpost is asking your manager or coworkers if you can get moved to that new project or team! Don\u2019t wait until you\u2019ve taken some online courses to ask; make your interest clear now, so that they will think of you if there\u2019s an opening on the project, or another similar opportunity.", "If the above efforts are sufficient enough to get you moved to that other data science role or specialized project at work, then awesome! Your new goalpost has been achieved. If it\u2019s not that easy, then the next big step would be to build a quick side project on that topic, using the knowledge you learned from the online course. If demonstrating your real experience in a topic can\u2019t convince your manager / coworkers that you are a good candidate to work on that project of interest, then\u2026 online courses aren\u2019t really the question here.", "In short, here is the general decision criteria I suggest:", "If you have no machine learning / data science related resume line items:", "If you have some online courses under your belt and are not sure whether to take more:", "If you have learned statistics and programming to a good baseline level, and have some data science resume line items:", "Now, we\u2019ve walked through recommendations for multiple types of scenarios, and the detailed logic behind those recommendations. Of course, each person has a different educational background, work experience, and other circumstances, but I hope that with the provided logic, you can apply it to your own specific situation!", "When in doubt, remember: there is decreasing marginal benefit in taking online courses. The first few will be highly beneficial, then the more you do, the less new benefit each subsequent one gives you. The same logic applies to going for additional education.", "It\u2019s easy to get stuck in a loop of passively learning, so the general idea is to take a pause if you can already hit your goalpost with the current amount of knowledge you have. Side projects or simply starting the job application process would give you a much better return on investment on your time. I hope this helps!", "Data Scientist & game developer.
