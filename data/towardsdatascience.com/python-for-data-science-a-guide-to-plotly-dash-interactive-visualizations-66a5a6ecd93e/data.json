We\u2019ve already talked about how you should take advantage of powerful libraries we currently have in Python.", "In this write-up, we\u2019re taking it to the next level. We\u2019re going to talk about How to Build an Interactive Dashboard using Plotly Dash, in Python. The Dashboard can even be hosted as a web app.", "Dash is the new hot kid on the block.", "It is a Python framework that allows you to create amazing web applications using Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js. Dash is extremely efficient in building data visualization apps with highly customization user interface without the need to know any HTML, CSS, or Javascript.", "Basically, it\u2019s fast, pretty, and easy to learn if you\u2019vealready mastered Python.", "Dash takes away all the worries of needing to know web development, including the headaches of deploying the app. It is easily maintainable, cross-platform, and mobile-ready as well.", "You can build your mobile-responsive web app in just pure python now.", "I\u2019m starting to sound like a salesman for Dash.", "It is also good to know that the demand for Plotly Dash is increasing over the years. Below are the results for Plotly Dash in Google Trends over the past 5 years.", "Now that\u2019s out of the way. Let\u2019s get into it.", "Dash visualizations are based on Plotly. Hence, please make sure you have a solid understanding of the basics of Plotly before continuing on this advance guide. You can do that by referring to the article I wrote about the Basics of Plotly here.", "In order to work with Plotly, you should master Pandas as well.What a coincidence.I happen to have written A Guide to Pandas as well.If you need to refresh your memory, please go through it.", "Link to the dataset used in this guide.", "Dash frameworks are separated into two parts. The first part is the layout of the app which defines the look and feel of the application. This involves everything from the style, positioning, and size of things you have on your app.", "Dash uses components to define the layout.", "Let\u2019s build a simple \u2018Hello World\u2019 layout to warm-up.", "In this app, we are simply defining an H1 HTML tag as \u2018Hello World\u2019.Regardless of where you\u2019re running the code, you should something like this.", "Click on the link to access your app.", "and there you have it, your first \u2018Hello World\u2019 app.That\u2019s cool and all, but let\u2019s show an actual graph in our app.", "In this block of code, we introduced the Div tag ( one of the most used ) and the dcc.Graph component.", "The graph component is used to display a Plotly graph. The figure parameter is used to represent go.Figure, you can refresh your memory about it here.", "Basically, you can pass any type of Plotly graph through the dcc.Graph component to be displayed on your app. You can then further customize the style of that graph in Plotly and Dash.", "Now let\u2019s make a layout for the data we have imported from Github.", "In this app, we are simply visualizing the miles per gallon against the model year of the vehicles in the dataset. On a side note, we can clearly see a slight increase in MPG as the model year of the vehicle increases.", "Using the style parameter, we can declare how we want the graph to look in the dashboard. You can further drill down into the style by inspecting the element of the web app.", "We can see that the width of this inner div is half of its parent div. This is because we had declared the following in our code.", "I think it\u2019s pretty straight forward up till now, to make a simple dashboard in Dash we:", "This is where it gets interesting.", "After declaring our basic layout, Dash allows us to add complex interactions in our app. This component will also allow us to update our data, in real-time.", "Yes, you heard it right. The dashboard will be able to update itself in real-time if required, but more on that later. Let\u2019s talk about how callbacks can be used to update your data upon certain user actions.", "We achieve this by defining callback functions after the layout. Callback Functions, like any other functions, have \u2014", "Using the component-ids we have declared in Dash, we are able to pinpoint exactly what do we want as an input for our function, and what to update as well.", "As an example, we will use a property that is included in the dcc.Graph component by default, \u2018HoverData\u2019. It returns a JSON string of information about the data you\u2019re hovering over. Let me show you.", "In this section, we\u2019ve added a Div below the graph to show the content we are hovering over. As you can see, the content of the Div is updating instantly as we hover over different points in the graph. We achieve this by \u2014", "*Extra Note: The pointIndex in the HoverData represents the Index of the DataFrame of the current data referenced. This will be useful later on.", "That being said, we can do all sorts of stuff with the input we are taking in. The sky is the limit with this.", "Let\u2019s display something interesting about the dataset we had imported.For our very first web app, we want to show for each data point \u2014", "By taking advantage of the data in HoverData, we can refer to the actual data from our pandas dataframe, mpg.csv. We can then do calculations based on it and display all kinds of metrics we want to show.", "I hope you realize by now, how powerful is the Dash Framework.", "you\u2019ve mastered the basic concepts of Plotly Dash.", "In this article, you\u2019ve learned \u2014", "Both are essential in building your first web app.", "go build something you are interested in and show it to the world.", "If you hit a roadblock, feel free to reach out to me.
