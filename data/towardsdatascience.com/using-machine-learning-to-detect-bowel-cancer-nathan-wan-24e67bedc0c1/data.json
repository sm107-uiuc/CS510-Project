But no one wants to get one \u201cjust in case.\u201d", "But patients regularly have their blood taken as part of their annual check up. What if we could provide the benefits of a colonoscopy with the convenience of a blood test?", "This is what Nathan and his team are working on.", "Nathan studied computer science and electrical engineering, along with some computational biology. He went on to do a six-year stint at Google, joining a machine learning team.", "But Nathan wanted bigger challenges and more impactful work, so he moved on to his current position at Freenome. He says:", "\u201cI was looking for a company where the problem was a lot harder, and it was a lot more challenging, but also I guess the impact would be significant as well.\u201d", "While technology is a focus, Nathan hopes their main potential impact will be on the way people think about health more generally:", "\u201cIf we\u2019re successful, we\u2019ll really change the way people think about healthcare and about treating and diagnosing cancer. There is potential for a huge impact on the way we as a society think about healthcare.\u201d", "Almost 1 in 20 people will be affected by colorectal cancer \u2014 which is commonly known as bowel cancer \u2014 in their lifetime.", "Nathan\u2019s company has a vision: to be able to detect early warning signs of cancer from a standard blood sample. This wouldn\u2019t necessarily replace a colonoscopy completely, but it could indicate whether a follow-up colonoscopy might be a good idea.", "While patients are often advised to get a colonoscopy every 5 or 10 years, if doctors can detect warning signs in a blood sample, then they can recommend an interim diagnostic colonoscopy.", "It\u2019s a societal-norm problem as much as a technical one. As Nathan points out:", "\u201cSome competitors do it, but they use fecal matter instead of blood. There are concerns about both accuracy and compliance: patients are not always willing to defecate into a little bag, seal it up, and send it for analysis.\u201d", "At a high level, Nathan\u2019s team is building a system that takes a tube of blood as input and predicts whether the patient is healthy or presents cancer risk indicators.", "But the reality is more complicated, and we need more patient data to make accurate predictions: for example, whether the patient smokes, what medications they take, and whether they have existing lesions that could grow into cancer.", "For the actual data extracted from blood, Nathan\u2019s team uses a \u201cmulti-omic\u201d approach. He explains:", "\u201cThat means we\u2019re interested in measuring more than just one type of molecule or one measurement. So not only are we going to try to run one assay to measure DNA, we\u2019re also going to measure protein and potentially RNA or other ways to compute molecular measurements.\u201d", "\u201cSo there\u2019s some chemistry involved, and there\u2019s potentially some other hardware or lab machines to measure the molecules. We take multiple measurements of those molecules and combine them together into a classifier, and use that classifier to predict cancer, using both DNA and proteins.\u201d", "Compared to his time at Google, where Nathan was given the data and tasked only with processing it efficiently, he says the challenges are much broader in his current role.", "He has to juggle making sure that the data is collected properly, that the right models are trained, and that their estimated performance is accurate:", "\u201cThe experiment design and the way data is generated has a much bigger impact on a model\u2019s final usability than any algorithm you use.\u201d", "He says getting the right regulatory approval is challenging too:", "\u201cWe have to build the airplane as we fly. Our pipeline is constantly changing and moving as we try to submit it to the FDA. As the model changes, the assay will also change, and that in turn affects the model.\u201d", "Once the data has proven itself in a research setting, it gets handed over to an engineering team to prepare for the FDA. Nathan emphasizes the difference between research and production settings:", "\u201cThere\u2019s no way we would bring all the research code to the FDA and say, \u2018Please approve our product because we had this crazy idea that didn\u2019t even work.\u2019 We create a completely separate system for the final version. We actually make sure that there\u2019s no dependencies on the research system.\u201d", "\u201cWe work very closely with them to extract the relevant bits and keep it lean. It\u2019s like a research presentation. There\u2019s a lot of messiness that happens in the background, but we take the part that worked well \u2014 the most important bits \u2014 and just present those.\u201d", "Nathan works in a diverse team of computational biologists, machine learning scientists, statisticians, and research engineers. People with different expertise work together fluidly:", "\u201cWe may have statisticians who are not the best at Python, but when they partner with someone who\u2019s much better at Python, they\u2019re able to work cohesively to make faster progress. We come from academia, from industry, from tech, and from biology, so it\u2019s a really nice mix of different people.\u201d", "It can be challenging to work and communicate effectively with so many different specialists. What Nathan brings to the table is his experience with cross-functional interaction. He says:", "\u201cI\u2019m definitely not an expert in any one of these fields, but it\u2019s important to understand where people come from and what their work involves.\u201d", "\u201cI think you have to develop an aspect of this in any technical field: whether it\u2019s communicating with biologists, chemists, or business executives.\u201d", "Machine learning is powerful, but it\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of overestimating your own models. Nathan says:", "\u201cWe spend a lot of time interrogating our own results. It\u2019s really easy to overfit an example or a model. And we spend lots of time thinking about how we might have overfit.\u201d", "\u201cHow do we identify potential confounders or anything that might affect our data without being explicitly involved in data collection?\u201d", "Even if you get everything right, dealing with biological data is expensive. As Nathan puts it:", "\u201cThe process of collecting human samples, or live samples, is incredibly expensive and incredibly new.\u201d", "\u201cWe raise a lot of money, and a lot of that money\u2019s actually going into collecting these samples. I think that\u2019s the hard part about biology. You have to deal with human subjects or patients, and anytime something like that\u2019s involved, it\u2019s going to be a challenge.\u201d", "We\u2019re a machine learning agency that specialises in metabolomic analysis.
