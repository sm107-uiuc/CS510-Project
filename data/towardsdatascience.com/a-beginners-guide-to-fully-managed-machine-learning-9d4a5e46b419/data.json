In the industry, however, the projects are at a larger scale and bring additional complexities into their development and maintenance. This is where a fully managed ML service or ML Ops (inspired from DevOps) comes in. It shifts the process to the cloud and offers greater flexibility, reliability and transparency to the team. Through this article, I draw parallels between software development and typical data science projects.", "This is borrowed from the SOLID principles of software design. We can separate an end-to-end machine learning model into tasks that perform a single function. Then, we connect these tasks into a sequential workflow. Each task is only concerned with its own input and output data and the resources allocated to it. Typically, we may want to separate the steps such as data transformation, augmentation or image/video pre-processing from the modeling.", "It may not be the most suitable term in this scenario, but developers are comfortable with it. This principle refers to the decoupling of modules \u2014 higher level modules in the workflow should depend as little as possible on the lower ones. Data can be ingested into a ML model from multiple sources; If at any point these sources change, it shouldn\u2019t impact the modeling process. The lower order modules are responsible for supplying the data to the model in the desired format.", "Machine learning engineers strive to build reusable modules in the workflow. The data wrangling tasks should be plug-and-play although the higher level model changes. When training long running algorithms, especially neural networks which can take hours, it may help to cache the results so that every time you run the workflow you don\u2019t have to re-execute the training phase. Most of the cloud ML solutions offer this feature and it saves loads of time.", "Similar to traditional software, ML applications also suffer from varying performance needs. One of the greatest advantages of full managed services is the ability to horizontally scale the tasks to a cluster of machines. As the size of the training data or the number of requests increases or decreases, it automatically adds or removes machines from the cluster. The specifications are configurable, you can also add high performance machines with GPUs.", "Just like containers for apps, it also helps to run data analysis scripts in an isolated environment. Python, for instance, provides support for virtual environments which specify the Python version and other dependencies (often a long list). The configuration settings are easy to transfer, every time a new team member joins the team or you switch machines. Running projects in their own environment also prevent them from conflicting with other projects (which may be using lower versions of Python). The dependencies are resolved on every machine the script runs in a cluster.", "The ability to systematically track every model run and compare different models is a gift to every data person. One of the most challenging problems in machine learning is choosing an optimal combination of hyper-parameters \u2014 weighing the impact on performance against the accuracy. Through dedicated features, we can train the model quickly on a large set of hyper-parameters and visualize the accuracy (or any other metric).", "Cloud services also facilitate collaboration with contributors working on different stages of the workflow concurrently. Each service provides support through Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) which can be used to push changes from your local machine.", "Building a machine learning model is almost never the end of the story; There will be consumers of the insights you generate. You can expose your model through REST APIs or as a web service and sometimes, you may also have to integrate the outputs with other applications.", "Finally, the cherry on the cake is the ability to actively monitor the status of the workflow and receive customized notifications.", "Your home for data science.
