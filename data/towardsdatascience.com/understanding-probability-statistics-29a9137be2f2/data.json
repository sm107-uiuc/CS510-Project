We all know about transforming the data to make it Gaussian but we don\u2019t have a clear idea why so much importance is given to it.", "We don\u2019t have a clear idea of what topics in probability and statistics we must master are. So when we hear a topic, we search on the internet only to get a huge set of links. Even I faced the same problem when I started. So it was always in my mind to create a concise document to outline common topics and here we are!", "When we read data from a csv file, all the column headers give us an idea what a particular column is all about. If it is \u2018Age\u2019 column then we know all the values in this column correspond to age of different persons. In mathematical term this \u2018Age\u2019 is modeled as a variable and more specifically a Random variable because the process that generates the age of different persons is a varying process generating random numbers. Each random variable has its own distribution and set of properties -", "There are 2 types of random variables -", "2. Continuous random variables which take all values in a given interval of numbers like age and their distribution can be described by a Probability Density Function (PDF). We will discuss below discrete random variables:", "It can be thought of a model for the experiment whose outcome is binary i.e. head/tail, yes/no etc. The outcome is positive with probability p and negative with probability 1-p.", "This distribution with parameter n and p is the generalized case of Bernoulli distribution where n is the number of sequence of random experiment and p is the probability of a positive outcome in each experiment. We can think of it as experiments like tossing a coin 20 times and calculating the probability of getting 9 heads where the probability of head in each trial is 0.6.", "This type of distribution is to model the number of Bernoulli trials with probability p of success until first success like throwing a die multiple times until \u20181\u2019 appears for the first time.", "This distribution is to model the probability of a given number of events k occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate \u03bb and independently of the time since the last event. The examples include the number of phone calls received by a call center or the number of emails per day etc.", "As the name suggests it is used to model the random experiments where all the discrete outcomes between a and b (b\u2265 a) are equally likely like throwing a fair die.", "It is used to model the probability distribution of the time between processes in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate \u03bb like the amount of time from now until an earthquake occurs.One of the important property of Exponential distribution is \u2018Memorylessness\u2019 which can be explained as if an event has not occurred after 30 seconds, the conditional probability that occurrence will take at least 10 more seconds is equal to the unconditional probability of observing the event more than 10 seconds after the initial time.", "It describes an experiment where the outcome is continuous i.e can take any value between a minimum and maximum value denoted as a and b. One of the examples can be a random number generator.", "This distribution is used to represent any real valued random variable whose distribution is unknown. Mean \u03bc and Variance \u03c3\u00b2 are used to denote it. If we plot the number of words for each tweet in a set of tweets we can see the shape follows a \u2018Bell Curve\u2019 and conclude that the distribution is Gaussian or Normal. We will see later why this distribution is so important.", "Covariance measures the joint variability of 2 separate random variables and the strength of their relationship is measured by Correlation coefficient. If Covariance is 0 then 2 random variables are independent but the converse is not true.", "In our small example, we generated \u2018data2' using \u2018data1\u2019 and they are related with each other and we can measure their Spearman\u2019s Correlation coefficient \u03c1 which ranges from -1 to +1 where -1 means strongest negative correlation, 0 means independent and +1 strongest positive correlation.", "The output will tell us that these 2 variables are positively correlated.", "In Statistics, Law of Large Number (LLN) is a theorem that says if we perform the same experiment a large number of times then the average of the outcomes of the experiments should be close to the true mean. The LLN is important because it guarantees stable long-term results for the averages of some random events and that is the reason why a casino will always make money in the long run even after losing money in a few instances.", "Mathematically, it says that if the same experiment is performed n (n is very large) times as independent and identical (i.i.d) experiments then the numerical average of the outcomes will be very close to the true mean \u03bc.", "Since any linear combination of normal random variable is also random in the below example the true mean of \u2018data\u2019 variable is 5 * 0 + 10 = 10. We will see when n increases from 10 to 100,000 the numerical average will become closer to the true mean 10.", "If we run the above code we will see this.", "The importance of Gaussian distribution comes from Central Limit Theorem (CLT) which states that under some conditions, the average of many observations of a random variable with finite mean and variance is itself a random variable whose distribution converges to a normal distribution as the number of samples increases even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed.", "If we plot the histogram of centered sample average after subtracting true mean and multiplying by \u221an we can pictorially conclude that the distribution is Gaussian and the mean is 0.", "Once we identify a distribution we need to statistically infer from it and make assumptions on unseen data and validate it. There are 3 main processes of doing it -", "The advantage of Central Limit Theorem(CLT) is that for large number of observations any distribution converges to Standard Normal distribution.", "The left hand side of the arrow in the above image is called the Test Statistic of an experiment and if we can calculate the Test Statistic(Z-score) we can definitely calculate the probability of this Test Statistic to be larger than a cut-off value and conversely if we know the probability(p-value) we can calculate the cut-off value because the probability at different cut-off value under a Standard Normal is readily available called Z-score table or Standard Normal table.", "Suppose we have a coin to toss and we assume the coin to be fair i.e. the chance of head is 0.5. This assumption forms the hypothesis about the experiment and this baseline hypothesis is called Null Hypothesis H_0. The alternative assumption is the coin is unfair and we call it Alternative Hypothesis H_1. We toss it 200 times and heads are obtained 170 times. If we form the Test Statistic as per Central Limit Theorem we will get -((\u221a200)((170/200) \u2014 0.5) / \u221a(0.5 * 0.5)) = 9.89 which is larger than 1.645 \u2014 the 95% quantile (assuming \u03b1=0.05)of Standard Normal distribution. So we can reject the Null Hypothesis and conclude that the coin is unfair.", "Type I error of a hypothesis test occurs when H_0 is rejected but it is actually true and Type II error occurs when H_0 is not rejected but H_1 is true.", "We will discuss common hypothesis tests and their purpose but before we do that we are going to discuss few special distributions.", "The assumption to apply Central Limit Theorem is that the sample size is large. If it is small (< 30) then the distribution of the random variables will follow a t-distribution instead of Gaussian distribution.", "The Chi-Square distribution with d degrees of freedom (Number of independent variables)is the distribution of a sum of d independent Standard Normal distribution. So its support is always positive. It is used in Goodness-of-Fit test of a distribution.", "The Student\u2019s t-test is a statistical hypothesis test where the Test Statistic follows t-Distribution under Null Hypothesis. We can think of a case where we want to see if the average \u2018Height\u2019 of Indians are statistically different from that of Germans. Since \u2018Height\u2019 of 2 different countries follows Normal distribution as per Central Limit Theorem and they are independent with each other we can apply Student\u2019s t-test.", "Say we measure the blood pressure of few individuals, apply some medicine and again after some time measure the blood pressure to see the impact of the medicine. Now the samples are not independent so we need a different version of t-Test called Paired Student\u2019s t-Test.", "ANOVA is the generalized form of t-Test when we have more than 2 independent random variable. One-Way ANOVA is used to determine if there is statistically significant differences between the means of 3 or more independent random variables. Instead of running pairwise t-Test we can directly use One-Way ANOVA and compute the F-Statistic.Repeated Measures ANOVA should be performed if the random variables are dependent.", "I have shown the manual calculation process as well in the above code and the output is -", "Chi-squared test is a statistical hypothesis test and comes under the category of Goodness-of-Fit test where a Test Statistic is expected to follow a Chi-Square distribution under Null Hypothesis and is used to test if there is statistically significant difference between the observed frequencies and expected frequencies for categorical variables.The observations are represented using a Contingency table as shown in the below code where each observation is independent from others and follows a Normal distribution.A typical example of Chi-Squared test can be determining the relationship of COVID19 between people of different ethnicity and age-band where different ethnicity can be used as row and age-bands as columns of a Contingency table.", "This type of tests comes under Non-Parametric Hypothesis tests where we don\u2019t have any parameter to test rather we test whether the observations follow Normal distribution or not.", "Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) PlotHere we pictorially try to measure whether the Cumulative Distribution Function(CDF) of the underlying random variable of the observations follows the CDF of a Normal distribution and we plot the quantile of one distribution again other. If they have same CDF then we should see a straight line from bottom-left corner to top-right corner.", "We can generate some random data and see its distribution and later we will see its Q-Q plot.", "We can see the \u2018data\u2019 with flattened peak and heavy tail is not Normal. We will now see its Q-Q plot which will also confirm our belief that the \u2018data\u2019 is not Normal and in the tails sample quantiles drifts away from theoretical quantiles.", "Shapiro-Wilk Test|D\u2019Agostino\u2019s K2 Test|Anderson-Darling TestAll these 3 are Non-Parametric tests that measure how far is the CDF of our sample distribution is from CDF of the distribution to check against. If we use the same \u2018data\u2019 variable we will see that these 3 test will also confirm that the \u2018data\u2019 variable is not Normally distributed.", "It is really an uphill task to filter out common statistical concepts and explain them in very generic terms but I wanted to give it a try.
