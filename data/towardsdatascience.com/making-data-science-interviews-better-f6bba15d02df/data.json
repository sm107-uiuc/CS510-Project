But lately, having observed my friends (and fellow boot camp grads) go through interview after interview, I have some constructive feedback for how companies can interview better.", "What\u2019s the actual objective of a business case interview? It\u2019s to test the ability of a candidate to both think critically and creatively when faced with an open-ended problem.", "But as an interviewer how do you assess these things? The thinking critically part is not as hard \u2014 if the person is stumbling through basic business strategy issues or making recommendations that don\u2019t make sense (given the context) then it\u2019s probably a no go.", "The ability to think creatively and formulate novel solutions to problems is much harder to assess. And I think interviewers (and companies in general) currently don\u2019t do a good job at this \u2014 despite the fact that the case interview\u2019s primary purpose is to measure this ability.", "The issue, in my opinion, is that interviewers prefer to use known, solved, business cases (often ones that they themselves have worked on) when they conduct interviews. The reasons for this are obvious:", "But these benefits are also the same reasons why the case interview is not as effective as companies generally think it is.", "When are people most open to new and novel suggestions? The answer is \u2014 it\u2019s when they themselves are not sure what the answer is. If they already have an answer in mind, especially if it\u2019s one that they came up with themselves, then those people will be anchored and possibly biased. In these cases, if a candidate suggests a solution that is different from yours, you will probably spend the time rationalizing why your approach is better and why their\u2019s is wrong when you really should be objectively assessing the candidate\u2019s answer.", "If the interviewer doesn\u2019t know the answer beforehand, the interview becomes more of a back and forth brainstorming session \u2014 and a more accurate simulation of how it would be like to work together for both people. As opposed to right now, where case interviews often turn into the interviewer sitting there waiting to hear a specific keyword or concept, while the candidate desperately blathers in an attempt to check all the boxes.", "So companies and interviewers, I implore you to give what I suggest a try. If you go into the interview with an unsolved problem and step out even 5% closer to a solution, isn\u2019t that pretty strong evidence that hiring the candidate would result in a mutually beneficial working relationship?", "It\u2019s my personal belief that if you can formulate the right question, then you are 80% of the way there. I would be much more impressed if you knew how to ask the right questions of the data and design the correct experiments (to answer those questions) than if you\u2019d memorized the derivation of OLS.", "Yes, fancy math implies a certain degree of knowledge and education. And the ability to map your ideas to Python code reasonably quickly is important too. But we live in a world of Google, Wikipedia, YouTube tutorials, and Stack Overflow.", "Think about how you solve an actual problem at work:", "So having an end-to-end solution already in your head is almost never the case. Thus, you should not expect your candidates to have one either. Rather assess them for their ability to ask the right questions and their ability to be resourceful and learn things on the fly \u2014 as those are better long term indicators of the candidate's ability to add value to your organization.", "A selection of my recent posts that I hope you will check out:", "Is Your Company Truly Data Driven?", "Are Data Scientists at Risk of Automation", "How Much Do Data Scientists Make?", "How Much Do Data Scientists Make Part 2", "How Much Do Software Engineers Make?", "A Better Way to Skill Up", "Your home for data science.
