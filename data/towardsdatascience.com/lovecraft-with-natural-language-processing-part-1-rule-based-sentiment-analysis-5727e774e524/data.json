I think classical literature is a really interesting application of NLP, you can showcase a wide array of topics from word counts and sentiment analysis to neural network text generation.", "I picked H. P. Lovecraft\u2019s stories as a subject of my analysis. He was an American writer from the early 20th century, famous for his weird and cosmic horror fiction, with a huge influence on modern pop culture. If you want to read more about why I think he is a great choice for a project like this, have a look at my previous post in which I also describe how I prepared the text we are going to analyse now.", "In the first post of the NLP series, we are going to have a closer look at rule-based sentiment analysis. The wider scope of sentiment analysis is definitely not the best first step to take in the world of NLP, however, the good thing about rule-based sentiment analysis is that it requires minimal pre-work. I wanted to start the project with something that can immediately be played with, without being bogged down by the technical details of tokenisations and lemmas and whatnot.", "We are going to apply VADER-Sentiment-Analysis to rank the writings of Lovecraft, from most negative to most positive. According to its GitHub page, VADER is \u201cspecifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media\u201d. In other words, the library is trained on a modern, slang-heavy corpus. This should be interesting because there were three things Lovecraft abhorred from the bottom of his heart:", "Let\u2019s start with a quick summary. Sentiment analysis is a type of NLP, and deals with the classification of emotions based on text data. You input a text, and the algorithm tells you how positive or negative it is. There are two main approaches one can take:", "We are going with the rule-based approach in our current project, let\u2019s have a closer look at our library next!", "VADER stands for Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner. At the core, it\u2019s a sentiment lexicon, they started with over 9,000 features (words, expressions, emojis), and asked people to rate them on a scale of -4 to +4, from most negative to most positive. Then they took the average of those ratings, excluded the ones that were found to be neutral, and collected them in a dictionary of 7,520 elements. (The GitHub repo also has a funny, comprehensive emoji collection.)", "In addition to this lexicon, there are a number of interesting tweaks. For example, the word \u201cextremely\u201d has no intrinsic negative or positive sentiment, it simply increases the intensity of the word it\u2019s attached to. There are also words that decrease the intensity, punctuations have meanings, negations like \u201cnot\u201d in \u201cnot very good\u201d cancel out or inverse the original sentiment, etc.", "Let\u2019s have a look at a couple of examples first.", "Install the library, and import the method that we are going to use:", "Next, we create a SentimentIntensityAnalyzer object:", "Remember that text file with the 7,520 tokens? You can view them in Python, let\u2019s see how the word \u201cadorned\u201d is rated:", "The result is 0.8. That is how positive this word is going to be, regardless of the context. We are not going to use the individual scores, that would be tedious, the polarity_scores method aggregates the text information for us.", "The first three values are the portion of the text that is negative, natural, or positive. On our case, 0.592 is deemed to be positive, 0.408 is neutral. The compound score is the overall negativity or positivity score, normalised, ranging from -1 to +1.", "Now, there is a chance that you, similar to me, would assume two things: 1) the portions are somehow connected to either the number of words or the number of characters and 2) the compound score can be calculated from the portions and the individual scores. You would be wrong on both accounts.", "I spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out how the portions and compound score are calculated exactly. For example, if you run the polarity_score method on \u201cadorned\u201d, which had a score of 0.8 in the lexicon, you get this result:", "The first three numbers look OK, after all, there is only one word in the text, and it is a positive one. But where does the compound score come from? It\u2019s close to 0.8 / 4, which you would get from normalising the original 0.8 score to the scale between -1 and +1, but it\u2019s not exactly. Similar issues with the previous example of \u201cI feel good\u201d, you would assume that \u201cI\u201d and \u201cfeel\u201d are the neutral words, and \u201cgood\u201d is a positive one, but where does the 0.408\u20130.592 split come from?", "There is a long description of how the scores are calculated on StackOverflow, in case you are interested. I for one drew the line here as to how much time I wanted to spend on investigating the code behind something that is ultimately just an interesting thought experiment.", "However, while I was there, I had a closer look at the code on GitHub, there are a number of interesting little details:", "And just to drive home the absurdity of measuring the nuances of human communication by such simple rules, guess which sentence is rated more negatively: \u201cI feel nothing inside\u201d or \u201cThe soup tastes bad\u201d.", "Yes, the one with the soup is rated to be more negative. In fact, the first sentence\u2019s score is completely neutral.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, VADER is a very impressive library, and works quite universally, as we will soon see. But like with many machine learning algorithms, the closer you look, the less magical it seems.", "All right, on to Lovecraft now!", "We are going to do a few test runs just to make sure that the library works with text that is from the early 20th century.", "Take this description from The White Ship (1919):", "Then came we to a pleasant coast gay with blossoms of every hue, where as far inland as we could see basked lovely groves and radiant arbours beneath a meridian sun.", "Running the polarity_scores returns this result:", "Sounds OK, it\u2019s a very positive text. However, I was curious to see what the basis of this score was in the lexicon. By splitting the text, we can gather the words in the sentence that are in the lexicon:", "Interesting, right? All that writing, and these three words determine the sentiment, like there was nothing else there, no \u201cgay with blossoms of every hue\u201d.", "Let\u2019s see a more typical Lovecraftian sequence, from Dagon (1917):", "I have said that the unbroken monotony of the rolling plain was a source of vague horror to me; but I think my horror was greater when I gained the summit of the mound and looked down the other side into an immeasurable pit or canyon, whose black recesses the moon had not yet soared high enough to illumine. I felt myself on the edge of the world; peering over the rim into a fathomless chaos of eternal night. Through my terror ran curious reminiscences of Paradise Lost, and of Satan\u2018s hideous climb through the unfashioned realms of darkness.", "The estimated sentiment of this segment:", "0.186 of the text is deemed to be negative, and 0.121 is positive. However, the overall compound score, -0.8074, is close to the negative limit, which means the intensity of the negative segments were much stronger.", "Once again, we can gather the individual words with an assigned non-neutral score:", "Like with the first example, we can see how most of the information is not processed. No \u201cunbroken monotony\u201d or \u201ceternal night\u201d in the list. We can also see that there are some misclassifications. For example, the word \u201cgreater\u201d in the expression \u201cmy horror was greater\u201d gets a +1.6 score, but it is meant to be an increase in negativity. But the main thing is, it somehow got the overall sentiment right.", "In general, I am quite satisfied with the performance so far: the overall score seems to be reflective of the sentiment a human would assign to the text. The only thing left to do is to apply this to the complete corpus!", "Before we jump into the ranking, I would like to emphasise once more that we are heavily in thought experiment territory. I think rule-based sentiment analysis is a high-level approximation at its best, and VADER was created with the intention of analysing modern, short, informal texts, none of which is true for Lovecraft\u2019s writing.", "With the warnings out of the way, without further ado, I used the code below to process the writings and save the results in lists. The list filenames contains the individual story names.", "Then, I created a pandas DataFrame object from these lists. Statistics of the 4 scores:", "One clear conclusion we can draw is that the writings are mostly negative. the 75th percentile of the compound score is still negative, and the average sentiment is -0.5025. Only 16 out of 63 writings got an overall positive score.", "All right, let\u2019s see the list. The 5 most positive writings are, based on the compound score:", "There is a very interesting common factor here: all of these stories deal with the protagonist \u201cdreaming\u201d themselves into magical fantasy worlds, they are mostly descriptions of landscapes and cities, and not much action takes place in them. They undoubtedly use a rather positive language, we saw one example from The White Ship earlier, but the overall tone of these stories is rather melancholic, and no human reader would categorise them as \u201chappy\u201d. However, it\u2019s quite interesting to see that the sentiment analysis algorithm managed to separate this group of stories from the \u201creally dark\u201d ones.", "(By the way, in case you are interested, you can read more about the stories in this bibliography.)", "The 5 most negative writings are:", "The common theme here is that these stories are more plot-heavy (relatively speaking), longer, more complicated writings. They are also quite famous, three out of these five is among Lovecraft\u2019s most influential works. In case you are wondering, most of his other famous stories like At the Mountains of Madness (1931), Herbert West \u2014 Reanimator (1922), The Case of Charles Dexter Ward (1927) are also among the Top 10 darkest stories. The Call of Cthulhu (1926) is #16.", "It\u2019s also interesting to see in the statistics table that the majority of the text in all the writings is neutral, the neutral portions range from 71.4% to 90.5% of the texts. This would support the concept that despite the overall depressive tone, the narration in Lovecraft\u2019s writings is usually calm and distant, apart from the occasional \u201cThe horror, the horror, the indescribable horror!\u201d sections. But it could also be caused by the majority of the dictionary not being present in the VADER lexicon.", "In case you want to see all the results, you can access them here in a CSV file. There are also large charts for the overall compound score and the text portions.", "There are a number of additional analysis one could do with VADER on this corpus. For example, you could split the stories into sentences, and see how negative they are over the course of the story. Are there relatively neutral starting points, and then a peak in the middle, or the other way around? It would definitely be interesting to see that.", "I hope you found this post helpful, in the next one, we are going to have a closer look at tokenisation and word analysis.", "Hutto, C.J. & Gilbert, E.E.
