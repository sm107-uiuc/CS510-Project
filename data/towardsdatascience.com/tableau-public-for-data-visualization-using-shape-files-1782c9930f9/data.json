As often stated, \u201cWalking is important to a city\u201d, the pedestrian activity is an indication of economic prosperity, safety, and convenience of people residing in a city. An automated pedestrian counting system developed by the City of Melbourne enabled the development of an information repository that can be utilized to analyze the activity of residents across different parts of the city. The pedestrian counting sensors installed in various locations across the city transmit data to a central server which can then be utilized towards better decision making and planning for the future. This project aims to deep dive into the data gathered using these sensors to address two key questions:", "A five-step iterative process starting with data gathering, attribute synthesis, data wrangling, hypothesis generation, and data visualization was used to derive key findings and insights about the questions at hand. The detailed process of the same is outlined in Figure 1 below.", "Two separate datasets used for this analysis are outlined below:", "The data dictionary, i.e. information about different data attributes are included in the Jupyter Notebook and can also be found here. The Pedestrian Counting System \u2014 Sensor Locations dataset is at a Sensor ID level (primary key) whereas the Pedestrian Counting System \u2014 2019 dataset is at a Sensor ID, date-time level (primary keys).", "Data wrangling is defined as the process of structuring, cleaning, and transforming the data into a format that can facilitate better decision making in quicker turn around times. The data was obtained in a tabular format hence restructuring wasn\u2019t required. However, a Jupyter notebook was developed to look for data anomalies, missing values, outliers, and other data issues. The findings from the wrangling exercise are outlined below:", "The Pedestrian_Counting_System_-_Sensor_Locations.csv file had information for 66 different sensor ids of which the direction information was missing for four sensors. On further deep dive, it was seen that these sensors were either removed or are inactive. The information about these sensors can be seen in Figure 2 below. The \u201cnote\u201d column has missing values for the majority of the sensors.", "None of the columns from the Pedestrian_Counting_System_2019.csv dataset had missing values. A quick description/summary statistic of the numerical columns exhibited that the figures are in range. The column \u201cHourly_Counts\u201d indicated significant skewness of the pedestrian counts. The 75th percentile and maximum value of the pedestrian count recorded are significantly different and can be attributed to events, holidays, seasonal trends, etc. The summary statics of Sensors with at-least 7% outliers are shown in Figure 3 below.", "On further deep dive, 8 sensors IDs were obtained that are part of the Pedestrian_Counting_System_-_Sensor_Locations.csv dataset however they are absent in the Pedestrian_Counting_System_2019.csv dataset. Findings below:", "A top-down approach is used to break the problem into multiple factors (hypothesis). Based on data availability these factors are then analyzed using visualizations in Tableau to identify key findings or trends. The treemap for hypothesis synthesis can be found here.", "Data were explored in Tableau using visualizations to check for data anomaly. Figure 4 shows that the pedestrian traffic volume collected by the sensors is skewed towards the left and the box plot also shows the presence of outliers. As discussed earlier, outliers are not treated as multiple factors like seasonality, events, time, and day of the week impacts the pedestrian volume recorded. Figure 5 shows that the pedestrian volume is not recorded for a few of the sensors, e.g. Sensors 32, 63\u201366, etc. as illustrated in the bar graph below. Since most of the analysis is based on pedestrian volume by regions and date-time, these sensors weren\u2019t dropped.", "The processed data is uploaded to Tableau along with two shapefiles to understand the impact of demographics, suburbs, and areas of interest on the pedestrian count in 2019. The visualizations are represented using Figures 6, 7, and 8 below.", "2. Land use can broadly be classified into recreational, transport, agriculture, residential, and commercial. Areas that fall under commercial and recreational are expected to have higher footfall when compared to the rest. Pedestrian density recorded in 2019 is much higher in and around CBD when compared to other areas as visible in Figure 6 above. The area between La Trobe Street and Eureka Tower that hosts several MNCs and recreational spots observed higher pedestrians in 2019 than surrounding areas", "3. Sensors closer to metro stations like Southern Cross and Melbourne Central have higher pedestrian count compared to other sensor spots", "4. The Activity Centre Zone (ACZ) is the preferred tool to guide and facilitate land-use planning in activity centres. Figure 7 below shows the presence of Activity Centres in an around the area under analysis. Inner Metro and Inner South East regions have a higher number of activity centres and observed higher pedestrian volume in 2019 as captured by the sensors in and around these areas", "Figure 9 and 10 below analyzes the variation of pedestrian volume across the day of the week and time of the day. Time of day is categorized into different buckets based on the usual volume expected.", "About the Author: Advanced analytics professional and management consultant helping companies find solutions for diverse problems through a mix of business, technology, and math on organizational data.
