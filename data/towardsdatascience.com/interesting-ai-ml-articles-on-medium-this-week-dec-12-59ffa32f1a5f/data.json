But that doesn\u2019t stop deep fake Santa Claus from making an appearance this Christmas. Thomas Smith explores an AI video generation tool that produces deep fake Santas. These synthetically generated Santas can utter words from provided scripts.", "Jair Ribeiro visualises a future where his daughters experience the comfort and efficiency of automated driving cars.", "Also, If you are a fan of Game Of Thrones, then Sajid Lhessani\u2019s unique take on the association of programming languages and GOT characters is an article you have to read.", "These are just examples of the interesting articles I came across this week. Feel free to scroll through my compiled list of AI/ML/DS articles that are sure to provide some form of value to ML practitioners.", "Thomas Smith\u2019s article explores the workings of an AI-generated, deep fake Santa Claus produced by Synthesia, a company that specialises in creating AI video.", "The premise of the tool is that a fake Santa is created and utters words that are scripted by you. The tool used to generate the fake Santa can be accessed via the Synthesia site \u2014 read through Thomas\u2019s article to obtain a link.", "This is an intriguing read, as it showcases the creative applicability of deep fakes to more human-centric events. Perhaps this technology could replace celebratory cards with a more special and unique deep fake replacement.", "Target Audience: Machine Learning Practitioners (Healthcare)", "Eugenio Zuccarelli\u2019s article provides information around three notable AI trends within the Healthcare industry. This article goes through methods which AI/ML technology is leveraged to support, simplify and optimise existing processes within health institutions such as hospitals.", "To conclude this article, Eugenio touches on the pushback the mentioned AI technology will face as they are integrated into healthcare systems. Rejections of these technologies are usually a result of concerns of regulation, privacy and trust.", "Jair Riberio, a father of three, ponders in this article if his Digital Natives daughters will require a driving license in the year 2038. Jair intuition and perspective of the current trajectory of tech advancement guides him to the conclusion that his daughters might be able to operate an autonomous vehicle without a driving license.", "This whole article is a creative take on the projection of the future of transportation and mobility in which Jair leverages good use of imagery to illustrate scenarios of the comfort and ease of mobility to be enjoyed in a future powered by AI algorithms.", "Jair\u2019s retelling of the current state of road traffic incidents and recollections of personal tragedy provides a reminder of the necessity of a more efficient and safer form of transportation and general mobility.", "Overall the article is a great read, as we are brought along a father\u2019s journey as he considers the likely possibility of a world filled with automation and efficiency.", "Samuel Martins includes and expands on the key takeaways from the efforts of researchers surveying technical debt associated with machine learning systems.", "The topic of technical debt isn\u2019t discussed enough. Still, Samuel\u2019s article is an introduction into an area of machine learning and software development that is usually an afterthought.", "The provision of definitions and explanations of domain-specific terminologies makes this an informative read for general ML practitioners.", "I\u2019ve never given the thought of associating programming languages to characters of the popular TV show Game Of Thrones. But after reading Sajid\u2019s article, the included associations make perfect sense.", "This article is a fun read and probably the most excellent example of creative writing.", "Without giving any spoilers, I reckon a lot of readers will be shocked with the association of the programming language Python. And I have to say PHP\u2019s GOT character association is unarguable.", "Target Audience: Computer Vision Engineers(Deep Learning)", "Cheng He explains the details behind a neural network architecture, Transformer, that\u2019s unifying the approaches taken to solve computer vision(CV) and natural language processing(NLP) tasks.", "More specifically, in this article, there is an inclusion of technical details of associated research efforts where the Transfomer architecture has been leveraged to solve computer vision tasks.", "Cheng\u2019s article provides external resources that answer a series of questions surrounding the premise of utilising Transformer for computer vision tasks, including the realised benefits and possible limitations the architecture imposes.", "This article is Ygor\u2019s effort to summarise the key takeaways from the third instalment of the State of AI created by Nathan Benaich and Ian Hogarth.", "An external resource to the full report is provided within Ygor\u2019s article, but if you are short on time, then Ygor provides a quick digest of the key information from the report.", "Each point and takeaways extracted from this report and included in Ygor digest article is referenced to by the slide number, so it\u2019s easy to retrace information back to the source for further details.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
