If not, just skip and read on.", "GoogleBigQuery is GoogleCloud\u2019s data warehousing solution (one of the many) and quite ideal for working with relational data such as those in this tutorial.", "In part 1, I illustrated how you can automate the data feeds into BigQuery using Cloud Functions.

You can then use the CAST function to convert text data types to floats, in order to be able to add and divide numbers, and the ROUND function to round returns to just two decimals.", "You can avoid using the CAST function if your data types are already the correct ones (i.e. numeric for numbers, etc..)", "The stock\u2019s moving averages across 5-day periods are then calculated as:", "you can use the AVG function to compute the mean of the Close price for each different Symbol, considering a row window made up of the current day\u2019s Close and the previous 4 days making up the 5 day time period.", "The same logic is replicated across 10 and 15 day periods.", "Putting everything together, you obtain the following SQL query:", "In summary, the query pulls from both the SPhistorical (aliased as \u201cp\u201d) and SPcomponents table (aliased as \u201cc\u201d).

Refer to this quick guide for details on adding charts to your blank report on Data Studio.", "The S&P500 is well balanced across industry sectors. The top 3 in order of prevalence are Industrials, Information Technology and Financials, with making up around a 13\u201314% share of the total.", "2) How are these firms distributed geographically (in terms of HQ base)?", "In terms of HQ location, one can see a prevalence of US firms, as expected, with some European firms present. When using a map, you can make good use of the toolbar to zoom in&out, entering full screen-mode, and overall adjusting the map view.", "3) How has the SPY* performed historically?", "Next, I plot the SPY daily Close over the years using a line chart, to get a sense of its trend.", "In the long term, the SPY goes from around 150 to 300+ in value, providing for a steady increase.", "4) How does the latest trend in rolling averages look like for the SPY?", "I then plot the 5/10/15 day moving averages in more recent times, to see how they stack against each other. Having chosen similar time scales for the three metric, you can see that in general they tend to track each other quite closely, with the 15-day period average showing a bit more variability around the general trend line.", "The period choice for calculating moving averages has no intrinsic reason and was just computed in order to be plotted. You can definitely learn more about moving averages online, as there are plenty of valuable tutorials.", "Putting everything together, you can the add a headline and title to you report, and obtain something along the lines of:", "Which allows you to get a complete snapshot of your data and indicators of interest.", "As you can see, Data Studio is quite simple to use and provides great data connectors and interactivity.", "Your workflow is officially set up.
