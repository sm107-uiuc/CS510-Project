We are offering a class with broad discussion times to encourage all students around the world to participate and recording all lecture and discussion material.", "What are 60% of students doing? Are they just watching recordings? For reference, when I lectured this class last spring to 800 people enrolled (on Zoom), 100 watched live and the recordings rarely hit 250 views. 450/800 students have seen neither before the final. This was before our student body was spread across the globe, and as a staff, we have 0 insight into this, which is quite the predicament for an education institution. This leads to major questions:", "I want to engage on three main themes:", "Online courses are a wild-west for students. It\u2019s the merging of trends of reduced community in courses with increased digital engagement among individual students. Students learn and feel valued by having opportunities to engage. A blog post summarizing the trends in research on engagement is to the point (check it out for the studies it references):", "Research has historically indicated strong correlations between student engagement (typically defined as attention to the area of focus, active participation in learning, and time on task) and student achievement. These correlations remain strong for all levels of instruction, across all subject areas, and for varying instructional activities.", "That is the problem we are unintentionally contending with. Current Universities are structured for in-person engagement (giant lecture halls aside) but this holds no weight in the transition to online classes. See more about the links between engagement and learning in terms of in-lecture responses and of drop out rates.", "(Online courses can probably learn from live-streamers, such as 3blue1brown).", "There is no question that students have less of a barrier to asking questions through a chat box than in person, but I think it leaves a disconnect. There is feedback loop between the subtle emotional cues of students and the instructor. You cannot replicate the feeling of 100 confused faces looking up at you after you sped through one too many lecture slides (speaking from experience, it\u2019s daunting). This mismatch has consequences.", "Consider this quote from a Data 100 instructor (thanks Vikram) in the spring:", "\u201c I think TAs need more help create that sort of [actively engaged] atmosphere. e.g., in a classroom it\u2019s really easy for me to go up to the board and scribble out an example, but I can\u2019t do that if we\u2019re on Zoom (even with an iPad, not super easy unless you have the Apple Pencil).\u201d", "Where does this help come from?

Are the students playing a passive game on Zoom while we lecture to them, or is this still a useful form of teaching.", "Students come and go from Zoom rooms as if there is no social barrier, and that\u2019s because there isn\u2019t \u2014 there\u2019s a digital button.", "A question I am wondering is: What is the sweet spot where people don\u2019t leave/will engage/don\u2019t free float in a discussion section? Ie, what is the optimal number of students in an online discussion considering the leaving mechanisms (too empty or too full) and the freeloader effect. My hypothesis is 8\u201312 students, which is much less than that of in-person discussions (amplified effects that were already in place because it's easy to leave and easy to not contribute).", "The problem is, this does not scale to bigger classes \u2014 there already are not enough instructors! So, should we still host discussions is students are going to watch recordings?", "Content repetition in a section is of less value if everything is recorded, online, or in a published notebook. Should classes be designed to be fully synchronous (students do material with each other) or to cover every student\u2019s preferences?", "When setting up a course, staff generally wants each student to be able to attend every option. Normally, the only constrain is other courses, now the big constraint is global timezones. When setting up discussion times at the beginning of the semester, the question is if coverage is an access problem or a staffing problem.", "A small story about designing times for CS 188 \u2014 introduction to artificial intelligence \u2014 this summer.", "We used Piazza to poll timezones (there are no great options, but this is not the one to use). Unsurprisingly, this showed a focus around Pacific Time, but there were students that considered every timezone around the world a working hour. The problem with the Piazza tool is that it does not record identities per hour slot \u2014 therefore you cannot see which students have coverage based on buckets of section times (the ultimate goal is to increase this percentage). I don\u2019t think anyone at a University will want to make discussion times exactly proportional to preferences (because there are so few instructors that rounding will leave people out), but the task of guaranteeing every student to have a slot is tough.", "Or, consider the approach of my friend Professor David Delchamps at Cornell University: he records his lectures alone and releases them so the students that can make the lecture time are not at an advantage, and the lecture slot is now office hours. These design decisions are going into place with no overhead from departments and no studies to reference.", "The question everyone needs to be asking while we get sparse signals back from students, instructors, and professors is: how is this affecting underrepresented groups that don\u2019t have a microphone to express their concerns. Two mechanisms come to mind.", "A) How does the credibility of staff remain after a miss up with a deadline etc when there\u2019s no in-person network? Are students more or less forgiving online? How does this evolve semester-to-semester?", "B) Hallway effect of schools. What benefits do random interactions have and who do they benefit? Should there be discord channels to chat in? Can the university facilitate this and do network effects decay on a per-class basis (suggesting some permanence to the bonds), faster (suggesting seeing people always is important), or slower (suggesting there are more complicated effects at play)?", "Industry analysts have pinned education as the most difficult industry to automate [source, source]. I distilled this: we can automate learning, but we cannot automate education. Education is a system, learning is about a subject.", "Who benefits from massive online open courses (MOOC) and who benefits from structured, incremental education? Take a second to formulate your own prior.", "Those who want to learn about a specific subject matter benefit from MOOCs of today (think someone learning computer science skills), but I haven\u2019t heard of one person who gained their scientific ability and critical thinking from an online course \u2014 those are from structured (breadth) learning that allows for freedom (depth in arguments). People take existing abilities and combine them with rapid, available online learning to pivot careers or make products.", "Some people think robot tutors can solve this (reading on robots teaching), but I think this is very, very far from the truth. Robots can provide information, but they cannot process the complex interaction of teaching. Online courses are pretty much robots trying to teach people on confined tracks \u2014 this doesn\u2019t scale well. The language processing abilities are limited in AI now, and there are no content creation AI\u2019s, so I really doubt intricate automatic learning systems will be comparable (simple ones are still valuable yes).", "As Universities become more like online courses, the education system will resemble more of just learning things rather than engendering intelligent process. This is a slippery slope I am afraid of.", "Some more related articles: the education/culture tradeoff in Flanders, a culture in education study on African American students, a Washington Post article on the point of education beyond learning.", "When writing this I got an email from UC Berkeley that the number of COVID19 cases on campus jumped from a cumulative total of 23 prior to July 2020 to 47 new cases in the last week (traced to Greek Life parties). I see the public school systems and Universities in large urban centers to be hard-pressed to open in the next 12 months.", "This is a brief section, because it\u2019s mostly just recent events. Many schools are announcing their plans for the fall. Two big examples are Harvard going online and Cornell opening. Cornell\u2019s surprise announcement was based on a survey showing most students would still want to come to campus if online (that\u2019s a big value-statement from students in terms of what campus means to them). Cornell then will use this physical presence to monitor cases and provide medical help, rather than students being on campus and around without official opening.", "The ability to open comes from an isolated location. Schools in cities like Harvard will have a hard time opening (even though Columbia has said otherwise, I think it is a risk).", "You know there are tons of jokes around about the value of educations when they go online, and there are a couple of reasons it\u2019s so hard \u2014 the difficulty is disambiguating the different values that different individuals receive. Some students benefit entirely from the brand (and connections \u2014 stereotypical student-athlete at Harvard), which would warrant maintaining tuition (or raising in some school\u2019s cases), but many students do actually benefit from an education (with lower than $50k/year value).", "This gap is impossible to quantify, but individuals will make it clear when they do not enroll in some schools, when some schools close, and when some schools are forced to innovated (and maybe undercut on tuition and aim for transfers to boost income).", "I\u2019ll leave this essay with a thought: will any mid-tier universities opt for increased digital enrollment at the cost of reputation? The process is: dramatically lower tuition (~10%) and makes transfer acceptances high and of low bureaucratic burden. Could this steal students from other schools when the class material is all digital and easy to reproduce?", "Your home for data science.
