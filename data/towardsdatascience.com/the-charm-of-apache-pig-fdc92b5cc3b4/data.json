The objective of this article is to discuss how Apache Pig becomes prominent among rest of the Hadoop tech tools and why and when someone should utilize Pig for their big data tasks.", "Anyone with a reasonable understanding of Hadoop knows that it is capable of handling large volumes of data in a distributed manner. Hadoop\u2019s programming model called MapReduce enables processing large datasets in parallel by splitting a job into a set of map tasks and reduce tasks. MapReduce is the underlying low-level programming model and these jobs can be implemented using languages like Java and Python.", "Consider a simple word count task that we want to achieve via Hadoop. The intention of this job is to count the number of occurrences of each word in a given input set. Following code snippet shows how this can be achieved using a mapper class and a reducer class written using Java. This is an example provided in https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/MapReduceTutorial.html#Source_Code", "OK, so this code snippet consists of 61 lines of code. To write something like this, you must clearly understand the fundamental concepts and theories of MapReduce. And, you should know the set of libraries or packages provided in your preferred language and how they should be put together. Mappers, reducers, and other utility methods must be called or combined explicitly into a pipeline to achieve the overall outcome (main method in this example) Out of all, this piece of code has to be compiled and deployed. Sounds a little complex right, especially if you do not have a MapReduce or Java background?", "When I wrote my first MapReduce program using Java, I asked this question myself \u2014 \u2018isn\u2019t there any easier way of achieving this?\u2019. The answer is \u2018Yes, there is, and that is with Apache Pig\u2019.", "Apache Pig is a high-level platform for creating programs that run on Hadoop. The language for this platform is called Pig Latin.", "Pig Latin is a SQL like scripting language, that abstracts the programming concepts of MapReduce. If you are familiar with basic concepts of SQL, putting a MapReduce job in place using Pig Latin is a task of just a few minutes. It converts the underlying complex concepts of MapReduce into a very high-level programming model.", "Now let\u2019s see how the above word count task we did with Java MapReduce can be achieved using Pig Latin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Pig).", "With Pig Latin, we have reduced the previous 61 lines to 7 lines. And the same task is achieved by manipulating a couple of keywords. And a piece of code like this is easy to implement as well as it is easy to be understood by someone else. So, it is obvious that Apache Pig reduces the learning and development curve of MapReduce. Understanding the above 7 lines of code is the challenge I am going to leave for you. If you are interested, you can start learning basics of Pig Latin here: https://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.17.0/basic.html", "Following table provides a summarized comparison of Apache Pig and MapReduce based on the above example.", "Even though we tried to differentiate between MapReduce and Apache Pig, we have to understand that Apache Pig is built on top of MapReduce.", "Pig scripts are converted into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) through the parser and then input into the optimizer to perform further optimizations. Optimizer performs logical optimizations such as projections and passes the optimized logical plan to the compiler. Compiler converts this to a set of MapReduce jobs and passes to the execution engine. This architecture too proves that the benefit comes in terms of ease of implementation and understandability. Apache Pig acts as a high-level wrapper for complex concepts of MapReduce and provides an easy to deal with scripting framework for users.", "Let\u2019s dig a little deeper into some interesting features of Apache Pig.", "Knowing the capabilities of Apache Pig, now let us see for what types of tasks it is used in the real world. We were clear that the benefit comes up with the ease of learning, developing, and understanding. So if we are planning to integrate Apache Pig into real world big data systems, our objective should be to utilize that benefit. Apache Pig can be used,", "I believe I gave you enough motivation to start learning Apache Pig through this article. It will always be a value addition to your big data tool set. So why don\u2019t you start now?", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "A software engineer by profession. A Technical Lead.
