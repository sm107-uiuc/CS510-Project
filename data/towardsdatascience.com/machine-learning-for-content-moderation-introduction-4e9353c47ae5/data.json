While the growth of these platforms brings many benefits and allows people to remain connected with each other and collectively organize across the world, it also brings problems such as the propagation of fake news, and online abuse such as cyberbullying. As the legal and social environments surrounding these interaction spaces mature, there is an increasing burden on these companies to police their platforms. They are becoming increasingly responsible for the maintenance and quality of their platforms.", "However, with billions of users, and millions of messages and photos posted on these platforms, it is impossible for these companies to manually inspect each one. Instead, they typically leverage machine learning systems to automatically parse the content uploaded to their websites. The submissions that are flagged as breaking a rule are then submitted to manual reviewers who provide a final judgment on whether or not that piece of content should be allowed on the site.", "First, it is important to go into some examples of content that is typically targeted by content moderation systems. Content is typically dealt with in one of the two following methods \u2014 either through preemptive warnings before submission of suspected abusive content, or through deletion and/or punishment after-the-fact.", "The first category involves content that aims to harass or abuse someone or a group of people online. This includes various types of behavior such as: cyber-aggression, cyber-bullying, hate speech, and doxxing. While some of these social phenomenon are somewhat difficult to define, companies nonetheless have made efforts to automatically detect them. After the occurrence of several incidents involving cyber-bullying that have unfortunately led to self-harm and suicide, companies such as Facebook and Instagram have faced increasing pressure to add reporting options and increased moderation. Most approaches for abusive content detection use a mixture of natural language processing, image processing, and social network analysis.", "The next category involves content that is either false or misleading, which aims to utilize a social network to accelerate the spread of false information, typically in the form of news articles. Most commonly, we hear of this content under the politically-charged phrase \u201cfake news\u201d. Detecting fake news is an open area of research, and presents many challenges, as it is impossible to manually fact check every article. Current approaches use various methods such as incorporating large general/common-sense knowledge-bases, natural language processing, and incorporating various reputation-based factors through social network analysis and stylistic elements of the content.", "The next category involves nudity and sexually-explicit content. This is typically detected through image processing methods. Different platforms have different stances no this \u2014 for example, Instagram does not allow it at all, whereas Reddit allows all (legal) cases of it. Most notably, Tumblr recently decided to change their policy on explicit content, and banned pornography and most cases of nudity.", "Finally, we have content that aims to scam, phish, or hack users on the platform. This type of content will typically try to get users to leave the platform, and use another website. On this external website, the user will typically be tricked into either submitting personal information, or sending money to an unintended party. This is often accomplished by either mimicking the URLs on the original website (often through homoglyph attacks), or by promising the user a better deal on some purchase by using the external website. This content is typically detected through natural language processing, collections of known phishing links, and reputation-based factors through social network analysis and account factors.", "Now that we have an understanding of common types of moderated content, we can go into an overview of how most automated content moderation systems function. This usually occurs in two main stages.", "First, of course, the content is created and submitted by the user.", "If this user is known to be a rule-breaker or the content is very obviously against the rules based on some basic checks, the user may be shadow-banned and the content may be automatically hidden, unbeknownst to them.", "Otherwise, features are calculated to be inputted into the content moderation machine learning models. Some of these features may have already been calculated through a scheduled batch-processing system if they are not a function of the content itself (such as user features), while others may be computed on-the-fly if they are directly derived from the submitted content (such as features that involve the text or image). In addition, after submission, if the content is manually flagged by other users, it may be re-processed.", "Based on these features, the machine learning model outputs a score that may be interpreted as a probability. If this score is above a certain threshold, the content is flagged for human review, as it is suspected to be breaking the platform\u2019s rules. Naturally, as these are businesses that aim to optimize their expenses, this threshold is typically chosen with mathematical rigor, so to optimize some metric that balances the cost of rule-breaking with the cost of manual labeling.", "Once content has been flagged, it then gets passed onto a human reviewer who manually inspects it. They are typically given a small amount of training to identify rule-breaking content. These manual reviewers operate very quickly, and may spend only a few seconds to review each piece of content. Due to the type of content that they have to view on a daily basis, the work conditions of these workers has been brought up as problematic.", "After reviewing the content, the reviewer then makes a final judgment on whether or not the content violates any rules. Usually, each submission will be assigned to a few reviewers (~5), in order to hopefully eliminate inconsistent results that arise from labeling mistakes or different interpretations.", "Once the final labels are in, the content is then acted upon if it was in violation of any rules. This typically means that the content is deleted. The user\u2019s account may also be penalized or deleted.", "Finally, this piece of content is then stored alongside its given label(s). Future iterations of the content flagging machine learning models will most likely use this new piece of data in their training sets. Through this process, no data is wasted, and the models are able to be constantly retrained and can adapt to changing patterns in user submissions.", "Your home for data science.
