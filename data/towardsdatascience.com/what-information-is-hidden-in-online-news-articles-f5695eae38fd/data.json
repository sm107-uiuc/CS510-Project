Not only do they contain the statements to be disseminated, but also implicitly other information about the publisher and its employees. This flow of information is usually not intended, and the publishers are not even aware of it.", "These are not secret hidden messages embedded in individual messages, as some people believe to find secret messages in Beatles songs, but information that is only apparent when a large amount of data is viewed together and correctly combined. In this article, I would like to show this with some examples.", "I will find in the article, for example, references to the fact that editors of the daily newspaper \u201cDer Standard\u201d like to sleep longer on weekends, and write longer articles in the morning or on weekends in the morning. The rest of the day seems to be dominated by agency reports.", "Especially the newspaper \u201cKronen Zeitung\u201d but also the portal \u201coe24.at\u201d publish, not unexpectedly, hardly any longer articles. The fact that here, in contrast to the \u201cStandard\u201d, it is about ten times as much is a bit surprising.", "From the publications of editors named by name, information can be gained about their vacation behavior or which other editors they might be close to.", "As data for the examples I have selected the news articles of the online edition of three Austrian daily newspapers:- \u201c\u00d6sterreich\u201d \u2014 www.oe24.at- \u201cKronen Zeitung\u201d \u2014 www.krone.at- \u201cDer Standard\u201d \u2014 www.derstandard.atThe first two can be assigned to the Boulevard, the latter is called a quality newspaper.", "To get a first overview of the data, we will look at the number of articles published by the different newspapers each day.", "All 3 newspapers considered show a weekly cycle, which is most pronounced in the \u201cStandard\u201d, on weekends and holidays there is much less publication. On average, just over 100 articles are written. On oe24.at since the beginning of October significantly more.", "Now let\u2019s look at the time of day and the day of the week when the news was published. The size of the dots describes the number of articles. The color code also indicates the average text length (number of words) per time. Blue circles stand for short articles, the darker the red tone, the longer the articles are.", "Publication is mostly during the day, and on weekends we start a little later. Here the editors seem to want to sleep a little longer. In general, less is published on weekends.", "From the coloring, one can see that the editorship of the \u201cstandard\u201d obviously takes itself in the morning of each day and on weekends time to write long articles, as expected from a \u201cquality medium\u201d. Are mainly short agency reports distributed later in the day?", "The next picture shows a slightly different picture for the editorial office of \u201c\u00d6sterreich \u2014 oe24.at\u201d, here there are only a small number of longer articles 6 o\u2019clock in the morning, shortly before midnight and Friday noon. What kind of articles are these?Here too, more is published on weekdays.", "But I don\u2019t only want to know when and with which text length the publication will be made, but also about which topics. For this purpose, I have subjected the individual articles to an automatic topic assignment.", "The analysis was done with the \u201cNews Intelligence Platform\u201d from \u201cAylien\u201d and used \u201cIAB\u201d as categorization. This categorization was developed in order to assign the right content to online advertisements.In my example, only the main categories were used.", "Now let\u2019s look at how many articles were published in the most important categories by the three news producers. The size of the circles reflects the total number in the period under consideration.", "Now we will have a look if there are any differences in when the articles on the different topics will be published. The following chart shows for the \u201cStandard\u201d the distribution of publications over time for the two most common categories \u201cPolitics\u201d and \u201cSports\u201d.", "The number of articles for the sports sector increases much more slowly in the morning than for politics. Is this because there is not too much to report about sports in the morning, or because sports editors like to sleep in?", "The data for the articles of \u201cKrone\u201d and \u201cOe24.at\u201d show the same picture.", "If you also assign the individual articles to a \u201ctopic map\u201d, you get a picture of how the different articles are distributed. The following graphic shows the distribution of the articles and the most important categories for the \u201cStandard\u201d.", "Nearby points stand for articles that are similar, and the colors reflect the topics.For this illustration, a \u201cSentence Embedding\u201d was calculated for the title of each article, which encodes the meaning of the title. More about this in the article:", "Subsequently, a dimensionally reduced 2D plot was generated using the \u201ct-SNE\u201d method. More about this in the article:", "to t-SNE with Python Example\nIntroductiontowardsdatascience.com", "The average text length for the \u201cKronen Zeitung\u201d hardly varies from topic to topic and is also significantly shorter than the standard. At \u201cOe24.at\u201d the picture is similar with the exception that the articles are generally a bit longer, and there are longer articles for the \u201cAutomotive\u201d section.", "The average text length for the \u201cStandard\u201d is ten times longer than for the \u201cKronen Zeitung\u201d. The data confirm the prejudice that tabloids hardly ever provide text. The \u201cstandard\u201d also has significant differences in length between the subject areas. \u201cNews\u201d articles, for example, are significantly shorter than the rest.", "Some newspapers mark the articles with the names of the editors or with parts of the editorial staff. In the case of the Kronenzeitung, for example, the articles can be assigned to the individual federal states\u2019 editorial offices. This makes it clear how active the individual state editors are.", "It can be seen that over the entire period considered, the Viennese central editorial office is the most active, and provinces such as Burgenland and Vorarlberg contribute only a little.", "If one evaluates articles that show the name of the author, personal statements can be made. In the following figure, the names are therefore made unrecognizable.", "From the evaluation some interesting information can be taken, then one recognizes easily firmly employed editors and free coworkers by the number of the contributions. The color code can be used to assign people to thematic areas, and gaps in the publications can indicate vacations. In this way, indications of shared vacations in the editorial department can also be collected from such graphics. Do these point to a closer personal relationship between the persons?", "Questions and information such as the latter indicate the danger of the evaluations. Only publicly freely available data was used. The explosiveness is only created by the aggregation and linking of many data together with the appropriate visualization. The human being is then able to draw conclusions on this basis thanks to his great pattern recognition abilities.", "For example, a competitor can identify the subject areas of editors in order to recruit them. A supervisor can spy out private connections of employees, and much more.", "Your home for data science.
