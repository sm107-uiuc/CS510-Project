I am one of the fans of inferential statistics.", "Inferential Statistics gave me a kick while learning it the first time through this coursera course. I wanted to write about it, but was wondering if it would be interesting to present it with a small dataset like temperature data. After doing a bit of research on what is available on it, I was convinced that what I am going to present here is going to interest people. Why? That is for you to decide after reading. Here\u2019s why I think it will interest you. Most studies start from the formula for a t-test / z-test, define the terms like margin of error, z-stat and how to calculate them. In this post, the formulas come in the end, and all confusions are handled head-on.", "It is easy to get confused while reading any statistics related article. I will highlight points of confusion wherever possible, based on where I got confused in my path (while learning the concepts first time).", "No prior knowledge of Inferential Statistics is assumed. However, you are expected to know what is mean, standard deviation, variance, conditional probability, distribution functions, normal distribution, and Central Limit Theorem (CLT). If you do not know CLT, please go through this short video by Khan Academy or read this article. If you have no idea about the other terms, please do not read this post right now. First study \u201cdescriptive statistics\u201d from one of the online courses (Coursera, datacamp, Udacity any of them depending on what appeals to you) and come back. It is vast topic, hence I have decided to make a series of posts. This post will have introduction to the terminology.", "Look at this picture. This is what you need to understand at a minimum, before you could conduct any sample tests and report your findings with confidence!!", "Population: Set of numbers whose precise distribution or summary statistics are unknown.

You name it!", "Sample: A small set from a population. Here the confusion starts. Is \u2018sample\u2019 one number? No. It is a set of numbers.", "For example, 100 measurements of human heart rate. This is \u201ca sample\u201d of population of heart rates of humans. It is not \u201csamples\u201d of population. If you have 3 different sets of 100 measurements, then it is 3 \u201csamples\u201d of population. Process of getting a sample is called sampling. The number 100 here is sample size, and is typically represented by n. Often when there are 1000 samples of size 100 are taken, there is a tendency to confuse 1000 to be n.", "A sample need not be always sampled from a population. It can also be sampled from another sample!", "i) Without replacement: Each member from the population or original sample (from which sampling is done) can appear only once in the sample taken.", "ii) With replacement: Each member from the population or original sample (from which sampling is done) can appear as many number of times as sample size. Sampling with replacement seems a little weird in the beginning.", "Sample Distribution: Distribution of samples. This is typically plotted with histogram command (matplotlib.pyplot.hist or seaborn.distplot for Python users). Sample is a subset of population, hence the shape of the distribution is similar to the population distribution when sampling is done without replacement. However, we should always be aware that it is only an approximation, as it is a sampled version of population.

Sample spread is an approximation to the population spread. Read the next sentence carefully: Many times, the formulas for estimating from population center (example: mean) from sample center will need the value of the population spread (say standard deviation), and obviously that won\u2019t be measurable (population parameters are not measurable), hence in formulas, we use sample spread.", "There is another term called Sampling Distribution and also Bootstrap Distribution.

Note that measuring the True population mean is never possible. It is normal often to (conf)use \u201cestimating\u201d the sample mean. This is wrong. Sample is available and hence its mean is measured, not estimated. Standard deviation of such Sampling distribution is \u201ctheoretical population standard deviation\u201d by square root of n. This is called Standard Error in mean, or SEM.", "Now, how do we use CLT to estimate population mean from N number of sample means? n is size of each sample, N is number of such samples. Usefulness of CLT comes from the fact that one can improve the chances of getting better estimates by increasing sample size n, i.e. lower error in estimate. Higher the N, smoother is the normal curve, and pleasing visuallty, but it does not affect the theoretical accuracy in estimate. It is often easy to confuse n and N. Please try out this free tool to understand CLT by playing around with different types of population distributions and different values of n and N.", "I consider it important to touch upon bootstrap too, because the CLT based estimation of population parameters is not generic enough.", "Bootstrapping: Bootstrapping technique is useful when it is not possible to apply CLT, because either assumptions are not valid, or we are interested in statistic other than mean. If only one sample of size n available, we create more samples by taking replicas of this sample. To do this, sample it again of the same size (i.e. n) with replacement. Note that if bootstrap sampling is done without replacement, we get original sample itself which is of no use. This enables us to estimate any statistic of the population, unlike the CLT based estimation, which is just for the mean.", "Bootstrap Distribution: Suppose we take N such samples, they are called Bootstrap samples. Measure the statistic of interest on each such sample and this measurement is called \u201cBootstrap replicate\u201d . Distribution of these replicates is called Bootstrap distribution.

Shown visually,", "Upper-bound for A 1 (because it is probability). [xbar-b, xbar+b] is the confidence interval for the estimate of population mean corresponding to a confidence level of A*100%. One way to interpret is, if 100 times random samples are drawn from the population and their mean is measured, then A*100 times it the mean is expected to lie in the interval [xbar-b,xbar+b].", "Confidence interval is longer (wider), for bigger A\u2019s and shorter for smaller A\u2019s. Confusing point: Confidence Level Vs. Confidence interval. Confidence interval is length and a portion of your x axis. Confidence level is area and it is portion of area under the curve; there is a 1\u20131 relationship between the two in this context.", "z-stat: z-stat is more often seen as a formula rather than intuitively. z-stat is just a fancy name for a real number used to count standard deviations corresponding to confidence level chosen. In other words, to get A*100% area under the curve, how many standard deviations around the mean should be taken on both sides? that is your z-stat. One can often confuse a z-score with z-stat. z-score is for any single data point (of the sample), z-stat is for sample statistic.", "Dark blue is one standard deviation on either side of the mean. For the normal distribution, this accounts for 68.27 percent of the set (z-stat = 1 for A = 0.6827); while two standard deviations from the mean (medium and dark blue) account for 95.45 percent; three standard deviations (light, medium, and dark blue) account for 99.73 percent; and four standard deviations account for 99.994 (z-stat=4 for A = 0.99994) percent. z-stat and confidence level / interval have 1\u20131 relationship. Stating one of them is sufficient to find out the rest.", "One might wonder where is our familiar formula for z-stat. Is this what you are thinking about?", "If you have a sample with mean xbar and sample std s,", "Think of it as, having a normal distribution being centered around true population mean and one trying to find out in which region among the various blue shades, a randomly taken sample mean xbar lies.", "Margin of Error: After all the estimation is done using CLT, how to state the results? You know that there is a standard error in estimation of mean we defined above. Hopefully you understood its meaning. Now, how does it translate to the error in true population mean? Margin of error is corresponding to some standard deviations or confidence level. Standard deviation is sqrt(n)*SEM. You can state the result as, \u201cMy estimate of population mean = xbar +- z-stat * sample std\u201d (recall that sample std is just a substitute for population std)", "Confusion might happen here: Margin of error in population mean estimation corresponding to A*100% confidence is b? No. Often this is the error I have observed in many Python notebooks measuring normal range of a population parameter, based on its estimate. In fact xbar+ b or xbar -b is the point on the x axis of the plot of sampling distribution, not on the population distribution. The Margin of error in population mean corresponding to A*100% will be actually xbar +- z-stat* sqrt(n)*b. Why? Recall central limit theorem and the standard deviation of the resulting distribution. It is population\u2019s standard deviation / sqrt (n). Intuitively, the confidence interval for true population mean is wider because its standard deviation is sqrt(n) times higher. (Sorry for repetitions, I think in statistics studies repetitions and rephrasing help in reinforcement of concepts)", "Essentially, this entire process of sampling and measuring the sample mean helps in estimating the population mean. Higher the sample size, lesser the standard error in mean and higher A (higher confidence) for the same b (for same width).", "Take the example of Multiple Linear Regression. One is trying to fit a n-dimensional line y = f(x), where f(x) = a0 + a1*x1 +a2*x2 + \u2026.an*xn; y is target variable and x1 to xn are features, a0 is intercept, a1 to an are coefficients. Each feature vector is called a sample in machine learning, and this sample is analogous to the sample discussed in the above paragraphs. Here, the f(x) is actually an estimate of the true function that relates feature vector x\u2019s to y. f(x) is estimated using an array of features, called training data. Such a linear fit f(x) is tested using another set of samples called test data. Population is the entire set from which training samples, test samples are drawn, and population has lot many samples that we have never seen before (this is why no amount of testing can guarantee performance of an ML algorithm). a0 to an are analogous to xbar. Like xbar is computed as mean of several sample means, a0 to an are calculated from several samples of the population. The books explaining Machine Learning algorithm fundamentals talk about confidence intervals for coefficient estimate too. Now, you might be able to relate to them better.", "Edit: 1. Central Limit theorem is key in understanding why overfitting (variance) reduces when multiple trees are constructed to make an ensemble as in Bagging Classifier, Random Forest or many more.", "2. \u201cB\u201dootstrapping and \u201cAgg\u201dregating is what makes it \u201cBagg\u201ding.
