I personally enjoy the analytics more than the visualization of data, however, if the data I am analyzing is not understood by the end user, then what\u2019s the point?", "Data visualization is an interesting part of data professions because it is one of the only, if not the only part of the profession that can be left up to interpretation, rather than pure fact. Sure, your bar graph that compares sales is correct, but maybe it would\u2019ve made more sense to the end user if it was in a circle graph? Data visualization is a part of the profession that I continue to get some extra practice on, however, with all the mistakes and practice I\u2019ve had, I\u2019d like to offer some of it to my readers and fellow data professionals/students. Let\u2019s get into it!", "Disclaimer: I am not a full time data professional, I am simply relaying my experiences from my summer internships and personal practice. This is not meant to tell you what exactly you need to know, rather, this is to give you some practical advice from experiences I\u2019ve had. For advanced technical information, please check out Towards Data Science. If you are interested in some advice to help you with data visualization, keep reading!", "The best piece of advice I\u2019ve received about data visualization is to \u201cCreate with the end user in mind\u201d. Just as any creative knows their audience when creating a piece of art, so do data professionals when creating visualizations. In a sense, visualization is the artwork of data. We spend lots of time building models, doing statistical analysis, and cleaning data. Not many people understand that part of the profession, but everyone understands a good graph when they see one. With that in mind, let\u2019s look at a couple audiences:", "Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operations Officer, Chief Financial Officer, etc.", "You will probably work with this group the least amount unless you are in mid-level data management or are a senior analyst. This group tends to be older, incredibly experienced, and not as technically adept as analysts, simply because that isn\u2019t their job. The executive management are the one\u2019s running the company, and they need quick and clean overviews. They may want to dive into numbers every now and then, but most of the time, they just need the high-level view to make decisions quickly. Power BI would be a good tool for these reports, as it allows for quick creation of reports rather than complex dashboards.", "Vice President of Marketing, Vice President of Sales, Director of IT, etc.", "You will probably work with this group a little more than the executive management. This group tends to be middle-older age, experienced, and have above average technical skills. They like to dive into the numbers a little more, but for the most part, still like to keep a high-level view. Tableau would be a good tool for this group, as these managers like to dig into the numbers at their own will.", "Marketing Automation Manager, Sales Development Manager, etc.", "This is one of the most frequent groups you will work with. This group is younger, less experienced, but more technically adept. Growing up in the beginning of the information age, they are more interested in digging into the numbers than other groups. Tableau would be really good for more technical positions, while Power BI would be good for less technical positions.", "BI Developer, Web Analyst, Customer Development Representative, etc.", "This is another group you\u2019ll work with a significant amount of time. Many concentrated positions will ask for you to pull metrics for them. This group is very young with very little experience, but high technical aptitude. Any reporting or visualization tool works because they will probably be able to understand it!", "Now rather than just telling you about the different end user groups, I\u2019d like to actually show some examples of how I create reports for these different groups using the same data. Typically, you\u2019ll start by getting an email from someone asking, \u201cHey _____, what can we learn from this data and how have we been performing?\u201d. That\u2019s about all the guidance you\u2019ll get, so here are three examples with my thought process while creating them. For these visualizations, I used a video game sales data set by Gregory Smith on Kaggle, a website that provides free data sets. For these scenarios, you are the lead data analyst at a video game company towards the end of the fiscal year. Many stakeholders are curious on how they did, and what they can do to improve. Let\u2019s get through these reports!", "\u201cHypothetically, our company owns every game that exists in this data set, nice business model!\u201d", "For this report, the CEO of our video game company emails us, \u201cHello ____, I need to know how we\u2019ve been performing, thanks\u201d. The first thing we need to think about when creating a report for executives is, \u201cHow can we present important information as concise and high-level as possible? What do they need to know?\u201d. Our CEO want\u2019s to know how we\u2019ve been performing, so let\u2019s tackle that first. Since this is a global company, they\u2019ll probably want to know total sales, as well as sales between the three regions. One of the best ways to visualize time series is a line graph, so let\u2019s make a line graph with the past 20 years of global sales, as well as all three region\u2019s worth of sales. The CEO probably also wants some insight that can help them make a large strategy decision. Since genre is an important metric to track, lets track it\u2019s performance and throw it on the report. Finally, they\u2019ll probably need to know how each region is doing independently so that they can dish out performance-based incentives as needed. Let\u2019s include the total sales for each region in a pie chart. Done! So what does this report provide? You might notice that this is all long-term, large information. Based on this report, we would recommend to the CEO that they should focus on creating some action games with a marketing push in North America. Marketing should also follow what they did in 2008, since that was the highest point of sales. In a real data set, there would be more information to make decisions on than just a small amount of variables, but for our purposes, this works! Onto the next report!", "Next, the Vice President of Global Marketing in North America emails us. \u201cHey ____, I\u2019m putting together a request for our R&D team to decide what we want our next games to be. Mind pulling some data and sending it to me?\u201d. Let\u2019s get to work! So we know since this is the Vice President of Global Marketing, they probably want to know how metrics are performing globally, as well as only metrics that pertain to products or sale of products. Let\u2019s start by putting together how North America is selling each genre compared to global sales, since their first priority is North America. While on the topic of genre, let\u2019s also visualize how different genre\u2019s are performing in each region, to get a feel of the landscape for global marketing strategy. Platform is another important variable since partnerships are expensive, so lets look at how each platform is selling in America. Finally, let\u2019s also look at the top 10 highest selling games to see what is, and has been hot. Done! These are good metrics because they represent both North American, and global performance. Our recommendations should be to look at making some action games for Xbox and PlayStation with our newest technologies. Additionally, we don\u2019t perform very well with role-playing games, but Japan does an outstanding job with them. We should recommend our VP to call Japan\u2019s VP of Marketing and get some ideas from him on how they marketing and develop their role-playing games. That should be good, let\u2019s get to our final report!", "Towards the middle of the day, the lead project manager for Call of Duty in Europe sends us an email. \u201cHello ______, I was wondering if we can pull some metrics for sales, thanks\u201d. Obviously, this email is a little vague, so we\u2019ll need to use our data and intuition to make a good report. First, let\u2019s look at how Call of Duty is performing in Europe compared to the rest of the globe. Next, let\u2019s look at total Call of Duty sales by each region. Finally, let\u2019s look at how each Call of Duty game has performed. Notice that we only included metrics about Call of Duty, because the Call of Duty Project Manager doesn\u2019t need to waste his time and memory with other metrics. Let\u2019s just give him Call of Duty metrics since that\u2019s his specialty. We should recommend that the project manager for Europe contacts the other two project managers in their respective regions and figure out what happened in 2015 to cause such a sharp decrease in sales. We should also recommend that they contact the \u201cCall of Duty: Black Ops\u201d developers and create another installment, as that series performed very well, with three of the five top Call of Duty games were a part of the \u201cBlack Ops\u201d series.", "Whew! That was a lot of visualization! Hopefully this gave you a glimpse into the planning and thought processes it takes to create reports. It\u2019s not just as simple as putting graphs on paper, but rather, creating something that is unique to each end user. Always think about the end user while creating visualizations, they\u2019ll notice, and so will you. Feel free to keep coming back to this story for reference!
