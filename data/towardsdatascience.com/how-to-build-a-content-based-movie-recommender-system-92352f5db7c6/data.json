I\u2019ll also share an example that I\u2019ve done with Python and tell you how it works step by step.", "I am not going to explain the types of recommender systems separately, since it is quite easy to find on the internet. So, let\u2019s start talking about the content-based recommender system!", "Content-based recommender systems do not include datas retrieved from the users other than you. It simply helps you by identifying products that are similar to the product you like.", "For example, you have a website that sells stuff online and you don\u2019t have a registered user yet, but you still want to recommend products to the visitors of the website. In this case, the content-based recommender system would be an ideal option for you.", "However, content-based recommendation systems are limited because they do not contain other user data. And it doesn\u2019t help a user discover their potential tastes.", "For example, let\u2019s say that user A and user B like drama movies. User A also likes comedy movies, but since you don\u2019t have that knowledge, you keep offering drama movies. Eventually, you\u2019re eliminating other options that user B potentially might like.", "Anyway! Let\u2019s talk about a few terms we\u2019re going to use before we create this system. Let\u2019s start with Kernel Density Estimation!", "Kernel density estimation is a really useful statistical tool with an intimidating name. Often shortened to KDE, it\u2019s a technique that let\u2019s you create a smooth curve given a set of data.", "KDE is a method to help determine the density of data distribution. It provides information about where many points are located and where they are not. So in one-dimensional arrays, it helps you clustering by separating the lowest density points (local minima) with the highest density points (local maxima). Just follow these steps,", "Cosine similarity is a method for measuring similarity between vectors. Mathematically, it calculates the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. If the angle between the two vectors is zero, the similarity is calculated as 1 because the cosine of zero is 1. So the two vectors are identical. The cosine of any angle varies from 0 to 1. Therefore, similarity rates will vary from 0 to 1. The formula is expressed as follows:", "That\u2019s enough for now! Let\u2019s code it!", "I want to set a score for each movie or series, and I need a coefficient for each feature, so I\u2019m going to look at feature importances.", "You can easily obtain this data set by merging files shared at https://datasets.imdbws.com. I obtained this data by merging title.basics.tsv.gz with title.ratings.tsv.gz and after, I deleted some features. For example, the end_year field contained too much null value, so I removed it. For more detailed information, please see my repository. It is shared at the end of this article.", "I have to say one more detail, I\u2019ve converted the kind field into an integer field by using label encoder.", "As you can see above, I\u2019ve tried three different methods. The first is the importance of the feature provided directly by the Random Forests model.", "Another is Permutation Importances. This approach directly measures the effect of the field on the model using the random re-shuffling technique for each predictor. It maintains the distribution of the variable because it uses a random re-shuffling technique.", "The last is Drop Column Feature Importances. This method is completely intuitive and each time it wipes one feature and compares it to the model in which all columns are used. It is usually much safer, but it can have a long processing time. Processing time is not so important for our data set.", "We choose the Drop Column Feature Importances method among these methods. As we indicated before, it is much more reliable and, when we take a glance at the results, they make much more sense to calculate scores.", "I\u2019m going to use the scores to create the clusters. So I can recommend movies with the same score on average.", "I have a 1-dimensional array of scores, and I can use KDE to cluster. I used this code to see the distribution of scores:", "And I got a graph like this,", "I added a vertical line for 18,000, because the density is between 650 and 18,000. If I give you points greater than 18,000 when applying KDE, it collects all points less than 18,000 in one cluster, and that\u2019s not what we want, because it\u2019s going to reduce diversity.", "I applied 3 stages to do clustering with KDE as I mentioned at the beginning of my article.", "2. Find local minima and local maxima values", "Finally, I calculated the similarities between the genres in order to be able to recommend the same type of film as accurate as possible. I used TF-IDF and Linear Kernel for this. Consequently, cosine similarity was used in the background to find similarities.", "That seemed pretty useful to me! If you want to see the codes in more detail, serve with flask, index movies with elasticsearch and use docker, you can look at my repository:", "Your home for data science.
