(Ah, those lovely stereotypes\u2026)", "Well, guess what? As it turns out, it also works the other way around: the music you listen to actually reflects who you already are. Taking it a step further, the media that we consume could be a reflection of who we are as a society, hence studying media consumption could unlock a wealth of knowledge about our identity as people, where we come from and (predictive modeling, anyone?) where we are going in the future.", "So, with this basic idea in our heads, let\u2019s play around with some data to find out how music consumption has evolved in the past decade, and how those trends may impact the music industry.", "The data I\u2019m using here was downloaded from Kaggle and scrapped directly from Spotify by someone other than me. It has been previously sanitized (also by someone else), so we shouldn\u2019t run into any major issues with things like null values or numerical mistakes.", "The entities in the dataset consist of the most popular songs (according to Billboard) from 2010 to 2019. The descriptive variables include data like the year the song was chosen by Billboard among the most popular, the artist, and several musical characteristics.", "About the musical characteristics: they are descriptions of what each song sounds like. Some are related to basic musical concepts like tempo and duration, which makes them easy to understand, however others are a bit more abstract and honestly kinda confusing. As a data analyst, one of the first things you want to do is make sure you understand the variables, because your entire analysis depends on what interpretation you give to your raw data.", "So, for the sake of clarity, let\u2019s lay out the meaning of the descriptive variables we will focus on here:", "BPM: short for Beats Per Minute. It\u2019s the tempo or \u201cspeed\u201d of the song.Energy: the name explains itself.Danceability: the higher the value, the easier it is to dance to the song.dB: how loud the song is. In digital productions, these values are negative.Valence: a measure of how \u201cpositive\u201d or happy the song is.Duration: duration in seconds.Acousticness: measures whether the song uses acoustic instruments.Year: the year when each song was chosen by Billboard as one of the most popular. Keep in mind that a song can be chosen in multiple years (though this is rare).Popularity: the name explains itself, although it is unclear how the measure is obtained (I\u2019ll try to stay away from variables that aren\u2019t completely clear).", "Keep in mind that this is a data-analytical exploration to find inspiration and interesting ideas. Basically, this is me playing around with a bunch of data, turning it upside down, filtering it, plotting it, trying out different angles to see what I find and figuring out if those findings are worth further analysis. Remember, as analysts we are only looking at a specific set of data and any patterns we find must be confined to that specific dataset. If, however, any finding seems REALLY interesting and useful for the business, we may send it over to our friends the statisticians for some good ol\u2019 statistical inference.", "In other words, this is me doing what data analysts do all day long (which is why I believe data analysts have the coolest job in data science).", "On the other hand, whenever you \u201cplay around with data\u201d it\u2019s important to have a clearly established context, to make sure you know why you\u2019re playing and what exactly you will consider useful findings. When an analyst does his thing, he almost never does it just for fun (as fun as it may be), but because he\u2019s trying to help somebody do something. So what I\u2019m saying is, make sure your data explorations make sense and help your organization get to where it wants to go.", "OK, enough blah-blah-blah, let\u2019s get down to business.", "The first thing I want to know is how many songs in the dataset were chosen by Billboard each year. Let\u2019s take a look:", "Interesting to note that there\u2019s a different number of songs for every year. I would\u2019ve been nice to have an even number of songs throughout, but hey, part of an analyst\u2019s job is to play with the data he\u2019s got and make the best of it. Also, for some reason, the data has very few songs in 2019, which I\u2019ll keep in mind, since it might have an influence on some of the results.", "I also want to know how many songs and descriptive variables there are in total:", "Like I said at the beginning, the data has been previously cleaned, so no issues should pop up there, but let\u2019s just make sure that there aren\u2019t any null values:", "Before I do any analysis, I want to look at the distribution of the musical attributes. This might allow (in a very general way) to identify if the values look reasonable (aka, free of errors). I\u2019ll start with BPM:", "AHA! Right there I can see there is a value that\u2019s probably wrong. Can you see it? There appears to be a song released in 2016 with a tempo of 0 or close to 0. That of course cannot be, because no song is that slow. It\u2019s important to spot these situations, because erratic values can throw off our analysis. So let\u2019s find out which one it is:", "I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve never heard an Adele song with a tempo of 0. Furthermore, almost all of the other values are also 0, so this is clearly a mistake. Seems like the data cleaning performed on this dataset skipped this one song. I\u2019ll go ahead and delete it because it will not greatly impact the data.", "Let\u2019s check the distribution again to make sure the problem\u2019s fixed:", "Now, the distribution of duration shows a very short song in 2015 but that isn\u2019t necessarily an error:", "In fact it\u2019s Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cMark My Words\u201d, which indeed is only 134 seconds long (you can check it out on Spotify. It\u2019s a pretty good song).", "The rest of the variables seem reasonable, so no problem there:", "To close up this part, I want to point out that these musical characteristics are identified automatically by Spotify. Although the detection process is very good, it isn\u2019t perfect, and this dataset provides a good example. Check out the tempo of the song FourFiveSeconds:", "Spotify identifies the tempo at 206, but if you\u2019ve ever heard the song, your musical ear tells you there\u2019s something wrong there. Actually, the song\u2019s tempo is 103 (half what Spotify identified). The reason is that Spotify simply doubled the count and instead of counting quarter notes, it counted eighth notes. This is a subtle mistake, but the point I\u2019m trying to drive home is that you should always check your raw data before analyzing it, and use your domain expertise to make sure it is appropriate and won\u2019t give you bogus results.", "OK, this is where the fun part starts, and why I love the job of the data analyst. Basically, what we do is play with the data to start asking questions and finding answers. Some of these questions and answers might be useful, some might not; only the process itself will tell us which are which.", "Also keep in mind that some of the questions may already have been asked by your organization\u2019s decision makers, in which case you can go ahead and try to answer them. Finally, remember that part of the analyst\u2019s job is to help the decision maker to correctly frame the questions and state them clearly in analytical terms. This is where your domain knowledge starts to kick in and you become an analysis Rockstar.", "Question 1: Who were the most popular artists of the decade?", "To answer this question, I\u2019ll begin by looking at the artists with more appearances (or hits) in the dataset, aka the most popular artists in the entire decade. The focus will be on those who appear more than ten times, to keep the visualization manageable.", "No surprise here. Katy Perry, Justin Bieber and Rihanna dominate the list of the most popular artists of the decade, according to this dataset. Now, this is a very general indicator because the music industry changes A LOT throughout a decade, so let\u2019s zoom in to see the graphs by year. Again, to keep things manageable I\u2019ll focus on those artists with more than 2 songs in the specific year.", "Now we have a a clearer view of how the balance of power moved in the music industry during the decade. The first years show artists like Black Eyed Peas, Christina Aguilera and Lady Gaga, while the middle years mark the ascension of One Direction, Katy Perry and Bruno Mars. The decade closes with a strong push by Ed Sheeran, as well as The Chainsmokers and Shawn Mendes.", "Interesting to note that most top artists hang around 4 songs per year, with only a few exceptions like Ed Sheeran in 2019 and (most notably) Justin Bieber with a mind-boggling 9 hits in 2015 (this is slightly attenuated by the fact that 2015 is the year with more songs in the dataset).", "Question 2: How is the \u201cshare of popularity\u201d distributed each year?", "A common opinion about the music industry is that it tends to be monopolized by a relatively small amount of very famous artists. Indeed, it is really hard to become massively known in this industry, since it involves numerous aspects like good music production, good interpretation, image creation, investment in promotion, having an extensive network within the various music circuits, managing tours, and many more. This idea links straight back to what Michael Porter calls the \u201cbarriers of entry\u201d: basically, it means that it is extremely hard for new competitors (artists) to enter into the music industry and gain some traction.", "Thinking about this made me curious to see how popularity was distributed throughout the last ten years. A first glimpse at the answer is to look at the amount of songs per artist per year, since it could be an indication of the distribution of popularity among the artists present in Billboard\u2019s list.", "Here we can see that the first couple of years of the decade had a high number of songs per artist (high concentration of popularity), followed by 3 years of lower concentration, after which the number increases moderately to close the decade.", "Another, possibly more interesting way of looking at this question is to analyze the actual popularity distribution across the artists in Billboard\u2019s list. I\u2019ll consider the sum of all songs as the total popularity available that year (aka 100% of the popularity), and ask how much of that pie is eaten by each artist, each year. In other words, what percentage of the totality of songs belongs to each artist? This is what I call share of popularity.", "Now, to make this visualization simpler, I decided to calculate the sum of share of popularity among the top 5 artists of each year. This should give us a pretty accurate picture of how much popularity was accumulated by the really huge and famous artists, and how much of the popularity pie was left for everyone else. Let\u2019s take a look:", "Similar to the previous graph, here I notice that the decade started with several years of great accumulation of popularity by the big artists (they \u201cmonopolized\u201d close to 40% of the total songs). Then, in 2013 it goes way down, which is indicative of a more equally distributed popularity share among the artists in the list. Furthermore, this coincides with an important drop in the average number of songs per artist (previous image). Finally, in 2019 the indicator goes up again, possibly because of the \u201cmonopolizing\u201d effect of one Ed Sheeran. Keep in mind that the dataset has very few songs for 2019, and this puts an asterisk on that year.", "So, to close this question I might summarize by saying that the share of popularity was monopolized by the big artists during the first couple of years (close to 40% of popularity for the top 5 artists each year), after which popularity was better distributed among the artists in the list.", "Question 3: How long do artists sustain their popularity? What is an artist\u2019s popularity lifespan?", "Considering that the music industry is after all a business, participants (mainly production labels) are always looking for ways to more effectively monetize their musical products. In this sense, one of the most frequent questions is how long can an artist stay relevant. Otherwise put, once we\u2019ve invested in an artist\u2019s career and he/she has reached a certain level of popularity, how long can it be sustained and how much financial advantage can we obtain?", "To answer these questions, I looked at the amount of years in which an artist has at least one song in Billboard\u2019s list. So, for example, if an artist has at least a song in each of the ten years in the dataset, it means that he/she remained highly popular throughout the decade (this practically never happens).", "Since there are many artists in the dataset, I calculated the median amount of years with at least a song on the list, for all artists:", "So, as a record company, you might expect that once one of your artists cracks into Billboard\u2019s popularity lists, he may be there again for one more year in the same decade.", "But as a music producer, I know that artists vary greatly in their level of popularity and ability to stay current. So I divided them into three categories: top, medium and small artists. All artist with more than 10 hits throughout the decade are called \u201ctop artists\u201d, those with 3 to 10 are \u201cmedium artists\u201d and those with less than 3 are \u201csmall artists\u201d.", "And now I calculate the median lifespan (in years) for each category:", "Ok so now we can understand better how artistic lifespan works in this dataset. Top artists can be expected to remain popular for 6 years, while medium artists only do so for 3, and small artists only for 1. Let\u2019s visualize this:", "To close this out, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the popularity of an artist is mainly a function of how much money, time and energy is invested into his/her career. So, for example the top artists are those for whom millions of dollars were spent throughout the decade in terms of publicity, image, etc. This means that production and promotion companies need to figure out ways to optimize their Return On Investment which requires that they put everything in a balance and make a decision on how much they think an artist will bring back for them. Usually the \u201cInverted U\u201d principle holds: the more you invest in an artist, the more return you\u2019ll get, but only up to a certain point, after which the relationship inverts and companies start losing money.", "Question 4: How did the main musical attributes evolve through the last decade?", "Music taste changes very quickly. It seems like a completely new genre emerges every year, with a whole set of musical characteristics and its very own representative artists. This raises a bunch of questions in my mind. How has music changed in the last decade? Is music faster? Is it more energetic, more danceable, or happier? How has the evolution of society and the music industry changed our musical tastes?", "Well, let\u2019s see if the data has something to say about that. I am going to plot some simple KDE\u2019s for 4 key musical attributes: BPM, Energy, Valence and Danceability. The goal here is to visually identify how these attributes have \u201cmoved\u201d through the years, so I\u2019ll plot one KDE for every year, starting in 2010 and ending in 2019. In order to see it more easily, I\u2019ll also plot a vertical line that indicates the median for each indicator, for each year.", "This is very interesting. Tempo has gone consistently down, from a median of 125 BPM in 2010 to around 107 in 2019. Any musician can tell you that a 22 BPM change makes all the difference in the world in terms of how a song is perceived, how it sounds and the message it communicates. Energy and Valence have a similar behavior, which makes us wonder if music is less \u201cenergetic\u201d and \u201chappy\u201d now than it was a decade ago. This change possibly has to do with the popularity decrease of \u201chouse-ish\u201d music, and the increase of rhythms closer to trap, as well as the return of RnB.", "In spite of the decrease in those metrics, we see that danceability remains pretty constant throughout. Perhaps this means that we are now used to dancing to slower rhythms.", "Finally, to clarify the findings in this point, I\u2019ll plot the evolution of each musical attribute:", "Like I said in the beginning, a data analysis is only useful when it helps someone do something. So, how can these findings be useful for music industry participants?", "As any data exploration, this one has limitations. For starters, we have no geographical data, which means that we can\u2019t know if these tendencies behave differently on different parts of the world, or even for different segments of listeners.", "On the other hand, there is some selection bias present. After all, every song that is part of the dataset has been included in Billboard\u2019s list of more popular songs, and that means that it is already a worldwide hit. That\u2019s why terms like \u201csmall artists\u201d need to be attenuated and contextualized, as well as the conclusions we obtained.", "Speaking of conclusions obtained, I close up this data exploration by saying that all the observations made are restricted to this dataset. They are not to be taken as representative of the entire music industry. Always keep this in mind before you jump to conclusions.", "So, does music transform you into something, or is it only a reflection of who you already are? I think it\u2019s a little bit of both. After all, looking back I have to say I did end up (for some time at least) looking like those Rhapsody dudes. Wait, does that mean I look like Mac Miller now? Probably not\u2026", "Your home for data science.
