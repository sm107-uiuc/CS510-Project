For example, in their 2015 working paper, Gimpelson and Triesman show that individuals\u2019 beliefs about the income distribution in their countries reveal \u201c[w]idespread ignorance and misperceptions\u2026 regardless of data source, operationalization, and measurement method.\u201d They summarize this misperception thusly:", "[T]he rich often think they are poorer \u2014 and the poor think they are richer \u2014 than they actually are.
