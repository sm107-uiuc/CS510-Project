But if and when it does happen, then the picture is a really bleak one for Pakistan.", "Pakistan has one of the youngest population in the world which should probably result in a much lower death rate (as % of confirmed + opened cases)", "We don\u2019t have very accurate death rates for coronavirus yet because the pandemic is still ongoing and there are many unresolved infection cases. It also really depends on the region and country, between 0.6% in South Korea and 4.4% in Iran which one should we use?\u00b9", "For this case study, world\u2019s average fatality rate across different age groups should suffice.", "As an example, let\u2019s compare the population age groups of Pakistan\u00b2 and Italy\u2074 along with worldwide coronavirus fatality rates.", "Figure 8 shows a relatively positive picture for Pakistan. Pakistan\u2019s population (teal coloured bars) is much younger than Italy\u2019s Population (orange-red coloured bars) and estimates suggest a much higher fatality rate among older populations\u00b9. Fatality rates (red coloured bars) for the age group can be seen as white text in the middle of y axis.", "Coronavirus fatality rate in Pakistan is estimated to be relatively lower than the rest of world (if patients are treated properly).", "For instance, fatality rate in Pakistan should be at least 4 times lesser than that of Italy, in theory.", "Based on the demographics of Pakistan and fatality rates of coronavirus across age groups, let\u2019s estimate the no. of fatalities from the estimated no. of infections presented in Figure 8.", "Even with a much smaller fatality rate, we are looking at very high no. of deaths because of the much higher no. of infections. Hence it\u2019s of utmost importance to limit the number of infections as much as possible in major cities of Pakistan.", "With one of the lowest Public Health Expenditure as % of GDP in the world, Pakistan has only 0.6 beds per 1000 people\u2075. For comparison, Germany has 8.5 beds per 1000 people.", "The situation is especially bad in major cities, like Karachi, where the population is a staggering 14.91 million. How long the spread of infection can go before the city\u2019s health infrastructure falls into chaos? Let me show you again through some charts.", "Here is the chart showing available hospital beds across Pakistan.", "For a city with a population of 14.91 million (i.e Karachi) and an estimated 500k+ infections in just over 14 days, even all of the 130k+ hospital beds in Pakistan cannot handle such a big number of patients.", "Of course, not all the patients with virus need to be hospitalised, so we should take that into account for our estimations.", "The chart on the left by American Hospital Association\u2076 shows the estimated percentage of severe and critical patients having coronavirus who need to be hospitalised.", "For simplicity\u2019s sake, we will treat severe and critical cases as same, as that should be enough to prove the point.", "Using the estimated number of infections for Karachi from Figure 8 and the estimate that 18.5% of patients need to be hospitalised out of all the patients, we can come up with the following chart:", "Even if all of Province\u2019s hospital beds are already free, estimated no. of patients from Karachi who need to be hospitalised would exhaust the whole Province\u2019s capacity in just under 12 days.", "It is no brainer that if the situation depicted in this section for the major cities start happening in Pakistan, it\u2019s only a matter of a couple of weeks before the healthcare system of Pakistan crumbles into chaos, thus, resulting in even further spread.", "Also, the estimations were done based on Germany\u2019s circumstances, which is not even the worst hit among all the countries by coronavirus. Estimations based on Italy\u2019s circumstances are going to be even worse, where the virus has spread much quicker than in Germany.", "Yes, although difficult, it is in fact avoidable and possible to contain as already demonstrated in China.", "Latest figures show 189 confirmed cases in Pakistan. With a possibly underreported number of cases because of lack of health facilities as well as lack of no. of doctors, ground reality might be already worse than being reported and only become visible if and when a large number of fatalities start happening, but by that stage, it will probably be too late.", "In any case, it\u2019s not too late for Pakistan yet. If enough measures on government level are taken and people take their individual and social responsibilities seriously, then it is very possible to contain it", "If not, then just wait for it to hit you really hard.", "It\u2019s not the main purpose of the article to list all of the precautionary measures and steps people can take, but here is a short list with most important ones:", "Most of the studies say no\u2078.", "Some new studies say yes but only for a short amount of time.
