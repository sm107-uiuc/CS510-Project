Its goal is to receive feedbacks from peer researchers that analyze your work according to their own experience, and judge it according to some criteria such as novelty, technical correctness and even readability.", "In the fields related to \u201cAI\u201d (e.g. computer vision, natural language processing, speech processing and so on\u2026) this step is often delayed or completely skipped because of tools like arxiv.org. Ariv is a preprint server, its goal is supposed to be early dissemination and debate of new work, but many papers put there become very popular before any peer review. And sometimes no peer review happens at all. Many of such papers are indeed very valuable pieces of work, but in some cases some ideas are spread without receiving a \u201cgreen light\u201d from the community, and for good reasons.", "Is this bad? Is this good? For sure, arxiv prevents some gatekeeping mechanisms that can block young researcher\u2019s career. On the other side, our worldis flooded with papers, and for new researchers (or data scientists / engineers who need to read them) it may be very tough to discriminate good and bad work. With so many papers around we need a way to narrow down our focus.", "With this post I want to share the lessons for paper writing/reading that I learned from peer reviewing , and when I say reading I mean reviewing. It is a good exercise to approach the reading of all papers you face, also the most popular, as a review. They do not present established knowledge and it usually takes some years before the community replicates and reproduces extensively the experiments to absorb the new knowledge. So, let skepticism and criticism anticipate your enthusiasm. Reading will take longer but you will learn more in the process.", "In the following section, I describe the different aspects of a paper to analyze, which incidentally are the ones you are required to evaluate in a conference peer review. These suggestions are the product of four years of writing and reading, getting papers rejected and improving them according to the reviewer\u2019s suggestions. I know that four years are nothing when compared to the decade-long experience of many professors. However, these are lessons learned the hard way and I thought that I can make someone\u2019s life easier by writing them down. The discussed points are valid for both writing and reading, but writing is obviously more difficult and, as such, I want to add something about it before starting.", "First of all, the more you master English and scientific writing, the better it is. Good research is necessary for having a paper accepted but it is not sufficient. Your readers should be able to understand what you have done and its value. Read about scientific writing and try to improve continuosuly. Never stop learning, never think that your writing skills are good enough.There are native speakers out there writing in the same area as you, and there researchers trained as linguists, who will always write better than you. Fortunately, it is a continuous work in progress, and if everything goes well, when you will read again your papers from one year back you will be embarassed by writing issues. To improve faster, do not limit yourself to writing papers at the end of a research work. Write drafts, proposal, even a blog (look at what I do, not at what I say ;) ) and, most important, receive feedbacks. You improve when your errors are pointed out and corrected.", "Second, keep your audience in mind. Your paper should follow the writing conventions of the conference/journal your are writing for and also the results should be of the correct type. For instance, a research about how technology helps translators will hardly be published in EMNLP, but it will fit perfectly a machine translation conference like the MT Summit. In the same fashion, a new cool interface for data collecting can be very useful for many tasks, but unless it proposes new deep learning models it will never get to NeurIPS. Or, machine learning conferences require much more math writing than other conferences.", "Third, always write with your reader in mind. Remind that your reader is not inside your head. Your reader does not know what you know, does not have your experience, does not know what you were thinking while writing, and definitely does not know your assumptions. Unless you write everything down. Then, writing a paper is not about self-celebration. Nobody reads you to know that you can smash all the competition and break the state-of-the-art results. A research paper is a way to communicate new knowledge, and your readers want exactly this. Always ask yourself why a reader (and a reviewer) should be interested in your work, why they should care at all, and how you can make it more interesting. In the corporate world, the most successful companies are the ones that can interpret better the needs of their customers and propose products accordingly. Writing requires the same mindset.", "Finally, scientific writing is not supposed to be aseptyc. Whenever you write, tell a story for your reader. If every section of your paper is self-contained and it is mostly a contour for your numbers, it may be useful as a reference but it will hardly excite your reader. A research paper needs to follow a progression similarly to a modern tale: a strong enemy threatens to derange our lifes (our problem); somebody really needs to fight him (motivation); a hero appears who can fight the enemy (proposed method); others have tried before him and failed (related woks); the fight takes place (experiments and results); but then, as we are scientists, the triumph is replaced by an analysis of the fight. Finally, strong of the lessons learned from the analysis, we ask our community to join our fight and promise to come back to it soon. When writing a good story, you create engagement and provide much more than information.", "Novelty is a tricky topic in science. Research obviously has to produce new knowledge, but this can mean different thigs for different people, and sometimes the communities have overvalued a type of knowledge at the expense of the others, mostly because of research trends or what was perceived \u201cdifficult\u201d at the time.", "The most evident example happened in NLP conferences (and other \u201cAI\u201d-related fields) when everybody started to use deep learning. It seemed that the only research worth to do was to propose new deep learning topologies for different tasks. Other important areas like building linguistic resources and evaluating system quality were relegated to minor conferences.", "I think that the problem emerged because many unexperienced reviewers (as I was) were more interested in what is possible to achieve with deep learning than actually understanding better a problem and how to solve it. This attitude led to the acceptance of many papers that we cannot remember anymore, probably becausethe \u201cnew\u201d methods did not do anything substantially different from previous, simpler models.", "Fortunately, now conferences are explictly encouraging their reviewers to have a broader view about the \u201cacceptable\u201d papers. Indeed,novelty can mean to make unexpected links between two different research areas, propose needed corpora, better evaluation or, even better, pave the way for a new task.", "Novelty is strongly related to what can be considered a research papers. A few years ago, showing that something can be done with deep learning, then with RNNs, CNNs, and so on, was a legitimate research question. Now it is not considered interesting anymore (given that you can find a task where all these things have not been applied).", "When you read a paper, connect it to previous work and try to understand how novel it is. Was this problem tackled before? Is this paper proposing a new way to look at the problem? Is the resource valuable and the construction method useful to reproduce?", "When writing, try to highlight the novelty of your paper in every possible way. If you do not do it, nobody else is going to do it. Highlighting the novelty can also suggest you the story to tell with it.", "Content quality is of absolute importance in a research paper, but to be able to convey the content, it must be written well. A good paper has a good structure that facilitates its reading. The abstract and introduction convey the message in a broad way and motivate the reader to keep reading. In the middle it must be clear where to find your hypothesis, experimental setup, experiments, the needed background and how it is positioned in the current literature. The conclusions wrap up the paper to highlight the findings and why the research contained in it is important.", "Abstract, introduction and conclusions must be written with particular care, because their goal is to convince the audience that the paper is worth reading.", "If you are writing a paper as a beginner, the best thing to do is to stick to the most common structure of papers similar to yours in the venue where you are publishing. With time and experience you will learn to change it to fit better your paper, but there is no need to run fast on this point. Use a clean structure and focus on your writing.", "Good English is the second, and more difficult, point about clarity. Grammar should be as perfect as possible, sentences clear and concise. Avoid statements that are general or ambiguous. Explain clearly the figures and the tables that you present and never assume anything. And again, remember:", "The reader is not inside your mind.", "If you want your paper to be clear for peer researchers, ask first somebody with a different background to read it and tell you what they find not clear. You can be surprised by the actual readability.", "When reading, enjoy a beautifully written paper, or just leave aside a poorly written one. If you cannot understand what it says, or if the content is too ambiguous, chances are that it is difficult to read for many others. It is not going to be useful for providing new knowledge.", "A paper\u2019s introduction has to provide general background information as well as the scientific problem that it solves, some information about the approach and method used and the motivation behind all this. This part can be underestimated when writing a paper, maybe because one assumes that its value is obvious, or because one may think that only results are really needed in a paper. It turns out that, unless you are doing research in an overcrowded niche, it is unlikely that your reader knows why it matters. It happened to me sometimes to get papers rejected mainly because they were not well motivated.", "You may ask why it matters so much if the research contained in it is good. The reason is that, if you cannot explain the relevance of solving a problem, how can the others know that it is a problem at all? Also, any publication venue has limited room for papers. Then, everything else being equal, a paper that solves a compelling problem will be valued more than another with dubious motivation.", "My suggestion is to think carefully why your readers can find your research interesting and write it explicitly. If the motivation resonates with your readers and the solution is good, they will become your biggest fan on the planet and fight for having it accepted/known. The opposite case will sound like: \u201cthe method is interesting, the results are good, yes ok, but why should I care?\u201d. Try to be on the good side.", "When reviewing, try to be more cautious. If the motivation does not resonate with you, it may be because you do not understand the problem tackled. However, if the paper is not able to frame the general problem and the aspects studied in it in an understandable way, then this is an issue to point out.", "One of the pillars of science is the falsifiable hypothesis: after observing a phenomenon, I make a hypothesis and design experiments where its assumptions hold true. I hope that my hypothesis is not proved wrong by my experiments, but it can be proved wrong/incomplete in the future.", "A hypothesis should give an explanation for a phenomenon or justify an engineering improvement. In a paper, it should be clearly stated since the abstract and repeated along the paper. It is not a coincidence if the most successful papers are also the ones with hypothesis that changed how we see problems. \u201cAttention is all you need\u201d hypothesized that self-attention is more effective than recurrent neural networks in modelling sequences; \u201cBERT\u201d hypothesized that large amounts of unlabeled text data can power up systems for many NLP tasks; \u201cDistilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network\u201d hypothesized that a neural network can learn latent relations among target classes that are more useful than the original data themselves for training new models. They all are now common knowledge in the scientific community, but their ideas were transmitted by their strong and concise messages, not only through numbers in a table. By contrast, papers with weak hypotheses will be perceived as \u201cincremental work\u201d and then moved to a lower rank.", "When writing, state clearly your hypothesis and be sure that the method you propose is coherent with it. Obviously, this part should be done when designing the method and much earlier than writing the paper, but when you write it is time to make it explict for your readers.", "When reading/reviewing ask yourself if the hypothesis is clear, if it is interesting and if the experiments agree with it. If the method and the hypothesis are not coherent among temselves, then the paper is not producing knowledge but confusion. It always feels bad to click on \u201creject\u201d if you feel that the research was good, but a method justified by means of a hypothesis that does not really hold leads to false claims. The same is true when the paper\u2019s title does not agree with its content or the analysis/conclusions make claims out of the blue. In science, errors can happen, but openly false claims cannot be accepted.", "The dataset used for your experiments is not a secondary choice of the experimental design. A dataset embodies a set of domains (or languages, for speech and language processing), assumptions and biases that should be kept in mind during a study. The dataset should reflect the phenomenon to study. Some research works use datasets that are \u201cproxies\u201d for the real task, but this is usually not a good idea.", "A common example of dataset problems from the machine translation world is for papers about low-resourced language pairs, and I must admit that I fell in the same error. Many papers present methods for a low-data condition, but then experiment on a small (and sometimes not-so-small) subset of a large dataset. However, many methods can appear to work here just because the small data produce a weak baseline. Also, such an approach assumes that low-resourced languages and rich-resourced languages are alike, only with less known vocabulary. This is mostly wishful thinking since languages can be as diverse as you can imagine. For instance, the concepts of \u201cto be\u201d and \u201cto have\u201d can be expressed in many different ways, if expressed at all; different formality levels can lead to completely different vocabulary; the idiomatic expressions are really linked to their culture; different writing systems, sometimes many together. These are just some of the challenges of really low-resourced languages that can be hardly learned from small datasets.", "A different issue is the one of evaluation. Sometimes researchers are eager to propose new solutions to problem that they still do not know how to evaluate. In this case, establishing an evaluation method can foster the research field much more than a \u201cnovel method\u201d. For instance, \u201cGender in Danger? Evaluating Speech Translation Technology on the MuST-SHE Corpus\u201d proposes a reproducible method to evaluate speech translation\u2019s quality on gender-related phenomena. The evaluation method required to build a test set with manual annotations in it. Can it be done better? For sure yes, but we still do not know how. And that paper is a big step forward when compared to previous studies on translation gender bias that simply evaluated general translation quality and use it as a proxy for their task.", "Do you want to tackle a task but the existing datasets/evaluation methods are not good enough? Build those and your work will be much more valuable than the ones using a super complex neural network to solve a fake problem.Remember that anybody approaching a new research area will need software, datasets and automatic evaluation. By making it easy to access these resources, you can gain attention (and citations) in your area. In my personal case, people started to notice me in the field of speech translation becasue of code and a dataset I worked on.", "When writing a paper, be sure that the datasets and evaluation methods that you used are coherent with the problem that you want to solve.", "When reading a paper, ensure that the claims in the introduction/conclusion really match the findings of the experiments.", "Your baselines represent a strong indicator of the care you put in your work. A strong baseline, maybe stronger than in other published results, means that the improvement provided by your method are reliable. Sometimes , it happens to read or review papers with baselines that are competitive with the results of 5 years ago, and they absolutely neglect all the improvements produced in the meanwhile. Then, although the improvement over the baseline can be meaningful, the final result is not reliable. The reason is that the contribution (in terms of final result) of many methods or inductive biases tends to zero when applied to stronger baselines. As an example, it is very difficult to appreciate the value of embedding pre-training in a neural machine translation model with a large amount of training data, whereas they are very effective when the training set is small.", "When writing a paper, show more love to your baselines and it will be reciprocated. Stronger baselines can give you new insights into a problem and highlight some flaws in how it has been tackled so far. Weak baselines are useful only to try to publish a paper by hoping to get reviewers that do not know your field. Please, do not do that.", "When reading a paper, before being amazed by the shiny results presented in it, check if it cites recent papers in the same area and verify that the baselines are coherent with the other studies. The presence of tables listing the state of the art is usually a value, but always double check that it is really the state of the art. I saw papers that excluded results that they should have been aware of (because of time passed and small number of published papers). This way their results looked much better than they actually were. This is a really bad scientific practice and should be stopped as soon as noticed.", "The results are an important aspect for an empirical field like NLP, but the adoption of deep learning forces us to read them with a grain of salt. What can go wrong? After checking that the baselines are convincing, we need to estimate the entity of the improvement. Relatively small improvements, although stastically significant, can still be due to randomness (like different random seed, or even a different implementation of the method) or to a better choice of hyperparameters. Just by reading a paper it is hard to tell what the reasons of the improvement are, so I prefer to focus on the analysis. If the analysis can show a coherence between the hypothesis and the results, then I tend to have a positive attitude. If the analysis shows something just because it has to, then it is better for the rest of the paper being really good.", "However, sometimes it is really hard to produce an analysis that can show something interesting for the study. Usually, this happens because it would involve understanding what goes on inside the network weights, which is still quite uninterpretable. Then, we are forced to provide proxies to gain some insights about our methods. The proxies should still be related to the phenomenon, and the models, we are interested in. Anyway, if you are reading a paper and find the analysis unsatisfying, do not be too negative unless you are able to propose a more valuable one.", "When writing a paper, ensure that your results are convincing and the procedure followed is analogous to previous studies, so that it is easy for a reader to compare.", "When reading a paper, try to figure out if the results can be really due to the method applied or to other unrelated factors. Read well the analysis and understand if it is compelling to the phenomenon under study.", "A scientific paper can be very intimidating to write/read/review, but practice and experience will make it easier over time. Fortunately, many papers follow the same structure that makes the reading easier, and when they do not, either they are particularly good or they are particularly bad. Both cases are usually easy to spot. If you are new to writing scientific papers, you may want to improve your scientific writing skills. The web is full of resources, and the ones I linked are a very small sample. I learned many useful tips and recommendations this way. If you are new to reviewing, it is probably better to do some practice by reviewing published papers and asking to somebody more experienced to comment your reviews. I hope that this post helps you to focus on the relevant aspects that can make you understand easier the value of a paper and avoid some errors that I did when starting.", "Do you like my writing and are considering subscribing for a Medium Membership for having unlimited access to the articles?", "If you subscribe through this link you will support me through your subscription with no additional cost for you https://medium.com/@mattiadigangi/membership", "Your home for data science.
