There is nothing wrong with the simplicity that gets the job done and brings savings without massive development costs. That is absolutely where the first opportunities of RPA lie for many companies. At the same time, RPA teams I\u2019ve spoken with are pondering the question \u201cwhat next\u201d.", "In real life, processes have judgment-based decision points, they deal with unstructured data, have exceptions, and they evolve. These complexities are the kryptonite of RPA.", "There is a limit how far you can get with rule-based logic, until hitting a brick wall of impossibility and realising you created something so challenging to maintain that it counters the benefits of automation.", "AI solves this, right? Bring in the scientists!", "Yeah sort of, but we are not going far if all talk is about OCR and document understanding, which seems to steal the majority of the attention with the RPA platform providers AI initiatives. There is so much more. For example, validating and fixing input data, matching datasets between systems that lack shared identifiers, detect anomalies to prevent errors and automate repetitive or \u201ccognitive\u201d decisions made by humans with attended bots.", "While my sample of discussions with RPA leaders is hardly statistically representative, I think it is a fair assumption to say there is a problem. Here are three quotes, generalised to protect the identity of individuals.", "We have had this automation on our RPA backlog for more than a year, and we tried something but the machine learning part didn\u2019t come together. \u2014 RPA team lead", "It\u2019s really difficult to fit the data science project into our agile 3 week bot development sprints. \u2014 RPA team lead", "Our data science team is like a black hole. You put an idea in, and after six months you have a data pipeline built. \u2014 CEO", "Machine learning is undeniably needed when RPA program grows in complexity. Yet, the common theme here is that data science doesn\u2019t meet the needs of RPA. Availability is minimal, tooling drives towards lengthy projects and introducing more technical specialists adds communication challenges. The mindset of data scientists drives towards exploratory projects, whereas RPA engineers need quick solutions that move items on the backlog. As a result, costs stack up too high for many RPA use cases.", "There is a 10\u2013100x gap in \u201cAI to RPA fit\u201d at the moment.", "While I believe data science as a skillset is very much needed and there will \u201calways\u201d be a place for that, I also think there are so much more can be done without bringing the science into every project. Don\u2019t let this mismatch ruin your automation project.", "I got very excited when in the recent Sofa Summit RPA Conf 2020 Ericsson\u2019s Director Automation & AI Transformation Kanda Kumar presented their thinking of \u201cextend the capacity with democratisation\u201d. In practice, there are two ways to get from the status quo towards the full potential:", "I believe there is a massive opportunity in especially the latter. A domain expert having the capability of solving the problem as a part of his/her daily workflow is an undeniable benefit. Apart from allowing cost-effective development of more complex automation workflows, it also enables agile development that is free of the constraints of an external team, their ways of working and backlogs.", "Instead of throwing your automation project into the data science black hole and crossing your fingers, see what you can get done yourself first. You\u2019ll be amazed. Efficient and easy to use tools are already available. Here is my list of six features to consider.", "As I am working with one such tool provider myself, I am biased. :) Thus I would love to hear what is your go-to tool fulfilling some or all of the above requirements? Or how would you improve the list?", "I\u2019m a Chief Product Officer at Aito.ai, a cloud-hosted predictive database that serves machine learning predictions over a simple API using whatever data you have in the database.", "Your home for data science.
