Now when I say success, I don\u2019t mean that I developed a groundbreaking model that can exactly predict when a customer is going to buy a product, I mean successful in the sense that I\u2019ve learned more during this internship than I ever thought and feel that I really understand what data professionals do.", "A large portion of my success came from the company I interned with this summer, but I also feel that I knew what to do because my first internship was not nearly as successful. Here are ten tips that will help you be successful at your next internship!", "Disclaimer: I am not a full time data professional, I am simply relaying my experience from my summer internships. This is not meant to tell you exactly what to do, rather, to give you some advice from experiences I\u2019ve had. For this information, please check out Towards Data Science. If you are interested in some tips that could help you get the most out of your internship, keep reading!", "Now, this is probably the most cliche piece of advice you can receive. Whenever someone would ask me, \u201cDo you have any questions?\u201d, 90% of the time I would answer, \u201cNope, I think I understand it!\u201d. This was a theme for me through my internship, and the first part of my current internship, until the Marketing Strategist at my internship, who is also very passionate about data, gave me some really good advice: \u201cAs data professionals, our whole job is structured on asking questions. Next time someone asks if you have any questions, challenge yourself to look beyond what you want to know, and ask what you think you should know\u201d. So next time someone asks you if you have any questions, challenge yourself to ask a deeper question. Your colleagues and supervisors will see it as a sign of intelligence and a passion to learn, and you will also be practicing a fundamental skill within the craft of data, which is asking questions!", "\u201cAs data professionals, our whole job is structured on asking questions. Next time someone asks if you have any questions, challenge yourself to look beyond what you care to know, and ask what you think you should know\u201d", "If you\u2019ve read my previous story, What I Learned as a Marketing Analytics Intern, then you will remember how I mentioned that building relationships is an extremely important skill. Bouncing off of that idea, doing something as simple as saying \u201cGood Morning!\u201d to your colleagues will show them that you acknowledge their presence, and care about being there with them. Not only will this help build relationships with your colleagues, but frankly, it will also make your experience much more enjoyable! You\u2019ll feel like a part of the team because when you care, so will your colleagues.", "Practice makes perfect! Data professionals are not just scientists and analysts, they are also craftsmen/craftswomen and builders. Just as artists and musicians perfect their craft(personal experience for another story), so do data professionals. If you see someone do something you don\u2019t know how to do, whether it be the Chief Information Officer, or a fellow intern, learn it from them and practice it! I spent at least an hour every day when I got home practicing my Python programming skills after watching the tenure marketing analyst working in Python. As your colleagues and supervisors see your skills growing before their eyes, they will be more inclined to let you attempt more difficult and valuable projects!", "If one of your colleagues asks if you can comb through a 200,000 row spreadsheet and clean some data, then do it! Don\u2019t feel that any task is beneath you, no matter how much experience you have in machine learning and data science/analytics. This was a challenge for me during my first internship, as I thought I was \u201ctoo good\u201d to comb through a spreadsheet. I quickly realized that this is not a smart move. Being open to tasks shows your humbleness, ability to work within a team, and frankly, will let you test your skills with data. I mean, we are aspiring data professionals aren\u2019t we?", "You never know a person until you meet them. I\u2019ve learned a great deal from people outside of the marketing automation department this summer. I\u2019ve met with people in Business Intelligence, Sales, Marketing Communications, and Information Services. Each of these people has helped me grow in some way and have also shared some pretty amazing stories of their journeys within their careers. All you have to do is send them an email or stop by their office and say, \u201cHello! My name is ______. I\u2019m one of the interns, and I\u2019d be really interested in grabbing lunch sometime and picking your brain!\u201d. You\u2019d be surprised how many very successful professionals would be willing to sit down with you and share what they know!", "Everyone loves a team player. If you\u2019re the intern that strolls into the office, props your feet on your desk, and starts talking about how your university is the best and that you\u2019re basically a data master with your 2\u20133 years of education, you will not be received well. Now imagine this, you walk into the office, say good morning to everyone, ask about how your colleagues kids\u2019 birthday was, and ask your manager if you need anything from them this morning, you will be very well received. The point of an internship is to see if you fit into the company culture for possible employment. If you show that you want to be a member of the team, and help the team be successful, you will look very nice when your resume comes across someone\u2019s desk for a job.", "\u201cNow imagine this, you walk into the office, say good morning to everyone, ask about how your colleagues kids\u2019 birthday was, and ask your manager if you need anything from them this morning, you will be very well received.\u201d", "In most internships, your colleagues are there to support you and help you learn. If you want to take on a bigger project than the projects you have been doing, then ask! If you want to do some model building, then ask! Your colleagues want you to be successful, so if you want to do something because you are curious, or want to put your skills to the test, make sure you mention it to someone on your team, because chances are that they can help make it happen!", "As I\u2019ve said, the whole point of most internships is to see if you would be a fit with the company for a long-term position. You need to show your colleagues, however, that you can provide value to the company. Being able to market yourself is huge in this case. Making sure you look professional when you come to work, using professional language in emails, and trying to provide value in every project you do is crucial. This will show your colleagues that you care about the organization and care about the work you do. If they see this from you, they will most likely check up on your work and see what you are up to!", "If you are in an internship program where there is more than one intern, then try to build a relationship with them! This is important because typically, most of the interns in an internship program are all around the same age and the same point in their careers. Getting to know them means that there are opportunities to learn from them, network with them, and become friends with them! You never know, you might be looking for a job ten years down the road, and one of your fellow interns happens to be a VP in a company you are looking at. If they remember that you went out of your way to be friends with them, and hopefully are still friends, they will be more inclined to help you out!", "This one is very important. Internships are fast-paced, and you will have a lot of information thrown your way each day for months. I\u2019d venture to say it would be impossible to retain 100% of that information just by listening. End each day by writing a paragraph about what you learned, and keeping that, along with your projects and other tangible documents, in the same place. That way, you can refer to that information throughout the summer, and the months after your internship as you continue to retain all the information you\u2019ve learned.", "If this was helpful, please let me know! I really enjoy writing about data, and would love to write more articles about data as a craft, how to excel in your internship, and share more of what I\u2019ve learned from a technical perspective! Stay safe everyone, and have a great day!", "To contact me or recieve more content, follow me on Twitter @BMNAnalytics!", "BI Developer II | Data Engineering | www.brendenmnoblitt.com"],
