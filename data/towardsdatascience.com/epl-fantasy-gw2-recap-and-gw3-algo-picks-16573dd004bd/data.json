Let\u2019s look at the most selected players on their teams by position and the most preferred team formations.", "We used this data to create the team below which is a blend of the most selected players by Top100:", "These stats make sense as most of the top players are trying to capitalize on offensive midfielders and strikers with 4\u20134\u20132 or 3\u20134\u20133 formations.", "We had all of our teams score above average, with the highest team getting 66pts. Every week, we will post a picture of our Top2 performing teams. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t pick good captains. We picked Bruno Fernandez because we expected there to be a penalty at the MUN-CRY game given these two teams have some of the highest stats of penalties given to them over last 5 seasons. Well, we were right about the penalty, but unfortunately for us it was for CRY and not for MUN :) And with Jorginho missing the penalty against LIV, our penalty luck was very bad last week.", "We also participate in the FanTeam version of the FPL, where we had our best performing team of the week. Again, not the best captain choice \u2014 Leicester scored 4 goals and Vardy was somehow not involved even in one of them. So, I\u2019d say our luck was quite poor last week overall, but somehow we still managed to do OK.", "Since we added a lot of new stats to our Algorithm this year, this Blog will evolve to have more stats and graphs and less text over time. Let\u2019s start with the Fixture Difficulty Rating (FDR) for the next three game-weeks below:", "Looks like Arsenal, Villa, Leeds, and Newcastle have some tough games coming up, so our Algorithm might not be picking players from those teams. Wolves, Chelsea, Fulham, Man Utd and Sheffield Utd seem to have more easy schedules over the next three weeks.", "We will try to stack up on players from teams that have a higher than 50 % chance of winning such as MUN, CHE, WOL, LIV, TOT, MCI, and EVE. We should try not to have too many defensive players from LEI, WBA, NEW, ARS, BHA, CRY, WBA, WHU, or BUR.", "Teams with higher probability to draw, especially when the game is combined with high odds for Under 2.5, might be good for selecting defensive players because if the game ends 0:0, that will result in lots of bonus points. Combined with the Under/Over Graph below, we can identify the following games with higher probability of at least one clean sheet \u2014 WHU-WOL, BUR-SOU, FUL-AVL, and SHU-LEE.", "Inversely, we might want to have more attacking players from games with high odds for Over 2.5 such as MCI vs. LEI, LIV vs. ARS, WBA vs. CHE, and TOT vs. NEW. Again, the odds from last week played out pretty well as most games predicted had over 2.5 goals!", "From the stats below it appears that there is a higher chance for penalty given in games: CRY-EVE, WBA-CHE, TOT-NEW, MCI-LEI and LIV-ARS, so we recommend having penalty takers for some of these teams. Looks, like the games CRY-EVE and SHU-LEE have refs that like to give a lot of cards, so expect to lose some points there from yellow cards, but hopefully no red\u2026", "To help your choice of set piece takers please see the list below which is more or less up-to-date with a couple of doubtful predictions:", "Before we run our final team selector, let\u2019s take into account the predicted starting 11 for each team.", "Pay attention to the doubtful player names on the right and also the the most recent injury news updates below:", "It\u2019s time for the crown jewel of this year\u2019s improved Algorithm \u2014 the predicted player stats. After we layer in all the FDR, bookie coefficient, ref starts, projected lineups and injuries, there are two major metrics that we take into consideration when tuning our Team Optimizer for the next n-gameweeks team selection\u2014 predicted total points and expected value (ROI). Below are the stats for each metric, also broken down by position.", "As you can see there is a large number of options we can choose from for each position, so we will be plugging a lot of the stats above into an Optimization Function in Python, which will output the team with the highest expected total points, given our budget constraints and other metrics that go into our decision making process. Some of the preliminary filters, applied before the Team Selector Code kicks in, include:", "As you can see below, the model first looks at parameters that tells it if it should optimize towards full squad of 15 players, or towards a specific formation with 11 key players and 4 cheap fillers. For the fillers, it first looks at preferred formation and uses that to decide how many fillers to get per position. The model then subtracts the total amount spent on the 4 fillers from our initial budget and spends the leftover budget on the key 11 players, given the optimization function and model constraints.", "We used the output of the Optimizer Algorithm to build the team below:", "We pretty much made just one change and that was trading Auba for KDB. This year we will be trying to get very few -4pts from extra transfers, since our algorithm is meant to invest in players that you can keep at least for 3\u20134 gameweeks, so we should not be doing lots of transfers each week. It was hard to select a captain, but given Son\u2019s recent form and Newcastle\u2019s shaky defense, we\u2019re hoping it will pay off. But we also think that KDB, Salah and Fernandes are not bad captain choices either since there is a higher chance of penalties in all of these team\u2019s games.", "We still have some work to do with our transfers to get rid of Saliba and get a more consistent GK than Areola, but that might take a few game weeks to work out, so, for now, we\u2019re sticking with our long term investment in our current squad, and giving the players at least 3\u20134 weeks to realize their expected potential. Some of them such as Son, Salah, and KDB are already paying off decent dividends :) Enjoy watching the games this weekend and good luck with selecting the right captain as we all got reminded just how important that is by Son and Kane last weekend :)", "Your home for data science.
