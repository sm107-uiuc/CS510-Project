Because of this, billions of persons have been sent into lockdown as health services struggle to cope. Now, in August 2020, there are many questions as to whether students should go back to school in-person for the new semester, whether businesses like restaurants can resume regular operations, and whether countries should reinforce their previous lockdown measures.", "Many of these decisions need to be guided by both data healthcare professionals and should not be made in a vacuum, absent of data. There are many aspects to the data analysis process, and data visualization is a very important aspect. Data visualization is the process of taking information and transforming it into a visual context, such as a graph. Most persons tend to agree that looking at a graph and understanding the underlying message is much easier than reading through a table of numbers, especially with large data sets. Therefore, in order to understand the distribution of COVID-19 cases by country as well as how COVID-19 is spreading throughout these countries, I am going to walk through a data visualization exercise.", "All analysis will be conducted in R using the tidyverse and the data can be retrieved from a publicly available data repository (link in the Reference section).", "The first step is to load the data into my environment and ensure that it is structured appropriately for visual analysis.", "This data set contains variables such as the date, country, province, longitude, latitude, the number of cases on a given date, and whether those cases were confirmed positive cases, recoveries or deaths. For this analysis, I am interested in the date, country and number of confirmed positive cases. Therefore, I will select these columns and create a new data frame with only the variables of interest.", "However, upon inspection of the output from glimpse(covid_df) , it is found that the date variable was parsed as a character type instead of a date type, and the type of case was also parsed as a character whereas it should have been a factor. Thus, I will convert the variables to the appropriate data type and then create the new data frame.", "Now that I have my data of interest, it would be valuable to understand the worldwide growth of COVID-19. Since the data frame contains many countries and it is reasonable for multiple countries to have confirmed positive cases on the same day, this requires that the data be grouped by date and then aggregated to find the total number of cases per day. Additionally, to understand the growth, it would also be appropriate to calculate the cumulative sum of cases over time.", "The graph shows that worldwide COVID-19 cases increased rapidly between January and February, slowed down at the beginning of March, and then rapidly increased again after mid-March. It can also be seen that the current rate of new cases is lower than that of the rate from mid-March to April, but worldwide cases are still increasing.", "Although cases were primarily concentrated in China during the early period of the outbreak, the United States quickly became the area of concern. Therefore, I will next plot the United States versus the rest of the world to gather insights as to the upticks in cases during March and beyond.", "These two curves have similar shapes; it shows that the number of confirmed cases within the United States increased rapidly during March, and this rapid increase continued until April. Although this does provide insight to the jump in cases seen on the first plot, it can also be seen that the rest of the world still saw a rapidly increasing number of confirmed cases during and after March.", "Because of this, I will compare the United States versus China to determine the similarities and differences between the outbreaks within these countries.", "The graph shows that as the United States continued to grow in confirmed cases, China relatively levelled off. Therefore, China\u2019s cases do not explain the jump seen within the previous graphs.", "So which countries are contributing to the constant growth in COVID-19 cases? It would be ideal to determine which are the top countries in terms of the total number of confirmed positive cases.", "The output of Hardest_hit_Countries shows a table of the top 5 countries in terms of the total number of confirmed positive cases. From this table, it is gathered that the United States is the top country in this regard with a total of 4,823,890 cases. The United States is followed by Brazil with 2,859,073 cases; India with 1,964,536 cases; Russia with 864,948 cases; and South Africa with 529,877 cases.", "To understand the relative contribution that these countries have had to the growth of worldwide COVID-19 cases over time, a plot comparing the growth within these countries versus the rest of the world can be created. If these countries were responsible for the bumps seen in the previous graphs, then the line representing the rest of the world would be much flatter when compared to that same line in previous graphs.", "The graph shows that the hardest-hit countries account for a considerable portion in the uptick in cases during and after March, where the United States accounts for most of the cases during March. However, there still exists a noticeable bump in the rest of the world during March. A reason for this is that the hardest-hit filter determines which countries currently have the highest number of COVID-19 cases, and these might not have been the same countries during March.", "To determine which were the hardest-hit countries during the period in question, I will update the hardest-hit filter and determine which countries now top the charts.", "The output of this data frame now shows that the United States is still the top country, with 214,205 cases. However, the United States is now followed by Italy with 110,574 cases; Spain with 104,118 cases; China with 82361 cases; and Germany with 77,872 cases.", "These numbers also suggest that the United States increased by over 2,000% in terms of the number of confirmed positive cases between April 1st and August 5th. Crazy.", "So, now knowing that the United States drastically increased in the confirmed number of positive cases, what portion of worldwide cases does the United States account for? In fact, it would be interesting to understand the portion of confirmed cases that each country accounts for.", "The output from share_of_cases shows that cases within 3 countries currently account for ~50% of the worldwide confirmed positive COVID-19 cases, where cases in the United States account for ~26%; cases in Brazil account for ~15%; and cases in India account for ~10%. This is particularly concerning since this data set contains 188 countries. Therefore, it means that less than 2% of the countries within this data set account for ~50% of worldwide cases.", "The output also shows that cases within 14 countries currently account for ~75% of of the worldwide confirmed positive COVID-19 cases. Now, this metric still suggests that cases are concentrated within a few countries, but it is comparatively better than cases within 3 countries accounting for ~50% of worldwide cases.", "The last thing that I will do is create a graph to show the growth of confirmed positive cases within the United States, while annotating key events such as when the pandemic was declared and when all states were under lockdown measures.", "This graph shows that the United States is continuing to increase in the number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases at a quadratic rate, despite the previous lockdown efforts. This is additionally concerning since some states are opposed continuing (or reimplementing) lockdown measures.", "As it relates to questions mentioned previously about students, restaurants and similar businesses, as well as other countries, policymakers should continue monitoring cases within their jurisdiction and make the best decision, given their circumstances. The coronavirus definitely has not gone away, and any decisions being made regarding health and safety need to be highly data-driven.", "Your home for data science.
