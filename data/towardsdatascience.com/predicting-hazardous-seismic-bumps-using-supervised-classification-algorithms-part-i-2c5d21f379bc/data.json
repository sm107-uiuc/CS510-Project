The code can be found in my GitHub repository.", "Note \u2014 I haven\u2019t elaborated on each feature in the EDA and feature engineering steps since they are repetitive. I only have samples in this blog and the full code is available on GitHub in this link.", "This dataset has 2584 instances with 19 columns, out of which there are 4 categorical features, 8 discrete features, and 6 numeric features. The last one is the label column which contains 0 for non-hazardous and 0 for non-hazardous seismic bumps.

In other words, 3 out of 50 seismic bumps are hazardous.", "First, I looked at the categorical features to understand if there exists a relationship bias between any of them and the label categories. For this, I constructed contingency tables using pandas.crosstab function and assessed the ratios and proportions of the content of each category in categorical features versus the class labels to determine if there is a bias.", "The ratios for each seismo-acoustic category for class 1 to class 0 are ~0.06 which doesn\u2019t exhibit any strong bias. The features \u2014 \u201cseismic\u201d and \u201cshift\u201d contained some distribution bias. The category \u2018b\u2019 in \u2018seismic\u2019 feature contains a greater fraction of hazardous seismic bumps while that of \u201cshift\u201d\u2019s category \u201cW\u201d contains more seismic bumps than the category \u201cN\u201d. The contingency tables for these categorical features are below:", "Next, I looked at the data and picked out the numeric columns to understand their descriptive stats, correlations, and distribution plots.", "In Pandas, the describe method only provides count, mean, min, max, std, and the percentiles from which we can assess the skewness of the data to some extent. To better understand their distributions, visuals are essential like distribution plots and histograms.", "I assessed the correlation among these features using pandas.DataFrame.corr and visualized using seaborn.heatmap .", "The distribution of energy and max energy looks similar. genergy looks right-skewed. To better understand the distributions, I used seaborn.distplot to visualize each feature as demoed below.", "In the heat-map, it is evident that genergy and gpuls, gdenergy, and gdpuls are strongly correlated. energy and maxenergy are almost perfectly correlated. In the later sections of EDA, I attempted to construct scatterplots for specifically these highly correlated pairs and visualize their spread for each target class.", "Like I said, I wanted to visualize the distributions like below, it is evident that genergy is right-skewed, like all other numeric features (shown in Github Notebook).", "More instances of genergy are in the range 0 to 200000 and the distribution then tapers off towards higher energy values. The pattern is the same for all the other numeric features but the ranges for gdenergy and gdpuls are smaller than the other numeric features.", "Additionally, I used a scatterplot to visualize the correlated features with a correlation coefficient of more than 0.70. I constructed the scatterplot to see how these numerical values are scattered for each target class.", "In the left figure, the seismic bumps are more concentrated at higher values of gpuls and genergy. There is also a strong observed linear relationship in the scatterplot on the right with energy vs maxenergy, as suggested by the descriptive stats, their distplots, and this scatterplot.", "The \u2018nbumpsX\u2019 are discrete features that contain integers from 0 to 9. As can be seen here, \u2018nbumps6\u2019 is all zeros, the same as \u2018nbumps7\u2019 and \u2018nbumps89\u2019. Also, they are all right-skewed or positively skewed distributions.", "I dropped \u2018nbumps6\u2019, \u2018nbumps7\u2019, and \u2018nbumps89\u2019 using the code below. Everything else looks fine, but there is a high possibility of any ML model treating \u2018nbumpsX\u2019 information as ordinal.", "I also constructed contingency tables again to see how the nbumpsX are jointly distributed with the target class using the following code:", "In the tables, there was no stark difference in the distributions for hazardous and non-hazardous instances. They occur proportionally throughout the nbumpsX count in all these discrete features.", "Since all of these look just fine, I moved on to \u2018Feature Engineering\u2019, the next section, where I dealt with the categorical and numeric features.", "I one-hot encoded the categorical variables and transformed the numeric columns for scaling the range down. I kept the discrete features the same.", "I encoded all the two-class categorical features into one feature containing 0s and 1s while I converted the features more than two classes into a binary column for each category. This one-hot encoded feature column represents if that instance contains that particular category or not.", "For example, the seismo-acoustic feature contains three classes \u2014 a, b and c (as on the left figure) which got transformed into the expanded into three binary features (as on the right figure). I used drop=\u2019first\u2019 to avoid the dummy variable trap.", "I then transformed all numeric features using log-transform. z-score transform and compared the transformations of the original distributions. The distributions now seem a bit more \u201cnormalized\u201d and the range much better. Refer to the code and visualization below to compare.", "I basically created a dictionary to define what transformation I\u2019d like to apply on these columns and then looped through the dictionary items like below:", "Final descriptive stats for the numeric after dropping maxenergy since the data are similar for both.", "The range seems good in the left table. The right table contains some zero values for energy and maxenergy. To tackle that, I added a 1 to the \u2018energy\u2019 column (since I dropped maxenergy) and then applied log-transform.", "Since this is an imbalanced dataset, I used Stratified Shuffle Split to split and proportionally distribute the target classes.", "Had I not used this technique, I would have ended up with slightly more imbalanced proportions of hazardous seismic bumps, like below. The machine learning algorithm will be able to learn from a much fair proportion of the class labels rather than random distributions where the smaller category of the target class can be too little to learn from, therefore, bringing down the model\u2019s performance.", "The impact of these slight differences could impact the performance of the machine learning algorithms hence for both binary and multi-class classification problems. It is always advisable hence to use stratified splits for classification problems, especially when there is an imbalanced dataset to preserve the percentage of samples for each class and avoid sampling bias.", "Thanks for visiting.
