But the problem is they are not really helpful for someone who is just starting out. To explore the usefulness of machine learning in data journalism we need to start at a more basic level.

Data scientists use it all the time to improve the performance of their models while optimizing training time. But here we care less about that. Much more interesting to us and our readers is what makes our data tick.

Some call them intuitive. Why intuitive? Some say they are similar to how humans make decisions in regards to classification. If a person knew all about the probabilities in the data, he or she would act similarly. Other model types for regression and classification tasks can be very different from this. Decision trees\u2019 graphical output is also helpful to pitch to editors. We saw some examples above.", "Some of the shortcomings of decision tree models right at the start: Their predictive accuracy can be lower compared to other model types. Also, small alterations in the data could cause significant changes in the final tree which makes them less robust. In our Random Forrest coding example further down we will show how to overcome this by aggregating many trees in a single model instead of just one.

Now to the juicy part. Which columns are most telling various INCOME categories?", "Unsurprisingly, all of the columns contribute some share. But some much more than others. Occupation seems to be the most telling feature, together with age. BTW, this is similar to what researchers at Temple University found on what influences future affluence the strongest. If gender and ethnicity rank high (or low) it raises some interesting questions that we as reporters may want to follow up investigating.", "We are not here for that. But it could give you a hook to further investigating biases or unfair treatment of groups.", "Other follow up investigating may entail telling which occupations are mentioned most frequently in each income bucket? We created a mode function for that. Do you spot what I see?", "Random Forest models run with default parameters as shown above but leave room for improvements. We can fine-tune our model by changing the \u2018mtry\u2019 input dial (the number of variables randomly sampled at each stage, at each split). At the same time, we will play with altering the \u2018Ntree\u2019 input (the number of trees we grow.).", "To make it a bit easier for us we will only have two categories for income classes: One for over 30,000 and one below.", "To find the optimal \u2018mtry\u2019 value we will loop through each model and check on the accuracy:", "Your mtry value is with the highest average accuracy level.", "Sidenote on the \u2018Ntree\u2019 input: You shouldn\u2019t make it too small to ensure every input row to be predicted at least a few times.", "Checking against other models: We do this to see what\u2019s working best.

To predict an outcome we followed the splits and predictions for the most frequent outcomes. As shown in the first example, we controlled the number of splits with the help of the bucket parameter.", "Random Forest on ther other hand is slightly more advanced.

Which of your models win?", "Well done in completing the tutorial.", "There are a number other feature selection techniques. One is called Information value and Weight of evidence. R\u2019s InformationValue package is for binary classification. It provides functions to calculate weights of evidence and information value for categorical variables. There is also MARS from the earth package. It\u2019s for implementing variable importance based on generalized cross-validation (GCV), number of subset models the variable occurs (nsubsets) and residual sum of squares (RSS). Ther is also Step-wise Regression.
