One of the most magical aspects of music is how multiple individual musical notes can come to together to form a chord \u2014 something greater than the sum of its individual parts. But what makes certain chords sound harmonious and others dissonant? Ultimately, it comes down to the ratio of the frequencies of the notes in the chord. To see this in action, we can use a function called the Lissajous curve.", "The Lissajous curve, named after Jules Antoine Lissajous, is defined by the following parametric equations:", "The curve plotted using the above equations is very sensitive to the values of a and b, essentially a measure of dissonance. The ratio a/b also visually corresponds to the number of lobes in the Lissajous curve. Additionally, when this ratio is irrational, the plot will appear to rotate. Let\u2019s see how we can use this to visualize different chord intervals.", "For this analysis, we will create visualizations in Python, so first we should import the relevant packages:", "If you are using Jupyter to generate your animations, you need to add the line %matplotlib notebook to use the interactive backend.", "We can now define the function for our Lissajous curve \u2014 we will use a simplified form of the equation where the coefficients A and B will both be set to 1, and we will set the \ud835\udeff = 0 so there is no offset in the x term.", "In our function, the input t will be an array of time values that we pass to sin and cos, and a and b will be the constants we discussed earlier that represent a measure of dissonance.", "Let us make some adjustments to the general parameters \u2014 we will remove the four axes spines and change the font properties for the plot:", "I have written a previous article here on the basics of animated plots in Python, but we will quickly go through all the steps here. First, we want to create an empty plot and create a variable reference to this plot that we can then use to update the data during our animation.", "Now, we need to create the animation function \u2014 this function will take an index i as an input and use that information to update the plot each time it is called. In our case, we are going to shift the time interval that is plotted based on the value of i, so that plots that are dissonant and \u201cunstable\u201d will go through visual changes as this time range evolves. In the code below, I have set the values of a and b to both be equal to 1.", "In the example above, during the first iteration, we are plotting t values from 0 to 8\u03c0, the subsequent iteration from 8\u03c0 to 16\u03c0, and so on. We are essentially plotting one time scale and sliding this entire scale through time as we update the animation.", "Finally, we can call the animation with the following code:", "frames \u2014 we are using range(10) to pass a list of values from [0, 9]", "interval \u2014 we are going to shift the time scale every 100 ms", "repeat \u2014 we will keep repeating the animation", "For aesthetics, we will remove the x and y ticks marks and set the x-axis label to represent the values of a and b that we have chosen.", "The \\n in the xlabel is an escaped newline character \u2014 by adding these we are printing the a and b values on separate lines. Since we have a multiline axis label we can add the following line to make sure that the entire label will be visible:", "Now, for the trivial example of a = b = 1, we get the following (keep in mind this is in fact an animation!).", "writer \u2014 the backend used to create the animation (for this we use pillow)", "fps \u2014 frames per second (since we are calling animate every 100 ms, we should make this value 10 to match)", "dpi \u2014 resolution (dots-per-inch) of images used to make animation", "When both of our frequencies are the same, we just get a line that appears to not change with time. Remember that \u201csimpler-looking\u201d figures are the result of low, whole-number ratios of a and b, which in this case, are both equal to 1. Additionally, since the ratio is a rational number, we do not expect the plot to rotate with time.", "This second natural overtone of a musical frequency is its doubling, also known as the octave. By changing the value of a to 2, we get the following animation:", "Since the ratio of a to b is now 2, we have 2 lobes in our Lissajous curve, and since the a/b is rational, we have no rotation. The idea of using \u201cpure intervals\u201d like these to tune notes was used in Ancient Greece by Pythagoras to generate a musical scale.", "The Pythagorean tuning system uses two pure intervals to determine an entire scale: the octave (2:1), and the perfect fifth (3:2) \u2014 you can find more information in this article here. By applying these two ratios over and over, we can generate all the notes in the scale. As an example:", "Start with base frequency, octave, and fifth:", "Find a new perfect fifth interval with respect to the current fifth:", "Since this value is greater than our octave (2/1), we divide by this ratio (2) to bring it back into our interval:", "Where (9/8) now represents a new note \u2014 the major second", "We continue this process over and over again until we have generated all the notes of the scale \u2014 looking at only the notes of the major scale, we get:", "We can visualize all of these notes by using subplots and plotting each of their animations! We will make the subplots as following:", "add_subplot(xyz) \u2014 x is the number of rows, y is the number of columns, and z is the subplot of interest (starts at the top left and goes through each row one-by-one)", "Now, our animate function has to have an update for all of the subplots simultaneously:", "Again, all the plots above are animated, so we can see that none of them are \u201cunstable\u201d. However, as we saw previously, the complexity of the curve is representative of the whole number ratios, and we see a large degree of complexity in the major 3rd and the major 7th. While the latter interval is known to sound dissonant (since they correspond to two consecutive semitones), the major 3rd should not. In fact, this is actually the main criticism of using the Pythagorean tuning scale! The major 3rd is so out of tune that it can cause major chords to sound dissonant.", "The tuning system that is typically used to get around this issue is twelve-tone equal temperament, where the ratio between adjacent notes is no longer defined by pure tones, or whole number ratios, but equal. To do this, we take the twelfth root of 2, since the frequency doubles (octave) every 12 semitones.", "The consequence of using this system is that because we are no longer using pure tone intervals, all of our notes are just slightly out-of-tune unlike the Pythagorean system, in which many intervals are perfect, with some ratios of large whole numbers causing dissonance. However, the relative intervals can provide chords that sound less dissonant as a whole than their counterparts in the Pythagorean case.", "Let us now visualize the major scale in equal temperament as we did for Pythagorean tuning! The semitones we need to construct the major scale are as follows:", "Octave: 12th semitone (or frequency doubling)", "An example of how we would implement this in our animation function is as follows:", "We see that all of our intervals outside of the octave are now unstable! Even the fifth interval in the equal temperament system is no longer a perfect fifth \u2014 however, we notice that the major 3rd is now MUCH less dissonant than it was in the Pythagorean tuning case. This is why for instruments like the piano, in which fine tuning notes on the fly is not possible (as in, for example, wind instruments), equally tempered notes are much more preferable.", "I hope this was article was useful is showing how we can use dynamic Python visualizations to judge \u201cdissonance\u201d in a musical chord.
