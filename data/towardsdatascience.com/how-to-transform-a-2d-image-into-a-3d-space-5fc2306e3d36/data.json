They are widely used in video games and Computer Vision. It is impossible to enumerate all their uses, but they are also used to enhance images during training in Deep Learning.", "For the moment we do not know what is the matrix M and its coefficients correspond to. In reality, the coefficients are not directly found. Let\u2019s rather say that there is a better way to decompose this matrix. Indeed a transformation matrix can be decomposed into 4 matrices, all playing a role in the transformation of coordinates in space.", "We note the Translation matrix, the Rotation matrix, the Scaling matrix and the Shearing (or Skewing) matrix.", "I have decomposed the matrix in the above order. The order has its importance. In this case, it will apply first the translation then the rotation and so on. However, to apply 3D perspectives, we will have to move to Homogeneous coordinates and therefore introduce two new matrices.", "The two matrices that we are going to see allow us to go from a Cartesian coordinate system to a projective coordinate system and vice versa, respectively H and H\u2019. Note that H\u2019 is not the inverse matrix of H.", "To explain what the projection coordinates are, I will make the analogy in 2D for simplicity. Imagine a screen of size X, Y, which is quite easy to represent. Then we have (X, Y, W) where W is the screen-projector distance. So we are in a 2D space in projective (or homogeneous) coordinates.", "Now that we are in this projection space, we can move the projector forward or backward from the screen with a distance \u0394W. If we move it backward then the projection image will be projected beyond it. Conversely, by bringing the projector closer to the screen, the display size of the image on the screen is reduced.", "It is not possible (or difficult) to imagine this projective space associated with a 3D Cartesian space, but the principle remains the same. We will have (X, Y, Z, W).", "In the next scripts, we will apply these transformation matrices by considering angles in degrees (0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0) and measurements in pixels.", "For the moment we have not defined the transformation matrices. We will define them later. We will replace them with the Identity matrix. This matrix does not modify the image, it is like multplying a number by 1.", "Let\u2019s go back to our matrices for the transition from Cartesian coordinates to projective coordinates and vice versa. For now, the matrix M is the identity matrix.", "Here, h and w are the height and width dimensions of the image to be processed.", "If h and w appear in our equation it is to center the mark in the center of the image. Indeed, in an image, the mark\u2019s origin is at the top-left corner of the image (the coordinates (0, 0)).", "Also, we can see the appearance of the variable f which corresponds to the focal length of our projector in the diagram we saw before.", "So we can make the foundation of our image transformation function. Starting by recovering all the transformation values on all the axes and then defining the matrices of homogeneous passage.", "Let\u2019s move on to the translation matrix. As its name indicates, this allows us to perform translations on the different axes.", "You will notice that the Z-axis translation had to be updated. Indeed our translation, in pixel, does not take into account the \u201cdistance to the projector\u201d.", "You will understand that we had to update the Z-axis for the scale too.", "The rotation matrix can be broken down into the product of rotation matrices on the different axes. In a 3D space, we have 3 rotation matrices.", "The Scale matrix allows, to put it simply, to imitate the zoom. In other words, if we take again our example our image, the zoom by two on X or Y can be understood by spreading the image by as much on these axes (while looking at the image from the same distance).", "And for the Z-axis, we can interpret zoom by two as the combination of a zoom by two on X and on Y. (or a change by ratio for the focal length)", "Note that one can make symmetries on the axes by passing a value of -1.", "The shearing matrix makes it possible to stretch (to shear) on the different axes.", "In 3D we, therefore, have a shearing matrix which is broken down into distortion matrices on the 3 axes.", "We then have all the necessary matrices to transform our image. It would be interesting to be able to visualize their effect in real time on an image of our choice. Let's create a slider.", "The slider is only a static image, nothing can be done yet. Let\u2019s create a stacker of these sliders so we can control them in real time with the mouse.", "Knowledge is all about sharing.Support me and get access of all my articles in one click here.", "Programmer\u2019s Guide to Homogeneous Coordinates, Hackernoon", "All the images are homemade and free to use.", "Your home for data science.
