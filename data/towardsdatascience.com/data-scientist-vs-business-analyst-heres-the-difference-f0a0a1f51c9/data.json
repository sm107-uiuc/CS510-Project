A lot of the goals shared are the same as well. The how, however, is what differentiates them. Both roles additionally do share some ambiguity which provides for even more overlap in terms of skills, concepts, and goals. Below, I will be outlining the specifics of these two positions, as well as their similarities and differences from my personal point of view.", "A Data Scientist is a person who utilizes Machine Learning algorithms to create a model from data that ultimately helps to make a business more efficient. What are some of the main skills required to be a Data Scientist, as well as their respective goals?", "The main skills for a Data Scientist include, but are not limited to:", "As you can see, there are both technical and soft-skills associated with Data Science. It is not enough to be a Programmer or Statistician, but also someone who can communicate the process of establishing the problem statement, developing it, and sharing that respective solution to the business.", "The main goals for a Data Scientist include, but are not limited to:", "You can see here that none of the goals here are necessarily technical, they are strictly points that ultimately improve the business in some way. However, the method in that you reach the goal requires technical expertise.", "Perhaps the biggest similarity of Business Analyst to Data Scientist is the words itself to describe the role. A Data Scientist is expected to perform business analytics in their role as it is essentially what dictates their Data Science goals. A Business Analyst can expect to focus not on Machine Learning algorithms to solve business problems, but instead on surfacing anomalies, shifts and trends, and key points of interest for a business.", "Some of the key skills of a Business Analyst are:", "The skills here cover tools that are used to answer issues analytically. Also important in this role is the ability to problem-solve and highlight key areas of improvements for the business.", "Here are some of the goals expected for a Business Analyst:", "The goals here are broader and ultimately refer to utilizing data to help the business.", "Of course, there are some key differences between these two roles. One of the biggest differences is the use of Machine Learning for Data Scientists only. Another difference is that a Business Analyst can expect to communicate more to stakeholders than a Data Scientist would (sometimes Data Scientist work can be more heads down and not involve as many meetings). Here is a summary of the differences you can expect to find between these positions.", "These two roles share goals with one another. Each requires a deep dive into data with similar tools as well. The process of communication is similar, too \u2014 working with stakeholders from the company to go over the business problem, solution, results, and impact. Here is a summary of the key similarities between a Data Scientist and a Business Analyst.", "Both roles vary from company to company. What stays the same are the goals and impact that each role employs. Perhaps the biggest difference is the method of how you get to the solution or surface a finding. Some Business Analysts may find themselves eventually becoming Data Scientists, and vice versa. It depends on your preference for the skills and tools needed to perform your job.", "Thank you for reading! I hope you found this article both interesting and useful.
