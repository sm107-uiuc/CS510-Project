These techniques allow for historical information to be introduced as input to the model through a set of time delays.", "The advantage of using machine learning models over more traditional methods is that they can have higher predictive power, especially when predictors have a clear causal link to the response. Moreover, they can handle complex calculations over larger numbers of inputs much faster.", "However, they tend to have a wider array of tuning parameters, are generally more complex than \"classic\" models, and can be expensive to fit, both in terms of computing power and time. To top it off, their black box nature makes their output harder to interpret and has given birth to the ever growing field of Machine Learning interpretability (I am not going to touch on this as it's outside the scope of the project)", "In this project, I am going to explain in detail the various steps needed to model time series data with machine learning models.", "In particular, I use TSstudio to carry out a \"traditional\" time series exploratory analysis to describe the time series and its components and show how to use the insight I gather to create features for a machine learning pipeline to ultimately generate a weekly revenue forecast.", "For modelling and forecasting I\u2019ve chosen the high performance, open source machine learning library H2O. I am fitting an assorted selection of machine learning models such as Generalised Linear Model, Gradient Boosting Machine and Random Forest and also using AutoML for automatic machine learning, one of the most exciting features of the H2O library.", "The dataset I\u2019m using here accompanies a Redbooks publication and is available as a free download in the Additional Material section. The data covers worth of sales orders for the Sample Outdoors Company, a fictitious B2B outdoor equipment retailer enterprise and comes with details about the products they sell as well as their customers (which in their case are retailers). Due to its artificial nature, the series presents a few oddities and quirks, which I am going to point out throughout this project.", "Here I\u2019m simply loading up the compiled dataset but if you want to follow along I\u2019ve also written a post called Loading, Merging and Joining Datasets where I show how I\u2019ve assembled the various data feeds and sorted out the likes of variable naming, new features creation and some general housekeeping tasks.", "You can find the full code on my Github repository.", "Time series data have a set of unique features, like timestamp, frequency and cycle/period, that have applications for both descriptive and predictive analysis. R provides several classes to represent time series objects ( xts and zoo to name but the main ones), but to cover the descriptive analysis for this project I've chosen to use the ts class, which is supported by the TSstudio library.", "TSstudio comes with some very useful functions for interactive visualization of time series objects. And I really like the fact that this library uses plotly as its visualisation engine!", "First of all, I select the data I need for my analysis ( order_date and revenue in this case) and aggregate it to a weekly frequency. I mark this dataset with a _tmp suffix to denote that is a temporary version and a few steps are still needed before it can be used.", "The series spans across 3 & 1\u20442 years worth of sales orders so I should expect to have at least 182 data point but there are only 89 observations!", "Let\u2019s take a closer look to see what\u2019s happening:", "A couple of things to notice here: this series presents an unusual weekly pattern, with sales logged twice a month on average. Also, the first week of 2004 has no sales logged against it.", "To carry out time series analysis with ts objects I need to make sure that I have a full 52 weeks in each year, which should also include weeks with no sales.", "So before converting my data to a ts object I need to:", "Now I can take a look at weekly revenue, my response variable", "As already mentioned, the series is artificially generated and does not necessarily reflect what would happen in a real-life situation. If this was an actual analytics consulting project, I would most definitely question the odd weekly sales frequency with my client.", "But assuming that this is the real deal, the challenge here is to construct a thought-through selection of meaningful features and test them on a few machine learning models to find one that can to produce a good forecast.", "In this segment, I am exploring the time series, examining its components and seasonality structure, and carry out a correlation analysis to identify the main characteristics of the series.", "Before I can change my series into a ts object, I need to define the start (or end) argument of the series. I want the count of weeks to start with the first week of the year, which ensures that all aligns with the ts framework.", "I create the ts object by selecting the response variable ( revenue) as the data argument and specifying a frequency of 52 weeks.", "Checking the series attributes with the ts_info() function shows that the series is a weekly ts object with 1 variable and 181 observations.", "Let\u2019s now plot our time series with the help of TSstudio 's graphic functions.", "ts_decompose breaks down the series into its elements: Trend, Seasonality, and Random components.", "Let\u2019s now zoom in on the seasonal component of the series", "Although there are 12 distinct \u201cspikes\u201d (one for each month of the year), the plot does not suggest the presence of a canonical seasonality. However, with very few exceptions, sales are logged on the same weeks each year and I will try to capture that regularity with a feature variable.", "The autocorrelation function (ACF) describes the level of correlation between the series and its lags.", "Due to the odd nature of the series at hand, the AC plot is not very straightforward to read and interpret: it shows that there is a lag structure but due to the noise in the series it\u2019s difficult to pick up a meaningful pattern.", "However, I can make use of Lag Visualizations and play with the lag number to identify potential correlation between the series and it lags.", "In this case, aligning the number of weeks to a quarterly frequency shows a distinct linear relationship with quarterly lags. For simplicity, I will only include lag 13 in the models to control for the effect of level of sales during the last quarter.", "Using the same trick reveals a strong linear relationship with the first yearly lag. Again, I will include only a lag 52 in the models.", "The modelling and forecasting strategy is to:", "Below you find a visual representation of the strategy. I find from experience that supporting explanations with a good visualisation is a great way to bring your points to life, especially when working with time series analysis.", "All models accuracy will be compared with performance metrics and actual vs predicted plots.", "The performance metrics I am going to be using are:", "A very important remark: as you can see, I\u2019m not showing 2004 data in the plot. This is because, whenever you include a lag variable in your model, the first period used to calculate the lag \u201cdrop off\u201d the dataset and won\u2019t be available for modelling. In the case of a yearly lag, all observations \u201cshift\u201d one year ahead, and as there are no sales recorder for 2003, this results in the first 52 weeks being dropped from the analysis.", "Now I can start to incorporate the findings from the Time Series exploration in my feature variables.

In this project I am focusing in particular on 4 algorithms:", "First things first: start a H2O instance!", "When R starts H2O through the h2o.init command, I can specify the size of the memory allocation pool cluster. To speed things up a bit, I set it to \"16G\".", "I also prefer to switch off the progress bar as in some cases the output message can be quite verbose and lengthy.", "The next step is to arrange response and predictor variables sets. For regression to be performed, you need to ensure that the response variable is NOT a factor (otherwise H2O will carry out a classification).", "I am going to start by fitting a random forest.", "Note that I\u2019m including the nfolds parameter. Whenever specified, this parameter enables cross-validation to be carried out without the need for a validation_frame - if set to 5 for instance, it will perform a 5-fold cross-validation.", "I\u2019m also using some of the control parameters to handle the model\u2019s running time:", "I now visualise the variable importance with h2o.varimp_plot, which returns a plot with the ranked contribution of each variable, normalised to a scale between 0 and 1.", "The model_summary function grants access to information about the models parameters.", "Here we can see that the random forest only uses 26 out of a maximum of 500 trees that it was allowed to estimate (I set this with the ntrees parameter). We can also gauge that the tree depth ranges from 7 to 14 (not a particularly deep forest) and that the number of leaves per tree ranges from 12 to 45.", "Last but not least, I can review the model\u2019s performance with h2o.performance", "The model achieves a high R^2 of 97.4%, which means that the variation in the feature variables explains almost all the variability of the response variable.", "On the other hand, RMSE appears to be quite large! High values of RMSE can be due to the presence of small number of high error predictions (like in the case of outliers), and this should not surprise given the choppy nature of the response variable.", "When it comes to error based metric like RMSE, MAE, MSE, etc., there is no absolute value of good or bad as they are expressed in the unit of Response Variable. Usually, you want to achieve a smaller RMSE as this translates into a higher predictive power but for this project, I will simply use this metric to compare the relative performance of the different model.", "Let\u2019s generalise the performance assessment in a programmatic way to compute, assess and compare multiple models in one go.", "First, I fit a few more models and make sure I\u2019m enabling cross-validation for all of them. Note that for the GBM I specify the same parameters I used for the random forest but there is an extensive array of parameters that you can use to control several aspects of the model's estimation (I will not touch on these as it's outside the scope of this project)", "I\u2019m also running the very handy automl function that enables for multiple models to be fitted and grid-search optimised. Like I did for the other models, I can specify a series of parameters to guide the function, like several stopping metrics, and max_runtime_secs to save on computing time.", "Checking the leader board will show the fitted models", "As you can see the top model is a Gradient Boosting Machine model. There are also a couple of Deep Learning models and a stacked ensemble, H2O take on the Super Learner.", "First, I save all models in one folder so that I can access them and process performance metrics programmatically through a series of functions", "Let\u2019s start with the variable importance plots. Earlier on I used plotting functionality with the random forest model but now I want to plot them all in one go so that I can compare and contrast the results.", "There are many libraries (like IML, PDP, VIP, and DALEX to name the more popular ones) that help with Machine Learning model interpretability, feature explanation and general performance assessment. In this project I am using the vip package.", "One of the main advantages of these libraries is their compatibility with other R packages such as gridExtra.", "Seasonality and previous revenue levels ( lags) come through at the top 3 stronger drives in almost all models (the only exception being GBM). Conversely, none of the models find trend and its squared counterpart to be a strong explainer of variation in the response variable.", "However, to assess and compare the models' performance I am going to focus on RMSE and R^2^.", "All performance metrics can be pulled at once using the h20.metric function, which for some reason does not seem to work with H2ORegressionMetrics objects.", "Also, the error message is not particularly helpful in this case as the \u201cmetric\u201d argument is optional and should return all metrics by default. The issue seems to have to do with performing a regression as it actually works fine with H2OClassificationMetrics objects.", "Luckily, provides some useful helper functions to extract the single metrics individually, which work all right!", "So I will be using these individual helpers to write a little function that runs predictions for all models on the test data and returns a handy tibble to house all the performance metrics.", "Now I can pass this formula to a map function from the purrr package to iterate calculations and compile RMSE and R^2^ across all models. To correctly identify each model, I also make sure to extract the model's name from the path.", "All tree-based models achieve very high R^2, with the autoML model (which is a GBM, remember?) reaching a staggering 99.3% and achieves the lowest RMSE. The GLM on the other hand scores a negative R^2.", "A negarive R\u00b2 is not unheard of: the R\u00b2 compares the fit of a model with that of a horizontal straight line and calculates the proportion of the variance explained by the model compared to that of a straight line (the null hypothesis). If the fit is actually worse than just fitting a horizontal line then R-square can be negative.", "Last but not least, to provide an additional and more visual display of the models\u2019 performance, I\u2019m going to plot the actual versus predicted for all models.", "I\u2019m using a function similar to the one I\u2019ve used to calculate the performance metrics as the basic principle is the same.", "As I did before, I pass the formula to a map function to iterate calculations and compile prediction using the test data subset across all models.", "However, the resulting validation_tmp is a nested tibble, with the predictions stored as lists in each cell.", "This requires a couple of additional manipulations to get in in a shape that can be used for plotting: unnesting the list, \u201cpivot\u201d the predictions around the order_date and add the revenue as actual.", "Now, I\u2019m going to write this plotting function directly in plotly", "With the exception of the GLM model, which is producing a seemingly flat line prediction (remember the negative R\u00b2?), all models are capturing well the peaks and troughs in the series. The prediction only starts to miss the full extent of the response variation around the last 2 spikes.", "No need to write any new functions as the performance_metrics_fct and predict_fct can also be used for the forecasting.", "First, I take a look at the performance metrics", "Interestingly, a little swap in the top position, with the \u201cmanual\u201d GBM performing better in the forecast that the autoML model. The performance metrics worsened for all models when compared to the validation metrics.", "Aside from the GLM which unsurprisingly produces a flat line forecast, all models continue to capture well the 2-week-on, 2-week-off purchase pattern. Additionally, all models forecasts fail to capture the full extent of the response variable movements for all 3 spikes, suggesting that there could be another dynamic at play in 2007 that the current predictors are not controlling for.", "One final thing: don\u2019t forget to shut-down the H2O instance when you're done!", "In this project, I have gone through the various steps needed to build a time series machine learning pipeline and generate a weekly revenue forecast.", "In particular, I have carried out a more \u201ctraditional\u201d exploratory time series analysis with TSstudio and created a number of predictors using the insight I gathered. I've then trained and validated an array of machine learning models with the open source library H2O, and compared the models' accuracy using performance metrics and actual vs predicted plots.", "This is just a first stab at producing a weekly revenue forecast and there clearly is plenty of room for improvement. Still, once you have a modelling and forecasting pipeline like this in place, it becomes much easier and faster to create and test several models and different predictors sets.", "The fact that the data series is artificially generated is not ideal as it does not necessarily incorporate dynamics that you would encounter in a real-life dataset. Nonetheless, that challenged me to get inventive and made the whole exercise that more enjoyable.", "Forecasting total revenue may not be the best strategy and perhaps breaking down the response variable by product line or by country for instance, may lead to improved and more accurate forecasts. This is behond the scope of this project but could well be the subject for a future project!", "One thing I take away from this exercise is that H2O is absolutely brilliant! It's fast, intuitive to set up and has a broad array of customisation options. AutoML is superb, has support with R, Python and Java and the fact that anyone can use it free of charge gives the likes of Google AutoML and AWS SageMaker AutoML platform a run for their money!", "The full R code can be found on my GitHub profile", "Your home for data science.
