See our Reader Terms for details.", "AI in banking is a big boon and often a major bane.", "The tradeoffs are huge, but the challenges of implementing a single simple solution often stave off the banks away from innovations. As we mentioned in the first part of this series, a lot of AI pilots fail either at test or deployment stages.", "The reason? Lack of a strong technological base, paired with a clear technical roadmap for sequentially upgrading all key elements of your systems and only then augmenting them with AI.", "As we discussed in the previous part, decoupling and modernizing the core banking legacy systems is the first imperative to put on your roadmap.", "The next step on your agenda are frontend transformations.", "AI is often dangled as a cure to inefficient processes. Companies might say Let\u2019s send RPA to handle invoicing, or Why can\u2019t an ML algorithm do all the reporting for the customers?", "Yet far fewer financial leaders tend to ask this question: Does this particular process even need AI augmentation?", "Because let\u2019s face it: a lot of front-office banking processes are somewhat obsolete. Do you need to collect a ton of paper documents in the branch for your customer\u2019s mortgage application? No. Norway\u2019s Banking ID experience says that you can go fully paperless and reduce the application process to one day (from 16 days) by merely issuing your customers digital IDs (with no AI in sight).", "Does it make sense to add an AI-driven voice concierge to your mobile banking app when it still offers a poor digital account opening experience for your customers? Nope. It won\u2019t make that much of a difference.", "// To gain the most impact from AI adoption, legacy financial processes need to be reconfigured. If they aren\u2019t, ROI will remain elusive. //", "And that\u2019s why transforming frontend processes is the second core element in the formula.", "Okay, so how can I go about reconfiguring the old to pave way for the new?", "The last point is especially important, as the banking industry has a ton of broken processes that FinTechs jumped to fix early on: daunting account opening processes, card ordering complications, a lack of affordable lending, lengthy credit card approvals, and more.", "Based on this data, it\u2019s easy to assume that merely adding some AI algorithm won\u2019t help HSBC miraculously get on top of the list. Their digital banking front office needs a much more serious lift.", "So if you\u2019re feeling that you\u2019ve been left behind by the competition, try the following approach to digital banking front-office transformations: think layers, not individual processes or solutions.", "We\u2019ve finally arrived at the part we\u2019ve been preparing for \u2014 implementing AI in banking!", "As the previous sections illustrated, getting AI-ready is a long road with at least two major pitstops: transforming legacy systems and adapting front-office processes.", "Remember: According to Accenture, only 16% of executives manage to scale AI projects. As Accenture\u2019s data further notes, most get stuck with the same AI adoption difficulties I described at the beginning of this post.", "At the same time, those who have managed to push past the initial pilot stage towards strategic scaling are finally seeing the promised dividends:", "Strategic Scalers achieved nearly triple the return from AI investments than companies in the Proof of Concept stage of their AI journey. Accenture", "When it comes to the banking sector in particular, scaling the following types of AI initiatives brings the highest returns:", "Mobile data and machine learning are proving to be a powerful combination for engaging credit-thin consumers \u2014 the unbanked, underbanked, and first-time lenders who are currently abandoned by traditional financial institutions (but not so much by FinTechs).", "Instant and affordable consumer lending powered by the ABCD tech stack \u2014 AI, blockchain, cloud, and data \u2014 has helped three fully digital Chinese banks (operating as super apps) process over 10 million loan applications per year and maintain a non-performing ratio of 1% on average.", "Lending based on alternative data sources is now catching up across Europe, Southeast Asia, and even the US, where FICO just released a new service that allows consumers to submit extra data to increase their credit scores.", "Banks are at risk of losing the consumer and SMB lending race if they don\u2019t act upon it in the short term.", "Move on chatbots, the future is voice-guided intelligent financial advisors that can offer concierge services both to customers and teams. AI-based intelligent advisors may be able to:", "Last year, 12% of consumers used voice functionality to pay bills and 10% used it to transfer money to another person.", "Considering that voice payments are gaining traction in 2020, it\u2019s safe to assume that voice usage in banking will climb further too.", "A new generation of personal finance management applications powered by AI can add fun into budgeting (fudgeting, anyone?).", "Rather than nudging users to stop wasting money on avocado toast, AI models can be configured to teach users about conscious spending and churn out personalized advice for:", "In fact, early trends suggest that in 5 to 10 years, the personal finance space could go fully autonomous.", "For banks, hopping on this financial literacy bandwagon can lead to lower account switching rates and higher customer lifetime value.", "According to Emerji, risk monitoring is one of the most in-demand AI capabilities in banking, already constituting as much as 26.9% of vendor\u2019s product offering capabilities. In particular, banks are looking at adopting intelligent models for predicting investment risks and prescribing a better course of action for various trading decisions.", "For instance, Kensho leverages a mix of historical and real-time market data along with natural language processing capabilities and visual image recognition to collect comprehensive market data and churn out highly accurate predictions on stock performance.", "Machine learning models can also be configured to guard your customers\u2019 assets. ML is more effective at fraud monitoring than human teams (or traditional rule-based engines programmed by said humans) because machine learning algorithms:", "ML models can provide predictive and prescriptive investment advice both to your customers and your advisors based on the data stashed in your data lake. For instance, Credit Karma collects over 2,600 different data attributes per user, and their AI model assesses some 8 billion predictions about the next best action for each customer.", "Beyond robo-advising, proven AI use cases in the wealth management space include:", "I could go on and on about other AI use cases, but the line needs to be drawn somewhere. Specifically, we should consider the line that separates a successful early pilot from a scaled AI deployment. The longer you linger to undertake legacy transformations, the further away that line will lie, as it will be pushed even further by more agile competitors.", "Yes, committing to deploying AI is tough within a fast-moving ecosystem of new technologies, customer preferences, and changing market demands.", "But you don\u2019t have to go head-first into AI adoption. Instead, build up your upper (legacy) and lower (frontend) body strength and then set an intelligent (AI) head on top.", "Your home for data science.
