The information presented in this article is simply a high-level overview; each of the terms has resources that are provided for those who seek to gain more in-depth knowledge.", "This is a computer vision technique that is used to generate an image keypoint descriptor (feature vector). The generated descriptor contains information on features such as edges, corners and blobs. The descriptor can be used to detect objects across images of different scales and distortion. SIFT is utilized in applications such as object recognition, gesture recognition, and tracking. Here is a link to the original research paper that introduced the technique. The key thing about SIFT is that its detected features are invariant to any affine transformation such as scaling, translation and rotation.", "This is a technique used to extract features from an image. The extracted features are derived from the information provided through the edges and corners within the image, more specifically, objects within the image. A simple description of the techniques is that it identifies the location of edges(gradients), corners and lines within an image and also, obtain information in regards to the orientation of the edges. The HOG descriptor generates a histogram that contains information on the distribution of the edge and orientation information detected from an image. This technique can be found in computer vision applications and within image processing as well. Here\u2019s a link with some more information.", "Principal Component Analysis(PCA): An algorithm to reduce the dimensions of feature-rich datasets. Reduction of dimension is achieved by projecting data points from a higher dimension to a lower plane, but still maintaining information and minimizing information loss.", "Neural Style Transfer (NST): A technique that involves the utilization of deep convolutional neural network and algorithms to extract the content information from an image and the style information from another reference image. After the extraction of style and content, a combination image is generated where the content and style of the resulting image is sourced from different images.", "Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) and LSTM: A variant of artificial neural network architecture that has the ability to accept as input with arbitrary sizes and produces output data with arbitrary sizes. RNN neural network architectures learn temporal relationships. RNNs are utilized in applications such as speech recognition, image captioning and natural language processing.", "Here\u2019s an excellent video by Luis Serrano explaining the basics of RNNs:", "Face Detection: A term given to the task of implementing systems that can automatically recognize and localize human faces in images and videos. Face detection is present in applications associated with facial recognition, photography, and motion capture.", "Pose Estimation: The process of deducing the location of the main joints of a body from provided digital assets such as images, videos, or a sequence of images. Forms of pose estimation are present in applications such as Action recognition, Human interactions, creation of assets for virtual reality and 3D graphics games, robotics and more.", "Object Recognition: The process of identifying the class a target object is associated with. Object recognition and detection are techniques with similar results and implementation approaches, although the recognition process comes before the detection steps in various systems and algorithms.", "Tracking: A method of identifying, detecting, and following an object of interest within a sequence of images over some time. Applications of tracking within systems are found in many surveillance cameras and traffic monitoring devices.", "Object Detection: Object detection is associated with Computer Vision and describes a system that can identify the presence and location of a desired object or body within an image. Do note that there can be singular or multiple occurrences of the object to be detected.", "Optimization algorithm: An algorithm that is executed a predefined number of times and is used to find optimal solutions to problems; in mathematical terms, these \u2018problems\u2019 are referred to as functions.", "Gradient Descent: This optimization algorithm is recruited to find values that reduce the cost function. This is done through the calculation of a gradient value, that is utilized to select values at each step that finds the local minimum of a cost function. The negative of the gradient is used to find the local minimum.", "Cost function: This is a method that quantifies \u2018how well\u2019 a machine learning model performs. The quantification is an output(cost) based on a set of inputs, which are referred to as parameter values. The parameter values are used to estimate a prediction, and the \u2018cost\u2019 is the difference between the prediction and the actual values.", "Global Minimum: This is the smallest parameter values that lie within the entire domain of a cost function.
