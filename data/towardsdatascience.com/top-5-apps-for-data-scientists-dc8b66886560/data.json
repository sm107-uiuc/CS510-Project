How we use that computing power depends on us. I am very reserved when it comes to trying new productivity apps because the effect is usually quite the opposite as it should be. I\u2019ve been on the brink of using no apps on my phone besides phone and messages. I even blocked the web browser. Then I started reading productivity guides and to my surprise, I found these apps that I find actually useful.", "Instead of wasting time on Facebook and Instagram, try to develop muscle memory and open Anki instead.", "Here are a few links that might interest you:", "Some of the links above are affiliate links and if you go through them to make a purchase I\u2019ll earn a commission. Keep in mind that I link courses because of their quality and not because of the commission I receive from your purchases.", "I write flashcards and use Anki to review them regularly. Anki is a program that uses spaced repetition, which makes remembering things easy. Spaced repetition is a learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect [1].", "Anki is a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn. Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless.", "I create flashcards about the concepts I find difficult to remember. For example, an explanation of regularization which I find very intuitive. When I need to explain the concept to someone, I don\u2019t need to think about analogies as I already have them in my mind.", "The downside of Anki is that you need to find a way to organize flashcards that suits you. There is no one pattern that fits all. It can also get quickly cluttered with too many flashcards. So I use it only for the most important and hard to remember concepts.", "When I am not listening to Joe Rogan or Tim Ferris podcasts, I like to tune in to:", "Podcast hosts explain complex ideas in a simple way because no one would understand them otherwise \ud83d\ude42 When there is an interesting idea presented that I don\u2019t know much about, I take note and google it later.", "You cannot go without ebooks in 2020. I use Kindle when reading ebooks and I love its highlighting feature. Whereas Kindle got it right with highlights, it has a terrible user experience for reviewing them. Luckily, there is a free online service clippings.io, which enables the import of the highlights. It has a friendly user interface and many more features besides that. On my phone, I access it from my mobile browser.", "Reddit is a network of communities based on people\u2019s interests.", "Reddit needs no introduction. While there are many communities where you can have a constructive conversation, it can also be a two-edged sword. By following time-wasting communities you won\u2019t get a lot out of it.", "The communities that I am actively collaborating are:", "No great breakthrough in the field won\u2019t pass by without being mentioned and discussed in these communities.", "These days we are overloaded with information. Whenever I visit HackerNews or DataTau, I find many interesting articles that I would/should like to read, but there\u2019s no time. Pocket comes to the rescue! Pocket is an app and browser extensions that enables to store articles and view them later.", "Each phone comes with a preinstalled notes app. There are more powerful apps on the market, like Evernote or OneNote, but they are too bloated with unnecessary features for me. I find Apple\u2019s Notes app really useful, when having a spontaneous idea, thought about something that I should research, I simply take a note.", "I find more and more great content on Medium. From well-written tutorials (sometimes even better than the documentation) to simplified explanations that offer a great starting point to dive deeper.", "Follow me on Twitter, where I regularly tweet about Data Science and Machine Learning.", "Your home for data science.
