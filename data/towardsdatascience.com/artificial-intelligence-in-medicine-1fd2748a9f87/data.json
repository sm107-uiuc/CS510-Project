This post summarizes the top 4 applications of AI in medicine today:", "Correctly diagnosing diseases takes years of medical training. Even then, diagnostics is often an arduous, time-consuming process. In many fields, the demand for experts far exceeds the available supply. This puts doctors under strain and often delays life-saving patient diagnostics.", "Machine Learning \u2014 particularly Deep Learning algorithms \u2014 have recently made huge advances in automatically diagnosing diseases, making diagnostics cheaper and more accessible.", "Machine Learning algorithms can learn to see patterns similarly to the way doctors see them. A key difference is that algorithms need a lot of concrete examples \u2014 many thousands \u2014 in order to learn. And these examples need to be neatly digitized \u2014 machines can\u2019t read between the lines in textbooks.", "So Machine Learning is particularly helpful in areas where the diagnostic information a doctor examines is already digitized.", "Since there is plenty of good data available in these cases, algorithms are becoming just as good at diagnostics as the experts. The difference is: the algorithm can draw conclusions in a fraction of a second, and it can be reproduced inexpensively all over the world. Soon everyone, everywhere could have access to the same quality of top expert in radiology diagnostics, and for a low price.", "The application of Machine Learning in diagnostics is just beginning \u2014 more ambitious systems involve the combination of multiple data sources (CT, MRI, genomics and proteomics, patient data, and even handwritten files) in assessing a disease or its progression.", "It\u2019s unlikely that AI will replace doctors outright. Instead, AI systems will be used to highlight potentially malignant lesions or dangerous cardiac patterns for the expert \u2014 allowing the doctor to focus on the interpretation of those signals.", "Developing drugs is a notoriously expensive process. Many of the analytical processes involved in drug development can be made more efficient with Machine Learning. This has the potential to shave off years of work and hundreds of millions in investments.", "AI has already been used successfully in all of the 4 the main stages in drug development:", "The first step in drug development is understanding the biological origin of a disease (pathways) as well as its resistance mechanisms. Then you have to identify good targets (typically proteins) for treating the disease. The widespread availability of high-throughput techniques, such as short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening and deep sequencing, has greatly increased the amount of data available for discovering viable target pathways. However, with traditional techniques, it\u2019s still a challenge to integrate the high number and variety of data sources \u2014 and then find the relevant patterns.", "Machine Learning algorithms can more easily analyse all the available data and can even learn to automatically identify good target proteins.", "Next, you need to find a compound that can interact with the identified target molecule in the desired way. This involves screening a large number \u2014 often many thousands or even millions \u2014 of potential compounds for their effect on the target (affinity), not to mention their off-target side-effects (toxicity). These compounds could be natural, synthetic, or bioengineered.", "However, current software is often inaccurate and produces a lot of bad suggestions (false positives) \u2014 so it takes a very long time to narrow it down to the best drug candidates (known as leads).", "Machine Learning algorithms can also help here: They can learn to predict the suitability of a molecule based on structural fingerprints and molecular descriptors. Then they blaze through millions of potential molecules and filter them all down to the best options \u2014 those that also have minimal side effects. This ends up saving a lot of time in drug design.", "It\u2019s hard to find suitable candidates for clinical trials. If you choose the wrong candidates, it will prolong the trial \u2014 costing a lot of time and resources.", "Machine Learning can speed up the design of clinical trials by automatically identifying suitable candidates as well as ensuring the correct distribution for groups of trial participants. Algorithms can help identify patterns that separate good candidates from bad. They can also serve as an early warning system for a clinical trial that is not producing conclusive results \u2014 allowing the researchers to intervene earlier, and potentially saving the development of the drug.", "You can only treat patients for a disease once you\u2019re sure of your diagnosis. Some methods are very expensive and involve complicated lab equipment as well as expert knowledge \u2014 such as whole genome sequencing.", "Biomarkers are molecules found in bodily fluids (typically human blood) that provide absolute certainty as to whether or not a patient has a disease. They make the process of diagnosing a disease secure and cheap.", "You can also use them to pinpoint the progression of the disease \u2014 making it easier for doctors to choose the correct treatment and monitor whether the drug is working.", "But discovering suitable Biomarkers for a particular disease is hard. It\u2019s another expensive, time-consuming process that involves screening tens of thousands of potential molecule candidates.", "AI can automate a large portion of the manual work and speed up the process. The algorithms classify molecules into good and bad candidates \u2014 which helps clinicians focus on analysing the best prospects.", "Biomarkers can be used to identify:", "Different patients respond to drugs and treatment schedules differently. So personalized treatment has enormous potential to increase patients\u2019 lifespans. But it\u2019s very hard to identify which factors should affect the choice of treatment.", "Machine Learning can automate this complicated statistical work \u2014 and help discover which characteristics indicate that a patient will have a particular response to a particular treatment. So the algorithm can predict a patient\u2019s probable response to a particular treatment.", "The system learns this by cross-referencing similar patients and comparing their treatments and outcomes. The resulting outcome predictions make it much easier for doctors to design the right treatment plan.", "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), specifically the CRISPR-Cas9 system for gene editing, is a big leap forward in our ability to edit DNA cost effectively \u2014 and precisely, like a surgeon.", "This technique relies on short guide RNAs (sgRNA) to target and edit a specific location on the DNA. But the guide RNA can fit multiple DNA locations \u2014 and that can lead to unintended side effects (off-target effects). The careful selection of guide RNA with the least dangerous side effects is a major bottleneck in the application of the CRISPR system.", "Machine Learning models have been proven to produce the best results when it comes to predicting the degree of both guide-target interactions and off-target effects for a given sgRNA. This can significantly speed up the development of guide RNA for every region of human DNA.", "AI is already helping us more efficiently diagnose diseases, develop drugs, personalize treatments, and even edit genes.", "But this is just the beginning. The more we digitize and unify our medical data, the more we can use AI to help us find valuable patterns \u2014 patterns we can use to make accurate, cost-effective decisions in complex analytical processes.", "AuthorI\u2019m the CEO at Data Revenue, a machine learning consultancy in Berlin.
