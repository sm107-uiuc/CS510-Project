Suppose that one built a sentiment analysis model in 2019 in order to gauge sentiment on travel. Data might have been collated from a variety of social networks, e.g. Twitter, Reddit, etc.", "Chances are \u2014 sentiment on travel might have still been quite positive \u2014 notwithstanding a degree of concern due to the impacts of travel on climate change.", "However, 2020 is a vastly different landscape for travel (or lack thereof), with air passenger numbers having plummeted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "As a result, any sentiment model that would have been trained on 2019 data would likely perform quite poorly if run today. Travel restrictions, virus fears, and economic concerns are likely to have been under-represented in any corpus that would have been used to train a text classification model to gauge travel sentiment. Moreover, the term \u201cCOVID-19\u201d did not exist before this year, and a text classification model would not know to assign a negative sentiment to this term in the context of travel.", "Text classification and sentiment analysis techniques are quite a recent innovation.", "As such, there has not been much scope to formulate a time series tracking sentiment over a long period, i.e. years. However, with NLP techniques now becoming more widespread \u2014such techniques may well become increasingly widespread from here.", "Going back to the travel example, suppose that we have a training set collated over time containing sentences ranked by date which expresses a particular sentiment on travel. As just two examples:", "Now, suppose that a sentiment score was calculated on a weekly basis by summing up all individual scores for each week. The below time series is merely hypothetical, but for all intents and purposes let us assume that travel sentiment from the beginning of 2019 up until now looks something like this:", "In this hypothetical example, sentiment is broadly positive before the onset of COVID-19, albeit with the inevitable \u201cswings and valleys\u201d that tend to accompany a time series.", "Post-COVID, travel sentiment may well be more volatile than before, as illustrated in the above graph. There are those who will swear off any sort of travelling until the pandemic is fully under control, while there are those who will choose to travel as soon as any restrictions are lifted.", "In a real-world scenario, the training data used for a sentiment model would need to be continuously updated \u2014 in order to ensure that sentiment is being gauged accurately across all the separate text entries.", "However, formulation of a time series of sentiment data would not only allow for tracking of such sentiment over time \u2014 but could also be used with time series modelling techniques to forecast future sentiment in the same manner as forecasting a regular time series. This could be done with traditional time series techniques such as ARIMA, or machine-learning based techniques such as LSTM, CNN, etc.", "In the context of travel \u2014 given enough sentiment data \u2014 it may be possible to forecast sentiment trends to determine when an uptick in travel sentiment can be expected. This would not necessarily be foolproof as this particular example is more reliant on the outcome of COVID-19 as opposed to extrapolating from past trends, but could well be a useful form of analysis.", "In fact, given that NLP is quite a new area of research, questions still remain as to whether sentiment analysis could potentially serve as a leading indicator in certain time series domains.", "For instance, suppose that at a certain point in time, abnormally negative sentiment is detected across social media posts for the stock market. Depending on what happens with the price of a major stock index (e.g. the S&P 500), one could use time series to validate the role of sentiment in stock price fluctuations.", "Did the stock price fall at the exact moment negative sentiment was expressed \u2014 or was there a lag of an hour or so? On the other hand, did markets adjust before any negative sentiment was expressed across social media?", "Combining time series analysis and NLP to answer these questions could yield big insights in determining the role that sentiment analysis plays in the financial markets.", "As a time series specialist, my view is that NLP is a great form of analysis \u2014 but its potential could be fully unlocked when combined with time series techniques.", "In order to fully understand the role that sentiment analysis affects certain business domains, one must also have an understanding of how sentiment shifts over time and the catalysts that underpin this.", "Up till now, NLP has been quite new and this area hasn\u2019t been explored to its full potential. However, I am of the opinion that when used correctly \u2014 NLP and time series analysis could prove a killer combination moving forward.", "Many thanks for reading, and you can also find more of my data science content at michael-grogan.com.", "Disclaimer: This article is written on an \u201cas is\u201d basis and without warranty.
