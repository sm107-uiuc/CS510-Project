This means that we are interested in measuring the differences of the probability of recovery between the cases A=treated vs A=untreated.", "In data science and machine learning we are used to work with conditional probabilities, which may seem useful for this purpose. However, we will see with a simple example that conditioning is not enough.", "Conditioning on a value X=x means that, among all the possible values that X takes, we select the particular sample of value x. For example, If we had data", "selecting on X=1 would lead to", "Imagine the following situation. We go to a drugstore because we\u2019ve got a cold. They have two different drugs: Drug 1 and Drug 2. Drug 1 is more popular, so we ask for it first: 50% of the time they have it, so we take it and we recover. On the other 50% of the cases, 90% of the time they have a more expensive Drug 2 and we buy it and recover too. But in the remaining 10%, they\u2019ve run out of both, so we keep our cold.", "What if the laboratory stops manufacturing Drug 2? What is our probability of recovery? The answer seems clear: 50% of cases we will not recover.", "Let\u2019s see what happens if we try to answer this question with direct conditional probabilities. If we gather the previous information, we get the Drugstore selling table.", "Now, what is the probability of being cured when there is no Drug 2? For this, we need to select the sample corresponding to Drug 2 = No", "and calculate the probability of recovering", "Which is a totally different result!", "We can model the data generation process using a causal graph.", "This graph reflects our observational data. Buying Drug 2 depends on whether Drug 1 was previously bought, and Recovery depends on which drugs have been bought. The data generated by this process is obtained in the Drugstore selling table above.", "However, our question regarding the lack of Drug 2, regards to a different data generation process. One in which Drug 2 does not depend on Drug 1 anymore because Drug 2 is always missing.", "This graph is called interventional graph which models what would happen if there never was Drug 2. If we could sample data from this graph, we would obtain the Interventional data table", "and we could directly calculate under the new probabilistic distribution P_intervened", "which is the expected result. Why direct conditional probabilities didn\u2019t do the job? Because they answer questions about data generated by the Data generation graph. In some cases is ok, but in this case, it is not enough.", "This toy exercise is a simple example to understand the problems attached to this type of analysis in a general situation. Here we know how data is generated (because we did it). However, obtaining the interventional data table would not be so straightforward. The simple solution would be, go to reality, remove Drug 2 for some time and measure how many people recover. Of course, in many situations, this would have large unwanted consequences.", "One of the main questions of causal inference is whether we can derive data from the interventional graph only from gathered observational data without having to go to reality and making an experiment. Meaning, can we get the probability of Recovery in the interventional graph with historical data only? In the following post, we will explain how to obtain such result with the classical Simpson\u2019s Paradox.", "Your home for data science.
