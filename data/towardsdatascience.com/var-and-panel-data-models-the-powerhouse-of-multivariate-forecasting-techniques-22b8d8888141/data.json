And your client is a big grocery chain asking you to predict it\u2019s sales quantity for the next 30 days.", "Now, what information will you be looking for to deliver the forecast?", "Past sales data of course. Let\u2019s say you were given their past 2 years of sales data. So your forecasting model becomes something like this:", "Now think about how confidently you can say that you\u2019ll make a good, reasonable forecast using just this single historical dataset?", "That\u2019s of course not how it works in the real world. In real-world forecasting historical sales is just one piece of information, but you\u2019ll also be looking for store locations, state holidays, any special events, ad spending or promotional activities etc \u2014 in fact, every bit of information that affects sales.", "Each piece of this information essentially becomes a variable in your forecasting model:", "future sales = f(past sales, special events, holidays, promotion\u2026\u2026)", "That is indeed where the power of multivariate forecasting comes from. The real world is interconnected and the outcome of a process is usually the result of multiple inputs and actions. So no wonder why data scientists will be looking for every piece of information relevant for building predictive models.", "In this article I\u2019ll be talking about two powerful multi-variate time series forecasting models \u2014 Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Panel Data Models\u2014 and demonstrate their applications with code snippets in two different programming languages \u2014 Python and R.", "Before defining Vector Autoregression let\u2019s understand what\u2019s auto-regression. As the name suggests, it\u2019s a regression of a variable on itself, on its past values \u2014 as I just wrote in the introduction. In this case, independent variables are the past values of the same univariate data series that\u2019s being predicted.", "Vector Autoregression generalizes this univariate concept and allows for the inclusion of additional correlated variables in the model. In this case, each variable is forecasted using its own past (lag) as well as the lag values of exogenous factors.", "In univariate forecasting techniques, future values are predicted as a function of past values. So, if you want to predict the population of a city in the year 2021 you take a simple univariate forecasting approach:", "But if you want to make a forecast over a longer time horizon (let\u2019s say population in 2050), we know that there are many other factors needed to be considered \u2014 birth rate, mortality, education, income, and so on. These factors are called exogenous factors or covariates. In the short-term, impacts of these exogenous factors are not so much, so we can ignore them, but in the long term their impacts compound and make a measurable difference.", "VAR is such a kind of multivariate forecasting model that incorporates exogenous variables in the modeling process. In this process, the dependent variable is forecasted using its own past (lag) values as well as the lag values of exogenous factors.", "To demonstrate how it works, I\u2019m using a US macroeconomic dataset comprising of 14 different variables. It\u2019s a quarterly dataset from 1959 all the way to 2009. For this demonstration purpose, however, I\u2019m using just two variables: Gross Domestic Product (realgdp) and personal consumption expenditure (realcons). You can access the dataset following the code in the snippet below.", "I am going to use a Python environment to take advantage of its very rich statsmodels library, a source of great options for VAR implementation with a lot of flexibility. The dataset for the demo is also coming from this API.", "So the goal of this exercise is to make a 5 time-steps ahead prediction of realgdp and realcons into the future.", "If you haven\u2019t heard about panel data before you are not alone. But I\u2019m sure you have seen this kind of data before, you just didn\u2019t know that there\u2019s a name for it. Here\u2019s a formal definition of panel data:", "A panel data is a multi-dimensional data of an observation that is measured repeatedly over time.", "In a nutshell, a panel data is repeated observation of the same objects or individuals. Check out the following imaginary data below which might be more intuitive than reading a definition:", "From a conceptual perspective, panel data works much like a multiple OLS regression, but much more effective than normal OLS. Using the above dataset let\u2019s say you are interested in the following question:", "Does city expenditure increase school enrollments?", "By running an OLS we could quickly check if there is an association between city expenditure and school enrollment and build a model:", "However, the dataset is no ordinary dataframe; it\u2019s a panel data with two additional columns \u2014 city names, year \u2014 that we can also utilize in the model. The following are three different ways to construct the model with a progressive level of sophistication, each time adding additional variable effects.", "I love Python but this is one of the few situations when I look up at R. It has a powerful library called plm that you can use to build panel data models in only a few lines. And it is very intuitive.", "Below I\u2019m creating a demo on Random Effects Model, but you can play with the codes by changing the model type (line 16) from \u201crandom\u201d to \u201cpooling\u201d or \u201cwithing\u201d and few other modeling variations.", "The purpose of this article was to demonstrate the value of two powerful multivariate forecasting techniques \u2014 Vector Autoregressive and Panel Data Models \u2014 in real-world applications. Why multivariate forecasting? Because univariate forecasting has limitations of its own. It\u2019s a simplistic assumption to make that the future is solely dependent on the past.", "The purpose of building models is to recreate and mimic the real world. The real world is complex and interconnected, so this needs to be reflected in our models.", "Your home for data science.
