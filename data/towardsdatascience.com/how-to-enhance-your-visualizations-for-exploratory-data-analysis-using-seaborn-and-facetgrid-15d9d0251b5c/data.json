Amidst the economic and political uncertainty and after witnessing the tragedy that ensued as the original epicenter of the outbreak during the COVID epidemic, 15 NYC Metro Area residents as fledging data scientists made the decision to begin their metamorphosis at the Flatiron School. As the virus continues to rage on throughout the rest of our nation, we have remained online solely knowing and interacting with one another through the Zoom-based learning platform, reminiscent of Hollywood Squares.", "What I have found critical in my success throughout my learning journey have been the step-by-step tutorials that I have found on Medium. Having spent the last decade distilling difficult scientific concepts into something relevant and accessible for premeds and in the spirit of contributing back to the community, I will methodically walk through how to use Seaborn to create some nifty visualizations for your next exploratory data analysis. I do assume a working knowledge of Python and Github.", "For our final project for Phase 2, we were asked to predict housing prices based on the Kaggle King County Housing Prices dataset. In creating any model for prediction, visualizing the data is useful for familiarizing ourselves with the data, detecting potential outliers, deciding on any potential normalizations or transformations, and also feature selection.", "We start off by importing the necessary packages. Pandas is a package in Python for data analysis and manipulation, but especially in creating dataframes, which is the preferred format for importing the data into Seaborn. Matplotlib is the platform on which Seaborn is built, but it also will allow for some additional customizations for our visualizations, so we will need to import both the Seaborn and Matplotlib packages.", "Using the function read_csv(), we read our training dataset (kc_house_data_train.csv) into a dataframe format and stored it in our variable df. I created a new feature variable that represents the age of the property at the time of sale (sale_age) by subtracting the year in which it was built (yr_built ) from the year that it was sold (sale_year), which I extracted from the date column by using a list comprehension and string slicing.", "Here is the repo with the training set I used in this analysis:", "Since our target variable is price, I left that out of the categories. By calling df.head() or df.columns, we can take a look at the category names. I separated the feature variables into two groups, continuous and categorical (or discrete). Some numerical variables could go into either column based on how you look it. For instance, I decided to put the columnsale_age into the continuous category. I then subsetted the dataframe for the desired columns for each category, feat_cat and feat_con. By calling df.columns, I get an Index object which we can use to pass into Seaborn.", "Here are the two subsetted dataframes:", "For a view of the descriptive statistics, we can call df.describe(), where df is feat_con for the below result:", "FacetGrid has a functionality that is similar to using subplots() and axes object, but with less code. It also has the capability of representing a third dimension through the hue parameter to aid in analyzing trends among multiple variables.", "At Flatiron, we constantly hear how Seaborn is better for creating visualizations especially data analysis, but there\u2019s the disconnect between that sentiment and seeing templates for visualizations in the lessons and assignments mostly based in Matplotlib. The impetus for this blog was out of my desire to iterate through the feature variables and display all the histograms, regression plots, etc. without using the whole Matplotlib fig, ax rigaramole. I really wanted to find a more elegant way to quickly display all the feature variables without having to create a for loop.", "Earlier we created indices of the continuous and categorial variables, and now we convert our dataframe from wide-from to long-form by using the functionmelt(). It unpivots all the indices listed in value_vars and creates two columns in this instance, variable and value, the former with the column indices as now values in the variable column and the latter the original values.", "This next line is extraneous in terms of creating the visualization , but in case you wanted to add some customizations, we can call the functionset_theme() with the following parameters:style , font , and context. For each of the visualizations, I used a different style, font family, and context to demonstrate the different options. Here are the options available for the customization parameters:", "I will address the remaining customizations throughout my discussion of the various visualizations.", "FacetGrid takes in our DataFrame in long-form con_1 and passes variable into the col parameter, where the different values within variable (categories for a discrete variable) becomes the independent variable for each of the facets across the row. Since we only have one row in this instance, we can use the parameter col_wrap. Here are some of the parameters we can pass into FacetGrid :", "We use distplot to observe our distribution of data, including outliers, which returns a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) by default, along with the underlying histogram.", "As a point of comparison, I am providing the Matplotlib equivalent for the first example along with the code and resulting visualization below:", "In the code, what has changed is that we need to set price as our identifier variableid_vars, which becomes our dependent variable for our regression plots. By unpivoting our dataframe, we still produce the variable and value columns in addition to our identifier column with the index as the original index value. We also pass in an additional argument into FacetGrid.map() , which represent the x and y values.", "Here is what the dataframe looks like after unpivoting:", "The functionregplot , however, returns a scatterplot along with a linear regression model fit, which help us to decide on what features are better for our prediction models. Having too many features could cause overfitting and produce poorer results in our prediction models.", "For our categorical variables, we will use countplot , regplot, and boxplot in our visualizations. countplot produces histograms, which are technically for continuous variables (which I just learned in researching for this blog) for each value in variable.", "The majority of the code remains the same, but we should take this opportunity to discuss FacetGrid.map() discuss the remainder of the customizations. We can pass into FacetGrid.map() and the parameters we can pass into it. This function allows to pass in a function which we can apply to every facet in FacetGrid. For every facet, we are applying in the above code the function sns.countplot() with the parameters following the function separated by commas. The parameters we can pass into map() is dependent on the function passed to each facet.", "With an additional variable, we could use the parameter hue to set the color palette for visualizing that additional dimension on the 2D plot. I also did not", "Since Seaborn was built on top of Matplotlib, we can always use customizations such as the method set_xtickslabel to reorient the x-tick labels so that they do not pile on top of each other. When they are all oriented horizontally, they inevitably overlap especially in the case of discrete variables with lots of categories.", "What is awesome about regplot is that we can at a quick glance gather information about the correlation of the discrete features to our target variable, housing price. It will help us in deciding what features to keep in our regression models.", "This is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what Seaborn can do for you in visualizing your exploratory data analysis.", "Your assignment is to explore how the different feature variables relate to one another by introducing another variable through the hue parameter in FacetGrid.map(). OK, no assignments, but as I am finding myself in the conundrum of having to \u2018Seabornize\u2019 everything, I would like to display some more great features from my future projects, like withPairgrid() and JointGrid().", "Your home for data science.
