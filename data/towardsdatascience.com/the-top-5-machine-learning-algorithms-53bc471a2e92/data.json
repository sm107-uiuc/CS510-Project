Logistic Regression, K-Means, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost use cases."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://datascience2.medium.com/subscribe", "anchor_text": "https://datascience2.medium.com/subscribe", "paragraph_index": 38}], "all_paragraphs": ["There are several Machine Learning algorithms that can be beneficial to both Data Scientists and of course, Machine Learning Engineers. I have worked at a couple of companies performing a variety of algorithms. In addition to myself, I have seen others in both educational and professional settings use similar algorithms. I am going to list what I think are the top Machine Learning algorithms along with use cases so that you can become aware or reiterate your knowledge of these algorithms. I also want to highlight the business understanding rather than the technology side, as I believe that point is often not as stressed in other articles.", "These Machine Learning algorithms that I will be discussing are somewhat following order of difficulty. Therefore, the most simple, yet still powerful Machine Learning algorithm is logistic regression. Although the name implies regression, it is actually a (supervised) classification algorithm. Most of the time, it is used for predicting binary classes from the logit function. There are also different forms of logistic regression that include multinomial and ordinal target variables. Here are some popular examples that you can expect to encounter in the real-world and not just academic setting. (I have really only used logistic regression for binary classes, so I will not expound upon multiclass or ordinal\u2014 for those situations, I use different algorithms like the ones I will describe next).", "Business use cases for logistic regression:", "This example predicts if a user of a product will or will not churn, meaning, they unsubscribe and drop themselves from the product. Possible features could include if they have low activity on the platform, failed to pay a fee, along with rates of specific lower activity.", "You can be creative and imagine a lot of situations as a 0 or 1, but it is ultimately up to your entire dataset, business use case, and the impact that will determine if this algorithm is right for you and your project. You could try to predict something as random as a house or not house \u2014 using descriptive features to help classify your target variable, but depending on your business, you will learn to find more useful and applicable situations for logistic regression (i.e., financial \u2014 approved or not approved, healthcare \u2014 disease or no disease).", "You can expect to encounter these evaluation metrics with logistic regression:", "Also important is the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve and AUC (area under the curve) along with sensitivity and specificity.", "Documentation that is easy to follow and detailed [3]:", "Whereas logistic regression was a supervised Machine Learning algorithm, k-means is the opposite, which is an unsupervised algorithm. I am specifically referring to the k-means clustering algorithm. In logistic regression, we had a yes or no, or a 0 or 1, spam or not spam, etc. We can also call those target variables labels, as we know what we are trying to predict. Unsupervised clustering is the opposite \u2014 we do not know the label, but we do want to still associate different observations of data with one another in forms of groups \u2014 or really just new classes that have no name yet. The way this algorithm works is by forming k clusters and their respective k centers. Intuitively, I like to think of it as a grouping problem. Say we have some data, and we want to create some groups or clusters. First, we identify our features, and then we run the algorithm that will essentially form groups based on features that closely resemble one another per group and between groups are as different as they can be.", "Here are some examples of k-means clustering:", "You notice that you now have three groups that are distinctly identifiable. The first group are people who stay up past midnight, are under 25 years old, and are usually residing in big cities. The second group are people who go to bed around 11 pm, above 25 years old but less than 50, and reside in small cities. The last group goes to bed at 9 pm, tends to be aged 50+, and lives in rural areas. As you can see, each group is unique compared to other groups, but each group population is similar to others in the same group. This situation is ideal because the marketing campaign impact can be contributed to their distinctiveness. Now let\u2019s work with a product manager, telling them that the groups do not have names yet, but that is not important as we want to find features associated with those groups. However, after running the model, we can still come up with labels now that we have our groups. Let\u2019s label our groups and see the best way to market to them.", "I hope this example is more useful than just saying grouping and explaining k-means mathematically.", "When you are working for a company, you may be surprised to find out leadership does not stress the importance of the code or functions developed and applied, but rather the impact of your Machine Learning algorithm that is now your saved and applied model.", "Documentation that is easy to follow and detailed [5]:", "A slightly more complex algorithm (depending on the person) is the decision trees algorithm. A unique benefit of using this algorithm is that it can work with not only classification, but regression problems as well. Also important to note is that it is supervised as well as non-parametric (meaning that there are no assumptions with probability distributions of the data). They are easier to interpret than most models, and easier to visually describe in terms of how they work behind the scenes (thinking of a tree and how its branches split). Another reason why I like using decision trees is that they can handle both categorical and numeric data, which is often what is needed in real-world applications of Machine Learning algorithms.", "The logic of decision trees can be imagined by making a decision, then more decisions, as the name implies.", "A disadvantage of decision trees is that they can be prone to overfitting or not generalizing well (we can use random forest to avoid overfitting faster, or tune the same decision trees model to avoid overfitting).", "Here is a business use case of decision trees for classification:", "In this example, a realtor would want to know the types of homes for their organization and grouping on their realtor website. The classification labels would be", "The decision trees would work to decide on the information gain of various features of the homes and types of people who tend to buy these homes. For example, a list of decisions and result could possibly be:", "Documentation that is easy to follow and detailed [7]:", "Now we are getting into the top two Machine Learning algorithms. These are some of the most popular and useful algorithms that I have encountered professionally as well as from others. Similar key concepts of decision trees can be applied to random forests \u2014 supervised, classification, and regression. A random forest is what it implies as well, a forest of randomness, but what is random about it? It is the random sample of data for the decision trees that compose a random forest. The ensemble of decision tree results ultimately make the random forest result or prediction, whichever class gets the most votes \u2014 wins. This type of ensembling helps to prevent overfitting that just using a decision trees algorithm would encounter.", "Here are some business use cases for Random Forest:", "Classifying several products for an e-commerce site", "So now that we have a classification algorithm, using a powerful supervised algorithm that works well with multiple classes, we can accurately classify product categories. You can have, say, 20 classes or 20 types of products, but it would take hours to manually classify them, and you could make some easy mistakes. A random forest can become pretty accurate for this use case (of course, depending on the dataset). It can also be much faster than a manual approach.", "Imagine the decision tree example from above, but apply it to each of the classes in this random forest problem. Hopefully, your training data and products are well defined and separated.", "The model could have some trouble if your products are too similar or too broad, perhaps making them one class instead or more classes is an easy fix.", "Also useful is using the predict_proba function to assign scores for each classification suggestion. So we would be, for example, 90% likely to be construction boots from our model.", "Documentation that is easy to follow and detailed [9]:", "Some would argue this Machine Learning algorithm is the best or better than Random Forest. I would agree, but also note that it does depend on the problem at hand as well, sometimes XGBoost can be hard to interpret. It can also be difficult to ingest data, transform, and predict new data. However, it is extremely powerful and leads to accurate results. You can think of XGBoost that utilizes parallel processing (to be extreme) while avoiding overfitting with regularization.", "Classifying different types of email with a several features quickly (for live predictions)", "You will notice in real-world applications of Machine Learning algorithms, some results will need to be outputted once a day, or some, pretty much instantly or in live manner. XGBoost is a beneficial algorithm for this type of problem. Because emails are sent and received quickly, you would need to categorize them quickly. This classification could either be spam or not spam, or it could be different types of emails like promotions, subscriptions, etc.", "Documentation that is easy to follow and detailed [11]:", "Depending on your dataset, business problem, and target variable, will decide which of these top five Machine Learning algorithms you would employ. Think of how fast you need your results, or if it is a one-off task. Do you have a continuous target variable or a class label? Do you even have labels? These are the questions you will need to ask yourself as you pick one of these algorithms. You can also perform similar algorithms to ultimately lower your error metric or increase your accuracy metric.", "The top five Machine Learning algorithms we discussed were:", "Feel free to comment down below to discuss what algorithms you enjoy and employ, or if you have other ones that you use that are more beneficial.", "I hope you enjoyed reading my article and learned something new.
