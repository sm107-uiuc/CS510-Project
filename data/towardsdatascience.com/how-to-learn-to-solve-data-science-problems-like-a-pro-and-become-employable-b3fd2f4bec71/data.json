There are many courses, boot camps, online tutorials, and many more. I have seen many people with data science certifications unable to find a job. The problem is, most of the courses or boot camps don\u2019t teach you the skills required to get a job. The best way to become employable is by getting practical experience. The most effective way to acquire skills that will get you hired is by working on projects.", "The data science teams work on solving many business problems. The approach for each one of them will be very different. Yet, the core skills required to solve a problem don\u2019t change much. The majority of real-life data science problems belong to one of the below categories.", "In this article, I am going to share some problems, approaches to solving them, and reference scripts. To help you learn to solve almost any data science problem. Also, this will help you to acquire the skills that will get you a job.", "Regression problems are often underestimated and not given due importance. Some people even try to learn fancy algorithms without learning the basics. You can get hired if you fail to explain a topic in deep learning. But, if you fail to explain a regression algorithm that\u2019s enough to not hire you.", "In regression problems, a target variable is a continuous number. The value of the target variable depends on the independent variables. This is one of the most common data science problems. The regression problems can be further classified into linear and non-linear.", "A simple example of a linear regression algorithm is predicting the housing price. There are many factors influencing a housing price. All those factors that influence housing prices are independent variables. The housing price attribute is the dependent/target variable. The general approach to solve a linear regression algorithm is,", "Data exploration is key to any data science project. The success of a project depends on the level of understanding of the data. Some of the techniques that helps in better data analysis are,", "After completing a thorough data analysis we move on to data preparation. Often, data preparation and exploration can go on hand in hand. Below are some of the typical data issues that require modifications,", "Finally after analyzing the data for the above issues. We need to use relevant techniques to transform them into a preferred format. The transformation techniques will depend on the algorithm and the data itself.", "It is common for the team to try multiple models. Those that perform better would be finally utilized. Some of the common metrics used for model evaluation in a regression problem are,", "Hyper-parameter tuning and feature selection help in model tuning. Hyperparameter tuning is about trying different ranges of values for the model parameters. Feature selection is about including and excluding different attributes of the dataset.", "Below is a very well-documented script that will show you the implementation of a regression problem. It covers the various stages of a regression problem and its implementation. It also includes different algorithms and their impact on performance.", "Classification problems are another popular category of machine learning algorithms. It is part of supervised learning. The output variable here is categorical. When the output variable takes one of the two possible values then it is a binary classification. For example, Customer churn or Not, Spam email or Not, and so on. When the output variable has more than 2 possible outcomes then it is a multiclass classification.", "The approach to solving a classification problem is very similar to that of the regression problem. The main difference would be in the model evaluations. The techniques and methods commonly used for evaluation in a classification problem are,", "The below reference script can be your template to solve any classification problem. It covers the various stages of solving a classification problem. It starts right from the problem definition, data analysis, data cleaning, model building, evaluation, and techniques to improve the performance.", "The clustering algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm. There is no label for model training. We look for patterns present in the dataset to group them into different clusters.", "Solving a clustering problem is different from solving a supervised learning problem. The steps involved are,", "Like any supervised learning problem, we start with data exploration. The difference is we focus more on the visual analysis. The goal here is to understand if there are any clear clusters.", "The next step is to identify the right set of algorithms. The choice of the algorithm would depend on the problem itself. In most cases, we would create clusters where one item belongs to only one cluster. Sometimes we need to allow items to belong to more than one cluster. In the first case, we use algorithms such as K-Mean and Hierarchical Clustering. For the latter, we use Fuzzy Clustering. Customer profiling is a typical example of fuzzy clustering. It would be normal for customers to exhibit many characteristics. Here it is fair to allow them to be part of multiple clusters with a probability.", "3. The ideal number of clusters", "It is critical to identify the ideal number of clusters. There are techniques and methods to identify the best number of clusters. The technique depends on the algorithm.", "A clustering problem is not considered solved after identifying the clusters. It is not enough to show the business the different clusters. It requires further analysis to prove the clusters are correct. Visual analysis plays a key role here. It is easy to pick insights from visual data.", "To know more about the different clustering algorithms, the steps involved in them, the advantages and drawbacks of each of those algorithms, and to understand the key concepts check the article below.", "To learn from the practical implementation of the clustering algorithm, Check below. This Kaggle notebook explains clearly the various steps involved in K-means clustering algorithms.", "There are many case studies on the recommendation problems. There has been a huge value capitalized from the recommendation systems. They are increasingly adopted across industries. The recommendation systems are usually built using Collaborative filtering and Content-based filtering methods.", "In the case of collaborative filtering, we have user-based or item-based similarities. For example, to produce a recommendation for user \u2018A\u2019. First, we need to find users who are similar to user \u2018A\u2019. Then the items popular among similar users are used in case of user-based recommendations. In an item-based method, all similar items are grouped together. For example, their likelihood of being sold together. When a user purchases one item the other similar items from the group are recommended.", "In the case of content-based filtering, the descriptions about the products and the users are used for recommendations. For example, the details of the products and the interests of the users are matched to produce the best recommendation for the users. Dating platforms are a perfect place for content-based recommendations.", "Recommendation systems are commonly used to", "Below are some facts about how recommendation systems are generating value to the business,", "To learn more about recommendation systems and their implementation. Check below,", "So far we were covering problems where we used structured datasets. Now, We are going to see about extracting value from an unstructured dataset using NLP. Organizations have been extracting values from structured data. The potential of unstructured data is still largely unexplored. A huge amount of unstructured is data getting generated every second. There is so much data on social media platforms and other public domains. There is a lot of value in these unstructured data.", "Over the next few years, a lot of focus will be on extracting values from unstructured data. The popular NLP use-cases can be classified into,", "The below article will provide a simple step-by-step approach for solving most NLP problems.", "The below notebook will show you the implementation of NLP use-cases. It starts with learning more about the structure of the dataset, generating the meta-features, and analyzing for impactful information. Most importantly it is well documented and easy to learn from.", "Computer vision problems are those where we extract information from image and video data. We are simply trying to mimic the human vision and brain. Our brain is trained on the knowledge gained over the years. Similarly in case of computer vision problems we need to train the machines. There are different kinds of computer vision problems. They are,", "The basic principle in all these above problems is identifying the patterns in the data. The advancements in processing power have made computer vision applications accessible to many. There are AutoML solutions that have made the implementation of computer vision use-cases easy. Below is an article about implementing object detection without writing a single line of code using Datature.", "The below notebook is a good one with clear documentation. It will introduce you to computer vision applications using a Convolutional Neural Network.", "The best way to learn data science is by doing. The algorithm covered so far will cover the majority of problems handled by data scientists in their job. The notebooks included are mostly from well-seasoned data scientists. They will help you to learn the best approaches and standards.", "For better understanding try solving a few more similar problems.
