This type of statistic is not unique. The Economist published a study concluding that while 70% of business executives rated analytics as \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d, just 2% said that they had achieved \u201cbroad positive results\u201d.", "The top 3 reported reasons for this difference between expectations and reality are:", "1. Difficulty in defining or framing the problem to be solved.", "2. Difficulty in coming up with a solution approach or design.", "3. Inability to translate the data science insights into actions that truly change the way the business executes.", "To succeed in Data Science, it is important to maintain the chain from data to analysis to insight to action.", "To help businesses bridge the gap from insights to actions, we focus on a mission to help businesses not only succeed, but lead in Data Science and AI.", "These insights are based on working with more than 100 clients across virtually every industry, from finance, to energy, to healthcare, and beyond.", "These clients were at any point on their journey, whether they were establishing a data science practice, building and growing their data science competence, or modernizing and innovating an already mature data science organization. Through this experience, I learned the top 10 essential best practices to succeed in data science.", "Best Practice 1: Start with a quick-win use case to gain business buy-in", "What type of use case leads to a quick-win? Is it when you envision a multi-million dollar opportunity, or when you have terabytes of data where you suspect there are hidden nuggets to discover? It\u2019s neither \u2014 to get quick-win results within 6\u201312 weeks, you need to target use cases with 3 essential characteristics:", "1. A business champion willing to own the success. The champion is essential to validate the business significance of the use case, and to gain buy-in from the broader business and executive level.", "2. Clear KPIs to measure business impact of the results. These are essential to demonstrate the measurable before vs after business impact of your project to business stakeholders.", "3. Available, accessible and clean data. A quick-win must show business results quickly in order to keep the business interested \u2014 if your data has quality or availability issues, you risk turning your quick-win into a data cleansing exercise.", "Best Practice 2: Create an effective Data Science organization and team", "While several Data Science organizational structures are possible, we\u2019ve seen a lot of success with a hub-and-spoke model. Here, the hub consists of a central Data Science Center-of-Excellence (CoE) led by a Chief Data Officer. The spokes are satellite Data Science teams sitting in various business functions, such as marketing, finance, and so forth. In this structure, the central CoE has the freedom to innovate, while working with the spokes to bring new innovations to market for relevant business use cases.", "Effective Data Science teams have cross-functional talent and sponsors. Project owners come not only from the Data Science CoE, but also from the Line-of-Business and IT. One of the biggest mistakes we\u2019ve seen is neglecting IT in the Data Science project ownership \u2014 early IT involvement is key to avoid getting stuck in Proof-of-Concept (POC) limbo. Effective Data Science teams tend to assign squads to projects, with the squad leader being an experienced Data Scientist or Engineer, and the squad members consisting of a mix of data scientists, data engineers, visualization experts, architects, and data science storytellers. If you have a fledgling Data Science organization, outsource as needed to complement your team for maximal impact.", "Best Practice 3: Select the right tools and metrics to match the job", "Plan whether you need tools for coding, or visual modeling, or both \u2014 if your team is just starting out, visual tools might be more appropriate, but if you have senior data scientists, they might prefer working in languages such as Python. Or perhaps your team needs tools that cover both these groups in a single environment. Plan for an infrastructure that will fit your corporate strategy \u2014 for example, whether you need a multi-cloud infrastructure or remain behind a firewall. Plan for the data volume and velocity you\u2019d need to scale to, or the computational power required. Think about the right methodology and algorithms for what you are trying to achieve \u2014 for example, do you need custom algorithms, or will out-of-the-box suffice?", "In terms of metrics, it is important to select the right metrics to tie the data science results to business goals. For example, the performance of predictive algorithms is often measured in terms of the Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE), but depending on the related business goal, a metric of Logarithmic-Root-Mean-Square-Error might achieve better results. For optimization algorithms, on the other hand, metrics are typically business KPIs, like cost or revenue.", "It is important to translate data science metrics into business metrics, and to estimate Return on Investment (ROI). Many data scientists make the mistake of reporting their success to C-level in terms of Data Science metrics. Telling your business stakeholder that your algorithm\u2019s RMSE has improved by 50% is meaningless to that person. Instead, make sure you translate this into a business KPIs such as impact on costs, profit, or customer services levels.", "Best Practice 4: Build a business stakeholder POC dashboard early on", "Building a business stakeholder POC dashboard early is key to gaining business buy-in. To do this, involve the business stakeholders in a Design Thinking workshop to kick off your project. During this session, sketch ideas and brainstorm around what would be meaningful to them in terms of a dashboard resulting from the project. Then, quickly build a POC dashboard \u2014 it doesn\u2019t need to be the most \u201cdesign\u201d or sophisticated dashboard \u2014 even people with limited visualization skills can use existing no-code dashboarding tools for this purpose. In your dashboard, be sure to include visuals on Business ROI, as well as before vs. after scenario analysis.", "Best Practice 5: Communicate widely and frequently", "Establish continued business buy-in via frequent project progress reviews. In these reviews, let your business stakeholder lead the presentation. Avoid presenting code, and instead use your POC dashboard to present the results in business language.", "Alternatively, create shareable stories to educate the wider business on the purpose and vision of your project, in business language. Methods like Scrollytelling work especially well for this.", "Best Practice 6: Use an Agile approach", "To ensure consistent progress, implement an Agile Data Science approach. This means at a minimum breaking your project into 2\u20133 week sprints, with sprint reviews at the end of each sprint cycle to present demos of results achieved, as well as Agile task planning. Invite all stakeholders to the sprint reviews and sprint planning, to reduce uncertainty, manage risks, gain common understanding, and contain the scope of the project.", "Best Practice 7: Plan ahead for flexible infrastructure", "A major reason why Data Science POCs fail to make it to the real world, is that when scale-up is required, the required infrastructure is not available. The POC then gets put on-the-shelf until infrastructure is acquired, which often means indefinitely, or by the time the POC is forgotten. For this reason, be sure to involve IT early on to plan how your POC will scale in production. For example, think of elastic compute capacity, a back-up environment, and a multi-cloud approach for increased flexibility.", "Best Practice 8: Ask operational questions during the POC phase", "During the POC, find answers to operational questions, such as how you will invoke your models (e.g. real-time vs. batch), how often models will need to be tuned, the rate of data ingestion (e.g. streaming vs. a scheduled job), the data volume in production, and the size of hardware required. Also focus on the end-user experience, for example identifying the people who will need to execute recommended actions, the environments they are comfortable working in, and start addressing any change management needs.", "Best Practice 9: Have a plan to operationalize your POC", "Start planning how you will put your POC into production from day 1, and include a plan to production in your final POC sprint review. During POC time, you might be working with a subset of data \u2014 to deploy your POC into the real-world, you need to also think of other data requirements related to, for example governance, volume, and the role of data stewards. During POC time, you might be working with a subset of the required infrastructure. For example, a POC built in a public cloud environment, might need to run in a private cloud in production \u2014 plan for such transitions via flexible environments. During POC phase, the actual work might involve mostly data scientists and data engineers, while putting your POC into operation requires more commitment from developers, business users, and analysts. Bring this extended team into the POC process from the start, to gain their early buy-in.", "Best practice 10: Go beyond insights and predictions, to optimized actions", "Traditional business intelligence tools provide insights into the state of the business, but they will not help you understand what could happen in the future \u2014 for that, your require predictive analytics. In turn, predictive analytics can help you understand what could happen in the future, but it will not help you get recommendations on what to do about that \u2014 for that, you require prescriptive analytics. The secret sauce of Prescriptive Analytics and Decision Optimization (a term that describes mathematical programming and constraint programming methods used for decision-making solutions). It is the only technology capable of considering multiple trade-offs between thousands, if not millions of simultaneous possibilities and business constraints, and able to recommend the next best action or plan into the future.", "To give a simple example illustrating this point, consider decision-making for a utility company to better plan their operations, whether related to energy generation, market dynamics, or their distribution network. Predictive analytics will inform them how much energy they could generate, based on available capacity and weather patterns in the case of renewables. It will not recommend how much energy they should generate \u2014 for that they need decision optimization. Predictive analytics will inform them how prices in the market might evolve, but it will not recommend how much energy they should buy or sell via partners \u2014 that comes from decision optimization. Predictive analytics will inform them how demand for energy might evolve over time, but it will not recommend how they should plan their infrastructure to handle changing demands and uncertainty around climate change \u2014 for that, once again, they need Decision Optimization.", "To truly go from insights, to predictions, to better decisions, explore what Decision Optimization could do for your business.", "Which Best Practices do you apply to get more from your Data Science endeavors?
