There will be tons of money on the line for both fighters, UFC and the fans who are betting as well!", "Update: the fight ended in line with our prediction!Watch this video for the post-fight interviews.", "Instead of random betting, let\u2019s do some data science work to predict the winner.", "The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games. It has been mostly used in chess. But many have applied the same algorithm in other competitive games such as soccer, basketball and scrabble.", "In this article, we will predict the winner of this UFC fight based on Elo ratings using Python.", "Based on the Elo rating system, we need to collect data for all fights related to Conor and Cowboy in the past. I scraped the historical data from sherdog.com.", "The process starts from the page with the fight history of Conor. All the fight information related to him in the past was gathered. Also, for each of his opponents, all the fight information related to them were gathered in a similar manner.", "Given that one of the opponents of Conor (Nate Diaz) fought with Cowboy, this data has included information related to Cowboy too. In the end, we will have data for Conor\u2019s opponents, Cowboy\u2019s opponents, their opponents\u2019 opponents and so on.", "While MMA has been a sport for decades, it would take very long to scrape the entire dataset. Therefore, I stopped the process when the data reached 36,503 fighters and 93,778 fights. This should be enough data for our purpose.", "The data at the end looks like below:", "The details of the Elo algorithm can be found here.", "In short, the algorithm updates the rating of a fighter based on each new match. The simple mathematical formula below describes the procedure:", "The most important parameter to tune is K. It decides how many rating points are added or subtracted after a match. Higher values of K would mean more volatile ratings.", "To show an example, let\u2019s assume two fighters A and B.", "Current Rating of Fighter A = 1500", "Current Rating of Fighter B = 1500", "Assume a new match between them ends with A as the winner. We need to update the ratings of these two fighters accordingly.", "We can see that when K is larger, the ratings of fighters change a lot faster when new information comes in.", "An MMA fight has different endings. A fight can end in one of three ways:", "From the winner\u2019s perspective, a finish is more impressive than a unanimous decision and a unanimous decision is more impressive than a split decision.", "To incorporate this information, we added three multipliers to K with the following relationship:", "Finish Multiplier \u2265 Unanimous Decision Multiplier \u2265 Split Decision Multiplier", "These multipliers help further distinguish between different fighters\u2019 ratings (based on impressiveness of their endings).", "For example, if fighter A beats fighter B with a finish:", "New Rating of Fighter A = Current Rating of Fighter A + Finish Multiplier *K*(1\u2013We)", "New Rating of Fighter B = Current Rating of Fighter B + Finish Multiplier *K*(0\u2013We)", "As a result, fighter A\u2019s rating will rise more than the other two types of endings. And fighter B\u2019s rating will sink more than the other two types of endings.", "First, we set the range of possible values to the parameters as below:", "Different combinations of the three undecided parameters (K, Finish Multiplier, Split Decision Multiplier) were tested using the cross-validation method.", "We found that the best values in terms of prediction accuracy are below:", "*Sports such as baseball, football and chess usually have K ranging from 10 to 30. K = 200 shows that mixed martial arts ratings fluctuate much more than other sports.", "Now that we are done the \u201cboring\u201d part. We can simply insert the values of the parameters into the Elo formula and update the ratings of the fighters with each new match.", "We are ready to see the results!", "According to the algorithm, below are our top 10 fighters:", "Even though our dataset includes fighters from all organizations. The top ten fighters are all active in the UFC. This coincides with the common belief that the UFC attracts the best fighters.", "Now we can also answer the question we asked at the beginning. Conor vs Cowboy, who will win?", "The chart below shows the Elo ratings of the two fighters throughout time:", "Even though Cowboy has been stronger in the past. Conor has a higher rating in recent years.", "As of today, Conor has a rating of 2791 while Cowboy has a rating of 2529. The chance of Conor winning is 82%!", "More money and data science related articles from Lianne & Justin:", "Your home for data science.
