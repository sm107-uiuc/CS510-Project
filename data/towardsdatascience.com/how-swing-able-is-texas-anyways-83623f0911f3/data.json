How could that be? Some sort of mistake? I went to school in Texas and let me tell you, that place is a red state. It at least felt red\u2026", "However, we watched Georgia swing blue this year and it really does beg the question: which others could swing?", "Let\u2019s take Texas for example and I hope to demonstrate why, in fact, your vote really does matter and you should take it seriously (regardless of our political leaning).", "When I wrote about Virginia and Pennsylvania, I made the point that the reports from the news were resulting from biased samples. Now, when I say \u201cbiased,\u201d I don\u2019t mean they were wrong or intentionally misleading. I mean that because of the manner that the results were collected (e.g. \u201cin person\u201d ballots were naturally counted faster), it gave an incomplete picture of the story that the underlying population (all the ballots combined) was telling.", "Furthermore, since I started writing this little mini-series, I\u2019ve been thinking of the votes cast in each state as the \u201ctarget\u201d of my statistical analysis. Statistically speaking, I was treating \u201call the ballots\u201d as \u201cthe population\u201d which we could \u201csample\u201d from to make inferences about the final results.", "This is all well and mathematically sound\u2026 except when you bring up that the votes themselves are actually a biased sample of what the people of that state represent.", "The way a democracy works is that we don\u2019t assume we know what the will of the people is. We ask them. And the majority opinion is what we go with (kind of). So we have this whole process set up where you can go vote and tell the government what laws should be passed and which officials should be in office. But here\u2019s the thing:", "Voting is a biased sampling process because not everyone participants. We can\u2019t assume that, since 75% of Democrats choose not to vote, then exactly 75% of Republicans do the same. Sometimes more of one group shows up to the polls. So what affect can this have on an election (and democracy)?", "During the writing of this article, Texas had counted 98% of its votes and Donald Trump had won the state by 600,000 votes (52% to Biden\u2019s 46%). But I was curious, could people\u2019s perception of what they imagined to be an inevitable result have actually manifested this result? What I mean is: did assuming that the state would go red play a role in it\u2019s eventual \u201cred-ness\u201d after counting votes in 2020?", "Was there a universe that existed where Texas actually swung\u2026 Democrat? Let\u2019s take a look\u2026", "Let\u2019s do a similar analysis we did with Virginia where we split the state by county to get a sense of how Texas is spatially distributed (i.e. how did each county vote?). First off, we see that, again, about 50% of the votes come from the largest 5 counties.", "In Virginia\u2019s case, this type of distribution ensured Biden\u2019s victory (even though he was behind by 20% at one point). However, we can see that the largest county, Harris, is not nearly as imbalanced (in favor of Biden) as Fairfax County was for Virginia. I wonder\u2026", "Did Biden supporters not show up in these big cities in the same numbers as they did in Virginia because they figured it was a lost cause? Could Texas be a \u201cblue state\u201d actually?", "As we saw with the Illinois example, we really don\u2019t need more than ~10k votes to get a sense for how the underlying population behaves. Let\u2019s just assume that the way people voted in these counties reflects the underlying population\u2019s sentiment towards each candidate for that county (i.e. Harris County leans 55% blue). Then, let\u2019s take the actual population and assume that 75% of people are of voting age (a pretty good guess in 2016).", "We can use these two pieces of information to extrapolate what the results would be if EVERYONE of voting age had shown up to the polls. Could the larger, \u201cblue\u201d city populations do what they did in Virginia?", "Unfortunately, the results are not as dramatic as I was hoping for. Biden goes from 46% to 47% and Trump drops from 52% to 51%. Texas really is a red state. (That is \u2014 if the proportions demonstrated by this election are representative \u2014 which would be hard to know from this data).", "But I\u2019m not satisfied. I wanted to know how swing-able Texas was\u2026 not just whether it was red or blue. First, let\u2019s talk about an assumption I made earlier.", "We\u2019re all celebrating a 66-ish% voter turnout this election because it\u2019s smashing records that were decades old. But, that still means that 33% of people didn\u2019t vote. And actually, that\u2019s 33% of people who were registered to vote and then chose not to vote.", "How many people are eligible to vote and just not registered? Since I had population data, I chose to look at the numbers through that lens rather than the \u201cregistered voters\u201d lens. It turns out that, if you assume 75% of people are voting age, the number drops to 51% voter turnout. Now, of course, some of that discrepancy is accounted for by immigrants or other non-eligible-to-vote adults\u2026 but I just wanted to point out that the number 66% is already inflated and, in general, unimpressive to be \u201crecord breaking.\u201d", "Ok back to Texas\u2026 We already pseudo-established (I realize we\u2019re doing a lot of hand-waving here) that Texas is a red state. But remember, voting is a biased sampling mechanism.", "Does a world exist where more Democrats show up at the polls?", "We recall that the deficit that the blues needed to make up was 600,000. What percentage of the Texas population would that be? Turns out only about 3%.", "Ok, but we already established that most Texans are Republican. So what percentage MORE of the Democrats would have to show up. Well, from the numbers from the toy model above, if 6.3% more democrats showed up to vote this year, Texas would\u2019ve swung blue. It would\u2019ve meant that 57% of Texas Democrats could have surprised the 52% of Texas Republicans (assuming their number doesn\u2019t change) at the polls and Texas would have artificially given all 38 of its electoral college votes to Biden. We wouldn\u2019t even be talking about Pennsylvania right now\u2026", "Ok so this has been a toy example but I feel like it makes the point: there is a ton of room for growth in voter turnout and if one group figures it out before the other, they could really swing policy making even if they aren\u2019t the majority.", "Sure if one person doesn\u2019t show up to vote, it might only slightly change the proportion of votes that the final tally reveals. But again, it still biases our sample if it happens in a way that is unbalanced.", "Consider the concept of group-thinking. Having a cavalier or fatalistic attitude could lead to those around you having the same attitude and, in turn, propagating it further to their friends. If people can be assumed to vote similarly to their friends or at least those close by, then a huge group of your network not voting could lead to a biased sample on election day. Imagine if something like that had happened with Democrats in Fairfax County, Virginia? It could\u2019ve unnaturally changed a predictable, landslide victory for Biden into a close-count as a result of biased sampling. The same (well, the opposite really) could be said about Texas.", "The best way to avoid this is to just make a habit of voting. And make sure you let your friends and family know how important it is.", "It\u2019s your right. And it\u2019s a big deal.", "Consider giving a clap (or 10?) so TDS will share it more readily with others", "Check out my other case studies on the election:", "Your home for data science.
