In addition, I also wrote a visualization module, which was not required, but I thought it would naturally complement the exercise.\u201d", "Domnall smiled proudly, as he reached for a glass of water. He spoke for the past forty minutes trying to summarize the week of intense work on prototype preparation. The task was not conceptually difficult, but it made up for it with its onerousness. The provided data turned out to be an unprocessed pile of Internet posts \u2014 mainly verbal farts, burps and hiccups \u2014 which Internet users exchange vigorously to communicate with each other on social media. Domnall lost five full days by simply clearing the data of irrelevant clusters of characters, spelling mistakes, and self-promotional ornaments. He spent the next two days building the required classifier and preparing a presentation.", "He felt exhausted but satisfied. He provided a prototype for which any consultancy would probably charge the equivalent of his six-month salary. It shall be more than enough to demonstrate his usefulness beyond any doubt. The company to which he applied probably came to the same conclusion, as they skipped the interview with the HR department and jumped directly to the meeting with the head of the software development team.", "\u201cYes \u2026 yes \u2026\u201d muttered the man on the other side of the table. \u201cThis visualization\u2026 was simple enough\u2026\u201d he said under his breath, without even looking up. All his attention was drawn to the scribble he was filling with the fourth consecutive page in his notebook. \u201cIf you\u2019d be so kind\u2026 and returned to\u2026\u201d He briskly put the last period. He looked up and finished: \u201c\u2026 and returned to the code snippet where you link the cleared posts from several different sources.\u201d He gave Domnall a moment to find the proper lines in the script. \u201cIf you were to present this to a non-technical person, how would you do it?\u201d", "Domnall suppressed a sigh of relief. When he heard who he would talk to, he was afraid of questions about code optimization, which he had a rather vague idea about. Whereas the technical manager decided to test his communication skills with the business. Satisfied with the turn of events, Domnall brought a patient smile to his face.", "\u201cImagine you are talking to two managers from two different departments. They came to the meeting with differently formatted presentations\u2026\u201d", "\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d The man smiled nervously. \u201cOur business team is well versed in technical issues and there is no need to enter such a high level of abstraction.\u201d", "\u201cIt can be an interesting experience. The managers I have worked with so far were usually delighted with examples referring to the situation they could relate to.\u201d", "\u201cWhat abstraction level should I enter then?\u201d", "\u201cExplain how you combined the output from these two text cleanup modules. From what you described here, they appear to have different formats.\u201d", "Domnall looked at the script and slapped his forehead.", "\u201cYeah. In the first module, just before returning the string, I reformat it using the function called here.\u201d Domnall marked the right line of code on the screen. \u201cThanks to that both results have the same format.\u201d", "\u201cIn the library\u2026 which I attached as a separate file,\u201d Domnall answered uncertainly, not knowing whether he was talking to the head of the software development department again or to the business phantom the guy was playing. However, he did not dare point out to him that this type of question from people who should rather be interested in the applications of his software would be somewhat\u2026 unusual.", "Meanwhile, the man was studying the code snippet, biting his lips.", "\u201cOh,\u201d he said finally, \u201cso you just merge the result data from both cleaners, and then use it as input for the predictor?\u201d", "\u201cGreat.\u201d The man nodded his head in delight. \u201cThat\u2019s all I needed. Thank you very much.\u201d He got up from the chair, picked up the laptop and his notebook from the table, and, avoiding the interlocutor\u2019s gaze, added: \u201cI will send a report from our conversation to the HR department.\u201d", "Domnall looked at him. Suddenly he became convinced that something was very wrong here. He almost cried in desperation:", "\u201cAnd why will this opinion be negative?\u201d", "The man jumped up in fear. He gave the interviewee a scared look and tightened his grip on the computer as if the device suddenly grew in weight on his hands.", "\u201cWell\u2026 you know,\u201d he stammered, with the corner of his eye measuring the distance separating him from the door. \u201cEvery company has its\u2026 erm\u2026 unique culture. I have the impression that you are not the best\u2026 erm\u2026 fit?\u201d", "Domnall clenched his teeth in the act of self-censorship, as he didn\u2019t find any words he could say to the man. The lack of cultural fit was a fact \u2014 he would never think of appropriating someone\u2019s work in such a blunt way.", "\u201cIf that\u2019s all, goodbye to you,\u201d the man said in a hurry. The bulky loot prevented him from shaking hands. \u201cWe will call you.\u201d", "Episode 6: Passionate, more passionate, hired!", "Domnall is a brilliant guy. However, job-seeking is long-term entertainment, and will probably take him a while. Especially that job interviews don\u2019t happen every day. In the meantime, you may consider reading about other (equally brilliant) characters in our #Pharmacon sociological thriller.", "Your home for data science.
