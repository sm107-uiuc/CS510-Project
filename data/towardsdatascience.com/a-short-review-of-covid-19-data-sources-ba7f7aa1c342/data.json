Unfortunately, there are so many different sources around, and each of them is a little different. Here\u2019s a short review as of Mar 26, 2020. I will cover the strength and weakness of the following data sources so that you can choose the one that best fits your need:", "In short, if you don\u2019t need an API, then 1Point3Acres has the best data and visualization.", "If you do need an API, then the Johns Hopkins CSSE data, together with the COVID Tracking Project for testing information, provides a good starting point.", "If you are looking for the US COVID-19 data, and you don\u2019t need an API, then look no further. This is the best website to go to.", "If you are looking for global data, this is the data source to go to. It has been widely cited since the early days of the coronavirus epidemic.", "If you only need the US data, and you need an API, then this is the data source to go to.", "This is a unique data source because it contains not only the confirmed/death counts, but also the US\u2019s test data, ie, positive and negative results, pending tests, and total people tested. This information is very valuable because it reveals a lot of information about the \u201cactual\u201d number of patients that has not yet been \u201cconfirmed\u201d. This testing data is also used by 1Point3Acres on their website.", "If you want to build statistics on medical details, this is the preferred data source.", "If you are looking for the best data for China, this is the data source to go to. This is the earliest data source available to the public. It has been widely used since the coronavirus breakout in January 2020.", "Generally, I prefer Johns Hopkins CSSE than Worldometers. There\u2019s no much information provided in Worldometers but not at Johns Hopkins CSSE. The only reason to check this website is that it splits the confirmed count into mild, and serious/critical. However, the website doesn\u2019t specify the source or methodology of this split, so it\u2019s hard to tell how trustworthy they are.", "Generally, I prefer 1Point3Acres than USAFacts. Both websites provide county-level information. But 1Point3Acres has much better visualization such as log scale plots, state-level plots, racing bar plots, etc. In addition, 1Point3Acre can compare numbers to other countries easily, but USAFacts cannot.", "However, even though USAFacts doesn\u2019t have any API, it does provide download links to the confirmed and death counts at county level:", "New York Times started to publish their data set in GitHub since 3/27/2020. If you are looking for a county-level data set for the USA, this is a decent place to go. However, their county-level numbers don\u2019t exactly add up to the state total last time I look. In addition, the New York Times data is a little delayed, you may have to wait to the next day to get the updated daily data.", "Also, they don\u2019t have test data, nor international data. So if you need that information, you need to merge from somewhere else.", "Most of the other data sources I have seen are derived from one or more of these sources. If you see any other good data sources, please don\u2019t hesitate to leave me a comment. Thanks.", "I want to thank my friend David Tian, a Machine Learning engineer, for his valuable suggestions on this article. Check out his fun self-driving *DeepPiCar* blog.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Engineer, teacher, writer. Loves to explain complex problems in simple terms, and to solve real-world problems by technology."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
