As a result, a brand\u2019s reputation can be made or broken based on their online strategy. Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s downfall and designing clothes which look good on instagram (e.g. big logos) are examples of this new trend. The aim of this short article is to see if we can forecast price swings with social media data.", "We\u2019re going to consider social media metric data for PepsiCo from Instagram, Google trends, Twitter and website traffic which was downloaded from Sentieo.", "In total, we have 36 input metrics which track the number of likes, comments, visits of Pepsi and Sodastream on these social networks. We are going to focus on weekly variations in order to see how they impact PepsiCo\u2019s stock price.", "After uploading the data into the AuDaS Data Science platform, we then bin the weekly price movements into 3 classes:", "This allows us to frame the problem as a classification task which is more helpful to long term investors who are mainly interested in the stock\u2019s large price swings. The analysis could easily be applied to longer horizons (month, years) and more baskets subject to data availability.", "Our target variable is the binned column of price movements and our inputs are the 36 social media metrics. AuDaS then automatically starts to search for the optimal Machine Learning model and provides the feature relevance and score metrics for the model to the user.", "After a couple of iterations we reach an F1 score of 0.417 for our 3 class prediction problem which is better than random (0.33).", "This signifies that the social media data does have some predictive power, in particular the weekly variation of Pepsico\u2019s Twitter mentions followed by its instagram comments and website reach.", "The data in this study measured PepsiCo\u2019s social media and online traffic but didn\u2019t provide a sentiment of the consumers interactions with the brand. Including the sentiment could help the model anticipate whether the consumers are lauding the brand or in fact venting their frustrations.", "An additional analysis could focus on the specific exchanges PepsiCo is having with its followers i.e. how are they answering their customer\u2019s questions, requests and how quickly?", "Another extension could be to look at how PepsiCo\u2019s traffic compares to CocaCola\u2019s and/or Unilever\u2019s and how the relative performance impacts their price swings.", "This machine learning model probably doesn\u2019t contain enough alpha for a systematic strategy because social media sentiment is already widely used and the signals decays very quickly, but it could instead support fundamental investors in their analysis. Quantifying the impact of social media on their high-conviction investments can allow them to understand some additional drivers which can not easily be measured by an analyst. This can also help them understand how vulnerable their investments are to a potential online backlash. Finally, instagram posts and twitter re-shares are often proxies for purchases and can be used in their fundamental modelling to forecast sales.", "If you are interested in finding out how our Quant and Fundamental Hedge Fund customers use AuDaS for their Risk analysis and Investment Management please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me by email or LinkedIn.
