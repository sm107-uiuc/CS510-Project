It has been a roller coaster ride with many ups and downs. There were many sleepless nights, frustrating moments and of course, many learning experiences.", "In this article, I would like to share with you 10 lessons I have learned throughout the past 2 years while being a research student in a field related to data science. If you are planning to start an academic career or you have already started, I hope you find these 10 lessons useful. Let\u2019s get started.", "The important thing is not to stop questioning.", "The related work in your field holds all the knowledge you need to know. If you are new to research and searching for a topic, the best place to look for is the existing work in your field. However, remember to have an open mind when reading others\u2019 work. Don\u2019t blindly believe everything and always ask questions. Think about what you would do if you were to solve the problem and the reasons behind your choice of methods.", "I have been messing with tools to benchmark different datasets since the beginning of my PhD. I have come across scenarios where I was unable to reproduce the results claimed in the publications of some tools. Sometimes when I contact the authors, a common reply would be that they don\u2019t know or it will be the silent treatment. This is the sad truth in the current research community. Many have compromised research quality over quantity.", "I\u2019m not saying that every piece of work is compromised. There are exceptional pieces of work as well, and I try my best to base on them as a solid foundation.", "Storytelling is the most powerful way to put ideas into the world.", "In interdisciplinary fields such as bioinformatics where computer science and biology meet, you need a story to explain what you are doing. Not all biologists are computer scientists and not all computer scientists are biologists.", "During the early days of my PhD, when someone out of my field asks for my research topic, I would explain with all the technical jargon and ultimately confuse them at the end. This made me re-think my approach to explaining. How can I make others understand my complex topic in simple terms?", "Later on, I figured out how to explain my research topic in a simple and understandable way. I would always try to make up a story in the real-world that would relate to my problem. This made it very easy to explain so that anyone would understand.", "You can do anything, but not everything.", "A research field is a vast area and there can be many topics to work on. Even those individual topics would have different directions you can explore. You have to select one topic, determine what you are going to do and define the scope. If you try to do everything, then you won\u2019t be able to complete anything. Hence, always have a clearly defined scope of what you are going to do. If you get stuck within your current scope, then you can expand a bit and see what else is possible.", "Research is to see what everybody else has seen and to think what nobody else has thought.", "It is highly likely that most of the research problems have been encountered by someone within the past few decades. Similar methods may have been proposed to solve the problem you are intending to work on. If you are doing interdisciplinary research as I do, then you can model your problem by borrowing ideas from existing work. Even though no one has come up with such a model yet, the basics do exist. All you have to do is apply the knowledge to your scenario and continue searching until you can infer a solution, or eventually, you prove that a solution does not exist!", "Data is like garbage. You\u2019d better know what you are going to do with it before you collect it.", "You need to get data based on the research problem you are going to solve. Since my research problem is related to genomic studies, I need to have datasets containing genomic data.", "Simulating datasets makes things much easier as you can easily get the ground truth. However, when you work with real data, it is hard to determine the exact ground truth. Moreover, there is a lot of noise and ambiguity in real data and your proposed solutions may not work perfectly as they worked for the simulated data. You may have to make certain assumptions and continue your work. There is always a boundary where you have to stop at when working with real data as beyond that point no one knows what is correct.", "Clarity and simplicity are the antidotes for complexity and uncertainty.", "Once you have come up with a solution to address your problem, you have to present it to the community. The most common thing we do is compile an article and submit it to a conference or a journal. You have to clearly explain your methodology without causing any confusions. The writing style matters when it comes to presenting your method.", "Use of visual cues is highly encouraged when presenting solutions. For example, you can use a flow diagram to explain your method step-by-step. You can also take a simple example and explain how the state of the example changes in each step of your method. Furthermore, you can use charts and diagrams to explain the significant improvements in your results.", "Success is buried on the other side of rejection.", "Once you have finalised your article, you can submit it to a conference or journal. It is always encouraged to target top conferences and top journals in a field. Every year, these conferences and journals get a lot of good-quality work and the reviewers will select a handful of pieces to publish. It really depends on the quality of the presentation of your work (and your luck). The more you can impress the reviewers, the more chance you have to get your work accepted.", "You may not get your work accepted the first time you submit. My first piece of work in my PhD got rejected from a conference. Rejection is very normal when doing research. Don\u2019t look at it as a failure. Consider it as a new opportunity to improve your solution. Even though your work gets rejected, reviewers will provide their comments. These comments generally contain", "You can use these comments to improve your work. I was able to improve my rejected piece based on the reviewers\u2019 comments and got it published in one of the top journals of my field. The key is to never give up when your work gets rejected.", "One must develop skills that stretch capacities, that make one more than what one is.", "Researchers are problem solvers. To solve problems, you need to be equipped with both technical skills and soft skills.", "You need technical skills such as programming and statistics to solve your problem of interest and come up with a solid solution. With the increasing popularity of open-source software at present, if you produce an automated tool containing your proposed method, it is more likely to be appreciated by the research community as anyone can use it and reuse your code. Furthermore, you have to analyse your results using appropriate evaluation metrics based on statistics.", "You need soft skills such as speaking and writing to present your solution. Imagine that you have to present your proposed method to your panel. You need to come up with a clear story and present your method clearly. Similarly, clarity and simplicity apply when you are compiling a manuscript to publish.", "Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date.", "Every field advances and new things are introduced every day. Improved and efficient methods are proposed to address problems that are already solved. You have to be up to date with the new developments in your field. You can take ideas from these new developments and use in your work.", "A good way to get up to speed on the new developments is to read new research articles published in top journals and top conferences. These high-quality work can provide you with valuable insights for your work. I always use Google Scholar to find new publications and I have joined ResearchGate as well.", "Your network is your net worth.", "Conferences and symposiums are some of the major places where you can meet experts in your area, and get to know about their work. You can expand your network by getting to know people. Generally, people are searching for candidates to recruit into their labs or to collaborate with. If you are interested in research internships or postdoctoral opportunities after completing your PhD, it will be beneficial to have these connections in your network.", "To wrap up this article, here are the key takeaways.", "My supervisory panel has provided me with valuable insights and guidance throughout the past 2 years. You should make the maximum use of your panel\u2019s expert knowledge.", "I hope you got something useful out of this article. Let me know your thoughts in the comments. I would love to hear about your experiences.", "If you are interested in more experiences related to research, data science and computer science, feel free to check out the following articles.", "Your home for data science.
