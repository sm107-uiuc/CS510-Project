The article is divided into the following content", "Tkinter is python\u2019s standard GUI framework and comes bundled with python 3. A great beginner\u2019s tutorial can be found here. This tutorial is not focused on Tkinter, rather on how to use it to create simple games. The two main widgets we will be using is", "The canvas widget on Tkinter is used to draw geometrical objects on the window. It has methods for drawing various shapes. The most commonly used methods for a simple game are as follows", "Bind is used to receive input from the mouse click events. Following parameters can be used within the bind method to identify the type of mouse clicks", "The bind method takes the above parameter as the first argument, and a module name as the second argument. The module is called when the parameter-defined mouse click event is identified.", "Now that we have a basic overview of Tkinter, let\u2019s draw a basic flow diagram of a simple game.", "Based on some game parameters (such as the size of the grid, color, text, and other initialization features) the game will initialize and then will start looking for user inputs (in the form of mouse clicks). Once received, the grid positions (x,y coordinates of the window where the mouse was clicked) will be converted into game-dependent logical positions. These logical positions will then be used to update the internal state of the game stored as variables in python, and update the game graphics using canvas methods. The process will repeat until the game is over (which will depend on the mouse click and the internal state of the game). The result of the game will be displayed. A mouse click event will be added to the result screen for the user to chose if he or she wants to play the game again.", "To have a better and logical organization of the code, we will structure the functions structured into three categories.", "These functions are responsible for setting up an initial state for the game. These include defining the game variables, initializing the game graphics, resetting the game variables when the game is over, defining the canvas and bind widgets, etc. Initialization functions will mainly deal with setting up the game in case a new game is started or the game is concluded and needs to be played again.", "As the name suggests, these functions will be responsible to draw game-based graphical elements onto the Tkinter window. Based on the basic canvas drawing methods mentioned above, we will be creating high-level drawing functions specific to our game. These high-level drawing functions will then be used as building blocks for updating game graphics.", "These functions will have nothing to do with the game graphics and will deal with the game logic. These include, but are not limited to, keeping track of the game state, receiving user input, updating the state of the game, checking if the current move is a legal one, keeping track of player scores, checking if the game has concluded, deciding on the result of the game, etc.", "Now that we have talked about some basics of game elements, let\u2019s have a look at some examples with working codes", "The working code can be downloaded from here", "The code uses an array of size 3x3 to keep track of the game i.e. the status of the board. \u2018X\u2019 is marked as -1 while \u2018O\u2019 is marked as 1. All unoccupied boxes are marked as 0 (zero). The user clicks within a box, and the event is captured with the bind method \u2018click\u2019. The grid position is then converted to identify the box in which the click event happened. Based on the player, the code then draws either an \u2018X\u2019 or an \u2018O\u2019 in the identified box only if the box has not already been occupied. Board status is also updated. With every turn, the code checks if any of the players have won. This is done by finding patterns in the 3x3 array of board status. The game is concluded when either of the players wins or all boxes have been occupied. At this stage, the result screen is generated displaying the winner and the score of each player.", "The working code can be downloaded from here", "The code uses an array of size (num_dots-1)x(num_dots-1) to keep track of the count of marked edges for each box. Whenever player 1 marks an edge around a box, the value of the array associated with that box is decremented by 1 and when it is marked by player 2 it is incremented by 1. Whenever any element of this array reaches a value of -4 (or 4), this indicates that player 1 (player 2) has successfully created the box.", "The players click on edges between the dots to activate/mark them. The activation area is carefully calculated for each edge and corresponds to the square centered in the middle of the edge with an area of 1/3rd as that of the box. Once an edge is marked, the grid position is then converted to identify the boxes corresponding to that edge, and the value of the array corresponding to these boxes is incremented/decremented. The game is concluded when all the edges have been marked. The result screen then displays the winner and the number of boxes marked by each player.", "The working code can be downloaded from here", "A basic outline of making simple games in Python using the Tkinter package was discussed. Three examples with codes were provided to give users a starting point and basic understanding for creating other simple games. The code is available at the following links", "If this article was helpful to you, feel free to clap, share and respond to it.
