I start with a list of Titles, Subtitles and URLs and convert them into a static HTML page for viewing on my personal GitHub.io site.", "This can be done in one of three ways:", "Side Note: It is possible to accomplish the same task using Flask, however render_template already uses Jinja2 under the hood and we do not want the additional requirement of needing a webserver \u2014 so we ignore this solution.", "This is probably the most widely used, but least efficient method. For a small number of files, this can be a quick and easy implementation, however, with >10 data points, this becomes time-consuming and prone to error.", "An example of our desired output for 3 image tags can be in the form of:", "We can also use pythons string manipulation capabilities to generate a string in the correct format, and then write it to file. This can be done in one of two ways:", "If we have our data in a nested list format:", "We can generate the above using the following script:", "If our data is a dictionary format \u2014 say from a pandas data frame or JSON file, we can again use string formatting to assemble a file template.", "Here we can iterate over each object in the dictionary using the values() function and proceed similarly to before. Note that I have used the naming ability of python\u2019s c-style formatting ( Python2 and Python3 compatible)", "This method works well for small files but can get confusing when you have many different datasets, which need to be inserted in different locations. Similarly, it would be convenient not to have long strings HTML code within our python program, for readability purposes \u2014 this is when Jinja comes in.", "Jinja is a templating language for use with Python. In essence, it populates sections within a text template with data that is provided within it. It has most likely already been installed with your Python distribution, but if not we can obtain it from the PiPy repository pip install Jinja2 .", "The first thing we need to do when using Jinja is to create a template. This can be done by opening an empty file e.g. template.html in a text editor and populating it with any code that will not change.", "Next, we can add sections that we wish to update using our python program. To start off I want to add a title.", "Note how we include our variable name (in this case title ) within two sets of curly braces. This tells Jinja where it needs to substitute information.", "Now we have a template we want to be able to tell python to use it to create a new file. To do this we can make use of the following program:", "Here we create a Jinja environment and read template.html from the current (./) directory. Within this, we supply the variable title which was defined in python and produce a formatted string from the template. Finally, we take this string and write it to a file of our choosing to produce:", "Now we have a working program, we can make use of Jinja\u2019s ability to iteratively create elements within our template. To do this we can recreate the output from the \u2018List Formatting\u2019 section by adding the following lines to our template:", "This goes through all items in the arbitrarily named mydata variable and creates an image element for it.", "We also need to update the python script so that it knows what the value of my data is before re-running.", "Similar to lists, we can also use dictionaries for more complex substitutions. To do this we change our iterator to go through each item, and can even access additional elements using their keys (e.g. value['src'] )", "This example requires the same python program as before but using the data from the \u2018Dictionary Formatting\u2019 example (earlier).", "If you have loaded your data as a pandas dataframe, it is possible to convert this into a row-wise dictionary containing all the columns as variables. To do this we take the transpose of the dataframe and use the to_dict function:", "Finally to conclude it is possible to use a mixture of item types and even nest them. For the image strips shown in the headline image, I was required to separate my images into separate div (groups) of 8. To do this I started with a list, where each element contained the data for 8 images \u2014 For simplicity, we shall use two elements of two for the example.", "We now iterate over each of the two elements of the list and create a new <div> element:", "Within each of those, we want to create as many images exist in the variable I have named divitem . This can be done by placing another loop within the existing one:", "And there we have it, an HTML template with the format", "We have successfully used Jinja to iteratively substitute data into a pre-defined template and greatly reduce the amount of manual work needed. Jinja allows us to automate document and file construction tasks and does not require a webserver to view any generated HTML pages. The final result of my project can be seen on my github.io page using the link below.", "Jinja can also work for many other text file formats, including LaTeX, CSVs and even other scripts. It has the ability to run conditionals, filter data or escape character and whitespace in your formatting.
