Though the beta versions were being rolled out for quite some time, the official release of Python 3.9.0 happened on October 5, 2020.", "The official documentation contains all the details of the latest features and changelog. Through this post, I\u2019ll walk you through a few cool features that may come in handy our day-to-day programming tasks.", "To follow me along or to try out the new features, you should have Python 3.9 installed. I have used an environment manager called pyenv(alternatively, you can use conda) to have the latest version installed alongside my current version. You can also run it using the official docker image.", "Function annotations have been around since python 3.0 and it enables us to add metadata to Python functions. So, what\u2019s new in Python 3.9?", "Python 3.9 added PEP 593 which introduced a mechanism to extend the type annotations from PEP 484 which provides the standard semantic for annotations and suggested that annotations be used for type hinting.", "Now, there can be many other use cases of annotations besides type hinting and thus PEP 593 introduced typing.Annotated which allows us to add more details to the metadata.", "Let\u2019s try to understand this better via an example for both Python 3.8 and 3.9.", "This is a simple function that converts Euro to USD using the exchange rate. We have used the annotations to serve as documentation for the user.", "Here, we are using the newly introduced Annotated that takes at least two arguments. The first argument(float in the example) establishes the type hint, and the rest of the arguments are arbitrary metadata of the function.", "The user/developer can also check these annotations using the __annotations__ attribute:", "We can also check the type using the get_type_hint() function:", "Basic data types like int, str or bool are simple to annotate. The earlier static typing was built incrementally on top of the existing Python runtime and constrained by it. This led to a duplicated collection hierarchy in the typing module due to the generics i.e. we had both typing.List and the built-in list.", "With generics, we have the issue of parameterization due to their storage structure which is of a container. And for these reasons, we have not been able to use list(float) or list[float] as type hints directly but needed typing module to achieve this.", "In Python 3.9, this duplicate hierarchy is no longer needed. We can annotate them directly:", "One of the coolest and useful features of Python 3.9 would be the merge(|) and update(|=) operators added to the built-in dict class.", "The existing(3.8) ways of merging two dicts have many shortcomings:", "PEP 584 has introduced two new operators for dictionaries:", "The update operator merges the dictionaries and updates the dictionary on the left of the operator while keeping the last values for the overlapping keys in the two dicts.", "Dates and time play a central role in the majority of applications. Python offers comprehensive support via datetime module in the standard library but there has always been a gap w.r.t. integrating time zones to these timestamps.", "Up till now, we\u2019ve had third party libraries like dateutil to implement such timezone specific rules but now Python 3.9 had Paul Ganssle joining the core team to add a new zoneinfo module that offers the entire Internet Assigned Numbers Authority(IANA) Time zone database to be accessed and used.", "Until now, we\u2019ve been accessing time zone aware timestamps using the tzinfo argumentas follows:", "But with the addition of zoneinfo, we now have access to the IANA Time Zone Database.", "We can do a bunch of operations with time zones and interconversion has become very easy:", "PEP 616 has introduced new methods to strip off prefixes and suffixes from strings. The new methods are:", "There have been many recurring issues reported across all the major forums(like StackOverflow) around lstrip() and rstrip() methods.", "We\u2019ve been stripping off characters from either ends of the string using the strip() method as follows:", "This has removed the substring present at the ends of the string. If you see carefully, this has removed the individual characters in \u201c python\u201d i.e. \u201c \u201d, \u201cp\u201d, \u201cy\u201d, \u201ct\u201d, \u201ch\u201d, \u201co\u201d and \u201cn\u201d.", "To get rid of the prefix from a string, we now have the removeprefix()", "You can check out this with a number of other permutations and combinations with the removesuffix() method as well.", "Besides these, a number of other features have also been introduced. Here is the list along with the PEP IDs:", "PEG parsers are more robust and powerful as per Guido\u2019s(creator of Python) research. The PEG parser\u2019s goal would be to produce the same abstract syntax tree (AST) as the old LL(1) parser.", "Here\u2019s an example of calculating GCD/LCM of more than two numbers using the math library:", "To know more about the details of each of these features, head over to the official documentation.", "3.9.0 marks a big milestone in the journey of Python\u2019s development and for the community. New enhancements are being added as we speak and 3.10 will also have promising features. For now, you should try out these soon to be widely used features introduced in Python 3.9.", "Try running your existing programs using Python 3.9 and see if upgrading would be much troublesome for you.", "Another thing you should try is the new parser which claims to be promising but we\u2019ll only figure out after considerable testing across several use cases.", "With this channel, I am planning to roll out a couple of series covering the entire data science space.
