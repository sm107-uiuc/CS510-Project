It will be a short and simple post. I will introduce you to each resource by giving some basic information about them. I tried to find resources with online access so that anyone from anywhere can have free access to them. This is one of the reasons I like programming, there are infinitely many open-source and free resources. The seven books in this list are related to machine learning, but each of them will give you a different perspective. Hoping that you will also find these resources helpful.", "Reading a programming book can be a bit challenging, but instead of reading the whole book, what I usually do is checking their index and reading the part that I find interesting or need to learn at that moment. But of course, if you have time you can read the whole book. Let\u2019s get started!", "This is a comprehensive introduction to the most important data science tools in the Python world. It is a book written by Jake VanderPlas. Jake VanderPlas was formerly both the Director of Open Software and the Director of Research in Physical Sciences for the eScience Institute; he now works at Google. In this book, you can also find helpful content about Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries.", "Another helpful book resource, written by Michael Driscoll. Michael has been programming with Python since 2006. He is the author of the popular Python blog, \u201cThe Mouse Vs. the Python\u201d. He is also a contributor on Real Python.", "This is a great resource if you are just getting started with Python. It is also a great read to refresh your Python knowledge. This book will help you learn how to program with Python 3 from beginning to end. Python 101 starts off with the fundamentals of Python and then moves on to Python\u2019s standard libraries.", "This resource a little more academic than others. The implementation of machine learning and big data can be found. The projects are mostly solved using Python, C++, Java and Scala. This will be a good read if you are interested in learning more about Big Data.", "This book focuses more on the mathematics behind machine learning. If you are interested to improve your machine learning knowledge, you should know how it works. When you know how something works, you have more power to change and try new things. The book is divided into two sections:", "AI is transforming numerous industries. Machine Learning Yearning, a free ebook from Andrew Ng, teaches you how to structure Machine Learning projects.", "This book is focused not on teaching you ML algorithms, but on how to make ML algorithms work. After reading Machine Learning Yearning, you will be able to:", "Written by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David.", "The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides a theoretical account of the fundamentals underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms.", "This book covers most of the new trends in machine learning. Written by Andriy. He is a dad of two and a machine learning expert based in Quebec City, Canada. Nine years ago, he got a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence, and for the last seven years, he has been leading a team of machine learning developers at Gartner.", "This book is like one cup of smoothie with all your favorite fruits. Healthy and concise \ud83d\ude42", "In one paragraph the topics covered in this book can be listed as: Supervised and unsupervised learning, support vector machines, neural networks, ensemble methods, gradient descent, cluster analysis and dimensionality reduction, auto-encoders and transfer learning, feature engineering and hyper-parameter tuning! Math, intuition, illustrations, all in just a hundred pages!", "I am Behic Guven, and I love sharing stories on creativity, programming, motivation, and life.", "Follow my blog and Towards Data Science to stay inspired.", "Your home for data science.
