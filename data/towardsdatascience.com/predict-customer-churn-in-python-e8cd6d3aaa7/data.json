If we could figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold. Let\u2019s make use of a customer transaction dataset from Kaggle to understand the key steps involved in predicting customer attrition in Python.", "Supervised Machine Learning is nothing but learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. A supervised machine learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. Given that we have data on current and prior customer transactions in the telecom dataset, this is a standardized supervised classification problem that tries to predict a binary outcome (Y/N).", "By the end of this article, let\u2019s attempt to solve some of the key business challenges pertaining to customer attrition like say, (1) what is the likelihood of an active customer leaving an organization? (2) what are key indicators of a customer churn? (3) what retention strategies can be implemented based on the results to diminish prospective customer churn?", "In real-world, we need to go through seven major stages to successfully predict customer churn:", "To understand the business challenge and the proposed solution, I would recommend you to download the dataset and to code with me. Feel free to ask me if you have any questions as you work along. Let\u2019s look into each one of these aforesaid steps in detail here below", "If you had asked the 20-year-old me, I would have jumped straight into model selection as its coolest thing to do in machine learning. But like in life, wisdom kicks in at a later stage! After witnessing the real-world Machine Learning business challenges, I can\u2019t stress the importance of Data preprocessing and Data Evaluation.", "Always remember the following golden rule in predictive analytics:", "\u201cYour model is only as good as your data\u201d", "Understanding the end-to-end structure of your dataset and reshaping the variables is the gateway to a qualitative predictive modelling initiative.", "Step 0: Restart the session: It\u2019s a good practice to restart the session and to remove all the temporary variables from the interactive development environment before we start coding. So let's restart the session, clear the cache and start afresh!", "Step 1: Import relevant libraries: Import all the relevant python libraries for building supervised machine learning algorithms.", "Step 2: Set up the current working directory:", "Step 3: Import the dataset: Let\u2019s load the input dataset into the python notebook in the current working directory.", "Step 4: Evaluate data structure: In this section, we need to look at the dataset in general and each column in detail to get a better understanding of the input data so as to aggregate the fields when needed.", "From the head & column methods, we get an idea that this is a telco customer churn dataset where each record entails the nature of subscription, tenure, frequency of payment and churn (signifying their current status).", "A quick describe method reveals that the telecom customers are staying on average for 32 months and are paying $64 per month. However, this could potentially be because different customers have different contracts.", "From the look of it, we can presume that the dataset contains several numerical and categorical columns providing various information on the customer transactions.", "Re-validate column data types and missing values: Always keep an eye onto the missing values in a dataset. The missing values could mess up model building and accuracy. Hence we need to take care of missing values (if any) before we compare and select a model.", "The dataset contains 7043 rows and 21 columns and there seem to be no missing values in the dataset.", "Identify unique values: \u2018Payment Methods\u2019 and \u2018Contract\u2019 are the two categorical variables in the dataset. When we look into the unique values in each categorical variables, we get an insight that the customers are either on a month-to-month rolling contract or on a fixed contract for one/two years. Also, they are paying bills via credit card, bank transfer or electronic checks.", "Step 5: Check target variable distribution: Let\u2019s look at the distribution of churn values. This is quite a simple yet crucial step to see if the dataset upholds any class imbalance issues. As you can see below, the data set is imbalanced with a high proportion of active customers compared to their churned counterparts.", "Step 7: Take care of missing data: As we saw earlier, the data provided has no missing values and hence this step is not required for the chosen dataset. I would like to showcase the steps here for any future references.", "Find the average and fill missing values programmatically: If we had any missing values in the numeric columns of the dataset, then we should find the average of each one of those columns and fill their missing values. Here\u2019s a snippet of code to do the same step programmatically.", "Revalidate NA\u2019s: It\u2019s always a good practice to revalidate and ensure that we don\u2019t have any more null values in the dataset.", "Step 8: Label Encode Binary data: Machine Learning algorithms can typically only have numerical values as their independent variables. Hence label encoding is quite pivotal as they encode categorical labels with appropriate numerical values. Here we are label encoding all categorical variables that have only two unique values. Any categorical variable that has more than two unique values are dealt with Label Encoding and one-hot Encoding in the subsequent sections.", "Step 9: Exploratory Data Analysis: Let\u2019s try to explore and visualize our data set by doing distribution of independent variables to better understand the patterns in the data and to potentially form some hypothesis.", "Step 9.1. Plot histogram of numeric Columns:", "A few observations can be made based on the histograms for numerical variables:", "Step 9.2. Analyze the distribution of categorical variables:", "9.2.1. Distribution of contract type: Most of the customers seem to have a prepaid connection with the telecom company. On the other hand, there are a more or less equal proportion of customers in the 1-year and 2-year contracts.", "9.2.2. Distribution of payment method type: The dataset indicates that customers prefer to pay their bills electronically the most followed by bank transfer, credit card and mailed checks.", "9.2.3. Distribution of label encoded categorical variables:", "Step 9.3: Analyze the churn rate by categorical variables:", "9.3.1. Overall churn rate: A preliminary look at the overall churn rate shows that around 74% of the customers are active. As shown in the chart below, this is an imbalanced classification problem. Machine learning algorithms work well when the number of instances of each class is roughly equal. Since the dataset is skewed, we need to keep that in mind while choosing the metrics for model selection.", "9.3.2. Churn Rate by Contract Type: Customers with a prepaid or rather a month-to-month connection have a very high probability to churn compared to their peers on 1 or 2 years contracts.", "9.3.3. Churn Rate by Payment Method Type: Customers who pay via bank transfers seem to have the lowest churn rate among all the payment method segments.", "Step 9.4. Find positive and negative correlations: Interestingly, the churn rate increases with monthly charges and age. In contrast Partner, Dependents and Tenure seem to be negatively related to churn. Let\u2019s have a look into the positive and negative correlations graphically in the next step.", "Step 9.5. Plot positive & negative correlations:", "Step 9.6. Plot Correlation Matrix of all independent variables: Correlation matrix helps us to discover the bivariate relationship between independent variables in a dataset.", "Step 9.7: Check Multicollinearity using VIF: Let's try to look into multicollinearity using Variable Inflation Factors (VIF). Unlike Correlation matrix, VIF determines the strength of the correlation of a variable with a group of other independent variables in a dataset. VIF starts usually at 1 and anywhere exceeding 10 indicates high multicollinearity between the independent variables.", "We can see here that the \u2018Monthly Charges\u2019 and \u2018Total Charges\u2019 have a high VIF value.", "Let\u2019s try to drop one of the correlated features to see if it help us in bringing down the multicollinearity between correlated features:", "In our example, after dropping the \u2018Total Charges\u2019 variable, VIF values for all the independent variables have decreased to a considerable extent.", "Let\u2019s try to summarise some of the key findings from this EDA:", "Step 10: Encode Categorical data: Any categorical variable that has more than two unique values have been dealt with Label Encoding and one-hot Encoding using get_dummies method in pandas here.", "Step 11: Split the dataset into dependent and independent variables: Now we need to separate the dataset into X and y values. y would be the \u2018Churn\u2019 column whilst X would be the remaining list of independent variables in the dataset.", "Step 12: Generate training and test datasets: Let\u2019s decouple the master dataset into training and test set with an 80%-20% ratio.", "Step 13: Remove Identifiers: Separate \u2018customerID\u2019 from training and test data frames.", "Step 14: Conduct Feature Scaling: It\u2019s quite important to normalize the variables before conducting any machine learning (classification) algorithms so that all the training and test variables are scaled within a range of 0 to 1.", "Step 15.1: Compare Baseline Classification Algorithms (1st Iteration): Let\u2019s model each classification algorithm over the training dataset and evaluate their accuracy and standard deviation scores.", "Classification Accuracy is one of the most common classification evaluation metrics to compare baseline algorithms as its the number of correct predictions made as a ratio of total predictions. However, it's not the ideal metric when we have class imbalance issue. Hence, let us sort the results based on the \u2018Mean AUC\u2019 value which is nothing but the model\u2019s ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes.", "Step 15.2. Visualize Classification Algorithms Accuracy Comparisons:", "Using Area under ROC Curve: From the first iteration of baseline classification algorithms, we can see that Logistic Regression and SVC have outperformed the other five models for the chosen dataset with the highest mean AUC Scores. Let\u2019s reconfirm our results in the second iteration as shown in the next steps.", "Step 15.3. Get the right parameters for the baseline models: Before doing the second iteration, let\u2019s optimize the parameters and finalize the evaluation metrics for model selection.", "Identify the optimal number of K neighbors for KNN Model: In the first iteration, we assumed that K = 3, but in reality, we don\u2019t know what is the optimal K value that gives maximum accuracy for the chosen training dataset. Therefore, let us write a for loop that iterates 20 to 30 times and gives the accuracy at each iteration so as to figure out the optimal number of K neighbors for the KNN Model.", "As we can see from the above iterations, if we use K = 22, then we will get the maximum score of 78%.", "Identify the optimal number of trees for Random Forest Model: Quite similar to the iterations in the KNN model, here we are trying to find the optimal number of decision trees to compose the best random forest.", "As we could see from the iterations above, the random forest model would attain the highest accuracy score when its n_estimators = 72.", "Step 15.4. Compare Baseline Classification Algorithms (2nd Iteration):", "In the second iteration of comparing baseline classification algorithms, we would be using the optimised parameters for KNN and Random Forest models. Also, we know that false negatives are more costly than false positives in a churn and hence let\u2019s use precision, recall and F2 scores as the ideal metric for the model selection.", "From the 2nd iteration, we can definitely conclude that logistic regression is an optimal model of choice for the given dataset as it has relatively the highest combination of precision, recall and F2 scores; giving most number of correct positive predictions while minimizing the false negatives. Hence, let's try to use Logistic Regression and evaluate its performance in the forthcoming sections.", "Step 16: Train & evaluate Chosen Model: Let\u2019s fit the selected model (Logistic Regression in this case) on the training dataset and evaluate the results.", "k-Fold Cross-Validation: Model evaluation is most commonly done through \u2018K- fold Cross-Validation\u2019 technique that primarily helps us to fix the variance. Variance problem occurs when we get good accuracy while running the model on a training set and a test set but then the accuracy looks different when the model is run on another test set.", "So, in order to fix the variance problem, k-fold cross-validation basically split the training set into 10 folds and train the model on 9 folds (9 subsets of the training dataset) before testing it on the test fold. This gives us the flexibility to train our model on all ten combinations of 9 folds; giving ample room to finalize the variance.", "Therefore, our k-fold Cross Validation results indicate that we would have an accuracy anywhere between 76% to 84% while running this model on any test set.", "Visualize results on a Confusion Matrix: The Confusion matrix indicates that we have 208+924 correct predictions and 166+111 incorrect predictions.", "Accuracy rate = number of correct predictions/ total predictions * 100Error rate = Number of wrong predictions / total predictions * 100", "We have got an accuracy of 80%; signalling the characteristics of a reasonably good model.", "Evaluate the model using ROC Graph: It\u2019s good to re-evaluate the model using ROC Graph. ROC Graph shows us the capability of a model to distinguish between the classes based on the AUC Mean score. The orange line represents the ROC curve of a random classifier while a good classifier tries to remain as far away from that line as possible. As shown in the graph below, the fine-tuned Logistic Regression model showcased a higher AUC score.", "Step 17:Predict Feature Importance: Logistic Regression allows us to determine the key features that have significance in predicting the target attribute (\u201cChurn\u201d in this project).", "The logistic regression model predicts that the churn rate would increase positively with month to month contract, optic fibre internet service, electronic checks, absence of payment security and tech support.", "On the other hand, the model predicts a negative correlation with churn if any customer has subscribed to online security, one-year contract or if they have opted for mailed checks as their payment medium.", "Model improvement basically involves choosing the best parameters for the machine learning model that we have come up with. There are two types of parameters in any machine learning model \u2014 the first type are the kind of parameters that the model learns; the optimal values automatically found by running the model. The second type of parameters is the ones that user get to choose while running the model. Such parameters are called the hyperparameters; a set of configurable values external to a model that cannot be determined by the data, and that we are trying to optimize through Parameter Tuning techniques like Random Search or Grid Search.", "Hyperparameter tuning might not improve the model every time. For instance, when we tried to tune the model further, we ended up getting an accuracy score lower than the default one. I\u2019m just demonstrating the steps involved in hyperparameter tuning here for future references.", "Step 18:Hyper parameter Tuning via Grid Search:", "Step 18.2: Final Hyperparameter tuning and selection:", "Step 19: Compare predictions against the test set:", "Step 20: Format Final Results: Unpredictability and risk are the close companions of any predictive models. Therefore in the real world, its always a good practice to build a propensity score besides an absolute predicted outcome. Instead of just retrieving a binary estimated target outcome (0 or 1), every \u2018Customer ID\u2019 could get an additional layer of propensity score highlighting their percentage of probability to take the target action.", "Lastly, deploy the model to a server using \u2018joblib\u2019 library so that we can productionize the end-to-end machine learning framework. Later we can run the model over any new dataset to predict the probability of any customer to churn in months to come.", "So, in a nutshell, we made use of a customer churn dataset from Kaggle to build a machine learning classifier that predicts the propensity of any customer to churn in months to come with a reasonable accuracy score of 76% to 84%.", "I have learned (and continue to learn) from many folks in Github. Hence sharing my entire python script and supporting files in a public GitHub Repository in case if it benefits any seekers online.
