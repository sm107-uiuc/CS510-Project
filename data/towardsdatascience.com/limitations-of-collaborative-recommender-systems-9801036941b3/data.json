It started out as a very informal side project and went through several iterations, never serious or important enough to document. Perhaps this was a fitting reflection of the nature of zines. Short for \u201cmagazines,\u201d these self-published creations are a kind of documentation themselves \u2014 but can also be limited, transient, and prone to disappearing.", "I didn\u2019t start keeping records of anything until two major changes happened in mid-2016:", "Both of these changes meant being accountable to people besides myself. And it meant keeping track of sales and trades instead of just giving things away all willy-nilly.", "The initial impulse to make a simple recommender system came from a few places:", "The plan was to build a recommender system using collaborative filtering based on purchases. You\u2019ve seen systems like this any time you\u2019ve seen something that starts with \u201cPeople who bought this also bought\u2026\u201d, \u201cPeople who listen to this also listen to\u2026\u201d, etc.", "I planned to pull the records from transactions made through Square and on the Stay Kind! website. The Square transactions capture sales and trades made in-person during events. The website is powered by WooCommerce and ended up being a little trickier because of its report options. I ended up grabbing the online sale info from a separate spreadsheet I\u2019d created to track transactions.", "Between the two data sets, I had records for (probably) all of the sales and trades made from spring of 2016 to the present. At one point, a library purchased two copies of all 48 titles I had in stock at the time. I excluded this sale from the final data set.", "As was expected, the bulk of the transactions came from events and were captured in the Square reports. The challenge here was that the majority of these purchases were made with cash. While I could group items that were purchased together, I wasn\u2019t able to group purchases made by the same person at different events unless they paid with a card and used the same card each time. One person had used at least two different cards to purchase zines at three different events plus from the website. I was able to group these purchases because the person had the same name associated with all of their cards, but they were the exception to the rule.", "(During this part of the process, I also noticed that one person had the name Emma Goldman associated with their card. While there\u2019s a chance this is the person\u2019s actual name, I\u2019m much more inclined to believe this is a nod to the activist who is often misquoted as saying, \u201cIf I can\u2019t dance to it, it\u2019s not my revolution.\u201d Either way, I got a good laugh out of it.)", "Anyway, after combining, cleaning up, and anonymizing the data sets, I ended up with something that looked like this:", "From this snippet, we can see that both Customers #544 and #527 purchased the June and July 2015 issues of Ima Eat You!", "Now that we have a single DataFrame indicating which customers have which items, we\u2019re ready to build the recommender based on purchases. The steps I took are:", "Here is a portion of that final DataFrame:", "The closer a value is to 0, the more similar the two items are in terms of if they have been purchased by the same people. So an item cross-referenced with itself will always equal 0.", "Meanwhile, a value of 1 indicates that the two items have never been purchased by the same people. Looking at an example above, this means that no one who has bought 1 1/2 Weeks has also bought 9 Love Potions.", "Let\u2019s look at a few examples to get an idea of how well this recommender is actually doing.", "Ang Pangalawang Pagtatapat: The Second Confessions", "Here is the description from the website:", "The second issue of the zine series, Confessions, about insecurities and the nature of Philippine politics and the Filipino mindset. By Siomai Charlene.", "And the recommendations based on what people who bought this also bought:", "The first two recommendations, Confessions and Kulay Ng Balat, are actually part of the same zine series offering reflections on race. If you hate someone\u2026 is another zine by the same creator. Living Southerners is a series by a different creator who also talks specifically about race. Overall, this set of recommendations is pretty good.", "Anxiety Toolkit is a one-off zine I made in 48 hours specifically for the Brooklyn Zine Fest 2014. It\u2019s a list of 15 tools one can use to de-escalate anxiety (along with descriptions of how/why these tools work for me). By Anne H.", "And the recommendations based on what people who bought this also bought:", "The results for this one are a little more mixed. While this zine has \u201ctoolkit\u201d in the title and does include de-escalation strategies, the creator writes in a very casual tone and shares personal stories. In this way, it is actually similar to recommended titles like Kulay Ng Balat and Fixer Eraser #2. Other titles are more obvious. Shrinks, How to Love Me, Become Worry-Free Right Now, and Everything is Going to Be Okay all address mental health, mindfulness, or self-care strategies.", "A perzine by Dawn \u201cZilla\u201d Graham mostly covering day-to-day experiences, observations, and thoughts. June 2011 includes finding a new apartment, being a pushover, trip to Boston, therapy, classes, a fable, recipes, going to court, sexual violence, and more.", "And the recommendations based on purchases:", "In this case, only five items are recommended based on people\u2019s purchases. All other items had a distance of 1, meaning that \u2014 according to the records \u2014 no one who got this issue of Ima Eat You! also got any other items besides those named above. Three of the five items were also made by me.", "It\u2019s also important to note that the total number sold is 5 \u2014 much less than the 20+ sold of the two previous examples. The majority of copies of this issue of Ima Eat You! had been given away long before I started tracking this stuff. While both Ang Pangalawang Pagtatapat and Anxiety Toolkit have been restocked by their creators multiple times, all copies of this issue of Ima Eat You! have been claimed and will never be reprinted.", "The last example starts to expose some of the limitations of this kind of recommender system applied to something like a zine distro. Let\u2019s dive deeper into this:", "Zines are often available in limited quantities. Some may not be replaced after they run out. Because of this, the timeframe that a zine is available can also be limited. Depending on when a zine was first added to the distro, or when it went out of stock, it will be available at the same time as only a portion of the other zines listed on the website. This raises two issues. There is the \u201ccold start\u201d problem when a zine is first added, meaning there is no previous purchase history to inform recommendations. And people are not choosing from the same overall selection.", "Likewise, not all available zines are displayed at events due to limited table space. Since people get most of their zines from Stay Kind! at events rather than through the website, this matters a lot. As zines sell out, I\u2019ll replace their spot on the table with other ones. The display is often completely different at the beginning of the day than at the end of the day. Anxiety Toolkit has sold out within the first hour of an event before. It\u2019s very likely that people who came by after and got other zines would have been interested in getting that one too \u2014 if it had still been available.", "On the other side, there have been people who got a couple zines at the beginning of an event, then came by later and got more because they saw new ones on display. This brings us back to another limitation. Since most sales are made in-person, with cash, purchases made by the same person generally can\u2019t be grouped together, even when made on the same day.", "Finally, while this recommender system does provide accurate information about items that were purchased together, it\u2019s not a great indicator of what people actually like. The nice part about most of the transactions happening in-person is that people had a chance to browse through first. This implies they liked what they saw enough to go ahead and get it. Most of the zines I carry are text-heavy. While there are some people who will stand there and read an entire zine before getting it (or not), the majority won\u2019t know until later how they feel about their new zine. There are also cases where people get something for themselves as well as gifts for other people \u2014 so zines purchased together don\u2019t necessarily reflect one person\u2019s preferences.", "(After naming all of these limitations, I feel compelled to name an upside to this little project: The collaborative recommender based on purchases was fast and easy to build. Writing this article has taken significantly longer than the data collection, preprocessing, and creation of the recommender system combined.)", "There are ways to build a better recommender system for the distro. Some ideas include:", "Thanks for reading! Thoughts, questions, and feedback are always appreciated. You can also check out the GitHub repo for this project.", "Your home for data science.
