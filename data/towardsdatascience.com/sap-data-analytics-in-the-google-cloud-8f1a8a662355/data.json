However, the combination of GCP and SAP is also possible for companies who are still living in the ERP world.", "These following points show possibilities of loading data from SAP to Google Services:", "Therefore, a possible solution could look like this:", "Getting the data is the first step. Afterwards, you will deal with the question of how to realize a delta logic, because you probably don\u2019t want to load all the data on a regular basis via full load. This would only come with disadvantages like heavy loading times and also having no historical data. Especially departments like controlling, internal audit, etc. often build up their data analytics based on historical data views.", "While the SAP Data Service comes already build in with a CDC wizard, other data integration approaches might need some extra work. To realize this step it\u2019s important to get to know the SAP tables and table structure very well. Realizing the delta load on an own logic can be realized especially with the help of two tables: CDHDR (Changes Header) and CDPOS (Changes Position). These tables are tracking changes in master data or transactional data.", "With the new era of column based data warehousing tools such as BigQuery, data transformation is often necessary due to performance but also because of different table structures or data types between the source and target system.", "One example is, that in SAP you have the tables BKPF (Accounting Document Header) and BSEG (Accounting Document Segment). Due to its column based structure it will make sense to denormalize the data within the BigQuery. The solution could be to join BKPF and BSEG and, if needed other master data and reference tables \u2014 for example with the help of the build in BigQuery DTS (Data Transfer Service). As a result, you can come up with a denormalized data object architecture as shown in the figure below:", "Another transformation to gain performance and cost efficiency could be to use nested data structures. Newer data warehouse technologies like BigQuery or Amazon\u2019s Redshift do work better with this data structure. Use cases for working with nested data are e.g header/segment tables like BKPF and BSEG or if you have cases where a table holds columns which don\u2019t change much, like:", "combined with historically often changeable columns like [2]:", "The last part would be to realize reports and data analytic possibilities. With BigQuery, the data analyst already has a great tool for analytics. Data scientists can use Data Lab or one of the many ML Services within the GCP. Data Studio could be the right solution for business users for sharing KPI\u2019s, dashboards, etc. To implement a Role/User access model within the BigQuery ,it\u2019s a common way to use the BUKRS attribute (Company Code) \u2014 so a user would only see data of the company code assigned to him, that\u2019s also the way SAP handles user rights.", "Conclusion \u2014 the combination of SAP and GCP could lead to significant data analytics competencies and possibilities in your company. SAP systems are hosting a lot of interesting data that wants to be analyzed while GCP comes with many data analytics/scientist tools and services which will enable to do so.", "Your home for data science.
