It is a flexible, powerful and easy to use tool.", "Lets get started, shall we? \ud83d\udc4c", "a) Making Pandas faster using Numba", "What is Numba? It is an open source just in time (JIT) compiler that translates a Python and Numpy code into faster machine translation code. In other words, it can help execute Numpy expressions on multiple CPU cores.", "The apply() function can leverage Numba by just specifying the engine keyword as \u2018numba\u2019. This makes executing functions easier for datasets which are large in size (1 million rows or greater).", "For this functionality, Numba library should have the version 0.46.0 or greater.", "In previous versions of Pandas, strings were stored in object numpy arrays. With the new version, a type dedicated to string data is added \u2014 StringDType. This solves a number of problems such as:", "To use this functionality, we can explicitly set the dtype as string.", "In previous version of Pandas, the boolean arrays could just hold either True or False values. Missing data could not be incorporated into these arrays. Now a new type dedicated to boolean type is created \u2014 BooleanDType that can hold missing values. A new mask has been created for the missing values.", "This is important for data analysts since they are always dealing with missing values and using this type would make the data set more defined.", "d) Handling parquet files becomes easier", "For those who have been working with PySpark, some times data analysts process the data in Spark and save it as a Parquet file. Then, they prefer do the less \u2018heavy lifting\u2019 part by using Pandas on the parquet file. But if the parquet file has a user defined schema, previous versions in Pandas throw an error that it cannot integrate the schema in Pandas.", "In the newer version, Pandas handles the schema argument for user defined schema. schema now handles the schema argument in conjunction with the pyarrow engine.", "When you have trained a model or done some analysis on data, one generates tables (for results). These tables need to be written in markdown or latex \u2014 during or post while one is working for reporting purposes.", "Writing documentations has become easier in the newer format since one can convert the DataFrame objects into markdown format as output. This is really a nice feature since now markdown for tables can be generated on the fly.", "Also multiple bugs have been fixed across various topics such as plotting, I/O, datetime etc. More information for these can be found on the Pandas documentation for 1.0.0.", "To install Pandas using pip (for first time users):", "For users who already have an older version of Pandas but want to upgrade:", "and also thanks to all the contributors/developers who have been managing and developing Pandas \ud83c\udf89.", "I hope you find this article interesting and useful.
