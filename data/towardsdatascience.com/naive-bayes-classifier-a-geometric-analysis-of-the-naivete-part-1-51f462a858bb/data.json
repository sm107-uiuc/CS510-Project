What is the curse of dimensionality? As the the number of features (dimensions) increase linearly, the amount of training data required for classification increases exponentially. If the classification is determined by a single feature we need a-priori classification data over a range of values for this feature, so we can predict the class of a new data point. For a feature x with 100 possible values, the required training data is of order O(100). But if there is a second feature y as well that is needed to determine the class, and y has 50 possible values, then we will need training data of order O(5000) \u2014 i.e. over the grid of possible values for the pair \u201cx, y\u201d. Thus the measure of the required data is the volume of the feature space and it increases exponentially as more features are added.", "But is this always this bad? Are there some simplifying assumptions we can make to decrease the amount of data required, even while keeping all the features? In the above example we said we needed training measurements of order O(5000). But naive bayes classifier needs measurements of order only O(150) \u2014 i.e. just a linear increase, not an exponential one! That is fantastic but we know there is no free lunch and naive bayes classifier should be making some simplifying (naive?) assumptions. That is the purpose of this post \u2014 examine the impact of naivete in the naive bayes classifier that allows it to side-step the curse of dimensionality. On a practical note, we do not want the algebra to detract us from appreciating what we are after, so we stick to 2 dimensions x,y and 2 classes C_1 and C_2.", "Decision boundary is a curve in our 2-dimensional feature space that separates the two classes C_1 and C_2. In Figure 1, the zone where y-f(x)>0 indicates class C_1 and y -f(x)<0 indicates C_2. Along the decision boundary y = f(x), and the probability of belonging to either class is equal. Equal probability of either class is the criterion to obtain the decision boundary.", "The objective of this post is to analyse the impact of nonlinearities in the decision boundary and the coupled issues that arise from unbalanced class sizes. The overall outline for this post is as follows.", "The content of the post is somewhat academic as with real data we do not know the true decision boundary, have to deal with data noise, and do not know which features are actually responsible for classification we seek etc\u2026 But the point here is to understand the impact of naivete assumption in an idealized setting so we would be better equipped to apply and interpret the naive bayes classifier for real data.", "Naive bayes classification is based on Bayes rule that relates conditional and marginal probabilities. It is well described in literature so we simply write the equations down for a 2 class (C_1 and C_2) situation with 2 features x,y.", "For any new measurement x,y we would compute P(C_1|x,y) and P(C_2|x,y), as per Equation 1 and pick the class with the larger value. As the denominator is the same it is easier to just compute their ratio so we do not have to evaluate P(x,y).", "P(C_i) is the probability for any measurement to fall into the class C_i . It is computed easily enough from the training data as the relative abundance of C_i samples. It is the computation of P(x,y|C_i) that is fraught with the challenge of data requirements we talked about. To do it right we need to estimate the joint probability distribution of x,y in each class C_i and that requires training data on a grid of x,y values. That is where the naive part of naive bayes comes in to alleviate the curse of dimensionality.", "If the features x,y were to be uncorrelated, given the class C_i then the joint probability distribution would simply be the product of individual probabilities. That is", "If we make this assumption then we only need to estimate P(x|C_i) and P(y|C_i) separately. And that only requires training data on the range of x and on the range of y \u2014 not on a grid of x,y values. Using Equation 2 in Equation 1 we get the ratio of the class probabilities for a new x,y measurement and its class assignment thereof to be as follows", "While the naive assumption of uncorrelated features simplifies things, its validity is open to question. If for example xy < 1 in a class, then the probability of finding large x values will be higher when y is small, and lower when y is large. In fact the probability of finding the measurement [x=0.9,y=1.1] in this class will be unity, whereas it would be zero for the measurement [x=0.9,y=1.2]. Clearly, the probability distributions of x and y will not in general be independent of each other and making the naive assumption of independence can lead to incorrect class assignment for new data.", "If we can obtain P(x|C_i) and P(y|C_i) as functions of x,y then we have the ratio in Equation 3 as a function of x,y.", "Consider Figure 2 where the true decision boundary y = f(x), splits the feature space into two classes. To keep the algebra at bay, we further take f to be explicitly invertible so we can write x = f^-1(y). The a-priori probability of a class is proportional to its overall size \u2014 area in this case.", "To compute P(x|C_i), imagine that we discretized the x-axis and picked a small rectangular strip of width \u03b4x around x as shown in Figure 2. The area of the strip in class C_i divided by the class area A_i would be the probability P (x|C_i). Likewise for the probability P (y|C_i)", "The longer x_1 is, the higher the probability of P(y|C_1) would be. Likewise a larger y_2 implies a higher probability for P(x|C_2) and so forth. Once we appreciate this, the rest is simply geometry and algebra. Combining Equations 4 and 5 with naive bayes classification in Equation 3, we get:", "The locus of x,y for which the ratio above equals unity is the decision boundary as predicted by the naive bayes classifier.", "For an intuitive understanding of Equation 7 consider the case of a linear decision boundary with equal/unequal class sizes in Figure 3. When class sizes are equal as in Figure 3.1 the decision boundary would be the diagonal, and for every point on the diagonal, the area of the rectangle ABOC equals the area of the rectangle ODEF. But that is nothing but a statement about the equality of x_1 y_1 and x_2 y_2 for any point on the diagonal. Thus as per Equation 7 the decision boundary predicted by naive bayes will match the diagonal \u2014 the true decision boundary. In Figure 3.2 however, the class sizes are not the same and the areas of these two rectangles do not have to be equal for every point on the separation boundary. So we cannot expect naive bayes to yield the true decision boundary even in the linear case when the class sizes are not the same. We shall verify this again analytically in the next section.", "That completes our general method for deriving the decision boundaries as predicted by naive bayes. For the remainder of the post we choose different functional forms for the true decision boundary f(x) and contrast that with what we get from naive bayes.", "We start with the linear case in Figure 4 where a straight line y = qx/a separates the two classes in a rectangular feature space. When q equals b we get balanced classes.", "The class areas A_1, A_2 and the lengths x_1, x_2, y_1, and y_2 follow directly from the geometry. Using them in Equation 7 and simplifying we get the decision boundary as predicted by naive bayes to be a hyperbola.", "With the closed-form solution in hand for the predicted separation boundary, we can look at the impact of class size and asymptotics thereof when the size of class A_1 keeps increasing while A_2 stays constant. This is achieved through increasing b while holding a and q constant.", "When b = q, the class sizes would be equal and the separation boundary reduces to:", "which is the true decision boundary. That is, naive bayes classification will have no error when the classes are separated by straight line and have the same size. This is a rigorous proof of the same geometric argument made in Figure 3.", "Figure 5 shows the predicted decision boundaries as b is increased (i.e. we drag the top-boundary of the feature space), thus increasing A_1 while holding A_2 constant. In all the cases the naive bayes predictions start off favoring class C_2 (the predicted boundaries are above the true boundary \u2014 meaning a preference to classify a true C_1 measurement as C_2) for smaller x and switching over to prefer class C_1 as x increases. It is interesting however that they all switch over at the same point on the true decision boundary.", "The switch over point (x*, y*) is the intersection of the true decision boundary and the predicted decision boundary. Using y = qx/a in in Equation 8 and simplifying we get,", "The coordinates of this point are independent of b, the only variable across the different curves. Hence they all intersect the true boundary at the same point.", "As b increases, the ratio A_1/A_2 increases. In the limit as b goes to infinity, we get the asymptotic prediction boundary y_s(x).", "We now consider the case in Figure 6 where a parabolic decision boundary y=x^2 separates the two classes.", "Once again the expressions for x_1, y_1, x_2, and y_2 as functions of x,y follow directly from the geometry. Applying Equation 7 and simplifying we get y as a fourth order function of x for the predicted decision boundary", "Figure 7 shows the predicted decision boundary Vs the true boundary as the class size A_2 is varied while holding A_1 constant. This is simply done by dragging the right-boundary of the feature space, i.e changing a.", "Here are a few quick observations that are in contrast with the linear case.", "yielding the intersection point to be independent of a thus proving the observation.", "As a increases, the area A_2 increases. In the limit as a goes to infinity, we get the asymptotic prediction boundary y_s(x).", "We have derived closed-form solutions to the decision boundaries predicted by naive bayes classifier, when the true decision boundary is known between 2 classes with 2 features. We picked simple linear and nonlinear boundaries and evaluated the impact of class sizes and asymptotics thereof when one class overwhelms the other. The next steps are as follows.", "As this post is getting too long so will take up the above and more in the next post in this series.", "Originally published at xplordat.com on August 6, 2018.", "Your home for data science.
