I encourage you to explore them. This particular dataset was called \u201cPrisoners in 2015.\u201d", "Just so we are all on the same page here, the BJS measures \u201ccapacity\u201d in three ways: the operational capacity, which is the \u201cNumber of inmates that can be accommodated based on a facility\u2019s staff, existing programs and services,\u201d and the rated capacity, which is \u201ca rating given by officials,\u201d and finally design capacity, which is, \u201chow many inmates architects/planners originally intended for facilities.\u201d", "In short, each of these numbers will be slightly different, so how one defines \u201ccapacity\u201d will lead to different conclusions. For example, a prison might be 110% overcapacity if we use the operational capacity, but only 95% capacity if we use the rated capacity.", "This dataset was particularly annoying to deal with because for some reason the \u2026 weren\u2019t being dealt with correctly until I manually copy and pasted the values using double quotes.", "Now, our population stats are a little bit off because those numbers include children under the age of 18. In order to be fair, we will estimate the number of state residents over the age of 18. According to Google, in the USA about 76% of the population is older than 18. So we will reduce the population for each state by 24%. That\u2019s our figure for \u201cprison age population.\u201d", "So, according to these data, Alaska and Delaware both have nearly 1% of their populations in state prisons. This does not include jail populations, and so should be considered a conservative estimate. Note: An attentive reader (working for Alaska\u2019s Department of Corrections) has pointed out to me that the above graphic may be slightly misleading for the following reason.", "Alaska works differently from other states and essentially has no jail system. Defendants in Alaska awaiting trial and sentencing are held in state custody in a prison, whereas in most other states these persons would be placed in a jail. In other words, the Alaska data includes jail population. It\u2019s possible Delaware also has a similar system, which might explain why Delaware and Alaska appear to be outliers in the above chart.", "We see Illinois clearly out in the lead with the most overcrowded prisons. Does anyone know why it\u2019s particularly bad there?", "This article suggests it\u2019s due to problems with Illinois\u2019 sentencing laws.", "New Mexico and Mississippi seem to have the least overcrowded prisons. Nevertheless, there are reports like these that suggest the NM prison population is increasing fast. Keep in mind these were 2015 numbers.", "It\u2019s often mentioned that the cost of housing/feeding/medical care for inmates is high.", "Google tells me that the average annual cost per inmate is about $31,100. That works out to about $84 per day. Most of the hotels I stay in cost less than that. Some states, such as NY, pay as much as $60,000 a year to take care of state prison inmates.", "UPDATE I found the actual amounts states spend per inmate per year and they vary widely. So when we use the true amounts, this chart looks very different. (I previously used the state average, $31,000, to estimate state spending. It turns out if you do this, Texas spends by far the most \u2014 more than California. But in reality, Texas spends way less per inmate than California, so the total expenditures are lower.)", "We will use the data from the website vera.org that has some nice articles discussing prison reform in the USA. Then we will use the Rvest package to download the table data and extract the numbers.", "The sad thing about this is that Texas and Florida have a lot of prisoners, relatively speaking, yet they spend so little on each one that the total expenditure is somewhat low. I don\u2019t know how or why they can spend so little on the prisoners.", "Vera.org suggested that instead of dividing expenditures by the prison population, it might make more sense to divide the expenditures by the state population. Vera.org notes that states with high inmate costs arise because these states have a lower personnel-to-inmate ratio and higher average salaries in those states.", "Let\u2019s make this bar chart again, but this time we\u2019ll look at the inmate spending per taxpayer (18 years or older).", "This graphic paints a very different picture than the previous per inmate spending. Now states with low incarceration rates will be equalized. So for example, Utah has a low incarceration rate and low per inmate spending and so has a low per taxpayer expenditure. Recall earlier that we saw that both Alaska and Delaware had nearly 1% of the adult population in prison.", "Due to the relatively high incarceration rates and spending per inmate, their per taxpayer costs are pretty high.", "Finally, is there any connection between spending and being overcapacity? We would expect that more spending is correlated to less overcrowding, right?", "This is interesting. There appears to be no relationship between a state\u2019s per inmate spending and the overcapacity. Essentially this implies that most of the inmate spending is not being used to alleviate overcrowding, although it might be going towards higher salaries for guards and medical services, for example.", "Secondly, the relationship between per taxpayer spending on inmates and overcapacity is positive. Somehow spending more per taxpayer is associated with more overcrowding in prisons. This is pretty counter-intuitive. Is it a coincidence that two of the states with the highest per taxpayer spending are states with relatively high incarceration rates and small populations?", "Overall, there does seem to be a relationship, albeit relatively weak, between a state\u2019s population and overcrowded-ness. Perhaps states tend to build similar numbers of state prisons, regardless of population size, thus resulting in slightly more crowded prisons in states with bigger populations?", "I was surprised to find that Illinois leads the country in overcrowded prisons and that Alaska and Delaware keep the highest percentage of citizens in state prisons, and if you look at the spending per taxpayer, these states are the top two in the country.", "As far as per inmate spending goes, California is in a league of its own. But if you look at it in terms of per taxpayer spending, California doesn\u2019t look so bad. All of this goes to show that subtle changes in computation can lead to very different conclusions. If I wanted to push for prison reform, I might cite the statistic that California pays way more per inmate than any other state. Yet, if I look at the per taxpayer spending, California does better and now it doesn\u2019t seem like immediate reform is so urgent.", "Your home for data science.
