Nearly all of the most popular languages can be translated live using software such as Google Translate. The software used is mainly based on an NLP algorithm which takes in one language through text and produces its translation through text. For true live translation, some software utilize voices via a mic to translate a message without having the user type it in. This works great for spoken languages. But what about the 70 million individuals who either can\u2019t speak or can\u2019t hear and use sign language as a means of communication. Sign language is a different language in that it can\u2019t be spoken. If it can\u2019t be spoken, then it can\u2019t be translated by any current translation software. So how do you translate sign language? With a camera of course and a bit of AI magic! Current sign language translators utilize cameras to translate such as SIGNALL, who uses colored gloves, and multiple cameras to understand the signs. Cameras are a method of giving computers vision, allowing them to see the world. I decided to try and build my own sign language translator. Since I live in the US, an ASL (American Sign Language) translator made the most sense.", "Convolution Neural Nets(CNN) are one of the ways in which a computer can classify an image. They can train on thousands of photos, and learn to classify each one in its correct category, or translation in this case. I chose to do a simple ASL translation, where I translated the ASL alphabet. It consists of 26 hand signs and one delete and space sign. I translated the signs into English letters. Before I get into the code, I\u2019ll give a brief overview of CNNs.", "CNNs are really cool in that they can classify images. It\u2019s quite easy for a human to identify the difference between two items, such as a dog and a cat, but it\u2019s is a lot harder for a computer to do this. Computers don\u2019t truly \u201csee\u201d images. They read them as a series of numbers arranged in an array. A CNN consists of multiple layers. The layers are usually convolutional, pooling and fully-connected layers.", "The convolutional layer consists of a kernel/filter with a designated size that slides, or convolves, over the pixels multiplying and summing values, finally outputting it into a new smaller simplified matrix. The filter travels over every pixel in the photo creating a new matrix called a feature matrix. This new smaller matrix is important because it highlights the most important features(hence the name) in the picture. It is also easier to train on because smaller = less weights = less training required to identify those weights.", "The next layer is a pooling layer. The pooling layer further reduces the matrix size. It passes a pooling kernel over the feature matrix and takes either the highest pixel value(max-pooling) or the average(average-pooling). In my case, I did max-pooling because it takes the more extreme features in the image such as the edges, which are important in identifying hand signs. Now we have an even smaller matrix with less weights and less required training. This matrix contains all the higher level details in the picture.", "Now we move on to the fully connected layer. Here\u2019s where the classification happens. The matrix is first flattened into a vector and then passed through a neural net. The neural net it passes through is similar to an Artificial Neural Net in that it passes the vector through, applying weights and biases finally ending up with a classification. The CNN classifies the image by using a softmax activation function which gives the probability the input is from a certain class.", "See the full code in the GitHub repository here to follow along:", "The input into these layers is the ASL data-set which can be found here. The data is organized into 29 folders with 3000 pictures in each folder for each letter of the alphabet. The 3 extra folders are space, delete and nothing. I organized the data such that 80% of the photos are in training, and 20% are in validation. In addition, to speed up training I down-scaled all the pictures in the data-set to 48x48 from 200x200.", "4 convolutional and pooling layers were used in this model. For each layer, 5 actions are performed:", "The output of the first convolutional layer now becomes the input of the next layer. The matrix has already gotten smaller, but by passing it through more layers it becomes even smaller, showing only the key parts of the photo necessary for classification. These steps happen 4 times, the only thing changing is the filter size and number of filters used during convolution.", "After convolution, it\u2019s time for the fully-connected layers. But before that happens, the data is flattened into a single column vector.", "Now that we have defined the model, we have to train it. Training the model is where the CNN comes to life. Training is where the question of \u201cwhat are the weights for the filters and fully connected layers?\u201d is answered. A CNN uses backpropagation to define the weights for all the layers. Backpropagation consists of four steps: forward pass, loss function, backwards pass and finally weight update.", "The Forward pass consists of the image going through the model. At first, all the weights and biases are randomized, so the classification is also randomized. This is because the model and specifically the filters do not know how to identify the edges and features of the images.", "The classification accuracy is represented in the loss function. The loss function tells you how well your model categorized each image. It compares the predicted label of the image with the actual label of the training image. In our case, categorical crossentropy was used as the loss function.", "Next, is the backwards pass which identifies which weights caused the loss function to be high.", "When those weights are identified, the weights are updated such that the loss decreases. The learning rate specifies how much the weights can be changed. Eventually, the goal is to have the predicted label match up all the time with the actual label of the picture.", "After 50 epochs of training, the model achieved 100% validation accuracy within the dataset. That\u2019s quite impressive, but there is a clear reason why the model was able to achieve 100% accuracy: the dataset. When looking at the pictures for one category within the dataset, they are all practically the same photo on the same background. Thus, it was easy for the model to achieve 100% accuracy because there wasn\u2019t much variety between each photo resulting in high accuracy very quickly.", "I still wanted to make the model perform live predictions to stay true to the goal of making a live translator. Using cv2, I was able to utilize the webcam on my laptop to capture frames and send them through the model to predict what class each frame was.", "It worked! It was able to predict most letters, but at times struggled due to the limited scope of the dataset and my lack of knowledge about sign language. It also only translated the ASL alphabet not the words, but it\u2019s a start!", "This project was so much fun to make because the end result was so rewarding. Stay posted for my next build!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Hi! I\u2019m Vikram Menon!
