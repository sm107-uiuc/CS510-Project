It has affected the lives of many of us, and caused a huge turmoil across financial markets.", "As a data scientist there is one thing I can always rely on, even in these troubled times \u2014 data. Luckily, data on the COVID-19 spread can be found online (e.g data.humdata.org).", "While there have been many fields in which data science and machine learning methods have practically solved long-standing problems (language translation, image recognition and sentiment analysis, among many others), there is no possibility that these methods will magically \u201csolve\u201d the Coronavirus crisis; and yet\u2013 a better understanding of its behavior, a more careful analysis based on data and meaningful predictions can be beneficial for decision making and policy setting.", "So\u2026 what ML methods can we apply here?", "When starting to work with new data, good visualization can be helpful in many ways. Sometimes it\u2019s all you need! But it can always give insights, ideas and save a lot of time later when processing the data.", "One cool Python library which I recommend for geographical visualization is folium, which can be used to create interactive world maps.", "In the following example, I plotted the number of COVID-19 cases since the middle of February:", "One can also create a bar plot of the number of cases in different country. For these kind of plots, seaborn is an easy to use and useful library:", "(In this specific plot China indicates only the Hubei region, and US \u2014 only NY).", "Many other creative visualizations can be made, and they often provide us with easy to understand information which can be helpful!", "Prediction models can be useful in forecasting different future scenarios for time series data. Often these models require several assumptions on the data \u2014 and while I will not go over these assumptions here, one must be aware of these models\u2019 limitations and appropriate usage. In addition, there are several important concepts one needs to consider:", "Several libraries (in Python and also in R) can be used for such tasks. One I like in particular is prophet (fbprophet, by Facebook). Here are the number of cases in Japan, in normal and logarithmic scale:", "Belowis an example of a short-term prediction using prophet for the total number of cases. I assumed a logistic model of the logarithm of the number of cases; we know that the number of cases has a peak and then goes down, so in the long term, the number of active cases will look different.", "An early article I remember reading about the virus linked its potential spread to the weather, hoping that warmer climate can minimize its effectiveness.", "I wanted to dig deeper into this point, and to understand how \u201cthe weather\u201d affects the virus. This is a kind of a supervised learning problem: describing and predicting one dependent variable using several other independent variables.", "However, \u201cthe weather\u201d is a concept which has many meanings, and it is not too clear what feature engineering should be done from raw temperature data, say.", "A good way to begin is by looking at an example, so I began by examining the weather in Wuhan, the place where the virus first emerged in December 2019. I was able to find the temperature monitoring station data (ID CHM00057494) for the last months, and got the following graph:", "An interesting observation is that the average temperature seems to be quite volatile in this period of January \u2014 March; Moreover, there are several sharp \u201cdrops\u201d or \u201cspikes\u201d; this may hint us that this \u201cvolatility\u201d in the temperature can be a good feature for our model.", "What ML model should be used? This is always a good question, and with the variety of models out there, it is not always clear which one to choose (a reasonable approach is sometimes to try many of them and pick the best one by its performance on the test set!).", "Taking into account the observation from before, I will divide different countries according to their climate: Tropical, Dry, Moist Sub-Tropical, Moist Continental (and Polar, but not too many cases there!). I will use the KNN algorithm, which is sometimes (unjustifiably) not considered. It relies on averaging datapoints with similar, or \u201cclose\u201d statistics, to get a prediction for a desired datapoint. The features I will use are the number of cases over a time window, and the climate type; the simplicity of the KNN algorithm can prevent overfitting the result and is suitable for these situations. I will divide the data to before March 10th and after (train-test split in time). The sklearn library has an implementation of the KNN algorithm (sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor) but I decided to write my own version to customize the distance metric, and because it is a fairly simple algorithm to implement.", "The results I got are interesting \u2014 a 8.5% relative error between the predicted and actual value of the number of cases. The baseline (which is always important to define), which is just taking the previous day for the same country, has a 15.8% relative error. So we actually got a significant (!) improvement by using KNN and climate data.", "Some anecdotes for the predictions the model had for yesterday (March 20th):", "In conclusion, with machine learning I \u2014 who is no expert in infectious diseases \u2014 was able to gain a better understanding of the virus, and even a reasonable forecasting method, using pure ML methods.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
