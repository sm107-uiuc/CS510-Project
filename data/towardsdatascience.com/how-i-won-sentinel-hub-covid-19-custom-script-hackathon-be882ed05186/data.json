The competition was organized in collaboration with the Copernicus EU Earth Observation programme, the European Space Agency and AI4EO consortium.", "To look for new, innovative scripts, which enable users to make sense of Earth Observation data. It was designed to find solutions to the huge challenges in the new \u2018normal\u2019", "What was the objective of our submission:", "Covid-19 has led to many world governments enforcing emergency quarantine measures. What is the impact of such policies on the environment? Can we measure the change in pollution levels? Is there a co-relation to economic activity? And can we build leading indicators which enable us to measure economic activity at a global scale. Through our project, we tried to analyze satellite imagery to identify the answers.", "The tools make the man, or so they say!", "I always tell my team to first start, by researching the available tools. Because the right tools can make or break a project!", "The tools that were available for this project were:", "We first used Sentinel-5P data to plot NO2 levels. This was done to identify any anomalies (sudden changes) in the data. This was then collaborated with VHR imagery (Very high resolution imagery)", "Statistical analysis of this data was used to show a significant difference in countries like Germany (where the lockdown was strictly implemented) vs countries like Italy.", "I have uploaded the notebook used for plotting the above plot on euroData Cube\u2019s Contribution page. you can check it via the link given below:", "NO2 is produced by vehicular traffic and as un-burnt residue from chemical processes. This can be collaborated by counting cars from high resolution satellite imagery.", "We will now use Picterra\u2019s machine learning platform to identify vehicles in VHR imagery.", "We need to first login to Picterra\u2019s geo-spatial imagery platform. They have a free trial version, which you can use (without providing any credit cards!)", "Once on the home page, you can Create a new project", "Now you can upload images from your local drive (other options are Online map imagery OR the option to Buy satellite images). Once uploaded, you can then use it to train a detector.", "Once the images are uploaded, we then go to the training section. Here we can use the platform to train a detector. However there are pre-built detectors which you can use. But for this demo, we will train a new one", "Click on the Train a new detector", "There are some custom base models. We chose the Vehicles option", "There are two available detection type: i) Count and ii) Segmentation", "We select the default Count option. and then press the Create button", "Then add the images that you had added to the project. and press the Start Training button", "When you do it for the first time, Picterra gives you a nice video tutorial that walks you through the training process.", "The interface is very intuitive, and once you understand the controls, it becomes easy to navigate.", "First select the Training button to the left. After that you can select the area of interest, as marked by the yellow square. Clicking on the selected AOI, will zoom into the image", "Now click on the Polygon button and select the Circle option", "You can now click on each of the parked cars within the area of interest and draw a circle on top. This is now your annotated train dataset. You could have selected the polygon option and drawn a box across the car outline, but I am too lazy for that!", "Now select the Testing button on the left menu and click and mark the testing area on the image. You can annotate the testing dataset. But here I will skip that step \u2014 Just to check what happens!", "Now click on the Train Detector button at the top of the dashboard.", "Now you can go and have a coffee ( I prefer my masala chai!)", "can check the educational resources provided. Do check the Picterra University. It has some good resources on end-to-end machine learning for geo-spatial images.", "Since the training is now finished, let's go and check the performance of the detector.", "The performance is good\u2026but not great! At the bottom right, it has mis-identified the roof of the warehouse as a car.", "For a detector its important to know what it should not consider as an object. In machine learning terms - false positives should be low.", "So we will annotate some more vehicles for our training set. We select a larger area near our previous training set.", "Post training, I get a warning: it seems I have some overlapping annotations in the training set. which is true. This can cause mergers while running the inference jobs and give an incorrect count.", "Use the Select button on the left to select any of the annotations & modify the marker (green circle).", "Retraining the detector, we get the following output.", "Seems good. We have missed one large white vehicle at the left, but now the misclassification from the roof is missing. And it has got the car to the extreme left corner.", "The detector can be trained with more data. Let\u2019s now run the detector on the entire image to see the evaluation performance. We will also evaluate it on a new image.", "Press the Run Detector button in front of the image. A prompt informs you about the number of processing quota required for running the data. Since we are running on a free-quota, we press Start Detection.", "Viewing the results shows us the output of the detector", "We can also use this powerful platform, for other object detection activities, like solar-arrays, ships, trash, military vehicles etc.!", "Please check Picterra\u2019s blog for their recent success stories:", "Unless mentioned otherwise, the author owns the licenses to the images.", "Indian mosiac (NO2 levels) was created by the author using Sentinel-Hub Platform", "Time series plots for No2 levels in Germany & Italy were created by the author using code specified above", "Screenshots are from Picterra\u2019s geo-spatial platform", "Your home for data science.
