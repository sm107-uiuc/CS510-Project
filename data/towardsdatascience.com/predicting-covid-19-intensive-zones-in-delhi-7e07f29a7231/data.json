We are not health professionals or epidemiologists, and the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice. To learn more about the coronavirus pandemic, you can click here.", "Covid-19 is an infectious disease that has caused havoc in the modern world by disrupting the daily life of every civilian on earth. The virus which primarily affects the lungs has infected 4,543,390 people globally and 303,711 people have lost their lives because of it (as of 15th May 2020). The pandemic has forced world leaders to come up with stringent measures such as nation-wide lock-downs to curb the spread of the virus. But lock-downs are holding back civilians from working and earning a living, and its effect does not only trouble the poor but every section of the society, even the governments themselves. In such a situation, where economies fall and countries may be heading to recessions, people might be forced to head out and work and live along with the virus. This causes a huge risk to countries like mine, India, with an enormous population density.", "To foresee the effects of lifting lock-downs, my research and this notebook will help people understand which neighborhoods might see a surge in Covid-19 cases. I will be using population density data and location data of popular venues (like popular market places) to estimate the interaction occurring at a particular place. The neighborhoods will be clustered into groups so that common and effective strategies could be built to handle similar places. I will be focusing on the predictions mainly in my city (Delhi, the capital of India).", "With this, I hope readers can better understand potentially risky areas and authorities can take measures to place restrictions beforehand to such areas to reduce the spread of the virus and thus the suffering to civilian life.", "I hope and pray whoever reads this is safe.", "To solve the above problem, I have made use of the following data:", "There are 9 districts in Delhi and the neighborhoods are aggregated into one of these districts.", "Please note this data is according to Census 2011 which declares 9 districts as opposed to 11 districts as per the current situation. Therefore, I will be adding places in SOUTH EAST DELHI under SOUTH DELHI and places in SHAHDARA under EAST DELHI.", "This data would be used to define the neighborhoods when I will be plotting the results on the map. I used the help of the \u2018search\u2019 option in Google Maps to figure out the approximate coordinates of each neighborhood and created my own dataset.", "The Foursquare API provides data related to the frequency of occurrence of different venues at a particular place. I will be using the location data to identify clusters where the proximity of venues with high footfall (like markets) are present. These will be identified as hotspot neighborhoods.", "It is noted that Foursquare API doesn\u2019t have many details regarding venues in Delhi, therefore this is just an approximate picture of the real world. But we can surely say that it is a good approximation and will serve our needs.", "The population density data would be used to mark districts with a potentially high risk of community transmission due to the high proximity in living conditions.", "I created a data set of my own having the polygon coordinates of each district in Delhi. I made use of two websites \u2014 http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ and http://polygons.openstreetmap.fr/index.py to first extract the location of a place of the map and then extract its coordinates respectively.", "To predict the COVID Intensive Zones in Delhi, we shall perform the following steps:", "Initially, I started by visualizing the neighborhoods and the venues present in each neighborhood.", "Upon grouping the venues according to the neighborhoods, we see that only 161 neighborhoods were returned. This means that out of 177 neighborhoods, 16 had no venue results.", "Now, I created a table containing the Top 2 venue categories found in each neighborhood.", "According to the top venues found, I used KMeans Clustering to group similar neighborhoods. I made use of the Silhouette Score Comparison to find the optimum value of K (ie the number of clusters).", "The optimum value of K was found out to be 6, following which neighborhoods were clustered into 6 clusters using KMeans Clustering. The result was then merged into a single Data Frame.", "Upon creating a Choropleth map using the district-wise population density data, I arrived at this.", "Thereafter, I added the clusters of neighborhoods onto this map so we could know the neighborhood clusters and the degree of concern required for them according to the clustering attribute and population density at that place.", "With the help of the final map, we can see which all districts are vulnerable to the spread of the virus and also which neighborhoods in each district need to be taken special care of.", "Places with Red and Yellow markers (Most Concerning zones) especially in districts like North East Delhi, North Delhi, and Central can aggravate the situation if timely action is not taken. South West Delhi and North Delhi being a sparsely populated region should be the least concerning area in Delhi.", "The following improvements could be worked upon in future studies:", "Covid-19 has wreaked havoc all around the globe and almost half of the year has been now spent by all the people on earth in just fighting off the pandemic. With better strategies and more efficient systems, we should be able to tackle this problem in a better way so as to be done with it as soon as possible, for not just the welfare of all the people but also to safeguard the economies. I hope this project of mine aids in the formation of mitigation strategies so that we all could win this battle and return to our normal lives at the earliest.", "I would like to thank Coursera, IBM, and all the faculties involved with the Data Science Professional Certificate Courses for introducing me to Data Science and enabling me with all the skills required to conduct the analysis of the problem at hand and reach my results. Last but not the least, I hope and pray my readers are safe.", "Thank you for spending your valuable time in going through my work.", "Your home for data science.
