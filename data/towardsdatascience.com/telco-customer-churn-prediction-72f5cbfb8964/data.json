By being aware of and monitoring churn rate, companies are equipped to determine their customer retention success rates and identify strategies for improvement. We will use a machine learning model to understand the precise customer behaviors and attributes which signal the risk and timing of customer churn.", "We will use the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. The raw dataset contains 7043 entries. All entries have several features and a column stating if the customer has churned or not.To better understand the data we will first load it into pandas and explore it with the help of some very basic commands.", "df.info() gives us detailed information about every column. We can see that our data is divided into three types;", "The goal of this section is to get comfortable with our data. We will do bivariate analysis. It is the simplest form of analyzing data where we examine how each variable relates to the churn rate. For categorical features, we can use frequency table or bar plots which will calculate the number of each category in a particular variable. For numerical features, probability density plots can be used to look at the distribution of the variable.", "All visualizations for categorical variables will be done in tableau public.", "The following inferences can be made from the above bar plots;", "The churn percent is almost equal in case of Male and Females.", "The percent of churn is higher in case of senior citizens.", "The churn rate is higher in case of customers who have phone services.", "Customers with Partners and Dependents have lower churn rate as compared to those who don\u2019t have partners & Dependents.", "Customers with an electronic payment method have a higher churn rate compared to other payment methods.", "Customers with no internet service has a lower churn rate.", "Churn rate is much higher in case of Fiber Optic InternetServices. Customers who do not have services like OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, and TechSupport have left the platform in the past month.", "Now let's look at the numerical variables.", "This section is a fundamental part of machine learning. If this section is not done properly, our model will not work. In this section we will clean up our dataset by dropping irrelevant data, treating missing values, and converting our variables to the proper data type.", "Treating Irrelevant data & missing values", "In our dataset, we can see that customer ID is not needed for our model so we drop the variable. We do not need to treat missing values as there are none in this dataset.", "Machine learning works with only numerical values. Therefore, we need to convert our categorical values to numerical values. By using the Pandas function \u201cget_dummies()\u201d, we can replace the gender column with \u201cgender_Female\u201d and \u201cgender_Male\u201d. We will use df.info() to show us which ones are categorical and numerical.", "From the results above, we can see that the variables with the object datatype need to be converted to numerical.", "It is always advisable to use df.info() to check that all our variables were converted to the appropriate data type. After this step, I noticed that total charges still had an object data type. Hence, I will use pd.numeric() function to convert it to a float.", "First our model needs to be trained, second our model needs to be tested. Therefore it is best to have two different datasets. As for now we only have one, it is very common to split the data accordingly. X is the data with the independent variables, Y is the data with the dependent variable. The test size variable determines in which ratio the data will be split. It is quite common to do this in an 80 Training / 20 Test ratio.", "Let us make our first model to predict the target variable. We will start with Logistic Regression which is used for predicting binary outcome.", "We will use scikit-learn (sklearn) for making different models which is an open source library for Python. It is one of the most efficient tools which contains many inbuilt functions that can be used for modeling in Python.", "The dataset has been divided into training and validation part. Let us import LogisticRegression and accuracy_score from sklearn and fit the logistic regression model.", "So our predictions are almost 81% accurate, i.e. we have identified 80% of the churn rate correctly. So with the final objective to reduce churn and take the right preventing actions in time, we want to know which independent variables have the most influence on our predicted outcome. Therefore we set the coefficients in our model to zero and look at the weights of each variable.", "It can be observed that some variables have a positive relation to our predicted variable and some have a negative relation. Customers with negative values show that they are unlikely to churn while those with positive values shows they are likely to churn.
