Two different approaches that solve two different types of problems.", "Since Machine Learning and especially Deep Learning are evolving at a rapid speed, things have been getting a little more complicated though. The line between supervised and unsupervised seems to blur and currently three new flavors of learning are gaining a lot of popularity. Let\u2019s briefly glance over the usual two suspects before getting to the new stuff.", "Supervised learning is about finding a mapping that transform a set of input features into a predefined set of output features. In other words we are explicitly telling the model what it is we want to predict for the training data. Supervised learning comes with the problem that we need to manually label our data in order to define the output space for each sample.", "In unsupervised learning we\u2019re also interested in finding a mapping to an output space but we don\u2019t know what this output looks like. Or at least, we don\u2019t feed this information to the algorithm. The most common example for unsupervised learning is clustering, where we divide the samples into groups based on their most distinct features.", "Self-Supervised learning refers to an approach where the labels can be generated automatically. The architecture itself and the learning process are entirely supervised but we don\u2019t require the step of manually labeling training data.", "A classic example for this are Autoencoders where input and output data are entirely the same. The purpose of their architecture is to first compress the input to a dense format and then reconstruct the original signal. By doing this Autoencoders learn a problem specific lossy data compression that can be helpful for feature extraction or data reduction.", "Another example is image super-resolution where we upscale an image while trying to reconstruct new pixel information based on the semantic content. If you want to build a dataset for such a problem all you need is a collection of unlabeled images. To label them you can downscale the original images and use these as your input. The output will be the originally sized images. In this case you didn\u2019t need to manually label anything. You automatically generated you labeled training data from unlabeled training data.", "Semi-Supervised learning comes to play when your training data is only partially labeled. You\u2019ll find many datasets online where on top of the annotated samples you\u2019ll also get additional data that is not labeled. Because all data is good data, this can potentially help you to improve your model.", "Pseudo Labeling is the process of predicting labels for data that we don\u2019t have labels for and using these predictions as ground-truth labels to expand our dataset. While this will likely introduce noise to our data, experiments have shown that it can help to increase the accuracy of a model. If you find this surprising, you\u2019re not alone.", "Weakly supervised learning refers to a model that predicts additional information from the labels it was trained on. You can think of this as unsupervised learning on top of supervised learning.", "Imagine you\u2019re training a classifier to distinguish different types of objects that are contained somewhere in the image. A CNN will learn to create heat maps for each class where it expects this object to be in the frame. That way it can compare the area and likeliness of one object to the others. While we only train the network on information that are true for the entire frame, we also get information where in the frame the object is positioned.", "You will find different definitions for these terms all over the place. Some seem to be inaccurate because they\u2019re outdated, some seem to combine terms that I explicitly differentiate and others state opinions that I simply disagree with.
