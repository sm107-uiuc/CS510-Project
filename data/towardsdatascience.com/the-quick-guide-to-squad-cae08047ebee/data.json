Whether you\u2019re just interested in learning about a popular NLP dataset or planning to use it in one of your projects, here are all the basics you should know.", "What task does SQuAD present? As implied by its name, SQuAD focuses on the task of question answering. It tests a model\u2019s ability to read a passage of text and then answer questions about it (flashback to reading comprehension on the SAT). It\u2019s a relatively straightforward task; here\u2019s an example that the dataset\u2019s creators gave:", "How was SQuAD created? To compile SQuAD, the creators sampled 536 from the top 10,000 Wikipedia articles. From each of these sampled articles, they extracted a total of 23,215 individual paragraphs (making sure to filter for paragraphs that were too small). They split the dataset by articles such that 80% of articles went into the training set, 10% into a development set, and 10% into a testing set.", "Annotating SQuAD. The most important part of creating a dataset \u2014 annotating it \u2014 was done by Mechanical Turk workers. Classic! I\u2019m seeing Mechanical Turk making a cameo in a lot of these NLP papers. These workers were selected only if they had a history of high quality work (as measured by the HIT approval rate). For each selected paragraph, the workers were asked to come up with and answer 5 questions on the content of the paragraph. They were provided a text field to type their question, and they could highlight the answers in the paragraph. The creators of SQuAD made sure that the questions that the workers came up with were in their own words, even disabling the copy-paste functionality. Noooooo! Not my copy-paste tools!", "Dataset Analysis. A crucial part of a good dataset is understanding its properties. To do this, the creators explored three areas:", "What makes SQuAD so good? Of course, with a task like question answering, there are tons of datasets out there. When comparing SQuAD with other datasets, there are a few primary differences:", "Concluding thoughts. SQuAD is probably one of the most popular question answering datasets (it\u2019s been cited over 2,000 times) because it\u2019s well-created and improves on many aspects that other datasets fail to address. I\u2019d highly recommend anyone that wants to evaluate an NLP model to test it on SQuAD, as it\u2019s a great dataset for testing model understanding of language and even just performance in general.", "Your home for data science.
