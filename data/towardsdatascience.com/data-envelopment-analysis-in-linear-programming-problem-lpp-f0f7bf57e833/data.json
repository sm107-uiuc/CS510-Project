After a long time of practicing, our work will become natural, skillful, swift, and steady. ~Bruce Lee", "Linear programming problems require meticulous art of designing the constraints and objective function before a machine takes over the iterations to solve. I realized the only critical step in raising more awareness for this powerful technique is to repeatedly revise and practice small problems before leaping into the ocean of real-world airlines or shipping problems. After discussing briefly the elements of LPP in the article referenced below.", "We also delved into solving some small scale toy applications in a separate article referenced below.", "However, before making ourselves available for Integer Programming Problem, Multi-criteria decisions, or Non-linear programming problems I felt it would be prudent to give ourselves some more time by looking at some of the advanced applications of LPP. Today, in this article I would be fortunate to take you through another LPP application related to Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). We would also discuss Revenue Management and Portfolio decisions in a separate article. The primary reason to take some extra time is to make ourselves aware with a few more small scale examples without thinking too much about the software. I believe the previous two articles have given you some interest in LPP, however, my sole request would be to explicitly state that our end goal is not to claim our expertise yet, in solving real-life complex LPP problems. Rather our end goal could be to make ourselves aware of some (but not all) of the different aspects of LPP applications before we take a firm decision on making our hands dirty in solving a large-scale problem.", "Consider a set of performing units that take a similar set of inputs to produce a similar set of outputs. Let's consider a set of three independent educational institutions providing theoretical and hands-on training in data science to working professionals. In each of the institutions, the students can leverage a certain number of on-campus classroom sessions, certain hours of live speaker series sessions from renowned industry experts, and a certain number of practical real-life assignments on statistics and operations research. These three can be considered as a set of inputs common to students from all three institutions. On the other hand, students can publish their respective research papers or write articles about relevant projects, invite recruiters for placements, and serve internships (irrespective of current experience) offered by institution alumni. These three can be considered as a set of outputs common to students from all three institutions. Now, one approach could be to measure mean and variance to compare the aggregated relative performance measures (central tendency measures) of the three institutions. At the end of the day, the performance of individual students would anyhow reflect the efficiency of the institutions.", "The other approach could be to form an LPP for estimating weights corresponding to every institution that would limit the resource availability and measure the relative efficiency based on outputs. DEA does something similar to this. It optimizes an efficiency index which is formed by a weighted sum of outputs divided by a weighted sum of inputs from all operating units.", "Ranch House, Inc., operates five fast-food restaurants. Input measures for the restaurants include weekly hours of operation, full-time equivalent staff, and weekly supply expenses. Output measures of performance include average weekly contribution to profit, market share, and annual growth rate. Data for the input and output measures are shown in the following tables: [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "We have five operating units, which are Bardstown, Clarksville, Jeffersonville, New Albany, and St. Matthews. We have three input measures, which are Hours of operation, FTE Staff, and the dollar amount spent on weekly supplies. We have three output measures, which are an average weekly profit contribution, weekly market share, and annual growth rate. In DEA, a separate LPP model is required for each operating unit whose relative efficiency is questioned.", "Hence DEA suggests formulating a composite operating unit whose output is a weighted average of all given restaurants. A composite unit is an imaginary unit expected to produce a weighted average of all 5 restaurants which is at least the same or higher levels of each output measure. It means, for each measure, the output of this composite unit must be the same or higher than the output of individual operating units. Similarly, the input for a composite unit is a weighted average of the corresponding input for each of the 5 restaurants. A composite unit is expected to have available at most the same or lesser levels of each input measure.", "The sum of all five weights defined above must add up to one. Once the inputs and outputs are defined for the composite unit, we can form the constraints. Each of the three input measures would form a constraint concerning some resource availability for that corresponding constraint. The operating unit whose relative efficiency is questioned provides the resource availability for each constraint. Let us consider in this case we need to compare the relative efficiency of Clarksville restaurant. Hence if the composite unit can produce almost the same or relatively higher output by taking relatively fewer amount inputs than the Clarksville restaurant then the composite unit is relatively deemed efficient. If the composite unit produces the same output by taking the same input levels as the Clarksville restaurant then it is not evident to deem the composite unit as relatively efficient. Therefore by what proportion of an operating unit's input is available to the composite unit to produce as much output as the corresponding operating unit, is also required to be estimated in the LPP. This is termed as the efficiency index (E) and the objective function of the DEA model is to minimize this index, implying we need to minimize the input resource levels available to the composite unit.", "Develop a linear programming model that can be used to evaluate the performance of the Clarksville Ranch House restaurant. Solve the model. [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "Is the Clarksville Ranch House restaurant relatively inefficient? Discuss. [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "The optimal efficiency index score for Clarksville operating unit is approximately 0.96. The composite restaurant is capable of producing at least each output measures at a level similar to Clarksville by utilizing no more than approximately 96% of the input measures required by Clarksville. The composite unit is optimally formed from the weighted average of Bardstown, Jeffersonville, and New Albany. The composite unit is relatively more efficient than Clarksville.", "Where does the composite restaurant have more output than the Clarksville restaurant? How much less of each input resource does the composite restaurant require when compared to the Clarksville restaurant? [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "Since the primal is a minimization problem, the slack column can be interpreted as surplus. The weekly profit constraint is not-binding and has a surplus contribution of $220. This implies the composite unit produces a weekly profit of $4820 ($4600 + $220) which is relatively $220 more than the operating unit under question (i.e. Clarksville). However, the market share and annual growth constraints are binding which implies that both the composite unit and Clarksville unit produce at most 32% market share and 8.5% annual growth respectively.", "The operation hours constraint is binding with no surplus, which implies that the composite unit uses approximately 96% of the operation hours available to the Clarksville unit. However, the FTE staff and weekly supply expenses constraint are not-binding with some surplus. This implies that the composite unit utilizes less than approximately 96% of FTE staff and weekly supply expenses available to the Clarksville unit.", "So, the composite unit uses relatively lesser FTE staff and weekly supply expenses and produces the same level of market share and annual growth with an additional $220 of weekly profit contribution, due to which it becomes relatively more efficient than the Clarksville unit.", "What other restaurants should be studied to find suggested ways for the Clarksville restaurant to improve its efficiency? [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "We have observed that the optimal weights are formed from the weighted average of Bardstown, Jeffersonville, and New Albany units. NOT Clarksville or St. Matthews. Ideally, these units should suggest methods of improvement to the Clarksville unit. However, we can solve similar LPP models for the other four units and compare the optimal efficiency index scores.", "The efficiency index scores for Bardstown, Clarksville, Jeffersonville, New Albany, and St. Matthews are 1, 0.96, 1, 1, and 0.99 respectively. A score of 1 implies that there is a lack of evidence to deem whether the composite unit or the corresponding operating unit is relatively more efficient. A score of less than 1 implies that the composite unit is relatively more efficient than the corresponding operating unit.", "Let us look at the answer reports from all the 5 primal LPP models.", "We notice that as discussed before, the composite unit contributes an additional $220 of weekly profit with the same level of market share and annual growth relative to the Clarksville unit. Whereas, relative to the St. Matthews unit, the composite restaurant produces an additional 3.19% of market share and 0.52% of annual growth with the same level of weekly profit contribution. For both cases, the composite unit uses relatively lesser operational hours, FTE staff, and weekly supply expenses available to the respective operating units. The composite unit uses 96% of operational hours available to Clarksville and 99% of operational hours available to St. Matthews. But, the composite unit uses less than 96% of FTE staff and weekly supply expenses available to Clarksville and less than 99% of FTE staff and weekly supply expenses available to St. Matthews.", "Therefore we may conclude that the Clarksville and the St. Matthews restaurant are relatively inefficient when compared to the composite unit. However, we cannot conclude that Bardstown, Jeffersonville, and New Albany are efficient. They are relatively in a position to suggest improvement areas to the other two operating units.", "DEA has proved to be a powerful LPP tool to compare relative efficiencies of both profit and non-profit organizations. However, the striking disadvantage for a domain expert in adopting this comparison technique is the lack of explicit suggestions to improve efficiency. For example, as a consultant, I may use DEA to filter out Clarksville and St. Matthews restaurants, however, it does not tell me the ways to improve performance efficiency.", "The above example has been borrowed from the unsolved exercises section in the book An Introduction to Management Science by Anderson, Sweeney, Williams, Camm, Cochran, Fry, Ohlman [ASWCCFO]. However, the solutions shared in this article have not been copied from any source or material.", "The workbook link for the above example is here.", "An introduction to Management Science by Anderson, Sweeney, Williams, Camm, Cochran, Fry, Ohlman, [ASWCCFO]", "Web and Open Video platform sharing knowledge on LPP", "Professor Prahalad Venkateshan, Production and Quantitative Methods, IIM-Ahmedabad", "Your home for data science.
