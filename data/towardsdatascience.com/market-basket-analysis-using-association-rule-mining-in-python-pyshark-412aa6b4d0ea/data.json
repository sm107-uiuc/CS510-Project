For example, they put bread and jam close to each other, milk and eggs, and so on.", "These are the examples that come to our mind right away as we shop in the stores ourselves.", "What they didn\u2019t expect is that after analyzing the receipts of each customer, they found a pattern that American dads have diapers and beer on one receipt (particularly often on Fridays).", "Market basket analysis (or affinity analysis) is mainly a data mining process that helps identify co-occurrence of certain events/activities performed by a user group. In our case, we will focus on an individual\u2019s buying behaviour in a retail store by analyzing their receipts using association rule mining in Python.", "Association rule learning is a rule-based method for discovering relations between variables in large datasets. In the case of retail POS (point-of-sale) transactions analytics, our variables are going to be the retail products. It essentially discovers strong associations (rules) with some \u201cstrongness\u201d level, which is represented by several parameters.", "Now we will turn to some mathematics to explain the association rules in a technical way.", "The following is a summary of how association rule learning is described by Agrawal, Imieli\u0144ski, Swami in their paper (taken as basis) with some of our additions:", "Every transaction t_m in D has a unique ID (in a retail example: every receipt has a unique number).", "Also each transaction t_m consists of a subset of items from set I (in a retail example: each receipt contains products from the store).", "A rule is defined as an implication of the form Y -> X where X \u2286 I and Y \u2286 I (equivalent to: X, Y \u2286 I, and X \u2229 Y = 0).", "These mathematical terms mean the following:", "To put this into context, let\u2019s take a look at the following example:", "Look back at the definition of the rule and you will see that you have satisfied all of the assumptions. Each item in itemset X is a product from the list of products on your receipt. Each item in itemset Y is a product from the list of products on your receipt. Products in X and Y don\u2019t repeat (are unique from the list of products on your receipt).", "Using these itemsets, an example of a rule would be: {bread, eggs}\u2192{apples}, meaning that someone who buys bread and eggs is likely to buy apples.", "So far we were working only with two itemsets that the author chose. However, our receipt has 4 items, so we can create more itemsets and hence more rules. For example, another rule could be {milk}\u2192{eggs} or {bread, milk}\u2192{eggs}.", "As you saw in the previous part, we were able to come up with several arbitrary rules that can be derived even from a very small sample of transactions with a few items in them.", "What we are going to do now is identify several useful measures that allow us to evaluate the \u201cstrength\u201d of the rules that can be proposed as potential association rules. We will basically work our way to find the most meaningful and most significant rules.", "First, let\u2019s create an arbitrary database of transactions from our grocery store:", "In the above database, each row is a unique receipt from a customer. The values in other columns are boolean (1 for True and 0 for False). The table shows us what was bought on what receipt.", "Now we are all set to do some calculations.", "Assume two single-item itemsets X and Y, where X contains milk (X: {Milk}) and Y contains eggs (Y: {Eggs}).", "The that we would like to explore is X-> Y, which is \u201chow strong is the rule that customers who purchased milk also purchased eggs?\u201d", "We will need to get familiar with a set of most concepts commonly used in market basket analysis.", "Support of an itemset X is defined as a proportion of transactions in the database that contain X.", "So let\u2019s count the number of transactions where we see X (milk) appear. It\u2019s 3 transactions (IDs: 001, 002, 003). The total number of transactions is 4.", "Hence our calculation is as follows:", "Confidence is a measurement of significance of indication that the rule is true. In plain words, it calculates the likelihood of itemset Y being purchased with itemset X).", "First, we will need to calculate the support for union of itemset X and Y. This is the number of transactions where both milk and eggs appear (intersection of transactions).", "Hence our calculation is as follows:", "Using the above numbers we get:", "This shows that every time a customer purchases milk, there is a 66% chance they will purchase eggs as well.", "It can also be referred to as conditional probability of Y on X: P(Y|X) = 0.66.", "Lift is a ratio of observed support to expected support if X and Y were independent.", "In other words, it tells us how good is the rule at calculating the outcome while taking into account the popularity of itemset Y.", "Up to this point we have calculated most of the values we will need.", "Now, let\u2019s find the third piece: supp(Y)", "We need the number of transactions where eggs appear. It\u2019s 3 transactions (IDs: 001, 002, 004). The total number of transactions is 4.", "Hence our calculation is as follows:", "Plugging it all in one formula we get:", "We find an interesting value for lift. When we look at the table, it seems quite obvious that milk and eggs are bought together often. We also know that by nature these products are often bought together since we know multiple dishes that need both.", "Note: Even though statistically speaking, they aren\u2019t complements we use our judgement to evaluate the association rule. This is the moment when we need to emphasize the domain knowledge. The formulas don\u2019t know what we know, there is a lot of information available to us and formulas do everything based on numbers.Calculating these values is a supplement to your decision making, not a substitute. It is up to you to set minimum thresholds when evaluating the association rules. This part is important to understand prior to performing the association rule mining in Python.", "The Apriori algorithm (originally proposed by Agarwal) is one of the most common techniques in Market Basket Analysis. It is used to analyze the frequent itemsets in a transactional database, which then is used to generate association rules between the products.", "Let\u2019s put it into an example. Recall the dataset we introduced in our \u201cConcepts\u201d lesson:", "Here is a sample tree how the Apriori algorithm explored association rules for Milk:", "In this example, the algorithm first looks at level 1 which is Milk and finds it\u2019s frequency, then it moves to the next depth layer and looks at frequencies of [Milk, Eggs], [Milk, Apple], and [Milk, Bread]. After second level of depth is analyzed, it moves on to the next depth level. This continues until it reaches the last depth level, which means that once there is no more new itemsets the algorithm will stop its calculation.", "As an illustration, consider the above diagram, but now instead of items we will label the steps the algorithm takes:", "The diagram above shows the steps the algorithm takes while performing its search (1:16).", "As a result, it calculates support for all possible combinations of itemsets. Remember that it is up to us to set the minimum parameters for support. If we set it to 0.01, we will obviously see much more possible rules than if we were to set it to 0.4.", "The resulting output will be a list of association rules that were discovered while satisfying the parameter values that we set.", "The ECLAT algorithm is another popular tool for Market Basket Analysis. It stands for Equivalence Class Clustering and Bottom-Up Lattice Traversal. It is known as a \u201cmore efficient\u201d Apriori algorithm.", "It is a depth-first search (DFS) approach which searches vertically through a dataset structure. The algorithm starts its search at a tree root, then explores next depth level node and keeps going down until it reaches the first terminal node. Then it makes a step back (to n-1) level and explores other nodes and goes down to the terminal node.", "It makes more sense when we explore it as a tree. Recall the dataset we used in the \u201cApriori Algorithm\u201d part (added for reference further in the lesson). Here is how DFS would analyze it:", "The summary of the logic is:", "If we compare it to Breadth-First Search (BFS), the computational speed will depend on the width and depth of the tree (different properties of the vertex orderings).", "When it comes back to the technical part of ECLAT algorithm, its flow is the following:", "Let\u2019s put it to an example again. Here is our dataset:", "Below is a showcase of all the runs ECLAT algorithm will perform on this dataset:", "Now, let\u2019s say we have preset a minimum support count requirement equal to 2 (support count=2) for the ECLAT search.This implies that for a rule to qualify for the output, it must have a minimum of 2 transactions where those items appear:", "Note: support count and support are two different concepts. Support count (\u03c3) is the count of transactions in which the item occurred. Support is the fraction of transactions where the item occurred of total number of transactions (support count divided by total number of transactions).", "F-P Growth (or frequent-pattern growth) algorithm is another popular technique in Market Basket Analysis (first introduced by Han). It produces the same results as Apriori algorithm but is computationally faster due to a mathematically different technique (divide and conquer).", "F-P Growth follows a two-step data preprocessing approach:", "Unlike Apriori algorithm, F-P Growth sorts items within each transaction by it\u2019s frequency from largest to smallest before inserting it into a tree. This is where it has a substantial computational advantage over Apriori algorithm since it does the frequency sorting early on. Items which don\u2019t meet minimum support (frequency) requirements (that we can set) are discarded from the tree.", "Another advantage is that frequent itemsets that repeat will have the same path (unlike Apriori algorithm, where each itemset has a unique path).", "Left hand side is Apriori algorithm, and it looks at two individual sequences with these steps:", "Right hand side is F-P Growth algorithm, and it looks at two sequences where the common part [Milk, Eggs] is compressed:", "What this allows is a much higher compression towards the root of the tree and less computational steps (in this case 2 steps), which means that the calculation is much faster than Apriori algorithm (in this case 4 steps).", "This section is designed to give you a brief overview in a compare and contrast manner for the three algorithms studied in this course.", "Please refer to the below table:", "The above table suggests that the main speed advantages are due to a different computational technique and data format. Because F-P Growth goes through a database only twice, it is much faster on a large number of itemsets. In the example that we used, where the entire database consists of only 4 unique items, the computational speed difference will be minimal and not noticeable.", "In this section we will create some examples of association rule mining in Python.", "Let\u2019s recall the dataset we created in one of the first lessons of this course:", "We will use it as an input into our models.", "To continue following this tutorial we will need two Python libraries: pandas and mlxtend.", "If you don\u2019t have them installed, please open \u201cCommand Prompt\u201d (on Windows) and install them using the following code:", "Once the libraries are downloaded and installed, we can proceed with Python code implementation.", "The above code creates a list with transactions that we will use.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the result:", "We first import the required libraries. Then we save the TransactionEncoder() function as a local variable te.Next step is to create an array (te_array) from the dataset list with True/False values (depending if an item appears/doesn\u2019t appear on a particular receipt).We then convert this array to a dataframe ( df) using items as column names.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the result:", "This shows us across all of the transactions which items do/don\u2019t occur on a particular receipt.", "First, we import the Apriori algorithm function from the library.Then we apply the algorithm to our data to extract the itemsets that have a minimum support value of 0.01 (this parameter can be changed).", "Let\u2019s take a look at the result:", "First, we import the F-P growth algorithm function from the library.Then we apply the algorithm to our data to extract the itemsets that have a minimum support value of 0.01 (this parameter can be tuned on a case-by-case basis).", "Let\u2019s take a look at the result:", "Note: what you observe is regardless of the technique you used, you arrived at the identical itemsets and support values. The only difference is the order in which they appear. You should notice that the output from F-P Growth appears in descending orders, hence the proof of what we mentioned in the theoretical part about this algorithm.", "In this final step we will find the association rules for the frequent itemsets which we calculated in Step 3.", "First we import the required function from the page to determine the association rules for a given dataset using some set of parameters.Then we apply it to the two frequent item datasets which we created in Step 3.", "Note: \u201cmetric\u201d and \u201cmin_threshold\u201d parameters can be tuned on a case-by-case basis, depending on the business problem requirements.", "Let\u2019s take a look at both sets of rules:", "From the two above we see that both algorithms found identical association rules with same coefficients, just presented in a different order.", "This article is a walkthrough for a basic example of implementation of association rule mining in Python for market basket analysis. We focused on theory and application of the most common algorithms.", "There is much more to it:", "The purpose of this article is to showcase the possibilities of this data mining technique in application to market basket analysis in Python which can be definitely explored further.", "Feel free to leave comments below if you have any questions or have suggestions for some edits and check out more of my Statistics articles.", "Your home for data science.
