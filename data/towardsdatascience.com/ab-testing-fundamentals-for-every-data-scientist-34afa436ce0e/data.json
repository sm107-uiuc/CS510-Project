As these organizations want to move towards data-informed design decision, AB testing is first in line.", "AB testing is a methodology of comparing multiple versions of a feature, a page, a button, etc. by showing the different versions to customers or prospective customers and assessing the quality of interaction by some metric (Click through, purchase, following any call to action, etc.). Any time you want to test multiple variations of something is a great use case for AB testing.", "It\u2019s important to reduce the process into different steps.", "The first part of this is specifying your hypothesis or what you believe will happen. (More specifically, what you believe is the Alternative Hypothesis and the NULL Hypothesis assumes no difference between variants.)", "Let\u2019s run through the things that you need to know or formulate before anything else:", "One other thought when conducting your experiment is to roll the variants out to customers during the same time period, rather than staging different variants across different time periods. As much non-random variation there is in your sample, the less dependable your experiment will be. Time is a good example of something to standardize on rather than letting seasonality play a role in the outcome of your experiment. When you launch an experiment, launch it for any and all variants.", "From here one of the most common questions people have is how many samples of each variant do I need to have statistically significant results?", "In order to determine this, we perform something called a power analysis. The idea of power analysis is that identify the requisite sample size based on a series of parameters; things like statistical power, p-value, the number of variants, and the size of the difference between the two group\u2019s measurement, etc. The reason we do this is to make sure we don\u2019t do an experiment so long that a ton of our customers had to see the worse version, but still long enough to justify our results.", "I\u2019ll break those down for you right here.", "k \u2014 number of variants; at least two and as many as you want. One thing to keep in mind is the more variants, the more required data.n \u2014 sample size per group: We\u2019ll leave this as NULL, that\u2019s what we\u2019re solving for.f \u2014 Observed difference between the groups that we want to validate: The bigger the difference, the smaller the required sample and the smaller the difference the greater the required sample to validate it. Using my sample data I generated, we have a minimum detectable distance of 18.7%sig.level \u2014 significance level: This just means if the results validate your hypothesis, what likelihood of randomness can we live with; that\u2019s typically .05.power \u2014 statistical power: This pretty much means that if your hypothesis is true, what\u2019s the probability that you\u2019d accept it. The standard is typically .8.", "Let\u2019s load the package pwr and use the pwr.anova.test to identify our requisite sample size.", "I\u2019ve created a couple of dummy datasets to play with, one for the experiment & one pre-experiment.", "Also as a reference, I\u2019ll include a code snippet of what you might do to understand the baseline. Baseline, being variant A.", "As you can see above, n or sample per variant is 98.", "This gave me the result of 0.502 which served as our baseline to compare with variant B\u2019s 0.673", "Another option is to chart the performance of the different variants over the course of the experiment. Below you can see that we group the experiment data by date and variant, then aggregating the average conversion. I think to plot the average conversion per group over time. As this was sample data, I adjusted it for the sake of the visualization.", "Once you\u2019ve collected a sample of 114 per variant it\u2019s time to validate your results.", "It\u2019s worthwhile to jump into your experiment data and review the conversion rate of your metric grouped by each variant yourself before piping it through a glm.", "Just about what we had seen previously which is a good sign.", "Another option is the performance of the different variants over the course of the experiment.", "Now let\u2019s validate this outcome using a GLM.", "As you can see in the statement below, we are trying to interpret the result of the call_to_action by which variant of the experience they had. That tidy() call on the end there just cleans up your output. To use that make sure to download the broom package.", "First looking at the row for variantB you can see that the p.value is lower than our minimum .05.", "Now comparing the estimate of our intercept with variantB we can see that our test had a far higher conversion rate than control.", "From here we can accept our hypothesis! Now it\u2019s time to implement your results and continue to iterate accordingly!", "We\u2019ve covered a lot in a very short amount of time, let\u2019s break down everything we\u2019ve learned:", "A strong AB testing foundation is key for data scientists, particularly those that sit within a product org and are looking to leverage their skills to drive meaningful improvement.", "If you found this helpful, come check out the rest of my lessons at datasciencelessons.com!", "Your home for data science.
