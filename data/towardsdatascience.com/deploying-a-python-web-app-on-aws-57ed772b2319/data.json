Fortunately, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), in a few minutes, we can deploy a Python web application to the entire world for free.", "In this article, we\u2019ll see how to deploy a deep learning web app to AWS on a free EC2 instance. This article will work with the app built in Deploying a Keras Deep Learning Model as a Web Application in Python using the model developed in Recurrent Neural Networks by Example in Python. Neither of these is required, just know that our application generates novel patent abstracts with an RNN. All the code for the project can be found on GitHub.", "Amazon Web Services is the umbrella term for the range of Amazon\u2019s cloud computing offerings. We be using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), a service where we rent virtual computers in the cloud to run applications. AWS EC2 offers a free tier so we can deploy without spending a cent.", "To get started, create an AWS account and head to the EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2. Click on the Launch Instance button which takes you to choose an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI), \u201c a template that contains the software configuration (operating system) required to launch your instance.\u201d You can use any os you\u2019re familiar with (although some aren\u2019t eligible for the free tier), but I\u2019ll be using Ubuntu Server 18.04:", "Hit Select, then on the next page choose the free tier eligible t2.micro instance (an instance is the hardware for our AMI). This only has 1 CPU and 1 GB of RAM, but it will actually be enough to run our pre-trained recurrent neural network application! If you\u2019re expecting more traffic or running a cpu-intensive application, you\u2019ll probably have to shell out.", "Select the instance type you want and then go to tab 6. Configure Security Group at the top of the page. Security groups filter the traffic into and out of our instance \u2014 basically, who can access our virtual computer.", "You (and only you) will need to access the instance via ssh, so add a rule that allows Source \u201cMy IP\u201d for SSH. We want others to be able to access our app in a web browser, so add a rule to allow HTTP access for all sources. The final security configuration is:", "Next, hit Review and Launch and then Launch. This brings up the options for using a key pair. You need this to access the server via ssh, so make sure to create a new key pair and save the private key somewhere you remember it. If you lose this, you will not be able to access your instance again!", "Finally, hit Launch Instances and Amazon will start up your very own virtual machine which is physically located\u2026somewhere. Wait a few minutes for the instance to boot before heading to the next step: connecting to your instance.", "Once the instance is up and running, select it on the EC2 Instance dashboard (Services > EC2 > Running Instances) and hit Connect. This will give us the exact commands to connect to the instance.", "Copy the example code, and paste it into Bash or a command prompt running in the folder with your private key (you generate this when launching your instance). Assuming everything goes well, you\u2019ll be logged into your instance and see a familiar terminal command prompt.", "This AMI comes equipped with Python 3.6, so we just need to clone the repository and install the app dependencies. First, get the repository:", "Then install pip, move into the repository, and install the requirements.", "Running the app is simple (you might need sudo for the second command):", "(If you want to understand what\u2019s going on in the web application, take a look at the previous article for the development process).", "You should see the following output in the terminal:", "While it looks like this the app is running on localhost:80/, that\u2019s on the virtual machine. For us to access the web app, we\u2019ll have to use the instance\u2019s Public DNS IPv4 which can be found on the running instance dashboard.", "Copy and paste the address into your browser, and you\u2019ll see the application!", "Feel free to play around with the recurrent neural network application. What it\u2019s doing is generating new patent abstracts with a recurrent neural network trained on thousands of abstracts with the keyword \u201cneural network\u201d You can either enter random for a random starting sequence, or your own sequence. (To see the development, check out this article or this notebook).", "Your application can now be reached by anyone in the world via the IPv4. If you want the app to keep running even after you log out of the instance, run it in a Screen session. (Screen is a handy program that lets you run terminal sessions from a single terminal window using virtual consoles.)", "My (if I haven\u2019t shut it down or run into errors) application should be running at http://54.173.255.177/. Because I\u2019m using a t2.micro instance, the cost to run this web application in perpetuity is precisely $0.00! If you want a domain name, you can pick up one from a domain name registrar such as Hover.", "Although this is a decent solution to quickly deploy a personal project, this is not a production-ready deployment! For that, you\u2019ll want to make sure to use proper security (with HTTPS and a certified certificate). You\u2019ll also want to make sure your application can handle expected traffic. Only use this specific solution for small projects without sensitive data.", "We truly live in incredible times: with Flask we can develop a Python web app in a few minutes and then we can deploy it to the world free with AWS. The general process we followed was: develop a web application (in Python preferably), rent commodity hardware from a cloud provider, and deploy a web application to the world.", "If you were able to follow all the tutorials from the implementation of a recurrent neural network to developing a local web application to deploying on AWS, then you\u2019ll have completed an impressive project! The overall process from a blank file to a running web application may be daunting, but like most technology problems, if you break it down, each step isn\u2019t overwhelming and there are many open-source tools to make the process easy. If you\u2019re a data scientist bored with doing self-contained analysis in Jupyter Notebooks, take the initiative to do a project you can deploy as an application. It\u2019s good to branch out into other disciplines, and building and deploying a web application is a great opportunity to learn some new skills.", "As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.
