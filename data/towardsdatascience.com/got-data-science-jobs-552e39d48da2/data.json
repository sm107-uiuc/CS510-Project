You\u2019ve seen lists like this one saying that data scientist is the best job in America (and highly paid to boot) and you are constantly bombarded with ads about how Bootcamp ABC will train you and help you land your first data science offer.", "It\u2019s definitely a gamble to quit your current job, shell out somewhere between $15,000 to $20,000, go back to school for 3 months, and then job hunt for an undetermined amount of time post bootcamp.", "Now that I have gone through the data science bootcamp experience and come out the other side, here is what I wish I had known about it and the ensuing job hunting process beforehand. Disclaimer: I attended Metis in San Francisco so if you choose another bootcamp and/or location, your experience may differ from mine.", "Computer vision is super cool, so is text generation with an LSTM neural network. But there is a 99% chance that your interviewer will care much more about your SQL table joining skills than your knowledge and passion for deep learning.", "I\u2019m not saying that deep learning and artificial intelligence are not important to know (they definitely are), but rather that you will probably be interviewing mostly for data analyst roles (or data analyst roles disguised with the data scientist title) when you first finish your bootcamp.", "And as far as I can tell, the key skills that you need for these types of roles are:", "Sadly, many of the things you spend significant time working on during your bootcamp (let\u2019s be honest, training a neural net to quote Edgar Allen Poe is way more fun than running a hypothesis test of the difference between two means) will be under-appreciated by your interviewers.", "And unfortunately, the one thing that you need to be an absolute ninja at, SQL, is barely covered and worked on during the bootcamp. Instead, you will most likely spend your first few weeks post bootcamp practicing SQL hard on your own. If you want to speed up this process, then devote some evenings during your bootcamp to learning and practicing SQL. My buddy Randy is working on a great Intro to SQL series here.", "Your bootcamp will tout the transformative power of its alumni network, hiring partners, recruiting assistance, and interview prep.", "Yes, there is definitely some career help but data science bootcamps are different from traditional software developer bootcamps \u2014 I am totally guessing but I would say for every 1 data scientist hired, there are probably 15 to 20 software engineers hired. As trendy and in demand as data scientists currently are, they still cannot compare to software engineers in terms of demand for the skillset \u2014 thus, you shouldn\u2019t use your friends\u2019 software engineering bootcamp recruiting outcome as your motivation to attend a data science bootcamp.", "And the data scientist supply demand mismatch is not what it once was. Years of hype and high salaries have probably brought the market closer to equilibrium, at the same time that many companies are finding out that there are limits to what data science and machine learning can help them achieve.", "So the moral of the story is that there are ever more of us fighting for a piece of a pie that is probably not growing as fast as we hope it is.", "Personally, I went into the bootcamp expecting there to be a \u201cRecruiting Day\u201d or \u201cInterview Day\u201d near the end and I was disappointed. While we did have a Career Day where we presented our final projects to a few recruiters, I don\u2019t believe anyone from my cohort got an onsite interview, much less a job out of it. And not for lack of trying \u2014 my classmates presented some really great projects and everyone schmoozed hard during the networking session. Unfortunately, many of the recruiters were either not hiring or trying to fill positions that required much more experience.", "So what\u2019s an aspiring data scientist to do? I have three suggestions:", "One of the key selling points of the bootcamp was the chance to put together a portfolio of data science projects that I could then tout as evidence to companies that, \u201cHey I can do this data science thing!\u201d", "But looking back, it was naive of me to assume that just because I trained a model that produced good results, threw it on my GitHub, and wrote a bullet about it for my resume, that magically a recruiter or hiring manager would see it and be like, \u201cCool! We should give that guy a chance.\u201d", "You need to market your projects and your data science knowledge. Personally, I do it through my blog. Here are a few Medium tips if you are an aspiring data science blogger:", "However you market your projects and yourself, just remember that unless you make them care (by presenting your process and insights in an eye-catching manner), they won\u2019t care about all your hard work.", "This is harder in the Bay Area (versus somewhere like Houston where every company is in the oil and gas sector). There are so many startups out there, each attempting to disrupt a particular industry with its own unique business economics.", "So unfortunately if you want to work in tech (especially tech startups) in the Bay Area, you will end up doing a lot of reading and studying up on the competitive dynamics of various industries. Wikipedia and Crunchbase are good places to start. Business strategy blogs like the a16z blog and Stratechery are great for deeper dives into industries you are interested in or interviewing for. Morningstar also does a surprisingly good job of analyzing companies and industries \u2014 pay special attention to their discussions on what drives a firm\u2019s economic moat \u2014 the characteristics that allow a company to sustainably earn a high return on its capital over time.", "The first question I was asked in multiple interviews was, \u201cSo what do you know about us?\u201d", "Generally recruiters and hiring managers expected me to know at the bare minimum the following things:", "A lot of data science bootcamp grads are career changers, with many coming from non or at least less technical backgrounds. Gaining traction in the job search will take a lot of time and effort.", "At least for me, job hunting with all that it entails (applications, cover letters, coffee meetings, phone calls, interview prep, the actual interview itself, and thank you notes) was extremely time consuming. Then on top of that, I also needed to maintain my blog.", "Before I knew it, more than a week had passed with me barely touching Python. At that point, I forced myself to step back from the job hunt and work on an old data science project.", "As much as we want to land that job, it\u2019s important to remember that we are not data scientists because some company was willing to pay us to be one \u2014 rather we are data scientists because we practice data science frequently (coding up new projects, participating in Kaggle competitions, researching and reading about new algorithms, etc.).", "So keep up that Python, keep working on those projects, and keep showing your passion and eventually someone will take a chance on you. Cheers and good luck!", "More Data Science and Analytics Related Posts:", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data scientist.
