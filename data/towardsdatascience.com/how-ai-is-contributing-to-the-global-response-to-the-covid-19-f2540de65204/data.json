But the enemy is there, invisible, elusive, advancing and requiring our general mobilization\u2019. These are the striking words used by French president, Emmanuel Macron, announcing the government\u2019s latest measures to deal with the coronavirus pandemic in a televised speech.", "What started as an outbreak in China in December 2019 has now developed globally, the Coronavirus health pandemic is becoming a global crisis and a human tragedy, affecting hundreds of thousands of people. More than a dangerous virus, the COVID-19 crisis is an experiment of accelerated decay and de-globalization. The movement is incredibly violent. Borders are closing, people can no longer move freely, curfews are imposed, central banks are cutting interest rates to keep markets functioning and flatten economic shocks, financial institutions seek to reassure customers and keep money flowing for the economy equilibrium, stock markets around the world have plunged as investors fear the spread of the virus and hospitals are struggling to respond to these unprecedented levels of critical patients. Couple of months ago, only Hollywood producers could imagine such disastrous scenario.", "Against the aforementioned long list of challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers around the world are working to better understand, palliate, and stop its spread. Key areas of research include studying the pandemic transmission, detection, development of vaccines and treatments, predicting the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic and even the psychological traces on individuals after several weeks and probably months of lockdown are emerging. In the context of this global mobilization, Artificial Intelligence research labs all over the world are bringing their machine learning expertise to the scientific community to help find potential solutions by enhancing ongoing research efforts, improving the efficiency and speed of existing approaches, and proposing original lines of research. In this article, we present an overview of recent studies using Deep Learning, Machine Learning and, more broadly, Artificial Intelligence, to tackle many aspects of the COVID-19 crisis at different scales.", "Intentionally, we will be excluding from our scope the long lasting debate of the epidemiological predictive models and pandemic evolution graphs to our frequentist and bayesian statistician friends \ud83d\ude01", "First efforts of using Machine Learning in the context of COVID-19 were concentrated on trying to understand the virus severity and infectivity using protein sequences.", "For example, Researchers from the National Center for Biotechnology Information report an in-depth molecular analysis to reconstruct the evolutionary origins of the enhanced pathogenicity of the COVID-19 and other coronaviruses that are severe human pathogens. Using the well known supervised learning estimator; Support Vector Machines, key genomic features that differentiate this pandemic and the viruses behind the two previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS and MERS) have been identified. Those parts of coronavirus\u2019 protein sequences distinguish high case fatality rate from those with low case fatality rate variants.", "Other researchers from the Department of Methodology and Research Infrastructure at Robert Koch Institute in Germany where trying to predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. Authors showed that deep neural networks built from CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard and even homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. In University of Western Ontario researchers used Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbours with Digital Signal Processing to predict the taxonomic classifications of viruses based on their genomic sequences which gave as another confirmation of the hypothesis that it came from bats.", "One of the first approaches explored in the journey towards rapidly curing patients involved discovering therapies which have similar effects to other known effective treatments by studying the molecular setup of existing drugs with AI. Quantified Mind and BioAge Labs used the LINCS dataset of gene expressions and took advantage of Deep Neural Networks to learn an embedding layer denoising expression data and identifying core features, making replicates of the same compound more similar. By definition, the learned embedding space (latent representation) accurately predicted pharmacological similarities and achieved improved performance in comparison with previous similarity measures applied to gene expression measurements. This method may help in identifying drugs with shared therapeutic and biological targets. From another side, Data Science team from Gero AI utilized a Deep Neural Network constructed of the three blocks; DenseNet block, an Embedding Layer, and Perturbagen classi\ufb01er to search for host-target acting antivirals among experimental and approved drugs with potential activity against coronavirus-born diseases. We, therefore, urge prompt experimental characterization of the other predictions and highlight the potential of modern AI/ML technologies for prompt identification of human-trial ready therapeutics against the world\u2019s most urgent medical needs.", "More radical approaches are attempting to discover entirely new compounds for use in targeting COVID-19. In Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug Target Research, scientists implemented a novel advanced deep Q-learning network with the fragment-based drug design for generating potential lead compounds targeting COVID-19. This reinforcement learning approach with fragment-based drug design rewards three aspects of discovered molecules: a drug-likeness score, the inclusion of pre-determined fragments, and the presence of known abstract design patterns believed to be correlated with a compound\u2019s effectiveness. In a slightly different approach, authors from Insilico Medicine fit 28 different models, including Generative Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks. The authors explore potential candidates using a reinforcement learning approach with a reward function that incorporates factors such as measures of drug-likeness, novelty, and diversity.", "One of the hottest areas of interest from governments involves vaccine discovery. In addition to producing virus-neutralizing antibodies via the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response; B-cells and T-cells. There is a subset of T-cells called memory cells which recognize the antigen of a formerly eliminated pathogen, and can quickly activate more effector T-cells upon re-exposure. These processes inform targets for vaccine design. As part of the response, helper proteins called major histocompatibility complex proteins present binding regions of antigens, called epitopes. Therefore, vaccine discovery involves two main and fundamental objectives: identifying suitable epitopes for targeting and ensuring that these epitopes works effectively with variants of genes from person to person. In a Stanford Medicine paper, the authors used two Neural Networks, to identify regions within the COVID-19 genome that are presentable by HLA. They identify 405 viral epitopes that are presentable on MHC-I and MHC-II and validate using known epitopes from SARS-CoV. In an another study from University of Michigan, authors used their Vaxign-ML framework (supervised machine learning reverse vaccinology model for improved prediction of bacterial protective antigens), leveraging supervised classification models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost (XGB), in an effort to predict which viral proteins may serve as effective vaccine targets. While the authors find that the S-protein is the best candidate, they also identify five possible NSPs.", "Medical imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19. Computer Vision AI-based techniques further strengthen their power and help medical specialists. These new models help in disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis.", "Classification of COVID-19 from other pneumonia and healthy subjects have been explored. AI research scientists from Brunel University London propose a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network to estimate the diagnosis uncertainty in COVID-19 prediction. This Bayesian inference improves detection accuracy of the standard VGG-16 deep CNN model from 85.7% to 92.9%. In Zonguldak Bulent Ecevit University, authors proposed three different deep learning CNN models, (ResNet50, InceptionV3, and Inception-ResNetV2), to detect COVID-19 infection from X-ray images. The classification performance results show 98.0%, 97.0% and 78.0%. In another study, authors trained a ResNet-based model to detect COVID-19 from X-ray images. The recall (specificity) and specificity are 96.0% and 70.7%, respectively, along with an AUC of 0.952. Research experts from Tsinghua University use chest CT images from 496 COVID-19 positive cases and 1385 negative cases. A 2D CNN based model is proposed to segment the lung and then identify slices of positive COVID-19 cases. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves sensitivity of 94.1%, specificity of 95.5%, and AUC of 0.979.", "In addition to early diagnosing, studying the infection severity is also crucial for treatment planning. In an interesting study, authors proposed a Random Forest based model trained to assess the severity (non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of COVID-19, is calculated from the Random Forest model.", "Due to the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus related literature, it becomes difficult for the medical and more broadly the scientific research community to keep up with everything happening within these multidisciplinary studies. Thus, there is a growing urgency for innovative approaches to tackle this issue and bridge the gaps between researchers all over the world. In response to this demand, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 59,000 scholarly articles, including over 47,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. From there, thousands of initiatives from independent data scientists and organizations were initiated. AI experts explored the medical/scientific articles by applying Topic Modelling in order to uncover the hidden topics in a collection of documents. Which topics are covered within the literature? But also, what is the meaning of each topic, how prevalent is it and how do topics relate to each other? Also, other tasks were and still tackled. Hereafter, we cite few examples such as: What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability? What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution? What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics? What has been published about ethical and social science considerations? What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?", "Along with the propagation of misinformation and disinformation, the rise in hate speech in recent months has been of significant concern on the major social media worldwide. The extent goes from spreading fake news to phishing for fraudulent aims to hate speech targeting ethnic minorities. For instance, US President Donald Trump has defended repeatedly calling the coronavirus the \u201cChinese virus\u201d during several news conferences, ignoring criticism that it is racist. \u201cIt\u2019s not racist at all,\u201d Trump said. From another side, WHO has launched a new platform to fight what they\u2019re calling the COVID-19 Infodemic, the official name given to the mass spread of incorrect information, contributing to hysteria, panic, and confusion through the public. At present, the infodemic has included everything from medication recommendations, all the way to conspiracy theories.", "In this war, Twitter, for example, moved early in the crisis to ensure that users searching for information on the virus were shown reliable and authoritative sources such as the WHO or health services and government agencies agencies, rather than conspiracy sites or news outlets frequently flagged for spreading fake news. After few weeks of declaring the COVID-19 as a pandemic, more than 20 million tweets were sent mentioning coronavirus. With the exponential interest to the pandemic, Natural Language Processing advanced techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU, LSTM), Transformers (BERT, ULMFiT), were extensively used to detect the spread of false information that may cause harm, and flag that content for removal. The other rival, Facebook, as well unveiled a list of measures to keep users safe from erroneous information and hate speech. National Health agencies and governments from their side also started collaborating with big tech companies to ensure reliable information that they want to spread doesn\u2019t get swamped by the fake news and opportunism.", "Rabeh Ayari is a Principal Data Scientist working on applied AI problems for credit risk modelling & fraud analytics and conducting original research in machine learning.
