It can be how many visitors you get on your website a day, how many clicks your ads get for the next month, how many phone calls you get during your shift, or even how many people will die from a fatal disease next year, etc.", "Below is an example of how I\u2019d use Poisson in real life.", "One way to solve this would be to start with the number of reads. Each person who reads the blog has some probability that they will really like it and clap.", "This is a classic job for the binomial distribution, since we are calculating the probability of the number of successful events (claps).", "A binomial random variable is the number of successes x in n repeated trials. And we assume the probability of success p is constant over each trial.", "However, here we are given only one piece of information \u2014 17 ppl/week, which is a \u201crate\u201d (the average # of successes per week, or the expected value of x). We don\u2019t know anything about the clapping probability p, nor the number of blog visitors n.", "Therefore, we need a little more information to tackle this problem. What more do we need to frame this probability as a binomial problem? We need two things: the probability of success (claps) p & the number of trials (visitors) n.", "Let\u2019s get them from the past data.", "These are stats for 1 year. A total of 59k people read my blog. Out of 59k people, 888 of them clapped.", "We just solved the problem with a binomial distribution.", "Then, what is Poisson for? What are the things that only Poisson can do, but Binomial can\u2019t?", "a) A binomial random variable is \u201cBI-nary\u201d \u2014 0 or 1.", "If we model the success probability by hour (0.1 people/hr) using the binomial random variable, this means most of the hours get zero claps but some hours will get exactly 1 clap. However, it is also very possible that certain hours will get more than 1 clap (2, 3, 5 claps, etc.)", "The problem with binomial is that it CANNOT contain more than 1 event in the unit of time (in this case, 1 hr is the unit time). The unit of time can only have 0 or 1 event.", "Then, how about dividing 1 hour into 60 minutes, and make unit time smaller, for example, a minute? Then 1 hour can contain multiple events. (Still, one minute will contain exactly one or zero events.)", "Kind of. But what if, during that one minute, we get multiple claps? (i.e. someone shared your blog post on Twitter and the traffic spiked at that minute.) Then what? We can divide a minute into seconds. Then our time unit becomes a second and again a minute can contain multiple events. But this binary container problem will always exist for ever-smaller time units.", "The idea is, we can make the Binomial random variable handle multiple events by dividing a unit time into smaller units. By using smaller divisions, we can make the original unit time contain more than one event.", "Mathematically, this means n \u2192 \u221e. Since we assume the rate is fixed, we must have p \u2192 0. Because otherwise, n*p, which is the number of events, will blow up.", "Using the limit, the unit times are now infinitesimal. We no longer have to worry about more than one event occurring within the same unit time. And this is how we derive Poisson distribution.", "b) In the Binomial distribution, the # of trials (n) should be known beforehand.", "If you use Binomial, you cannot calculate the success probability only with the rate (i.e. 17 ppl/week). You need \u201cmore info\u201d (n & p) in order to use the binomial PMF.The Poisson Distribution, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t require you to know n or p. We are assuming n is infinitely large and p is infinitesimal. The only parameter of the Poisson distribution is the rate \u03bb (the expected value of x). In real life, only knowing the rate (i.e., during 2pm~4pm, I received 3 phone calls) is much more common than knowing both n & p.", "Now you know where each component \u03bb^k , k! and e^-\u03bb come from!", "Finally, we only need to show that the multiplication of the first two terms n!/((n-k)!*n^k) is 1 when n approaches infinity.", "Now the Wikipedia explanation starts making sense.", "Plug your own data into the formula and see if P(x) makes sense to you!", "a. The average rate of events per unit time is constant. This means the number of people who visit your blog per hour might not follow a Poisson Distribution, because the hourly rate is not constant (higher rate during the daytime, lower rate during the nighttime). Using monthly rate for consumer/biological data would be just an approximation as well, since the seasonality effect is non-trivial in that domain.", "b. Events are independent.The arrivals of your blog visitors might not always be independent. For example, sometimes a large number of visitors come in a group because someone popular mentioned your blog, or your blog got featured on Medium\u2019s first page, etc. The number of earthquakes per year in a country also might not follow a Poisson Distribution if one large earthquake increases the probability of aftershocks.", "5. Relationship between a Poisson and an Exponential distribution", "If the number of events per unit time follows a Poisson distribution, then the amount of time between events follows the exponential distribution.
