In Data Science and Machine Learning with Scala and Spark (Episode 01/03), we covered the basics of Scala programming language while using a Google Colab environment. In this article, we learn about the Spark ecosystem and its higher-level API for Scala users. As before, we still use Spark 3.0.0 and Google Colab for practicing some code snippets.", "According to Apache Spark and Delta Lake Under the Hood", "Apache Spark is a unified computing engine and a set of libraries for parallel data processing on computer clusters. As of the time this writing, Spark is the most actively developed open source engine for this task; making it the de facto tool for any developer or data scientist interested in big data. Spark supports multiple widely used programming languages (Python, Java, Scala and R), includes libraries for diverse tasks ranging from SQL to streaming and machine learning, and runs anywhere from a laptop to a cluster of thousands of servers. This makes it an easy system to start with and scale up to big data processing or incredibly large scale.", "I highly recommend reading the Apache Spark and Delta Lake Under the Hood quick reference booklet. It is a 45-page document with examples in Scala and pyspark APIs and would not take more than 30 minutes to go through.", "Being a data scientist, we can ask the question \u201cwhat is the importance of Spark for machine learning tasks?\u201d With the increase in the use of electronic devices, social media platforms, and advanced IT systems rollouts, data is being generated at a level never seen before. Also, due to cheap data storage, clients are happy to collect big data for values to be extracted. Machine Learning models have been proven and work for business to better understand and strategize for future expansions. For having access to big data, Spark is the de-facto choice for machine learning to churn through enormous volumes of collected data to build models.", "DataFrame API is the most important higher-level API for Machine Learning. Spark\u2019s MLlib has dropped the support of RDD in favor of DataFrame API.", "Scala was selected to be the core the language to write the Spark engine. However, Apache Spark provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R. In this article, we will use spark 3.0.0.", "Below are the commands to get modules for Scala and Spark in Google colab", "There are two important abstractions of Spark, Spark Context, and Spark Session. Using the below lines, we create a spark session and context.", "Usually, when running spark there are a lot of warnings, using below commands, you can turn them off.", "Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) is the most common abstraction of Spark data structure related closely with Scala. It is very similar to Scala native parallel feature. Let's write some snippets about RRD in Scala.", "You can apply many operations on bigPRng , it will run on Spark.", "Applying the function on each element of RDD is very similar to Scala parallel map function.", "In the previous sections, we have included examples about the RDD and how RDD can be used to compute in parallel. Another popular API in spark is Dataframe. Coming from a Data Scientist background, probably, DataFrame API would make more sense. However, there is a major difference is how to spark data frames and pandas data frames operate under the hood.", "Spark DataFrames can live on multiple physical machines and hence their computations are performed in distributed way opposed to pandas DataFrames.", "Spark MLlib is implemented in DataFrame API going forward.", "Let us learn some basic tricks of Spark DataFrame API mostly useful for machine learning tasks.", "Read through Section 0 in the Google colab about the preparation of data for below snippets.", "Merging is one of the most common and efficient operations in Spark compared with pandas.", "I have prepared a functional Google colab notebook. Feel free to use the notebook for practice.", "For more examples, consult the Spark official documentation", "In this episode, we have learned the basics of Spark with Scala and covered below key concepts with exercises.", "In the next episode, we will learn about Machine Learning models with Spark and Scala using Google Colab runtime.", "Machine Learning with Scala in Google Colaboratory", "Your home for data science.
