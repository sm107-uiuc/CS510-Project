The method is useful for tasks such as question answering, language inference and commonsense inference. As the paper outlines, BERT outperforms preceding natural language processing (NLP) methods when trained on several benchmark natural language understanding (NLU) datasets. These include the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) dataset, the Multi-genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) data set, the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQUAD), and many more.", "What makes BERT unique is its ability to bake bidirectional context into word representations. What exactly does this mean? Typically, language representations are the results of context-free models or unidirectional/left-to-right language models. BERT is the first extension of pre-training contextual representations that includes context from both directions. To understand this, let\u2019s consider three types of text representation:", "A context-free model, such as word2vec and GloVe, would give the word \u201cpitcher\u201d the same representation in the sentences \u201cHe was a baseball pitcher\u201d and \u201cHe was thirsty, so he asked for the pitcher of water.\u201d While we know, based on the context, the word \u201cpitcher\u201d has different meanings, context-free models are unable to provide differentiated representations.", "A unidirectional contextual model, such as OpenAI GPT, would represent each word using the words that came before it, going from left to right. For example, \u201cpitcher\u201d in \u201cHe was a baseball pitcher\u201d is represented using \u201cHe was a baseball.\u201d Unlike context-free models, unidirectional models provide some context for word representations. Despite this, unidirectional models are limited because words can only be represented with preceding text. This limitation motivates the need for bidirectional language models which fully capture the contextual meaning of words.", "While unidirectional models provide some context, sometimes context is needed in both directions in order to fully understand the meaning of a word. For example, consider the sentence \u201cHe knew the pitcher of water was on the table.\u201d Models like OpenAI GPT would represent the word \u201cpitcher\u201d with \u201cHe knew the.\u201d BERT, being bidirectional, would appropriately represent the word \u201cpitcher\u201d with \u201cHe knew the\u201d and \u201cof water was on the table.\u201d By representing words with both preceding and succeeding text, BERT is able to accurately represent the meaning of words in text. You can read more about BERT\u2019s ability to capture bidirectional context in the Google AI blog post here.", "Given our understanding, this raises the question of how this is used in practice. The most relevant application is with Google\u2019s search engine, which uses BERT to enhance search results. In this Google blog post, the authors outline some key improvements to search results after implementing BERT. They use, as an example, the query \u201cCan you get medicine for someone pharmacy.\u201d Before BERT, the results suggested resources for how to get a prescription filled. After BERT, the results correctly represented the context: picking up prescription medicine for another person rather than prescriptions in general. The results then showed pages with relevant content.", "Now let\u2019s consider an interesting application of BERT. In recent decades, corporations have adopted a variety of cloud-based solutions for advertising job ads such as application tracking systems (ATS). While this allows corporations to facilitate more efficient hiring, it lends itself to scammers generating and advertising fraudulent content. Specifically, scammers have become adept at crafting convincing ads for blue-collar and secretarial jobs. Further, through application tracking systems like Workable, scammers can effortlessly collect thousands of resumes using fraudulent posts as bait.", "There are two aims of employment scams. The first is the collection of contact information such as email, zip code, phone number and address. This information can then be sold to marketers and cold callers. The more malicious aim of employment scams is identity theft. The fake posts usually direct users from the ATS to third party sites, where users are then put through a series of phony interview activities. Eventually, users are asked for highly sensitive information such as social security numbers and bank account information, which can be used for money laundering.", "Recently, the University of the Aegean published the Employment Scam Aegean Dataset in an effort to bring the employment scam issue to light. The data contains about 18,000 records containing real-life and fraudulent job advertisements. The task of identifying fake job posts naturally falls under binary classification. Specifically, we will use the BERT model to classify fake posts by representing the words in the job postings, which come labelled as either \u2018fraudulent\u2019 or \u2018genuine,\u2019 using bidirectional context. In this use case, the contextual meaning of words found in \u2018fraudulent\u2019 postings should be distinct from the contextual meaning of words found in \u2018genuine\u2019 postings. Capturing these bidirectional contextual differences should result in improved classification performance, compared to unidirectional and context-free models. Before beginning, thanks to Dima Shulga, whose post \u201cBERT to the Rescue\u201d inspired my work here.", "First, let\u2019s import some necessary packages:", "Next, let\u2019s read the data into a data frame and print the first five rows. We can also set the max number of display columns to \u2018None\u2019:", "For simplicity, let\u2019s look at the \u2018description\u2019 and \u2018fraudulent\u2019 columns:", "The target for our classification model is in the column \u2018fraudulent.\u2019 To get an idea of the distribution in and kinds of values for \u2018fraudulent\u2019 we can use \u2018Counter\u2019 from the collections module:", "The \u20180\u2019 value corresponds to a normal job posting and the \u20181\u2019 value corresponds to a fraudulent posting. We see that the data is slightly imbalanced, meaning there are more normal job posting (17,000) than fraudulent postings (866).", "Before proceeding, let\u2019s drop \u2018NaN\u2019 values:", "Next, we want to balance our data set such that we have an equal number of \u2018fraudulent\u2019 and \u2018not fraudulent\u2019 types. We also should randomly shuffle the targets:", "Again, verifying that we get the desired result:", "Next, we want to format the data such that it can be used as input into our BERT model. We split our data into training and testing sets:", "We generate a list of dictionaries with \u2018description\u2019 and \u2018fraudulent\u2019 keys:", "Generate a list of tuples from the list of dictionaries :", "Notice we truncate the input strings to 512 characters because that is the maximum number of tokens BERT can handle.", "Finally, generate a boolean array based on the value of \u2018fraudulent\u2019 for our testing and training sets:", "We create our BERT classifier which contains an \u2018initialization\u2019 method and a \u2018forward\u2019 method that return token probabilities:", "Next, we generate training and testing masks:", "Generate token tensors for training and testing:", "and finally, prepare our data loaders:", "We use the Adam optimizer to minimize the Binary Cross Entropy loss and we train with a batch size of 1 for 1 EPOCHS:", "This displays a confusion matrix containing precision, recall, and f1-score metrics, all of which describe model performance. Obviously, this post is just a primer on solving the employment scam with BERT. Through additional fine-tuning, we can increase the accuracy further and uncover even more fraudulent listings. The advantages of the BERT model over context-free and unidirectional context models are clear. Bidirectional language processing makes BERT much better at using context to determine a listing\u2019s legitimacy, thus protecting job seekers from exploitation by bad actors. Although this is just one way of putting machine learning to work solving real-world problems, it\u2019s a good example of how useful BERT can be.
