So, how can we identify, remediate, and even prevent this all-too-common problem before it becomes a massive headache? The answer lies in the data industry\u2019s next frontier: data observability.", "When you were growing up, did you ever read a Choose Your Own Adventure novel? You, the protagonist, are responsible for making choices that will determine the outcome of your epic journey, whether that\u2019s slaying a fire-breathing dragon or embarking on a voyage into the depths of Antarctica. If you\u2019re in data, these \u201cadventures\u201d might look a little different:", "It\u2019s 3 a.m. You\u2019ve spent the last four hours troubleshooting a data fire drill, and you\u2019re exhausted. You need to figure out why your team\u2019s Tableau dashboard isn\u2019t pulling the freshest data from Snowflake so that Jane in Finance can generate that report\u2026 yesterday.", "You\u2019re migrating to a new data warehouse and there\u2019s no way to know where important data lives. Redshift? Azure? A spreadsheet in Google Drive? It\u2019s like a game of telephone trying to figure out where to look, what the data should look like, and who owns it.", "It takes 9 months of onboarding before you know where any of your company\u2019s \u201cgood data\u201d lives. You\u2019ve found so many \u201cFINAL_FINAL_v3_I_PROMISE_ITS_FINAL\u201d versions of a single data set that you don\u2019t know what\u2019s up and what\u2019s down any more, let alone don\u2019t know which data tables are in production and which ones should be deprecated.", "Before we dive into how to fix this problem, let\u2019s talk about the common cause of broken data pipelines: data downtime.", "In the early days of the internet, if your site was down, it was no big deal \u2014 you\u2019d get it back up and running in a few hours with little impact on the customer (because, frankly, there weren\u2019t that many and our expectations of software were much lower).", "Flash forward to the era of Instagram, TikTok, and Slack \u2014 now, if your app crashes, that means an immediate impact on your business. To meet our need for five nines of uptime, we built tools, frameworks, and even careers fully dedicated to solving this problem.", "It\u2019s no longer enough to simply have a great product. Every company serious about maintaining their competitive edge is leveraging data to make smarter decisions, optimize their solutions, and even improve the user experience. In many ways, the need to monitor when data is \u201cdown\u201d and pipelines are broken is even more critical than achieving five nines. As one data leader at a 5,000-person e-commerce company recently told me: \u201cit\u2019s worse to have bad data on my company\u2019s website than to not have a website at all.\u201d", "In homage to the concept of application downtime, we call this problem data downtime, and it refers to periods of time where your data is missing, inaccurate, or otherwise erroneous. Data downtime affects data engineers, data scientists, and data analysts, among others at your company, leading to wasted time (north of 30 percent of a data team\u2019s working hours!), sunk costs, low morale, and perhaps worst of all, lack of trust in your insights.", "Here are some common sources of data downtime \u2014 maybe they\u2019ll resonate:", "With the increased scrutiny around data collection, storage, and applications, it\u2019s high time data downtime was treated with the diligence it deserves.", "Data observability, a concept pulled from best practices in DevOps and software engineering, refers to an organization\u2019s ability to fully understand the health of the data in their system. By applying the same principles of software application observability and reliability to data, these issues can be identified, resolved and even prevented, giving data teams confidence in their data to deliver valuable insights.", "Data observability can be split into five key pillars:", "Data observability provides end-to-end visibility into your data pipelines, letting you know which data is in production and which data assets can be deprecated, thereby identifying and preventing downtime.", "A robust and holistic approach to data observability incorporates:", "With these guidelines in tow, data teams can more effectively manage and even prevent data downtime from occurring in the first place.", "So \u2014 where will your data adventure take you?", "Interested in learning more about data observability for your organization?
