Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn\u2019t compete, and would be superseded.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Hawking", "We are currently ushering in the 4th Industrial Revolution which is driven by big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Lots of operations in our business and daily life are being automated by AI technology. This is not uncommon to see how AI is being touted as a \u201ccure\u201d or solution to a problem arisen from a different domain (business, health science, law, to name a few). However, the fact is AI can also be our disaster without understanding its limitation and using proper data management to leverage its power.", "In this article, we are going to look at what AI cannot do and how does it fail to meet user demand. This will be done by presenting five case studies that just happen in recent years (2015\u20132019).", "There is a team of researchers from the German Technische Universitat of Dortmund, the Ghent University in Belgium, and the Technical University in Munich who ran predictive modelling to foretell the likely winners of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Tournament. The follows are the predicted results ordered by the rank of probabilities of winning the world champion and the actual results:", "From the result above, it is obvious that the prediction poorly reflects reality. While the prediction may only serve as an indicator of how likely a participant country to win the championship, the discrepancy between prediction and the actual outcome is not negligible.", "The predictive model was supported by an extensive dataset that covers the historical records of past four World Cups along with other variables such as FIFA ranking, the economy of the participant country, skills of coach etc. Besides, the prediction was also backed by the fine-tuned Poisson regression, random forest and ranking methods. In short, the study was carefully crafted but not based on a random design. So, what went wrong here?", "One reason could be due to \u201cuncertainty\u201d nature of the event (football match) itself. Historical data may not always project a plausible future trend and this is especially true in an event like World Cup Championship. Even with the existence of other supportive variables (e.g. country economy, coach quality etc), there were still too much missing information and undefined variables which are significant to predict an outcome of a match.", "For example, factor like player\u2019s personal issue/mistake, referee fairness, team performance & cooperation is not the info we can easily obtain, process it and fetch it to a machine learning pipeline. Some of those factors are not convertible into a valid metric which can be recognized by the machine learning model. Just imagine how do we measure the fairness of a referee or team cooperation and convert it to either a quantitative or qualitative metric? An overcomplicated metric may also not help with the situation here but only confuse the model. The question here is neither quantity nor quality of the data, but some required info is just not \u201cmachine learning-friendly\u201d.", "Although AI backed by big data can propel predictive analytic and result in many interesting use cases, it would never resolve the uncertainty nature of some real-life events entirely. The predictive power of a machine learning model will never outperform the human brain which is much better in assimilating various quantifiable and non-quantifiable factors and deduce a more reliable prediction.", "Amazon is famous for its recommendation engine which is highly used in their online marketplace that manages to bring in billons dollars of sales. However, their recommender system is not always successful all the time. In early 2018, Reuters reported that Amazon scraps their AI recruiting tool which showed bias against women.", "The initial aim of the AI recruiting tool was to automate the job candidate selection process by assigning a score on each candidate\u2019s submitted resume and recommend the top scorer for hiring. Each candidate was scored on a scale of 1 to 5. However, the AI recruiting tool seemed to discriminate against women by penalizing their resumes.", "The root cause of this failure was due to imbalance data that Amazon team used to train their machine learning model. They used successful resume and unsuccessful resumes over the past 10 years to train their model and unfortunately most of those resumes originated from men. This imbalance data is a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry which does not only happen in Amazon alone. If there is a bias in the earlier hiring processes, a similar bias will also be introduced in the machine learning model trained by the data obtained from those hiring process. Basically, the machine learning model follows a common rule as what human being does: You are what you eat.", "The AI recruiting tool penalized the resume with some specific key terms such as \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d and favoured some verbs which commonly seen on male engineer\u2019s resumes such as \u201cexecuted\u201d and \u201ccaptured\u201d. Despite some efforts done by Amazon team to improve the tool to make it more neutral to these particular terms, the AI project had eventually been shut down and the relevant AI team was disbanded.", "No matter how sophisticated our AI solution, the resulting machine learning model will only be as good as the data that we use to train it. The training data must reflect the real-world situation without any bias which may lead to selective preference of one particular class over the others. However, the adoption of \u201cbalanced data\u201d can be a huge challenge in itself because such data may not always readily available in many cases.", "Henn na Hotel in Japan started its business in 2015 and was recognized by Guinness Book of World Records as the world first robot-staffed hotel. It once possessed 243 robots that served as a check-in receptionist, cleaner, in-room assistant etc which cover most of the hotel services. It was initially aimed to offer a fresh experience to customers while saving the staff costs at the same time. The hotel was only managed by several human staffs when the business went well at the beginning.", "Over time, the robots were found to create more works instead of reducing the workloads of human staff. The receptionist robot in the front desk could only speak a limited number of languages which fail to meet the demands of many guests from diverse countries and language background. The robots also struggled with recognizing different passport and identity card formats which can be easily achieved by human staff. The in-room voice assistant, Churi, appeared to only understand some basic commands (eg. turn light on or off). Besides, Churi could confuse the snoring of guest with a voice command and fire an annoying response while the guest falling asleep. Many often human staffs were called to step in to resolve the issues created by the robots. As a result, the hotel management made a hard decision to cut more than half of its service robot in January 2019 and replaced them with human staffs.", "One main underlying issue here is the expectation gap that appeared between what was envisaged by customers and what was actually offered by the robots in reality. The current AI technology is just not ready to perform many of the hotel services expected by customers. Apart from receiving negative customer feedback, the hotel also suffered from spending lots of money in the robot maintenance service.", "The Henn na Hotel case study projects a fact that the over-optimism about AI technology can result in a great revenue loss in a business. Before using AI, we need to look into the tech realism aspect by considering which application AI is suitable for and which just not fit into the picture. Sometimes we tend to forget the fact that a simple & natural action or response from a human, might be a formidable logical problem for an AI robot. The human workforce is still indispensable in many jobs.", "In March 2016, Microsoft launched an AI Chatbot, Tay, which was designed to interact with 18\u201324 year-olds in the U.S. for entertainment purpose. According to Microsoft, Tay was \u201cdesigned to engage and entertain people where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation\u201d. In less than 24 hours, Tay managed to attract 50,000 followers and generated about 100,000 tweets.", "At the starting point, Tay served its purpose well by establishing an expected entertaining conversation with users. However, Tay was soon \u201ctuned\u201d by tremendously racist and offensive remarks originated from a subgroup of malicious users. This was a coordinated attack by exploiting the vulnerability of the chatbot. One can tell Tay to \u201crepeat after me\u201d and such an approach will tell Tay to repeat any type of message (malicious / non-malicious) in its interaction with users. Within 16 hours, Tay was transformed from a playful and friendly bot into a racist that referred feminism as a cult, touted Nazis were right, to name a few. In the end, Microsoft took the Tay offline for re-tooling in less than 24 hours from its launch.", "This is a typical example to show how malicious data can destroy an AI model and distort its original function. Without taking a precaution step, AI model is not automatically immune to external harmful influence when it is launched in a live environment. Even the tech giant like Microsoft can overlook their model vulnerability.", "Microsoft has since learnt from the lesson and look into the ethical capacity of the components of AI. As what has already been mentioned above, AI will just follow the rule: \u201cYou are what you eat\u201d. AI system can feed on both positive and negative data from users which affect its behaviour. Just like a human who always filters whatever input message flowing through their mind, a similar filtering mechanism is also needed for AI to enable it to be more resilient to the malicious attack.", "We may be quite well aware of how AI is used in fraud detection to capture the fraudulent activities. It is not uncommon to see the relevant use cases in the industry such as bank and insurance company. Ironically, AI can also be utilized by the fraudster to commit fraud.", "In Aug 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported an unusual criminal case that the fraudsters used AI software to impersonate a chief executive\u2019s voice to make a fraudulent transfer of $243,000. The CEO from a UK based energy film received a request from his CEO of the German parent company to make an urgent transaction to the bank account of a Hungarian supplier. The request was made over a phone call which fraudster manage to use AI to mimic the German CEO voice. The AI can spoof the voice of the German CEO with a slight German accent and carry the man\u2019s melody.", "Unfortunately, there are no suspects are identified and therefore little is know about the actual AI software used by the fraudsters and how they managed to collect the voice data necessary to spoof the German CEO. The fraudsters are suspected to use a similar commercial AI software developed by Dessa to commit the crime. The AI software developed by Dessa has produced the most realistic replica voice of Joe Rogan (Creator and host of one of the world\u2019s most popular podcasts).", "One lesson we can learn from this rare AI-based cybercrime is that AI can be weaponized for malicious purpose instead of serving human with good end. This is a fallacy to presume AI is created all for good without knowing its nature as a two-edged sword. Fraudsters are always co-evolving with anti-fraudsters in using technology for their respective purpose. We would have to keep updating ourselves with new-school security awareness to detect and prevent the ever-evolving crimes.", "In summary, we should not simply worship AI as our Swiss Army Knife which can solve any problem surrounding us. AI do have its own limitations and specific scope of its use cases.", "However, this article doesn\u2019t intend to \u201cdilute\u201d the impact of AI. In fact, nobody can negate the fact that we are living with AI technology and this trend is going to persist regardless of the AI current limitations. The main point here is to build an awareness that AI is not going to completely replace human but we would rather use AI to augment human intelligence to serve humanity with good end by making our daily operation faster, scalable and cost-efficient. Perhaps we should shift our mindset to a paradigm that how human can collaborate with AI more effectively instead of over claiming its capability that can lead to disastrous consequences.", "Your home for data science.
