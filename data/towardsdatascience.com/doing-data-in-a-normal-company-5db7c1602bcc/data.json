As hard as I try to escape from the definition, this shapes me as an engineer more than the master degree I\u2019ve metaphorically hung on my room\u2019s wall \u2014 I mean, is there really anyone out there that is still doing it? I decided to switch to data during the last year of my master degree, mainly because the idea of the classical computer engineer job (full-stack developer?) that some internships here and there gave me didn\u2019t exactly look like what I wanted to do on a daily basis. I wanted to be more creative, interact with different people and backgrounds; ending up using the computer science\u2019s skills more as a tool than as a very specific competence. So far things are going pretty well, but my engineering background and some of the tasks related to that title are chasing me way more than I expected, making me reconsider a little that romantic and probably naive idea I had about what working in data actually means.", "I wanted to be more creative, interact with different people and backgrounds; ending up using the computer science\u2019s skills more as a tool than as a very specific competence.", "I am currently the to-go person for a lot of different data-related problems in a fast growing company in the Netherlands. We are very data-driven, with an innovative mindset and a solid engineering culture, but it isn\u2019t a tech giant with millions of budget to spend in data and the possibility to hire great specialists with a very narrow set of amazing skills; a normal company.", "I started as a data scientist, in a team that was a mix of data scientists and data analysts [1] with little focus on improving the data infrastructure. A year and a half later, when people ask me what I do for a living I find myself answering data engineer (sometimes). I find it quite interesting how this switch hasn\u2019t been the decision of other people, but mainly the natural consequence of my set of skills, and of finding myself in the right place at the right time.", "There are a lot of insightful reads online that describe the role of a data engineer in a startup and when it is actually the right time to hire one, the thing that is probably harder to define though is what actually means to be a Data Engineer in 2020. If you speak with some professionals in this business, it is quite difficult to have a clear picture. There are some patterns, of course, and no one tries to reinvent the wheel, but for data more than for other fields, different companies have very different challenges, with tasks, tech stacks and responsibilities that might vary quite a lot. People landing successfully in the job often share a solid computer engineering background; the ones with more experience even have some years as classical software engineers under the hood. All of them are now cloud enthusiasts and can very easily switch to Dev-Ops positions if they want that.", "Personally, I noticed room for improvement in our data architecture and we have a very skilled Ops team to learn concepts and best practices from. It wasn\u2019t easy at the beginning, but my engineering background helped me to steal some knowledge and experience of the latter and apply them somewhere else. Writing and scheduling cron-jobs on a K8s cluster, DAGs on Airflow, ETL tasks on dbt, are things the job market has created a specific role for, but they are nothing that a good software engineer cannot do and will very likely end up doing, in the early stages of a scaling company. Data engineers are just software engineers focused on data, in the exact same way as the classical ones are responsible for a specific part of a product (payments, messages, etc). Being the field quite new and still shaping itself, it is likely that data engineers also take care of their infrastructure, requiring a broader skill-set and making the good ones harder to find and definitely more expensive.", "Data engineers are just software engineers focused on data, in the exact same way as the classical ones are responsible for a specific part of a product (payments, messages, etc).", "Companies that have dealt with large amounts of data for longer time periods without a dedicated team are probably the ones that now put more challenges over the data engineers, while the explosion of managed ETL and cloud data warehouses have facilitated a lot the job of younger companies that can have something solid and reliable in place from day 0.", "Improving the data flows and the overall quality of the data architecture should come as a wish before being a need, because managed solutions designed for non (strictly) technical people start to be not enough after a certain scale. If you find yourself in the need of hiring a data engineer it is probably too late, and this is already affecting the delivery. Adding engineering skills to a data team, not only makes the processes more solid and reliable, but often times unblocks new possibilities and use cases to add value to the company. A data engineer can be seen as a multiplier, that leveraging his skills and introducing new technologies allows the data stakeholders to do more or in an easier way.", "A data engineer can be seen as a multiplier, that leveraging his skills and introducing new technologies allows the data stakeholders to do more or in an easier way.", "Increasing the complexity of the data infrastructure and the variety of the tools used though, just enables some potential. In order for the company to pick up this potential for generating actual value, it is required that all the data stakeholders have the right skillset (or mentality) to pick up the challenge and start using these tools themselves. In a growing data team, it is required that each of the members has a quite broad skill-set, and isn\u2019t unlikely that data analysts are required to know Python at non-trivial levels, speeding up the delivery quite a lot.", "The requirements for having a broad (or sometimes huge) skills set is even more important for data scientists in today\u2019s job market. Just by looking at the requirements for Machine Learning Engineers\u2019 open positions you realise it has to be expected that these people will have to take care of all the phases needed to deploy machine learning in production, adding to engineering related tasks a good knowledge of math and statistics. It isn\u2019t unlikely to end up doing job interviews where you span from LSTMs to TCP servers in a half an hour time interval. Our team is growing in this direction as well, and finding new people to onboard is always a struggle, even if having a computer science background helps a lot. The problem here is that is simply not worth it for a middle-sized company to have full-time data scientists with a very narrow domain of expertise. Investing in AI is a very risky decision with a lot of different variables hard to foresee. Hiring unicorns makes the process way easier to manage and more likely to succeed.", "Investing in AI is a very risky decision with a lot of different variables hard to foresee. Hiring unicorns makes the process way easier to manage and more likely to succeed.", "As a personal preference, the part of my job that I still like the most is the one related to modelling and machine learning experimentation, basically what I wished to do while dreaming about landing in data. In a small team in a growing company, though, it is important to deliver value as soon as possible, ending up doing a lot of engineering work just for the sake of having the chance to keep doing this kind of stuff. On a different level, as an engineer, I realised how much I love building things that work, and I discovered it just while actually working on them. Being in data nowadays, for how challenging it is, allows you to do both, changing focus and tasks quite often and lowering the risk of getting bored, or too used to what you are doing (also technology wise). If I look at my current day to day it is full of things that I honestly didn\u2019t wish to do months ago, but of which I am now quite an enthusiast and an internal driver. If it is true that a lot of this is due to the great company I am working for, it is also true that the field is rewarding its workers as no one else in tech.", "[1] A month ago I had a conversation with a colleague of mine that wishes to switch studying data. She wanted to have a quick 101 on this world and a brief introduction to all the roles that a proper data team has to fill \u2014 mainly who does what. I spent some time the days before to come up with a definition over the distinction between data scientists and analysts, and at which level of abstraction is necessary to put a data engineer in the picture. The thing that in the end I said to her is that analysts are more concerned with the past, while scientists with the future. It is quite a slogan, of course, but it isn\u2019t very far from reality. The big field of machine learning, the knowledge of which is probably the boundary between the two profiles, is mainly related to modelling, to learn from data \u2014 the past \u2014 in order to have an impact on future, unseen, samples with a flavour that cannot be found in reporting or plain data analysis.", "Your home for data science.
