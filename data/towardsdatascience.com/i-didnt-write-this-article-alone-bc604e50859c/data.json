When it comes to making an informed decision, you need someone who understands how to write a great data visualization (or analytics) application. That person can also understand the data that is coming in and determine the best way to use the data.", "This work is heavily based on the work by greycode and huggingface you can see their repos here:", "But before running the code we need some basics about how this model works (if you just want to use the model go to the next section).", "GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. Sadly for us, but maybe better for the world they did not release the whole model, instead they released a smaller model. You can see the original implementation here:", "Right now we have a (117M parameter) and medium (345M parameter) versions of GPT-2 to test. The model looks like this:", "Our model largely follows the original transformer work. We trained a 12-layer decoder-only transformer with masked self-attention heads (768 dimensional states and 12 attention heads). For the position-wise feed-forward networks, we used 3072 dimensional inner states. We used the Adam optimization scheme with a max learning rate of 2.5e-4. The learning rate was increased linearly from zero over the first 2000 updates and annealed to 0 using a cosine schedule. We train for 100 epochs on minibatches of 64 randomly sampled, contiguous sequences of 512 tokens. Since layernorm is used extensively throughout the model, a simple weight initialization of N(0, 0.02) was sufficient. We used a bytepair encoding (BPE) vocabulary with 40,000 mergesand residual, embedding, and attention dropouts with a rate of 0.1 for regularization. We also employed a modified version of L2 regularization proposed in, with w = 0.01 on all non bias or gain weights. For the activation function, we used the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU). We used learned position embeddings instead of the sinusoidal version proposed in the original work.", "The \u201coriginal work\u201d their mentioning here is a paper from Google called \u201cAttention Is All You Need\u201d (2017). Here they proposed a transformer that looked like this:", "The Transformer is a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.", "The Transformer depends on a Encoder and a Decoder. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, \u2026, xn) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1, \u2026, zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1, \u2026, ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive, consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.", "They are connected through an attention mechanism. It can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.", "There\u2019s much more to talk about the attention mechanism and the way it works, for that read the great article by James Montantes:", "So far we\u2019ve been technical but it\u2019s good to have an idea of what we\u2019re doing before using a model. But now, how do we use this?", "We\u2019ll let\u2019s start by spinning of a JupyterLab session and cloning some repos. For that I\u2019m using MatrixDS a cloud hosted system for data science.", "The project is there (use forklift to test it):", "Note: If you forklift the repo you will have everything already there to test the code, if not follow the instructions bellow.", "Inside JupyterLab (the one I used for this tutorial), open the terminal and start by cloning greycode repo:", "Then go to the folder you just created and download hugginface\u2019s pre-traine model:", "I also needed to install PyTorch and tqdm, for that with pip just type:", "After that, you are good to go!

It has also been working to make electricity more affordable for the world\u2019s poorest and has been investing in new energy technologies to address these challenges.", "I don\u2019t think the algorithm had enough information in this example and it just talked about electricity and power. Let\u2019s try something different.", "Let\u2019s try something from my article \u201cThe 3 Biggest Mistakes on Learning Data Science\u201d:", "Data science needs practice. Everything you learn, even though if the professor doesn\u2019t tell you, practice and try it. This is fundamental to really comprehend things and when you are working in the field you will be doing a lot of different practical stuff.", "The next time you are in a field you will be working on or you will be doing a lot of different things that will be different for you. And you will be doing them in the real world. You can do different things. You will find different things in different fields. You will find different things in different jobs. You will find different things. So it is not something you would do in the real world. The job that you find more interesting. The job that you find more interesting. The job that you find more interesting. The job that you find more interesting.

It is the world that you need to understand.", "That looks way better isn\u2019t it?", "Finally, let\u2019s go back to the first sentences in the article:", "A data scientist is not someone who knows how to use Python or R, is the person that can improve and optimize how a business work by understanding the data they have and create models that explain the complexity of reality while creating solutions that can drive actions, specific actions related to the business.", "When it comes to analyzing data in your data, you need someone to understand what types of data you are looking at and how you would use those types of data in your business case.

That person could also help you with your data analysis software and learn how to better analyze your data.", "That\u2019s just awesome!
