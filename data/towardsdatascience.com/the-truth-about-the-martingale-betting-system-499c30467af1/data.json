Since my current salary is way below that, I got curious. Only a fool would say no to this, right?", "Not only did they offer a higher salary, but flexible working hours were also on the table: basically for each hour, the expected revenue would be 50 euros. Many aspects made me think that this is a legitimate thing, such as:", "Without googling it first, I signed up and began with my training. It took maybe 3\u20135 minutes until I realized that this is all about systematic betting on roulette. I\u2019ve had some Facebook ads about it a few years back and every time I try to see through the strategy itself. Mostly it is about a simple casino game (such as roulette) and a martingale betting system.", "In roulette, it is always possible to place a bet on something that has a 50% chance of occurring: even/odd number, red/black tile, 1\u201318/19\u201336. The martingale system is as follows:", "You should start with a small amount, for instance, 1\u20ac, and keep making the same bet until you lose. When this happens, double the size of your bet (2\u20ac) for the next spin. If you win, then you will recover the money you lost on the previous round and win a little extra. If you stay on the losing course, just keep doubling your bet and the logic stays the same \u2014 for example, if you have lost 7 consecutive times (which is equivalent to losing 127\u20ac), then your next win of 128\u20ac should mean that you haven\u2019t lost anything at all. Keep in mind that as soon as you win, you should restart and make the 1\u20ac bet again for the next spin and repeat the entire process.", "There may be two different, yet popular opinions on this:", "You can never lose all your money, as long as you have infinite amount of money.", "It is impossible in roulette to lose 10 times straight when placing the same bet.", "In my honest opinion, you can\u2019t have an infinite amount of money and it is possible to lose more than 10 times in a row when placing the same bet (in fact it should have a probability just below 0,1%). To prove that, I have made some simulations using Python and here are the results.", "I swear by the name of Science that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.", "The script simulates 1000000 roulette outcomes within a second. At each simulation, a random whole number between 1 and 36 is picked. I have intentionally dropped 0 to lose the house edge. Hence we have a 50% chance of \u201cwinning\u201d instead of 48,6% or 47,4%, depending on the roulette wheel you are playing.", "Each result is later stored in a list called results and that\u2019s what we should analyze next. Let\u2019s add another layer of code:", "This takes the results list we created before and creates another list where numbers are replaced with \u201codd\u201d and \u201ceven\u201d, depending on their value. The contents of resultscopy should look like this [\u201codd\u201d, \u201ceven\u201d, \u201ceven\u201d, \u201ceven\u201d, \u201codd\u201d, \u201codd\u201d].", "Now we should explore this list while counting the amount of \u201codd\u201d and \u201ceven\u201d we could consecutively get.", "This function iterates over the list containing odds and evens and counts the consecutive results. In this way, a list of:", "since there were two odd numbers at first, then one even number, then four odd numbers, and so on\u2026 Let\u2019s add a bit more to our code to obtain readable statistics:", "This creates a dictionary and counts the amount of odd- or even-streaks that occurred during 1,000,000 simulations. The results are fascinating:", "When playing roulette 1,000,000 times in a row, it is possible to have 19 outcomes in a row that are the same. Imagine using the martingale system described above and losing 19 times in a row. Your 20th bet would have to be 524,288 times larger than your smallest bet. Can you afford that?", "Note: In such extreme cases, table limits stop players from making bets that are astronomically high and hence the martingale strategy fails after a certain number of consecutive losses.", "Let\u2019s add a few steps and suppose we have money in this simulation. The smallest bet is 1\u20ac and the average Joe starts playing with 500\u20ac. In python, we should add a few global variables and redefine our oddeven() function.", "In an ideal world, you would never expect your money to get below 0. Let\u2019s run 1,000,000 simulations and plot the amount of money we would have after each game.", "Oh no! There seem to be three extreme spikes indicating that our money went below zero.", "It was mentioned before that the martingale system works perfectly if you have tons of money (or an infinite amount of money). It is true if one can define such an amount. Before writing this article, one of my simulations showed a losing streak of 25 \u2014 you would need 33,5 million to recover from that on your 26th bet. I believe that most of the readers wouldn\u2019t have the nerve to even place that bet.", "If you are wondering if I\u2019m showing a result that I got after a few tries, then yes. I tried to get the best figure I could get in a few tries, but I can guarantee you that every time the script was executed, the average Joe went bankrupt. I added some extra code to have a notion of how this simulation went: \u201cFault\u201d if the amount of money went below 0 and \u201cSuccess\u201d if it never happened:", "To run this script multiple times (in this case 100 times), a batch file was created:", "100 executions of 1,000,000 roulette simulations took my computer a little less than two minutes. Out of these 100, none were successful.", "What if we modify those parameters a bit? Let\u2019s say our average Joe has 5000 euros in the beginning and is determined to play 1000 games per day for a week (7000 games in total). And to be extra sure, let\u2019s execute it 10 times and present the results in a tabular form:", "As you can already see, with these settings, an average Joe would have a ~66% chance to have some money remaining at the end of the week, and the highest possible revenue would be around 3600\u20ac.", "Using a martingale betting system in roulette can destroy your wallet and therefore it would be wise to avoid it in the first place. There\u2019s indeed a correlation between the initial amount of money, success percentage and number of games one is willing to play. Nevertheless, if something has a 1:1000 chance of occurring, it can happen on 1st, 1000th, 2000th try. You just simply don\u2019t know, when.", "Keep in mind that the house edge was intentionally ignored. In real life, you\u2019d have it working against you.", "Your home for data science.
