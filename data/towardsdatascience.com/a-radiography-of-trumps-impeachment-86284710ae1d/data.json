But what would that polarization look like? There\u2019s no better place to answer that than Twitter, the mecca of digital conversation worldwide, so I downloaded 500k tweets from Thursday, the 18th of December, day when the final vote took place in the House of Representatives to impeach Donald J. Trump. The result is both beautiful and daunting.", "Let\u2019s look at the methodology first. As I mentioned, I used the Twitter Public API to connect to the Twitter server and get all tweets that contained generic keywords, like \u2018Trump\u2019 or \u2018impeachment\u2019. The process was long, though, and it took my very caffeinated MacBook a couple of days to reach the 500k tweets mark (needless to say, it\u2019s almost impossible to get anything done with the computer during those times). There are, of course, other ways to get around, like streaming the tweets in real-time, which is easier and less computationally expensive, but I could not go back in time that Friday afternoon, when it was too late to capture tweets live.", "In order to connect to the Twitter API you need to create a developer profile and apply for a license. The process is not long and you will be equipped with your own license in no time if you do it right.", "After having the tweets, it was time to do some network theory. Think about it: if every account participating in the conversation is represented as a point in space (say, a node) and if every time any one of them interacts with another via a reply, a retweet or a quote we draw a line between them, we would end up with a bunch of nodes linked together with what we\u2019ll call edges. Thus we can represent the conversation that took place on December the 18th as a social network and, better yet, we can graph it to visually assess what\u2019s going on.", "My graphing tool was Gephi, an open source network graphing software (for which a ton of tutorials are available online). All you need to pass to Gephi is a simple csv file with two columns: the account that generated an interaction (the \u2018source\u2019 column) and the account that received said interaction (the \u2018target\u2019 column). After that, you are free to play around with your network and represent it any way you like. Here\u2019s what I did:", "Let\u2019s revisit that, step by step:", "First, the layout. There are several algorithms that calculate all sorts of fundamental aspects in a network, such as, how central certain nodes are, how far apart or close together should they be from each other, what clusters of nodes can be found in the network, how long or how elastic can the edges be, and so on. For the current graphing task, I chose ForceAtlas2, which, as the name suggests, is the sequel of ForceAtlas and is better equipped for larger networks. In essence, the algorithm takes on a couple of laws of physics to arrive at a stable state of balance or equilibrium between forces: it simulates the repulsion between nodes, as if they were charged particles (following Coulomb\u2019s Law), while making the edges attract their nodes, just like springs (following Hooke\u2019s Law).", "Second, the modularity. It\u2019s a way to detect communities within a network by giving a score that determines the strength of the divisions of the network into modules. High modularity means that a network has densely connected nodes within communities or modules, while links with other nodes in other communities or modules are rather loose or sparse.", "Finally, the labelling. It\u2019s crucial that we know which agents of the social network are the most relevant at a given time and so we can simply include their labels on the graph (for instance, their Twitter handlers). Imagine, though, a graph with hundreds of thousands of labels: it would look cluttered and unrecognizable. To solve that, we can simply ask Gephi to calculated the average weighted degree for each node.", "The what now? The degree of a node is the sum of edges that interact with it: for instance, in our case, retweets an account has gotten or retweets an account has made. Given that our graph is, by nature, directed, we care a lot about which direction each action has. In other words, we care mostly about which account was retweeted the most (in-degree) or which account retweeted the most (out-degree). The weight of said degrees simply relates to the importance or the quality of the edges for a node. For example, when there has been repeated interaction between two specific nodes, that edge will have a higher weight and therefore its degree will be pondered given such weights. When you have the degrees, you can ask Gephi to label the nodes relative to their degrees, so that the most relevant ones within a network will be the most visible.", "We chose weighted in-degree to showcase the importance of each node in our graph: we we want to see who influenced the conversation the most, by means of who got retweeted, replied or quoted the most.", "There are, no surprise, two well-defined main modules or communities, which correspond to the two poles of the political debate, the Democrats (represented in blue) and the Republicans (in red).", "The Democratic community showcases some ten important figures in the conversation. They range from politicians to writers to news anchors (Pelosi is, of course, also there). ABC can be seen on the right of the community. The Democratic community represents over 50% of the nodes in the graph.", "The bridge between the two clear political poles in the conversation showcases an interesting pivotal node: C-SPAN.", "American rapper YG has his own insular alternative community, the only one representative enough to be mentioned beside the two main ones, with over 6% of the nodes in the graph. This, caused mainly by a clear statement on his part:", "A mention of honor goes to @evadutizena who, by means of a meme, got to conform a community of almost 2.5 percent of the nodes in the network. Kudos to you, Deloris!", "And finally, the Republican community in the social network graph, with over 30% of the nodes.", "Here, only about eight accounts seem to catch the eye at first. Unlike in the Democratic community, the GOP itself has some clear activity and influence, along with other politicians, show hosts, comedians and writers, as well as the president\u2019s son himself. Speaking of which, can you find Trump?", "Now it\u2019s time to see the portrait of the digital conversation as a whole, an accurate representation of American politics today and the building block of what 2020 will bring upon the US political landscape. Enjoy!", "I feel that this graph tells a series of stories, all equally relevant, particularly at the break of 2020 and the presidential election:", "Don\u2019t forget to leave a comment and happy new year, everyone!", "Your home for data science.
