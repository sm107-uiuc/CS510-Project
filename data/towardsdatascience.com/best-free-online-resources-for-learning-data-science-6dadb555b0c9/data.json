In the real world, however, a lot of the work is to figure out how to turn raw data into tabular one via feature engineering.", "During the process of preparing for interviews I found many good free resources online, most of them offer entry-level courses as well as advanced materials that can be highly useful for further learning to people who are already in the field. In this blog post I will share with you the best learning resources I found, so without further ado \u2014 let\u2019s start.", "1. Google\u2019s Machine Learning Crash Course \u2014 this course thoroughly and effectively brings anyone \u2014 whether it\u2019s a junior DS or a complete newbie \u2014 into the world of machine and deep learning while covering important concepts such as gradient descent and loss functions and presenting main algorithms from linear regression to neural networks. The course material consists of readings, exercises, and notebooks with real code implemented with Tensorflow and running on google Colab which means no installation is required for you to be able to run it.", "Besides the crash course there is a huge amount of materials in this site regarding data science and AI, divided as follows:", "- Courses \u2014 here you\u2019ll find deeper-dives into specific topics such as clustering, recommendation systems and more.", "- Practica \u2014 examples of \u201chow Google uses machine learning in its products\u201d.", "- Guides \u2014 step by step instructed solutions to common ML problems.", "- Glossary \u2014 my favorite resource here, I think every data scientist should have this on her desktop.", "2. IBM\u2019s Machine Learning with Python", "This course starts with introducing the differences between the two main types of learning algorithms \u2014 supervised and unsupervised and then gives a good review of all essential algorithms in Machine learning including a (fascinating to my opinion) chapter on recommendation systems. Each chapter ends with a code the learner can run on her browser, plus \u2014 once you complete all the requirements you will receive a badge that can be later shared on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.", "Here too there are many other courses on many topics relevant to data scientists but also on others that aren\u2019t directly linked to the field but are interesting nonetheless such as Blockchain, Reactive Architecture, Bitcoin and more.", "3. AWS\u2019s the Elements of Data Science", "last year Amazon opened to the public courses that have run in the company for their developers and the result is a huge corpus of knowledge on various topics from ML fundamentals through introductions to their services (for example Neptune, ElastiCache) to specific applications using AWS tools (for example \u2014 Computer Vision with GluonCV, Visualizations with QuickSight).", "When I prepared for DS interviews I found their Elements of Data Science course highly useful for two main reasons, first \u2014 it covers the practical stages of a standard ML pipeline from data preparation to model training and assessment which was helpful, second \u2014 each topic has been presented and explained with actual code examples which gave a great glimpse to the practical aspect of the field and also revealed great functionalities of Pandas and Scikit Learn I wasn\u2019t acquainted with (did you know there are built-in datasets in the SKlearn package you can load and use for your personal practica? I do thanks to this course). Here, too, you\u2019ll get a certification when completing all the requirements.", "I must admit that I never finished this course, but I loved the parts I did plus it\u2019s very popular, so I felt obligated to include it in this list. Here you\u2019ll find long recorded lectures (~1.5 hours each) accompanied by code samples. They have different courses too and cover more advanced topics in comparison to the other courses in this list, including Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I will say that on the first time I wanted to start this course I got discouraged by the technical requirements mentioned in the first part of it but then I learned that all notebooks can be run on Google Colab which means no installation required and a free GPU.", "Kaggle is well known as the best place to get practical experience in data science thanks to its huge amount of organized datasets and many competitions, but there is another great part to it and that\u2019s their \u2018Learn\u2019 section. What you\u2019ll find here isn\u2019t exactly courses but, as termed by Kaggle themselves, Micro courses with many interactive exercises meant to teach and advance required skills from Python for DS through specific libraries all the way to deep learning, SQL and advanced Machine Learning. This is probably the best way to expand your knowledge with minimal commitment and time.", "Your home for data science.
