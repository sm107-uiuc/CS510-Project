The question is as follows:", "Question: You have a stick of arbitrary length. You break the stick uniformly at random along it\u2019s length at two places, leaving you with three distinct pieces. What is the probability that you can form a triangle with the resulting three pieces?", "We will first solve this problem analytically, and then simulate the problem computationally to verify our findings.", "Solution: Note that our stick is of arbitrary length. To bound the problem mathematically, let\u2019s choose a length that is easy for us to manage. Let us say the stick has \u201cunit length 1\u201d.", "Now we break the stick uniformly at random along it\u2019s length at two places, leaving us with three pieces. Note that because we have defined the total length as \u201cunit length 1\u201d, only two variables a and b are required to fully specify the lengths of the resulting three pieces. The first piece is of length a, second piece of length b, and third piece of length 1-a-b:", "Note that each piece can range in length from 0 to 1, with the condition that the three pieces sum to 1. Let us graphically map the total probability space as a function of a and b:", "Now the question begs, do our three pieces form a triangle? Let us recall the geometric conditions required of all triangles: each side of a triangle is strictly less than the sum of the other two sides. Therefore we can specify three distinct boundary conditions required to form a triangle from the three pieces:", "Let us overlay the three boundary conditions above on our probability space to determine the values for a and b for which we can form a triangle:", "We can see from the figure above that the boundary conditions specify 1/4 of the total probability space. Therefore, we can conclude there is a 1/4 probability that the three broken pieces will form a triangle.", "Let us now simulate this problem computationally in python to confirm our analytical solution:", "As shown above, over 10,000 simulations the results converge to probability 1/4 (i.e. 25%) that the three broken pieces can form a triangle.", "I hope the above is insightful. As I\u2019ve mentioned in some of my previous pieces, it\u2019s my opinion not enough folks take the time to go through these types of exercises. For me, this type of theory-based insight leaves me more comfortable using methods in practice. A personal goal of mine is to encourage others in the field to take a similar approach.
