Python presents a wide array of choices for the completion of each task. It is highly accessible and one of the best ways to get started with programming because it is fairly simple to use as well as quite easy to learn. It also has a great community with constant updates and upgrades. At the writing of this article, the most recent version of python is 3.8.", "This article assumes the viewers have slight or modest programming knowledge as well as understand a bit of python. If you have no prior programming knowledge then don\u2019t worry. Python is extremely easy to get started with and there are tons of free videos available on YouTube as well as lots of interesting tutorials on the web. Feel free to let me know if you guys want me to make a python basics tutorial from scratch. With just a basic understanding of python, we can continue to understand more about this amazing language along with all the extensions and libraries beneficial for machine learning.", "Note: This will be part-2 of my \u201cAll About Machine Learning\u201d course. However, each subsequent parts will be standalone parts. You can read the series in any order as per your convenience. I will try to cover the basics and most of the machine learning algorithms in the upcoming articles. To view other parts of the series you can click here. Check out the previous article from the below link if you haven\u2019t already.", "You can download python from the link below.", "Today, we will be looking into all the essential basic concepts of python required for machine learning. We will understand the various data structures of python and then proceed to dig deeper into the basics of all the libraries which are required for machine learning. We will cover all these concepts with some simple code snippets to gain a better grasping of these libraries and features. So, without further ado, let us get our hands dirty with some coding!", "Data Structures are a collection of data elements that are structured in some way. There are many built-in data structures in python. Let us explore each of these individually.", "A list is a mutable ordered sequence of elements. Mutable means that the list can be modified or changed. Lists are enclosed within Square Brackets \u2018[ ]\u2019. The important functions which we use for the list in python for machine learning are \u2014 \u2018append\u2019 which is used to add elements to the list, the \u2018len\u2019 function to find the length of the lists, and the \u2018sort\u2019 function to arrange the elements in the list in ascending order. These 3 are usually the most common functions which will be used for lists. List slicing is another concept that is very useful to understand. The list elements can be addressed by their index numbers. The 0th index consists of the first element, the 1st index consists of the second element, and so on.", "The other important concept concerning lists is the list comprehension. This is used to simplify code by providing a concise way to create the lists. An example of creating the squares up to 10 can be done as follows:", "You can also create a list within a list called nested lists. These are usually helpful for matrix operations in machine learning.", "A dictionary is an unordered collection of items. Unlike lists and other data structures like tuples or sets, the dictionary data structure has a pair of elements referred to as key and value. The dict() function can be used to assign a dictionary to a variable. An alternative approach is to use the curly braces \u2018{}\u2019 to assign a variable as a dictionary. After defining a dictionary, we have mainly three functions \u2014 The items function to view both the keys and the values of the dictionary, the keys function to access the keys of the dictionary and the values function to access all the values of the respective keys. The dictionary function can be even used to build data frames for the pandas library. It is one of the more important data structures alongside lists. The below example shows how to declare a dictionary and access all the variables in the dictionary.", "The tuple data structure is similar to the list data structure where you can define a tuple with a fixed number of elements. The only difference is that tuples are immutable. This prevents any modification of the elements within a tuple as more elements can\u2019t be appended or removed from the specific tuple that is created. The tuples can be created either by specifying the tuple function or by using the normal brackets \u2018()\u2019. The procedure of accessing an element in a tuple can be done by accessing its specific index position similar to a list. It is also possible to create a nested tuple i.e. a tuple of elements within a tuple. The main advantage of the tuple data structure is that it can be suited to define (X, Y) points on a graph such that those points remain consistent throughout the program and cannot be altered. Let us look at an example of nested tuples, with the main tuple containing two more tuples in the form of ((x1, y1)) and (x2, y2). Let us look at how exactly we can access the y1 element of the tuple as shown from the below code block.", "The output for the above code block would be 2 which is y1 and the element we want to access.", "A set is a collection of unordered elements. These elements are not indexed as well. Sets can be defined by using the set function or by using the curly braces \u2018{}\u2019 with only one element. The set data structures are mutable as elements can be added or removed but the sets only contain one of each element. Duplicates of elements cannot be repeated in a set and a set is always in sorted order. The sorting is done from the smallest to biggest meaning i.e. in ascending order. Sets can be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference, etc. Below is a code block showing the simple working of a set.", "The other data structures are strings and frozen sets. Most viewers would have learned about strings while learning the basics of python. I will cover strings briefly but I have personally not used frozen sets a lot in my machine learning projects as I do not find it that useful. If you are interested in knowing more about these then please feel free to learn about them as well.", "Strings can be defined in single quotes \u2018 \u2019 or double quotes \u201c \u201d. Strings are an immutable sequence of characters. Computers do not deal with characters. Instead, they deal with numbers, especially in binary. Even though you may see characters on your screen, internally it is stored and manipulated as a combination of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s. This conversion of character to a number is called encoding, and the reverse process is decoding. American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and Unicode are some of the popular encoding used. In Python, the string is a sequence of Unicode characters. The usual formatting technique that is used by strings for the encoding is the UTF-8 standard which is represented with bytes.", "The Pandas module is an open-source library in python to create data frames which is extremely useful for organizing the data. Pandas is used extensively in the field of data science, machine learning, and deep learning for the structured arrangement of the data. The data frame created in pandas is a 2-dimensional representation of the data. After importing the pandas library as pd you can visualize the tabular data of your liking. An example of this is as shown below:", "Overall, the pandas module is a fantastic library for systematic viewing of the data and it also allows a wide variety of operations that can be performed.", "The Matplotlib module is one of the best tools for the visualization of the data frames or any other form of data. Matplotlib is used to visualize the data for exploratory data analysis in data science. It is extremely useful to understand the kind of data we are dealing with and to determine what is the next action that must be performed. The library offers an extensive variety of visualization functions such as scatter plot, bar plot, histograms, pie chart, and many other similar functions. Import matplotlib.pyplot module as plt for performing visualization tasks using matplotlib. An example of these can be seen below \u2014", "The scatter plots and bar graph plotted using matplotlib is shown in the figures. An advantage of the module is that it is very simple to use and efficient at providing visualizations. It can also be combined with the seaborn library for a more visual and aesthetic appeal.", "The NumPy library stands for Numerical Python. The numpy library is one of the best options for performing computations on matrix operations. It supports multi-dimensional arrays. An extensive amount of mathematical and logical operations can be performed on arrays. By converting lists into numpy arrays, we can perform computations like addition, subtraction, dot product, among many others. The use cases of numpy are applicable in both computer vision and natural language processing projects. In computer vision, you can use numpy arrays for visualizing the RGB or grayscale images in a numpy array and converting them accordingly. In natural language processing projects, you usually prefer to convert the text data into the form of vectors and numbers for optimized computation. Import numpy as np and you can convert the text data into categorical data as shown below:", "The scikit-learn module is one of the best tools for machine learning and predictive data analysis. It offers a wide range of pre-built algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM\u2019s), classification algorithms like K-means clustering, and a ton more operations. This is the best way for beginners to get started with machine learning algorithms because of the simple and efficient tools that this module grants access to. It is open-source and commercially usable while granting accessibility to almost anyone. It is reusable and supported by libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. import the sklearn module to run scikit-learn code. Below is a code example for splitting the dataset we have into a form of train and test or validation data. This is useful for training and evaluation of the models.", "The NLTK library stands for the natural language toolkit platform which is one of the best libraries for machine learning of natural language processing data. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. The NLTK library is very well suited for linguistic-based tasks. It offers a wide range of options for tasks such as classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. It allows the user to chunk the data into entities that can be grouped together to produce a more organized meaning. The library can be imported as nltk and below is an example code for the tokenization of a sentence.", "Note: This is just a brief introduction to all the libraries. If you haven\u2019t completely understood all of them that is totally fine. We will be looking at each of these in much more detail in the upcoming parts of the series with actual examples and how exactly they are used in machine learning algorithms and problems.", "We were able to achieve a brief understanding of the various data structures and what exactly are the tasks they perform along with an intuitive understanding of the various libraries available in python that provide flexibility for machine learning. With this basic knowledge of python and its respective library modules for machine learning, we are ready to dive deeper into exploring the various territories and algorithms of machine learning. We will be focusing on the exploratory data analysis and the math behind machine learning in the upcoming articles. Once that is done we will look at each algorithm individually with a complete break down of them and their particular use cases.", "For some of the code, screenshots, and images used in this article are referred to from some of my previous articles. Feel free to check the references below.", "Check out all the articles related to this series from the following link:", "Thank you all for sticking on till the end and wish you all a wonderful day!", "Your home for data science.
