Croston published \u201cForecasting and Stock Control for Intermittent Demands,\u201d an article introducing a new technique to forecast products with intermittent demand. His idea could be summarized in three simple steps: - Evaluate the average demand level when there is a demand occurrence.- Evaluate the average time between two demand occurrences.- Forecast the demand as the demand level (when there is an occurrence) multiplied by the probability of having an occurrence.", "Let\u2019s do this step-by-step with an example:", "The Croston model answers the question How much demand will we have on average per period?", "Now that we understand the basic idea of the Croston model, we need to answer two questions:", "Croston used a technique close to the one used by Holt & Winters to answer these questions. For the different exponential smoothing models, we will be looking at both the previous estimation of each variable (i.e., level & periodicity) and its most recent observation.", "Let\u2019s note our level estimate a (like for the exponential models) and note the actual demand observations d. We will update our level estimate a only when we have an actual observation, so that", "As in the different exponential smoothing models, we use a learning parameter alpha (0 < alpha < 1) to allocate more or less importance to the most recent observations or the historical ones.", "Let\u2019s note the estimation of the time between two demand occurrences p (for periodicity), and the time elapsed since the previous demand occurrence q. We will only update p when we have a demand occurrence", "Note that we again use alpha as the learning parameter. This is the same parameter we used to estimate the demand level.", "The forecast is straightforward: it is the demand level (a) divided by the periodicity (p).", "We can then summarize the whole model.", "As you can see, when there is no demand observation, none of the parameters are updated. This will be one of the limitations of this model.", "Croston vs. Simple Exponential SmoothingThe most significant addition of the Croston method compared to the simple exponential smoothing is its ability to estimate the time between two demand occurrences. Let\u2019s see in the figure below if this helps us to forecast intermittent products.", "Unfortunately, MAE is around the same value for both models (with a slight advantage in favor of the simple smoothing method): 139% for Croston and 130% for Simple Smoothing.", "LimitationsAs you can see in the graph above, when there is no demand occurrence, the Croston forecast does not change. This is weird for two reasons.", "This is counter-intuitive. Imagine we are in period 51: you just sold 8 units, so you update your forecast to 3 pieces/period. From period 52 to 58, you won\u2019t sell a single piece, but you will not update your forecast once. Actually, you will have to wait for the 2-piece sale in period 59 to wake up and decrease your forecast to 2 pieces. This does not make any sense. Why couldn\u2019t we update our forecast during the periods without sales to reflect the idea that we expect our demand to be lower?", "In 2011, in their paper \u201cIntermittent demand: Linking forecasting to inventory obsolescence,\u201d Ruud Teunter, Aris Syntetos, and Zied Babai proposed an improvement to the Croston model. Their idea was to allow the model to update (decrease) its periodicity estimate even if there is no demand observation. That\u2019s perfect as this limitation was the main one we had with the vanilla Croston model.", "Level \u2014 The TSB model (for Teunter, Syntetos & Babai) does not change how the level is estimated compared to the regular Croston model.Periodicity \u2014 The periodicity p will now be expressed as the probability of having a demand occurrence. Actually, p will now denote a frequency (i.e., a probability) ranging from 0 (demand never occurs) to 1 (demand occurs at every period). We will update this periodicity at every period \u2014 \u2014 even if there is no demand occurrence. The periodicity will- decrease if there is no demand occurrence (as you expect a reduction in the probability for a demand to occur). This decrease will be exponential (like for all the exponential smoothing models);- increase if there is a demand occurrence.", "Remember that in the vanilla Croston model, p was the expected number of periods between two demand occurrences.", "Summary We now obtain this set of equations for the TSB model.", "Pay attention:- the forecast f is defined as the periodicity p multiplied by the level a (and not divided by it, as in the original model);- the forecast for t+1 is defined based on the level and periodicity estimates of t+1 (and not t).", "Let\u2019s compare our new TSB model against the original Croston model and a simple smoothing. As you can see in the two graphs below, TSB and the simple model are very similar. Actually, the difference lies in the fact that the TSB model keeps track of both the demand level and the demand probability. In contrast, the simple smoothing model only keeps track of the level (which includes the idea of the likelihood for a demand to occur).", "We now obtain a mean absolute error of 134% thanks to TSB. The simple smoothing model seems to be still slightly better than the two others for this product. Of course, this is just an example, and Croston/TSB might work better on other products.", "You can find below an implementation in python of both Croston & TSB models.", "Nicolas Vandeput is a supply chain data scientist specialized in demand forecasting and inventory optimization.
