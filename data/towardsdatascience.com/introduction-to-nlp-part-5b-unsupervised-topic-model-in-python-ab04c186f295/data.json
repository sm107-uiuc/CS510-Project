Simple approach) briefly explains part-of-speech (POS) tagging and lemmatisation.", "When doing a topic model, you may sometimes want to try using only one or several types of POS. For instance, if we think nouns are enough to identify topics, then we could adjust the script as below when creating documents:", "Now the documents are preprocessed, let\u2019s create a Gensim Dictionary object.

When building a model, we need to define the number of topics to the num_topics parameter. In this small example, we know there are two topics from reading the four short documents. However, often you wouldn\u2019t know the number of topics and the suitable number of topics will be up to your judgement. We will also ask the model to pass through the corpus 20 times when training with passes argument.", "The most important words are \u2018play\u2019, \u2018game\u2019 and \u2018board\u2019 (each with the same weight of 0.186) in topic 1 while the most important word in topic 2 is \u2018mango\u2019 (with a weight of 0.231).

However, I think it would be good to set aside a handful of unseen test documents to sense check the model later.

We will manually test a range of different topic numbers and assess them based on their coherence score. If you have an intuitive guess on the rough range of topics, one way to narrow down the options is to run manual grid search. However, take output of grid search as a guide only and check if the topics make sense.", "The higher the c_v coherence score, the better.

Let\u2019s check for cases where top two topics have the same probability.", "It\u2019s hard to say these documents have dominant topic since the probabilities of all three topics are equal. It seems reasonable why the model have given equal probability since these documents are quite short. Luckily, we only have five cases.

In this particular example, you will notice that topics 2 & 3 are swapped in pyLDAvis. There\u2019s an open issue regarding this confusing behaviour. In this post, we will use the topic numbers from Gensim.", "With the topic exploration so far, we could name the topics as follows:", "It\u2019s hard to assess how well the model is doing from just looking at the head of the data.
