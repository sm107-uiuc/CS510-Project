Some go further and let you implement and compare multiple algorithms in no time.", "The ease of use comes with some disadvantages. We may overlook key concepts or ideas behind these algorithms which are essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of them.", "In this post, I will mention about 7 key points on 7 machine learning algorithms. I want to point out that it will not be a whole explanation of the algorithms so it is better if you have a basic understanding of them.", "SVM creates a decision boundary that makes the distinction between two or more classes.", "A soft margin SVM tries to solve an optimization problem with the following goals:", "There is obviously a trade-off between these two goals. Decision boundary might have to be very close to one particular class to correctly label all data points. However, in this case, the accuracy on new observations might be lower because decision boundary is too sensitive to noise and to small changes in the independent variables.", "On the other hand, a decision boundary might be placed as far as possible to each class with the expense of some misclassified exceptions. This trade-off is controlled by the c parameter.", "C parameter adds a penalty for each misclassified data point. If c is small, the penalty for misclassified points is low so a decision boundary with a large margin is chosen at the expense of a greater number of misclassification.", "If c is large, SVM tries to minimize the number of misclassified examples due to high penalty which results in a decision boundary with a smaller margin. The penalty is not same for all misclassified examples. It is directly proportional to the distance to the decision boundary.", "When choosing a feature to split, the decision tree algorithm tries to achieve", "Entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness. The more randomness a variable has, the higher the entropy is. The variables with uniform distribution have the highest entropy. For example, rolling a fair dice has 6 possible outcomes with equal probabilities so it has a uniform distribution and high entropy.", "Splits that result in more pure nodes are chosen. All these indicate \u201cinformation gain\u201d which is basically the difference between entropy before and after the split.", "Random forest is an ensemble of many decision trees. The success of a random forest highly depends on using uncorrelated decision trees. If we use the same or very similar trees, the overall result will not be much different than the result of a single decision tree. Random forests achieve to have uncorrelated decision trees by bootstrapping and feature randomness.", "Bootstrapping is randomly selecting samples from training data with replacement. They are called bootstrap samples.", "Feature randomness is achieved by selecting features randomly for each decision tree in a random forest. The number of features used for each tree in a random forest can be controlled with the max_features parameter.", "GBDT is an ensemble of decision trees combined with boosting method which means the decision trees are connected sequentially.", "Learning rate and n_estimators are two critical hyperparameters for gradient boosting decision trees.", "The learning rate simply means how fast the model learns. The advantage of a slower learning rate is that the model becomes more robust and generalized. However, learning slowly comes at a cost. It takes more time to train the model which brings us to the other significant hyperparameter.", "The n_estimator parameter is the number of trees used in the model. If the learning rate is low, we need more trees to train the model. However, we need to be very careful at selecting the number of trees. It creates a high risk of overfitting to use too many trees.", "Point: What is the advantage of being naive?", "Naive Bayes is a supervised machine learning algorithm for classification so the task is to find the class of an observation given the values of features. Naive Bayes classifier calculates the probability of a class given a set of feature values (i.e. p(yi | x1, x2 , \u2026 , xn)).", "Naive Bayes assumes that features are independent of each other and there is no correlation between features. However, this is not the case in real life. This naive assumption of features being uncorrelated is the reason why this algorithm is called \u201cnaive\u201d.", "The assumption that all features are independent makes it very fast compared to complicated algorithms. In some cases, speed is preferred over higher accuracy.", "It works well with high-dimensional data such as text classification, email spam detection.", "Point: When to use and not to use", "K-nearest neighbors (kNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression tasks. The main principle of kNN is that the value of a data point is determined by the data points around it.", "The kNN algorithm becomes very slow as the number of data points increases because the model needs to store all data points in order to calculate the distance between them. This very reason also makes the algorithm not memory efficient.", "Another disadvantage is that kNN is sensitive to outliers because an outlier has an effect on the nearest point (even if it is too far).", "Point: When to use and not to use", "K-means clustering aims to partition data into k clusters in a way that data points in the same cluster are similar and data points in the different clusters are farther apart.", "K-means algorithm is not able to guess how many clusters exist in the data. The number of clusters must be pre-determined which might be a challenging task.", "The algorithm slows down as the number of samples increases because, at each step, it accesses all data points and calculates distances.", "K-means can only draw linear boundaries. If there is a non-linear structure separating groups in the data, k-means will not be a good choice.", "We have covered some key concepts about each algorithm. The given points and notes are definitely not the whole explanation of the algorithms. However, they are certainly important to know to make a difference when implementing these algorithms.", "Thank you for reading.
