More than electricity.\u201d \u2014 AI oracle and venture capitalist Dr. Kai-Fu Lee, 2018", "With the rapid improvements being made in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and the voluntary AI daily digest shared by my fianc\u00e9, I thought it was about time to take a deep dive in and see for myself what it was all about. In particular, I was interested in how I could cleverly integrate AI into product development conversations and how it could be applied to build products that people love. After all, if you don\u2019t know what something is capable of, how can one really innovate with it?", "Although I\u2019ve got a Bachelor\u2019s in Computer Science, I\u2019m no expert in AI, ML or deep learning. You don\u2019t need to be an expert either to get started. In this article, I\u2019ll share how to do image classification using neural networks the \u201ceasy way\u201d. Note that image classification is different to image detection and image recognition [1]. I\u2019ll start with how to create a data set then this will be used as input to building a machine learning model. Keep in mind that this isn\u2019t the only way, rather it\u2019s a starting point to learn how to do image classification with neural networks, especially if you\u2019re new to the AI space.", "Did you know? Deep neural networks are best for conducting image classification.", "Before we get into it, here\u2019s a some context to the example that we\u2019ll use. The x-ray images used below are of children. The objective of this image classification project is to help medical professionals to quickly identify children with pneumonia.", "A data set is a collection of data. This is a crucial part to get right since it serves as the foundation which your model will be built upon. If it\u2019s not in the data, a model will not learn what it doesn\u2019t know. To train a machine learning model, a high-quality data set is essential because data defines a model\u2019s behaviour and performance.", "Having a large quantity of data alone does not equate to having a high-quality data set. It comes down to having \u201cthe right data\u201d. This means the data must:", "We also need to ensure the data set covers all the necessary use cases. A lack of sufficient use cases will likely result in a poorly trained model. The questions one should ask themselves when creating a data set:", "Going back to our example data set of children x-ray images, it should contain the following:", "Besides having a diverse data set with a good variation of positive and negative examples, we also need to have labels associated with each of the examples. If the data set is not already labeled, it will need to get labeled before it can be used as input to building a model. You can either label the data set yourself or pay to get it done.", "\u201cIn modern artificial intelligence, data rules. A.I. software is only as smart as the data used to train it. If there are many more white men than black women in the system, it will be worse at identifying the black women.\u201d \u2014 New York Times", "Be sure to watch out for unbalanced data sets \u2014 they can introduce unwanted bias in your model. An unbalanced data set is one in which one or more labels has significantly more or less examples than the other labels. Once you have your data set labeled, check the number of examples associated with each of the labels to ensure each label has the same number of examples. If you see that a specific label has only a few examples, whilst the others have around a dozen, you are very likely to observe some bias when the model is used in real world. Once you\u2019re happy with the coverage of the data set, it\u2019s time to build the model.", "There are two ways in which a model can be built: (1) automated ML and (2) custom modelling. \u201cAutomated ML\u201d is a paid service which means it\u2019s easy to get started and cheap for quick development or prototyping of a model. However, it\u2019s difficult to extend and data that may be sensitive is accessible to the provider. On the other hand, \u201ccustom modelling\u201d is completely customisable for unlimited use cases and there is full control over the parameters for tuning the model. But the downside is that it\u2019s expensive to get started and requires machine learning expertise. Online automated ML services, such as Google Cloud and IBD Watson, enable anyone to quickly create models by simply providing a high-quality, labeled data set.", "Before we begin to build our model, it\u2019s important to define the business goal(s) and outcomes that we expect from this model. Also have a think about the performance level that you\u2019d like your model to have. As a starting benchmark, we can use human performance on that task. If the model can do it better than what humans can achieve, then I\u2019d say the model is in a decent state. Now, let\u2019s build a model.", "As mentioned earlier, the data defines a model\u2019s behaviour and performance, including its efficacy and accuracy. Thus, bad data will result in a bad model. For example, if you feed a model an image that was not represented within the training data, it will not be categorised correctly.", "For our X-Ray example we will use Google Cloud AutoML Vision to train a model. We will use an already prepared data set from Kaggle [2]. To get started, upload the labeled data set by clicking \u201cNew Dataset\u201d:", "Once the data has uploaded, your screen should look something like this:", "Next, we\u2019re going to train the model with this data set by going to the \u201cTrain\u201d tab and clicking \u201cTrain model\u201d.", "Note that this data set will automatically be divided up for training, testing and validating the model because the data used to train the model should never be used for testing or validating the model.", "Upon the completion of model training, we need to understand \u201chow good\u201d that model is. We\u2019ll take a deeper look into the ways we can analyse the model results, aka outputs.", "In order to understand quality of our model we need to to measure its performance. To do that the following metrics are often used:", "Going back to where we left off from training the model with AutoML Vision, go to the \u201cEvaluate\u201d tab of the data set to review the model\u2019s performance. It should look something like this:", "If you scroll down, you will see more metrics (eg. confusion matrix) and can see the performance measures per specific label as well.", "There\u2019s no such thing as training a model once and getting the \u201cperfect model\u201d. It is an iterative process. So in the case that you\u2019re not satisfied with the results, you have two options: 1) improve the data and 2) implement a custom model. I\u2019d strongly suggest that you first look at improving the data and once you cannot achieve any better results, only then consider implementing your own model. At this point, you would have a better understanding of why your model is not meeting expectations. Although having said that, chances are that the model provided by AutoML will get you to a decent point given a high-quality data set.", "Finally, let\u2019s see how the model performs with new images. Go to the \u201cPredict\u201d tab and upload an image that was not used in the training/testing data set.", "Once the prediction is made, your screen should look something like this:", "Congratulations, you\u2019ve just built your first model!", "You\u2019re now equipped to give image classification a try for yourself. There\u2019s no better learning than giving it a go yourself.", "Note that Google Cloud provides a free trial with $300 credit to get you started. Therefore, it won\u2019t cost you anything.", "Here\u2019s some resources to get you started:", "Feel free to share any thoughts you have in the comments below.", "Your home for data science.
