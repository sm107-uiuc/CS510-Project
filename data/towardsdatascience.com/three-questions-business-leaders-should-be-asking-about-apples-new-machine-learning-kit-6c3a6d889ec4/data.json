The company\u2019s announcement claimed Turi Create would allow users to \u201cfocus on tasks instead of algorithms.\u201d Let\u2019s face it: that\u2019s music to the ears of business leaders with limited time and resources!", "Now that the data scientists and software developers of the world have had some time to absorb the news and start working with Turi Create, let\u2019s break down how it could become a game-changer for your business \u2014 even if your business is still getting up to speed on the latest in AI.", "1. So what is Turi Create, anyway?", "Turi Create (TC) is a machine learning toolkit that lets you implement custom machine learning models for your app by inserting a few lines of code. Its strengths, and what distinguishes it from other kits, are its speed, efficiency, and unique features (like GPU acceleration) that either don\u2019t exist or are early stage in competing packages.", "The main uses of TC so far fall into the following categories:", "And that\u2019s just the start. Going forward, we can expect TC developers to explore Topic Modeling (summarizing and extracting themes and topics from documents) and Natural Language Processing (reading and understanding language), opening up a whole new realm of possibilities.", "2. OK, I get the basics. So what is Apple actually doing with TC?", "Apple\u2019s acquisition of Turi, followed just a year later by the release of Turi Create, shows the company is getting serious about building out its machine learning capabilities. It\u2019s not alone in this space, of course, as companies ranging from giants like Google to small start-ups are all competing in the \u201cbig data\u201d domain.", "Unlike some other tech firms, however, Apple prides itself on respecting customers\u2019 data privacy, so its focus remains on improving the general user experience. Here are some ways the Cupertino team is using TC right now in its products and services:", "As Apple continues to expand its used of TC, you\u2019ll want to stay informed about the latest applications so you can brainstorm how to develop analogous solutions for your own business challenges. One of the best ways to do that is to keep an eye on Apple\u2019s regularly-updated machine learning blog.", "3. Those are some pretty interesting applications, but how can I start thinking about using TC to benefit my business?", "Here\u2019s the good news: because Turi Create does much of the work for you, you don\u2019t need to develop advanced machine learning skills to take advantage of its cutting-edge techniques. In addition, because TC is open source, it\u2019s more than likely you\u2019ll be able to find existing models created by third party developers to help you with your business problems.", "Your task lies in creatively applying TC and its open source models to your unique data sets. For example, if your business sells a subscription service or licenses software, TC\u2019s extensive suite of classification models may determine which customers are more likely to turn over, or \u201cchurn\u201d. You can then incentivize those customers to renew, or determine if another product fits their needs.", "Another use case: if your firm provides a number of products or services \u2014 and you have data about your customer base \u2014 you can implement TC\u2019s recommender system to quantify customers\u2019 interest and prioritize which new items you market or offer. Right now, these models power Amazon and eBay\u2019s \u201crecommended for you\u201d listings, Spotify\u2019s music playlist curation, and GrubHub\u2019s vendor spotlights.", "Finally, if you run a medical business that collects heart, brain, or activity metrics using on-body sensors, you can use TC\u2019s activity classifier to ingest data from devices like gyroscopes, thermostats, and more. The model will then predict what kind of exercise, chronic condition, or medical emergency may be happening. In addition to the medical field, you can apply models to cybersecurity, engineering, and any field where patterns can be deduced from noisy data.", "Thinking about these examples, you may begin to understand how you can head down the path toward using your own data in similar ways. Now that you\u2019ve started asking about (1) the basics of Turi Create, (2) how Apple is using the platform, and (3) how you might creatively apply it to your work, you\u2019re three steps closer to figuring out how TC can open up a new world of possibilities for your business.", "About me: I\u2019m a senior data scientist at Metis, which provides full-time immersive bootcamps, part-time professional development courses, online learning, and corporate programs to accelerate the careers of data scientists.", "Your home for data science.
