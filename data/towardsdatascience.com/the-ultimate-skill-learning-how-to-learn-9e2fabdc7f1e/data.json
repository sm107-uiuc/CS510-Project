Apply your ability to learn.", "To improve my ability to learn, I went through the Learning How to Learn Course on Coursera. It\u2019s one of the most popular online courses of all time. And I can see why.", "It\u2019s taught in a simple and easy to understand manner. The concepts are applicable immediately. Even throughout the course, as you learn something in part 1, it resurfaces in part 2, 3 and 4, reinforcing the new information.", "If you\u2019ve seen the course before and are thinking about signing up, close this article and do it now, it\u2019s worth it.", "Otherwise, keep reading for a non-exhaustive list of some of my favourite takeaways.", "How do you answer such a question? What is learning?", "The course breaks it down with the combination of two kinds of thinking, focused and diffused.", "Focused thinking involves working on a singular task. For example, reading this post. You\u2019re devoting concentration to figuring out what the words on the screen mean.", "Diffused thinking happens when you\u2019re not focused on anything. You\u2019ve probably experienced this on a walk through nature or when you\u2019re laying in bed about to go to sleep. No thoughts but at the same time, all of the thoughts.", "Learning happens at the crossover of these two kinds of thinking.", "You focus on something intently for a period of time and then take a break and let your thoughts diffuse.", "How often have you been stuck on a problem and then thought of answer in the shower?", "This is an example of the two kinds of thinking at work. It doesn\u2019t always happen consciously either.", "Have you ever not known what step to take next on an assignment, left it overnight, come back and saw the solution immediately?", "If you want to learn something, it\u2019s important to take advantage of the two kinds of thinking. Combine intense periods of focus with intense periods of nothing.", "After studying, take a walk, have a nap or sit around and do nothing. And don\u2019t feel bad for it. You\u2019re giving yourself the best opportunity to let the diffused mind do its thing.", "You\u2019re working a problem. You reach a difficult point. It\u2019s uncomfortable to keep going so you start to feel unhappy. To fix this feeling, you seek something pleasurable. You open another tab, Facebook. You see the red notifications and click them. It feels good to have someone connecting with you. You see Sarah has invited you to her birthday. You look at the invites list, Gary is there. Gary is there. You\u2019re not the biggest fan of Gary. Back in middle school, he was a prick. \u2018Hey bro!\u2019 he\u2019d yell as he smacked you on the back. Hard. A bit more scrolling. Some advertisement for new shoes. The same ones you saw yesterday. They look real nice, black with orange. \u2018I\u2019m going to order them,\u2019 you think.", "You look down at your notes. You forget where you were up to.", "You were working on a problem. And you reached a difficult point. It was uncomfortable and you started to feel unhappy. You sought out something pleasurable. It worked. But only temporarily. Now you\u2019re back to where you were and you\u2019re even more upset at the fact you got distracted.", "So how do you fix it?", "The course suggests using the Pomodoro technique. I can vouch for this one.", "You set a timer and do nothing except what you wanted to work on for the duration. Even if it gets difficult, you keep working on it until the timer is done.", "A typical Pomodoro timer is 25-minutes with a 5-minute break afterwards. During the break, you can do whatever you want before starting another 25-minute session.", "But you can use any combination of working/break time.", "For example, to complete this course, I used 1-hour Pomodoro timers with a 15\u201330-minute break in between.", "If 25-minutes is too long, start with 10 and make your way up.", "Because you can\u2019t control whether or not you solve every problem which arises before the end of a days work.", "But you can control how much time and effort you put in.", "Can control: 4-hours of focused work in a day.", "Can\u2019t control: solving every assignment question in a day.", "We\u2019ve talked about focused and diffused thinking. Sleep is perhaps the best way to engage unconscious diffused thinking.", "Being in focused mode is to brain cells what lifting weights is to muscles. You\u2019re breaking them down.", "Sleep provides an opportunity for them to repaired and for new connections to be formed.", "There\u2019s a reason famous thinkers like Einstein and Salvatore Dali would sleep for 10-hours at a time and tap multiple naps a day.", "They knew it was vital for their brain to clear out toxins built up during the day which prevented engaging the focused mind.", "The next time you feel like pulling an all-nighter and studying, you\u2019d probably be better off getting a good night sleep and resuming the next day.", "Jerry Seinfeld writes jokes every day. He has a calendar on his wall and every day he writes jokes, he marks an X on it. Because he writes them every day if you looked the calendar you\u2019d see a chain of X\u2019s.", "Once the chain has started, all he has to do is keep it going.", "This technique is not only good for writing jokes. It can be used for learning too.", "In the Learning How to Learn course, they refer to a similar concept called spaced repetition.", "Spaced repetition involves practising something in small timeframes and as you get better at it, increasing the amount of time between each timeframe.", "For example, when starting to learn Chinese, you might practice a single word every day for a week until you\u2019re good at it. Then after the first week, you practice it twice a week. Then twice a month. Then once every two months. Eventually, it will be cemented in your mind.", "The best learning happens when you combine these two concepts. Don\u2019t break the chain by practising a little every day and incorporate spaced repetition by going over the difficult stuff more often.", "To begin with, you could set yourself a goal of one Pomodoro a day on a given topic. After a week, you would\u2019ve spent 3-hours on it. And after a year, you\u2019ll have amassed over 150-hours. Not bad for only 25-minutes per day.", "Part 2 of the course introduces chunking. Multiple neurons firing together are considered a chunk. And chunking is the process of calling upon these regions in a way which they work together.", "Because when multiple chunks of neurons fire together, the brain can work more efficiently.", "How do you form a chunk?", "A chunk is formed by first grasping an understanding of a major concept and then figuring out where to use it.", "If you were starting to learn programming, it would be unwise to try and learn an entire language off by heart. Instead, you might start with a single concept, let\u2019s say loops. You don\u2019t need to understand the language inside and out to know where to use loops. Instead, when you come across a problem which requires a loop, you can call upon the loops chunk in your brain and fill in the other pieces of the puzzle as you need.", "Forming a chunk is hard. First of all, what are the important concepts to learn? Second, where should you apply them?", "This is exactly why you should spend time and effort trying to create them. Instead of learning every intricate detail, seek out what the major concepts are. Figure out how to apply them by testing yourself. Work through example problems.", "The process of doing the hard thing is called deliberate practice. Spending more time on the things you find more difficult is how an average mind becomes a great mind.", "Dr Barbara Oakley introduces Einstellung as a German word for mindset.", "But the meaning is deeper than a single word translation.", "Every year you upgrade your smartphone\u2019s software. A whole set of new features arrive along with several performance improvements.", "When was the last time your way of thinking had a software upgrade?", "Einstellung\u2019s deeper meaning describes an older way of thinking holding back a newer, better way of thinking.", "The danger of becoming an expert in something is losing the ability to think like an amateur. You get so good at the way that\u2019s always worked, you become blind to the new.", "If you\u2019re learning something new, especially if it\u2019s the first time in a while, it\u2019s important to be mindful of Einstellung. Have an open mind and don\u2019t be afraid of asking the stupid questions. After all, the only stupid question is the one that doesn\u2019t get asked.", "Out of what you\u2019ve read so far, what has stood out the most?", "Don\u2019t scroll back up. Put the article down and think for a second.", "How would you describe it to someone else?", "It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, do it in your own words.", "Doing this is called recall. Bringing the information you\u2019ve just learned back to your mind without looking back at it.", "You can do it with any topic. Reading a book? When you\u2019re finished, put it down and describe your favourite parts in a few sentences.", "Finished an online course? Write an article about your favourite topics without going back through the course. Sound familiar?", "Practising recall is valuable because it avoids the illusion of competence. Rereading the same thing over and over again can give you an illusion of understanding it. But recalling it and reproducing the information in your own words is a way to figure out which parts you know and which parts you don\u2019t.", "How hard do you have to think about making coffee in the morning at your house?", "Not very much. So little, your half asleep zombie mode body can fumble around in the kitchen with boiling water and still manage to not get burned.", "Because you\u2019ve done it enough it\u2019s become a habit. It\u2019s the same with getting dressed or brushing your teeth. These things you can do on autopilot.", "Where do habits come into to learning?", "The thing about habits is that almost anything can be turned into a habit. Including procrastination.", "Above we talked about combating procrastination with a timer. But how do you approach from a habit standpoint?", "Part 3 of the Learning How to Learn course breaks habits into four parts.", "You only have to remove one of the four steps for the rest to crumble.", "Can you figure out what it is?", "What would happen if your phone was in another room? Or turned off?", "The cue would never happen, neither would the subsequent steps.", "The technique of removing the cue doesn\u2019t only work for procrastination. It can work for other habits too. It also works in reverse. If you want to create a good habit. Consider the four steps.", "To make a good habit, create a cue, make a routine around it, give yourself a reward if you follow through and you\u2019ll start forming a belief about you being the type of person who has the good habit.", "Thinking about the outcome of your learning is the quickest way to get discouraged about it.", "Because there is no end. Learning is a lifelong journey.", "No one in history has ever said, \u2018I\u2019ve learned enough.\u2019", "And if they have, they were lying.", "I\u2019ve been speaking English since I was young. Even after 25-years of speech, I still make mistakes, daily. But would getting upset at where my level of English is at be helpful? No.", "I could accept that knowing everything about speech and the English language is impossible. And instead, focus on the process of speaking.", "This principle can be related to anything you\u2019re trying to learn or create.", "If you want to get better at writing, the end product could be a bestselling book. But if I told you to go and write a bestselling book, what would you write?", "Worrying about what a bestselling book would have in it would consume you. It\u2019s far more useful to focus on the process, to write something every day.", "Dr Oakley says we\u2019ve got space for about four things in working memory. But if you\u2019re like me, it\u2019s probably closer to one.", "Some of the people I work with have three monitors with things happening on all of them, I\u2019m not sure how they do it. I stick to one and push it to two when a task requires it.", "If I had a third monitor it would be the A5 notepad I carry around everywhere. It\u2019s my personal assistant. Every morning, I write down a list of half a dozen or so things I want to get done during the day. Sometimes I write the same list on the whiteboard in my room to really clear out my brain.", "Even when I\u2019m in the middle of a focused session, 12 minutes into a Pomodoro, things still come out of nowhere. Rather than stop the Pomodoro, the thought gets trapped on the paper. Working memory free\u2019d up.", "The course recommends creating a list of things the night before but I\u2019m a fan of first thing in the morning as well. Putting things down means they\u2019re out of your head and you can devote all of your brainpower to focused thinking rather than worrying about what it was you had to do later.", "Don\u2019t forget to add a finishing time. The time of day you\u2019ll call it quits.", "Because having a cutoff time means you\u2019ve got a set timeframe to complete the tasks in. A set timeframe creates another reason to avoid procrastination.", "And having a cutoff time for focused work means you\u2019ll be giving your brain time to switch to diffused thinking. Who knows. That problem you couldn\u2019t solve at 4:37 may solve itself whilst you\u2019re in the shower at 8:13.", "You could study all weekend and go back to work on Monday and no one would know.", "You could work on a problem all week and by the end of the week feel like you\u2019re worse off than you started.", "Dr Sejnowski knows this. And emphasises learning doesn\u2019t happen linearly.", "Learning tough skills doesn\u2019t happen over the course of days or weeks or months. Years is the right timeframe for most things.", "I wanted to know how quickly how quickly I could learn all of the math concepts behind machine learning: calculus, linear algebra, probability. I found a question on Quora about it.", "A person who had been studying machine learning for 30-years replied with, \u2018Decades.\u2019 And then explained how he was still discovering new things.", "I was impatient. I was focusing on product rather than process.", "Learning looks more like a broken staircase than a straight line.", "How do you go from medical school dropout to discovering the theory of evolution?", "But what if you\u2019re not Charles Darwin?", "Not to worry, not everyone is Charles Darwin.", "There will never be another Charles Darwin. History repeats, but never perfectly. It\u2019s better to think of it as a rhyme. History rhymes with the future.", "Charles Darwin dropped out of medical school much to the disappointment of his family of physicians. He then travelled the world as a naturist.", "Years went on but one thing never changed, he kept looking at things in nature with a child-like mind.", "He\u2019d take walks multiple times per day in between periods of study. Focused mind and diffused mind.", "Take any introduction to biology course and you\u2019ll know what happened next.", "I\u2019ve condensed a story of decades into sentences but the point is everyone has to start somewhere.", "The first year you learn something new you suck. The second year you suck even more because you realise how much you don\u2019t know.", "There\u2019s no need to envy those who seem to know what they\u2019re doing. Every genius starts somewhere.", "The course credits Henry Ford as saying the above. But the internet is telling me it\u2019s from Confucius.", "It doesn\u2019t matter. Whoever said it was also right.", "If you believe you can\u2019t learn something, you\u2019re right.", "If you believe you can learn something, you\u2019re right.", "Dr Oakley was a linguist during her twenties. She didn\u2019t like math. So how did she become an engineering professor?", "By changing her belief in what she could learn.", "I used to tell myself, \u2018I\u2019ll never be the best engineer.\u2019", "I said it to someone at a meetup. They replied, \u2018not with that attitude.\u2019 A simple yet profound statement. All the best ones are.", "Whatever it is you decide to learn, it all starts with the story you tell yourself. Pretend you\u2019re the hero in the story of your own learning journey. Challenges will arise. It\u2019s inevitable. But how does the hero deal with them? You decide.", "Taking responsibility for your learning is one of the most important undertakings you can manage.", "Learning is the ultimate meta-skill as it can be applied to any other skill. So if you want to improve your ability to do anything, learning how to learn is something you should dedicate time to.", "The things I\u2019ve mentioned in this article are only scratching the surface of what\u2019s available in the Learning How to Learn course. I\u2019ve left out exercise, learning with others, studying in different locations. But you can imagine the benefits these have.", "If you want to dig deeper, I highly recommend checking out the full Learning How to Learn course. I paid for the certificate but it\u2019s not needed. You can access all the materials for free. However, I find I take things more seriously when I pay for them.
