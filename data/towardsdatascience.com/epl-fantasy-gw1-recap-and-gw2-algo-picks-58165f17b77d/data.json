Please, refer to the table below to see which players are more likely to get lots of extra points in the long run because of participating in more set-piece offensive plays.", "Predicted Starting Lineups: As we can already see, this season is starting with lots of surprises, so we found a few sites that take into consideration weekday games such as Cup and European matches, coach press-conferences and latest team news to try to predict the starting lineup each gameweek, including regular players that might be doubtful. This will hopefully save us from some of the bad choices we made for GW1, where we had THREE whole players not starting on one of our teams\u2026:(", "Most of the Top 100 players in the world from GW1 had Salah as triple captain and scored in the range of 125pts+. Let\u2019s look at the most selected players on their teams by position and the most preferred team formations.", "We used this data and the current player prices to create the team below which is a blend of the most selected players by Top100:", "Pretty good looking team, and lots of wiggle room to try some different picks on key positions, while still keeping a solid core of players.", "These stats make sense as most of the top players are trying to capitalize on offensive midfielders and strikers with 4\u20134\u20132 or 3\u20134\u20133 formations.", "We had a decent start as a few of our teams scored in the 70+ range. Every week, we will post a picture of our Top2 performing teams. It is interesting to note that our top-scoring team had 80pts, but didn\u2019t even have Salah as captain. Had we captained Salah, we would have had close to a 100pts! On top of that we had 3 non-playing players with 0 points, which is our only disappointment during the first game-week.", "We also participate in the FanTeam version of the FPL, where we also had two teams with a very strong start. Again, one of them with a bad captain choice.", "Since we added a lot of new stats to our Algorithm this year, this Blog will evolve to have more stats and graphs and less text over time. Let\u2019s start with the Fixture Difficulty Rating (FDR) for the next three game-weeks below:", "Looks like Arsenal, Crystal Palace, Leicester, West Ham and Villa have some tough games coming up, so our Algorithm might not be picking players from those teams. Everton, Man Utd, Man City, and Sheffield Utd seem to have more easy schedules over the next three weeks.", "We will try to stack up on players from teams that have a higher than 50 % chance of winning such as MUN, MCI, ARS, EVE, LEI and LEE. We should try not to have too many defensive players from CRY, WBA, WOL, WHA, or BUR.", "Teams with higher probability to draw, especially when the game is combined with high odds for Under 2.5, might be good for selecting defensive players because if the game ends 0:0, that will result in lots of bonus points. Combined with the Under/Over Graph below, we can identify the following games with higher probability of at least one clean sheet \u2014 NEW vs. BHA, AVL vs. SHU, and SOU vs. TOT. It was great to see that our predictions from last week all worked out perfectly as WOL, NEW, and CRY got clean sheets, even though none of the games ended in a draw!", "Inversely, we might want to have more attacking players from games with high odds for Over 2.5 such as CHE vs. LIV, ARS vs. WHU, MUN vs. CRY, WOL vs. MCI and EVE vs. WBA. Again, the odds from last week played out perfectly as all games predicted had over 2.5 goals!", "We actually also found a site to extract referee assignments from, so now you can see which games will have refs that are more likely to grand a penalty or give a lot of cards. We also have the home advantage stats, which could be a bit subjective, but since most refs seem to not be favoring the home team, the few that actually have positive scores for that stat, might be expected to favor the home team more compared to others. With that being said, it appears that Anthony Taylor has the highest penalty_ratio and home_advantage coeffs, so it is possible that we see a penalty for Leeds Utd, and possibly for Everton as well, looking at Mike Dean\u2019s stats. Looks, like the games CHE-LIV and AVL-SHU have refs that like to give a lot of cards, so expect to lose some points there from yellow cards, but hopefully no red\u2026", "It\u2019s time for the crown jewel of this year\u2019s improved Algorithm \u2014 the predicted player stats. There are three major metrics that we take into consideration when tuning our Team Optimizer for the next n-gameweeks \u2014 predicted total points, expected value (ROI), and bonus points per game. Below are the stats for each metric, also broken down by position.", "As you can see there is a large number of options we can choose from for each position, so we will be plugging a lot of the stats above into an Optimization Function in Python, which will output the team with the highest expected total points, given our budget constraints and other metrics that go into our decision making process. Some of the preliminary filters, applied before the Team Selector Code kicks in, include:", "Below are two examples of the text output of the model \u2014 one for a full team optimization and one for a single player transfer.", "As you can see below, the model first looks at parameters that tells it if it should optimize towards full squad of 15 players, or towards a specific formation with 11 key players and 4 cheap fillers. For the fillers, it first looks at preferred formation and uses that to decide how many fillers to get per position. The model then subtracts the total amount spent on the 4 fillers from our initial budget and spends the leftover budget on the key 11 players, given the optimization function and model constraints.", "As last year, not all of our decision making process can be fully automated, which is what makes this game so interesting and exciting. That being said, we often look at multiple outputs of the Optimizer Algorithm ran with a few different constraints and optimization functions and combine those with all the other useful stats described earlier in this article \u2014 Referee Stats, Bookie Odds, FDR scores, Penalty Stats, Bonus Point Stats etc. \u2014 to add a human element to our final team selection process. Here is an example of a well-balanced solid team below:", "As far as our own teams are concerned, we decided to not play our wild card and try to solve our goalkeeper problem with 2 free transfers next gameweek. So, our teams this week look pretty similar to last week except that we got rid of Antonio to get Wilson. We\u2019re also hoping to get KDB on one of our teams next week with the 2 free transfers we are saving.", "Seems like lots of players used their wild cards after GW1, which is understandable given, the blank week for MCI and MUN, and the many surprises in the starting lineups and recent player transfers news that have been popping up daily with the approach of the end of the transfer window. If you are one of those FPL users, I hope the stats shared above help you re-selected a more solid and balanced team full of players who are expected to be in the future starting lineups. Enjoy watching the games this weekend and good luck with selecting the right captain as we all got reminded just how important that is by the Egyptian King last weekend :)", "Your home for data science.
