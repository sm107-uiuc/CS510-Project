According to Statista, the revenue in the Indonesia e-commerce market is approximately US$ 26,922m in 2020 and is expected to have an annual growth rate (2020\u20132014) of 16.9%, resulting in a market volume of US$ 50,361m by 2024. The market\u2019s largest segment is Fashion (US$ 6,771m in 2020). A study conducted by Cuponation reported the top 5 e-commerce sites in Indonesia in 2019, namely Tokopedia, Shopee, Bukalapak, Lazada, and Blibli (Shopee and Lazada refer to Shopee Indonesia and Lazada Indonesia respectively).", "The data used are tweets that were collected from the 5 e-commerces\u2019 Twitter accounts starting from their first tweet until 30 April 2020 and the list of followings and followers as of 30 April 2020. A list of pre-processing techniques has been applied to the collected tweets. For the rest of this writing, the E-commerce name refers to its Twitter account.", "Disclaimer: Each e-commerce data were collected and treated equally with the same format of code from each e-commerce Twitter account. All numbers in this writing are based on the collected data. Differences with the actual number on Twitter was due to some restrictions in Twitter\u2019s policy during data acquisition.", "In terms of the number of tweets, Shopee leads with 266,233 tweets which are 9 times higher from Tokopedia\u2019s despite the fact that Shopee is the newest player in the country. All the top 5 e-commerce follow less than 10 accounts. Meanwhile, Blibli has the most followers. A more detailed analysis will be provided below.", "Every journey begins with a single step \u2014 Lao Tzu", "Let\u2019s go back to when they all started.", "This timeline is not only showing when they posted their first tweet but also their content. Tokopedia was announcing the investment from East Ventures, Bukalapak was promoting a product in their marketplace, and Shopee was sending introductory tweet informing their existence in the country.", "As shown in Table 1, all e-commerces only have a single-digit following. Some e-commerces follow their founder/co-founder/CEO, while some follow well-known public figures or groups, such as President of Republic Indonesia and Cristiano Ronaldo. Table 2 presents the details of the notable following accounts", "The collected tweets consist of general tweets, replies, mentions, and retweets. In order to simplify the analysis, I categorized them into 3 categories namely general tweets, mentions (replies + mentions), and retweets. A comprehensive explanation about their differences can be seen on the Twitter site.", "This sub-section will elaborate on the trend of general tweets, mentions, and retweets. Figure 2 shows that between 2010 and 2012, Bukalapak was the most active in Twitter in terms of general tweets. Since 2013, Blibli maintain its position until now as the most active one, even though all e-commerce (except Shopee) showed a downward trend since 2015. There is a high chance that at the end of 2020, Shopee will have the most number of general tweets.", "Figure 3 illustrates how active each account interacted with its followers. In 2015, Lazada was the most active in terms of mentioning other Twitter accounts / its followers. This includes answering its followers' questions or simple interactions with followers. However, this level of engagement plummeted in the following year. Meanwhile, since its coming to the country, Shopee showed an increasing interaction with its followers each year and peaked in 2019 with approximately 127k mentions.", "In terms of retweets, Bukalapak was very active in the early years but the number showed a downward trend since then. Tokopedia also led in the number once in 2015, however, the number also decreased significantly afterward. While others have become less active in retweets, contrasty Shopee\u2019s numbers of retweets showed an upward trend for the last three years.", "In order to simplify the analysis and ensure the relevancy of data, from this sub-section, I will only use the data between 2015 and 2020.", "The size of the circle represents the number of total tweets. Tokopedia and Blibli showed a similar trend as their total tweets are decreasing from year to year since 2015. Interestingly, Shopee and Lazada had the opposite trend where Shopee showed increasing tweets and Lazada is decreasing. Meanwhile, for Bukalapak, in general, the trend is decreasing, although, in 2019, they were more active compared to the previous years.", "The circle also indicates the proportions of tweets types from each account. Since 2016, more than 90% of Shopee tweets' content was on mentioning, and this proportion increased each year reaching 97.66% in 2019. Similar to this is Lazada who also spent around 80\u201387% of their tweets for mention. This finding indicates Shopee and Lazada allocate considerable time to engage with their followers. In contrast, approximately 75% of Tokopedia and Blibli\u2019s tweets were on general tweets. From 2015 to 2018, Bukalapak showed an increasing proportion of general tweets. However, since 2019, they shift towards a higher proportion of mention rather than general tweets.", "From this sub-section, I will only use the data of general tweets in order to simplify and ensure the relevancy of the analysis.", "Since there are many tweets with 0 likes and/or 0 replies and/or 0 retweets from their followers, I decided to exclude tweets with those criteria. Figure 6 shows the median of likes, replies, and retweets of the tweets from each E-Commerce between 2015 and 2020.", "It is clear that in the last 3 years, Shopee has been leading in all variables, followed by Tokopedia, whereas Blibli and Tokopedia have been the bottom two. The difference between the top 2 and the bottom 2 are significantly large.", "It is important to understand the content of the tweets. In terms of content, there are 3 different types of tweets which are tweet with text only, tweet with text and photo, and tweet with text and video.", "Figure 7 shows Tokopedia and Lazada have almost similar preferences. They preferred to post tweets with photos, except in 2020 Tokopedia has a bigger proportion on the tweet with text only. Meanwhile, Bukalapak has been focusing on the tweet with Photo in the last four years. On the other hand, Shopee is shifting from tweets with photo to text only since 2019. Since 2015, Blibli has preferred tweet with text only and continues to increase its proportion each year and reaching 86.10% in April 2020. It is also clear that all of them are trying to increase the proportion of tweets with video.", "The Relationship Between Content and Impression", "Does Content affect the tweet\u2019s impression?", "Based on the median of likes_count, tweets with photos gained more likes. However, this is not applied to Shopee which gained almost a similar impression for all different types of content.", "From Figure 9, based on the median of replies_count, Bukalapak, Lazada and Blibli gained more replies if the tweets contain video. On the other hand, Tokopedia and Shopee gained better engagement on tweets with text only.", "In terms of retweets, all e-commerces gained more retweets if the tweet contains video. Similar to replies_count, Bukalapak, Lazada, and Blibli gained the least retweets if the tweet only consists of text.", "An interesting finding from Figures 8, 9, and 10, Shopee tends to have better engagement on the tweet with text only. It is possible their tweets might contain interesting content that attracts their followers\u2019 attention. However, further analysis is needed to confirm this.", "An interesting finding, each E-commerce has its own favorite day. Meanwhile, Sunday is the day with the least number of tweets for all of them. This might because of the weekend.", "10 am (GMT +7) is the favorite time for Shopee and Lazada, whereas 7 pm (GMT +7) is Bukalapak\u2019s and Lazada\u2019s favorite time. However, Tokopedia and Bukalapak have a similar pattern of distribution, and Shopee and Lazada have a similar pattern of distribution.", "Some further analysis can be done on this for example, which day/time will gain more attention, but for now, I will limit it here", "In order to analyze the length of the tweet, I removed the stopwords. Figure 13 visualize that most of the tweets have a length between 12\u201314 words. However, Shopee and Bukalapak seem to have a bimodal distribution.", "Figure 14 shows that from 2015 to 2020, Shopee is consistent with their hashtag (#shopeeid). For Tokopedia itself, between 2018 and 2019, they did campaign on #mulaiajadulu, but for 2020 they have been promoting the #tokopediasaja. Bukalapak in the last 2 years has been focusing on their #bikinasik hashtag. Lazada in the last 5 years has been including #lazadaid in almost all their tweets. Lastly for Blibli, in 2020, they come with #karenakamuno1 which is related to their branding on customer satisfaction.", "Shopee tends to include emoticon/emojis in almost half of their tweets, whereas the others are still below 5%. An interesting future analysis is to see the relationship between the existence of emoji with the impression, but not in this writing \ud83d\ude00.", "In the Overview Section, I have mentioned the total followers of each E-commerce. Here, I combined all the followers and the total unique followers was 1,317,933. Then, I created a Venn diagram to see the intersection between each E-commerce followers as shown in Figure 16. All E-commerces shared 63,080 followers. Blibli has the most loyalist, whereas Bukalapak has the least loyalist from the quantity variable. Lazada and Blibli have 94,060 mutual followers, the largest compared to the other pairs. Another finding, there are 71,568 mutual followers of Tokopedia, Bukalapak, Lazada, and Blibli. It seems those followers are the early followers of E-Commerce and is probably the reason why they do not follow Shopee which is the newest E-Commerce player among them in Indonesia. More information can be seen in Figure 16", "There are a lot of deeper analyses can be done on the followers, for example, finding the distance between loyalist from one E-Commerce to the others by performing graph analysis, however, for this writing, I will limit it in here. Maybe in the future, I can dig deeper on this :)", "This writing has no intention to take sides, make any judgment, or give any guidance or recommendations. The purpose of this writing is solely to analyze and describe the Twitter account of the top 5 E-Commerce in Indonesia. I hope you enjoy and find this post useful! \ud83d\ude00 Feedback is welcome.
