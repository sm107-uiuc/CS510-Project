What is it this time? The test cases we wrote covered all the use cases we could imagine \u2014 and they all passed after we updated our services yesterday. If only we could go back and investigate all the recent changes to our code to see what went wrong! This is the type of problem Git exists to solve.", "In this article, I\u2019m going to show you how to use Git to track the history of files in your project so that you will be able to diagnose bugs whenever they appear in your project.", "GitHub is web application that allows users to host files kind of like DropBox or Google Drive \u2014 but it is designed to host Git Repositories. Git is a command-line tool used primarily by programmers to manage the versioning (history) of software projects. Each project lives inside a Git Repository that retains the history of all changes.", "Following the below link you can install Git by clicking on whichever operating system you are using at the top of the page. After you install Git, go to your command prompt if you are on Windows or your terminal if you are on MacOS or Linux. Type \u201cgit\u201d and hit enter. If you see any information about Git, you installed it correctly! If you get \u201ccommand not found\u201d \u2014 try uninstalling and reinstalling git, or reconfiguring your environment variables.", "The below link will take you to GitHub. From there you can set up an account using your email address.", "On any page on GitHub while you are logged in you will see a white plus sign next to your profile image in the toolbar on the top right. Clicking the plus sign will reveal a drop down menu where you should select: \u201cNew repository\u201d. From there, you should name the repository something like \u201cMaster_Git_And_GitHub_Basics_Article\u201d \u2014 taking into account they do not allow you to use spaces in the name. You don\u2019t need to add a description and you can leave the default \u201cPublic\u201d access enabled. For this lesson you should not check the \u201cInitialize with Readme file\u201d checkbox, and lastly you don\u2019t need to add a .gitignore file or a license \u2014 so you can click the bottom \u201cCreate repository\u201d button.", "The following page will have a lot of tiny intimidating text. The only information you will need to worry about on this page is the blue shaded box on the top that is labeled \u201cQuick setup\u201d. Inside the blue \u201cQuick setup\u201d box make sure \u201cHTTPS\u201d is selected and and not \u201cSSH\u201d. On the far left of the menu there is a clipboard icon button you can select to copy the URL address you need to clone your repository to your computer.", "In your terminal or git bash, go to the directory you would like to put your repository in using the \u201ccd directory_name\u201d command. Then run the following command (Replace my URL with the URL you copied from GitHub):", "Running that command should create an empty folder in the directory you ran the command from. You can think of cloning a repository like downloading it\u2014 but more. It also downloads the history of all the changes made to those files. Let\u2019s run the command \u201ccd Master_Git_And_GitHub_Basics_Article\u201d in our command prompt or terminal to go into our new repository we just cloned.

I have my Git Bash profile configured to give me those extra colors and messages.", "All this is telling us is that we don\u2019t have any history yet because we don\u2019t have any commits. You may wonder what \u201cOn branch main\u201d means \u2014 but we will address that in the next article. Now we\u2019ll add some history.", "In a Git Repository we record history in commits. As we have seen in our git status output, we currently have no commits. In order to create a commit we need to make some changes in our repository. Make a new file in either your file explorer or your finder window and drag it into your repository directory. My file will just be \u201cfile.txt\u201d with no content.

You\u2019ll notice that the file.txt file is listed in untracked files. Remember that Git wants to track all of the changes that happen in the repository \u2014 but we have to tell it which files to track. To make this apparent \u2014 let\u2019s add a second file called file2.txt so we can see what happens when we track one file but not the other. After adding a second file to the repository and verifying that it appears as untracked when you run \u201cgit status\u201d we\u2019ll learn our next Git command:", "We select files to be tracked using \u201cgit add <FILE_NAME>\u201d.

Now when we run git status we get the output:", "Notice that file.txt is listed under a new header: \u201dChanges to be committed\u201d and that file2.txt is still listed under \u201cUntracked\u201d. Keep in mind we have not tracked anything by adding the file \u2014 we have just selected the file to be tracked when we commit.

Future commits will not be \u201croot commits\u201d. Our commit has the message \u201cadded file.txt\u201d, and it only includes one file change where we created the \u201cfile.txt\u201d. Lastly, we\u2019ll learn one more command that will list all of the commits in our repository in descending order:", "Only one commit is listed since we only have one and it also tells us the author, the date, and the message for each commit.", "Once you have committed your changes \u2014 no one will be able to see them on your GitHub profile until you push your code with the command:", "Now your changes have been uploaded to your GitHub for everyone to see. Go check it out!", "Notice, file2.txt is not there since we did not select it to be committed. We can click \u201c1 commit\u201d on the far left of the toolbar in the middle of of the screen to see all of our commits kind of like how git log shows us.", "Now you know how to use the git commands: clone, status, add, commit, log, and push. You can now keep updating your repository with new changes. git add the files that you change to select them to be committed.
