To illustrate the ideas behind H3, I used the publicly available Python API. As most Python code libraries, this is made available under the package format, the lingua franca for Python code reuse. You install and manage these packages using a specialized tool. For the regular Python distribution, this tool is PIP and usually works very well, especially if you are not using a Windows machine.", "Having worked for the better part of the last twelve months with a high-end MacBook Pro, installing and managing PIP packages has been a breeze. This experience contrasts with what I had previously experienced with Windows. Then, the failure rate was high, especially with packages with C or C++ code that needs to compile during package installation. For these packages, there was almost always the right solution: Christoph Gohlke\u2019s web page. Here, you can find all sorts of prepackaged \u201cwheel\u201d files that do not require the use of a compiler during installation. Someone else has done that chore for you. You download the \u201cwheel\u201d file and use your faithful PIP to install it. The cherry on top is the choice of options you have, from Python version, processor type, and even compilation options. Such is the case of the ubiquitous NumPy package that is available in plain and MKL versions. I have never been able to install an MKL-enabled NumPy on my Mac, so here Windows users get better service. The problem is with these specialty packages like H3. Unless they become famous, odds are you will not find them on offer on Christoph\u2019s page. And if you don\u2019t see them there, odds are you will not find them anywhere.", "Such was my experience when, after publishing the H3 article, I decided to try it on my Jurassic Windows 10 box. I followed the instruction to install the H3 package using PIP, but the problems popped up immediately. In my particular case, it was the apparent absence of the CMake tool, that persisted even after installing it. I knew what I was in for, so I immediately dropped the ball. Working around these issues usually entails installing an obscure version of the Microsoft C++ compiler, making sure that it shows up in the PATH variable, and whatnot. I admire the people with the skills and patience to configure their Windows boxes to compile these packages cleanly. I don\u2019t belong to that group, unfortunately.", "While I was considering giving up on this, I remembered reading something about running Tensorflow on Windows. The blog post was from Scott Hanselman and was titled \u201cPlaying with Tensorflow on Windows.\u201d The text dates from 2016, a time when Tensorflow would not even compile on a Windows PC. How did the author manage to get around it? He used the WSL.", "WSL stands for \u201cWindows Subsystem for Linux,\u201d and it allows you to run a Linux box in your Windows box without a virtual machine\u00b9. When Scott wrote his famous blog post, this was still in a beta stage. Now the WSL is fully functional and already has tooling support. Before we go into all of these goodies, let me explain what I did to get the H3 code to run.", "First of all, you must enable WSL and then install a Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store. I chose Ubuntu 18, but you can pick whatever is available by the time you read this. Please understand that you will probably get a bare-bones version of the operating system, so you should be prepared to install a lot of ancillary tools, like PIP itself. Ubuntu 18 already has Python 3.6.7 installed, so it seemed to be the right choice.", "Getting the code down from GitHub was a breeze using the command line tools. Once that was done, I tried to create a virtual environment. Unfortunately, the VENV package was not available, so I had to install it. Ubuntu helped me by telling me what commands to issue, and I was back on my way. Apart from the unexpected absence of the \u201cwheel\u201d package, getting the virtual environment set up was too easy. After waiting for the old CPU to chew upon the installer list, I was ready to go. I launched the Jupyter Lab command and got a URL back as an answer. Copied the URL to the Windows browser and, lo-and-behold! There is a Jupyter notebook on my browser!", "WSL 1 shares the same infrastructure as Windows. It drives its magic by creating a Linux translation layer on top of Windows. Linux applications use the operating system\u2019s resources as if they were running on a real Linux machine, either real or virtual. The IP addresses are the same, and that is why you can start a web server on the WSL and consume it on Windows without any networking hacks.", "By now, I would be tempted to say that you are experiencing the best of both worlds. But there is a catch. Can you use your favorite IDE with WSL? I sought answers to this question and was pleasantly surprised.", "Visual Studio Code has recently released an add-on that allows you to edit, debug, and run Python code on a WSL box. The user interface still lives on Windows, but the Python code and interpreter live on WSL. The add-on is still in beta stage at the time of this writing but works as advertised.", "PyCharm also supports developing against the WSL, although only on the paid version.", "Unfortunately, there is no CUDA support, although there are plans for inclusion in a future version. That would be an excellent addition for deep learning projects.", "Is this the panacea for your Windows ailments? Although certainly not a full solution, Microsoft is moving in the right direction. Some areas of the WSL must be improved, such as remote access to the filesystem when the WSL is not running, and CUDA support for the deep learning crowd. Anyway, I would say that this opens a door for a better Data Science experience on a Windows box. And it should be worth your while.", "[1] Version 2 of the WSL will use a stripped-down, lightweight virtual machine.", "The description of how WSL works is my understanding of what I read about version 1. Please refer to more authoritative sources if you want more detailed insight into the workings of this beautiful piece of software.", "Your home for data science.
