Excerpted from its website, it is said to be \u201cperhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature\u201d [1]. In addition, Jason Brownlee who started the community of Machine Learning Mastery called it the \u201cHello World\u201d of machine learning [2].", "I would recommend this dataset to anyone who is a beginner in data science and is eager to build their first ML model. See below for some of nice characteristics of this dataset:", "As you can see, these characteristics can help minimize the time you need to spend in the data preparation process so you can focus on building the ML model. It is NOT that the preparation stage is not important. On the contrary, this process is so important that it can be too time-consuming for some beginners that they may overwhelm themselves before getting to the model development stage.", "As an example, the popular dataset House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques from Kaggle has about 80 features and more than 20% of them contain some level of missing data. In that case, you might need to spend some time understanding the attributes and imputing missing values.", "Now hopefully your confidence level (no stats pun intended) is relatively high. Here are some resources on data wrangling that you can read through as you work on more complex datasets and tasks: Dimensionality reduction, Imbalanced classification, Feature engineering, and Imputation.", "There are two questions that we want to be able to answer after exploring this dataset, which are quite typical in most classification problems:", "Classification is a type of supervised machine learning problem where the target (response) variable is categorical. Given the training data, which contains the known label, the classifier approximates a mapping function (f) from the input variables (X) to output variables (Y). For more sources on classification, see Chapter 3 in An Introduction to Statistical Learning, Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning Course (Week 3), and Simplilearn\u2019s tutorial on Classification.", "Now it\u2019s time to write some code!

In general, we should also have a validation set, which is used to evaluate the performance of each classifier and fine-tune the model parameters in order to determine the best model. The test set is mainly used for reporting purposes. However, due to the small size of this dataset, we can simplify this process by using the test set to serve the purpose of the validation set.", "In addition, I used a stratified hold-out approach to estimate model accuracy.

In addition, the petal measurements separate the different species better than the sepal ones.", "Next, let\u2019s make a correlation matrix to quantitatively examine the relationship between variables:", "The main takeaway is that the petal measurements have highly positive correlation, while the sepal one are uncorrelated.

Another way to show the prediction results is through a confusion matrix:", "Through this matrix, we see that there is one versicolor which we predict to be virginica.", "One downside is building a single tree is its instability, which can be improved through ensemble techniques such as random forests, boosting, etc. For now, let\u2019s move on to the next model.", "One of the most popular classification models is Naive Bayes.

Let\u2019s examine the test accuracy using this model to see whether this assumption is robust:", "What about the result if we only use the petal features:", "Interestingly, using only two features results in more correctly classified points, suggesting possibility of over-fitting when using all features. Seems that our Naive Bayes classifier did a decent job.", "If we use multivariate Gaussian distribution to calculate the class conditional density instead of taking a product of univariate Gaussian distribution (used in Naive Bayes), we would then get a LDA model (read more here).

It is a popular model since it is relatively simple and easy to implement. However, we need to be aware of the curse of dimensionality when number of features gets large.", "Let\u2019s plot the test accuracy with different choices of K:", "We can see that the accuracy is highest (about 0.965) when K is 3, or between 7 and 10. Compare to the previous models, it is less straightforward to classify new data points since we would need to look at its K closest neighbors in four-dimensional space.", "I also explored other models such as logistic regression, support vector machine classifier, etc. See my code on Github for details.", "Note that the SVC (with linear kernel) achieved a test accuracy of 100%!", "We should be pretty confident now since most of our models performed better than 95% accuracy.", "Here are a few ideas for future studies:", "We explored the Iris dataset, and then built a few popular classifiers using sklearn.
