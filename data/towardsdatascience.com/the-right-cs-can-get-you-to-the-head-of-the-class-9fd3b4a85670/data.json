I also believe it is important to challenge ourselves to learn new skills outside of the workplace, to add even more value to our working relationships.", "I recently had the chance to do this by joining an intense Data Science Immersive (DSI), where I was engaged daily with a great group of people from diverse backgrounds, experiences, and generations, all focusing our collective strengths and talents on solving the challenges set before us.", "As a student I found myself working independently, as part of a team, and also offering insights and leadership on certain labs and projects throughout the course.", "I wasn\u2019t expecting it, but I was fortunate to learn about more than just data science in this course. It provided me with a renewed perspective on the importance of collaboration, culture and community in today\u2019s workplace.", "How we collaborate in business has evolved through the decades, and I\u2019m not just talking about how advancements in technology have enabled us to do so today. I\u2019m talking about a change in the spirit of collaboration.", "If you think about it, we\u2019ve come a long way in just a few short decades from the hyper-competitive \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d management structures where individuals or small internal groups were pitted against each other to achieve a common goal.", "Deloitte\u2019s Human Capital Trends Report recently stated that 94% of companies globally believe that \u201cagility and collaboration\u201d are critical to their organization\u2019s success, and 32% of those companies say they are changing their organization\u2019s structure to be more \u201cteam-based\u201d.", "We are very fortunate that today\u2019s environment embraces a true spirit of collaboration over intense internal competition. Today we see an approach that capitalizes on everyone\u2019s strengths at the same time, allows for a greater exchange of ideas and a better product or solution, and a process that is much more productive and effective than the workplace environment from decades ago. This DSI offered great opportunities to listen, learn and lead:", "Whether it was during a friendly in-class Hack-a-thon competition, sharing insights outside the classroom while working on labs, or even late-night problem solving by kicking code around in a Slack channel, we actively helped each other along the path.", "We were all in, all for one and one for all. We learned that true collaboration occurs when there is trust among members of the team, clear communication, and the ability for ideas to spark, ignite, and fan the flames of greater concepts.", "Google recently undertook an initiative called \u201cProject Aristotle\u201d in which they analyzed effective teams and identified the quality that contributed most to their success. Trust was the most important factor, defined as psychological safety:", "In a team with high psychological safety, teammates feel safe to take risks around their team members. They feel confident that no one on the team will embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea.", "Not only did my DSI experience reinforce the spirit of collaboration, but it also provided great insight into the collaborative culture that tech companies have successfully cultivated for their teams.", "In the old \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d structures, discussing \u201cnext steps\u201d meant having all the answers before the questions were asked. In today\u2019s fast paced development world, \u201cnext steps\u201d in an opportunity of engagement \u2014 to celebrate how far the project has come, to discuss where it is going next and to solicit ideas for improvement or innovation from others along the way.", "Companies win when the culture is collaborative.", "They win when there is an environment for ideas and resources to be shared across teams for the greater good of the company, and they lose when they turn up internal competition.", "For example, one of the most important elements of our DSI was our individual capstone projects. Halfway through the course, we had to present three potential concepts to our instructors and peers for feedback and discuss which concept we would consider building out.", "You would initially think that everyone would be wildly competitive with each other at Capstone time, but we weren\u2019t. With the exchange of ideas out in the open, our group was incredibly supportive of each other from the start, and proactively offered advice and article links to each other when they saw something relevant. I credit our talented instructors with creating the environment that enabled this, and I know that environment was based on their own work experiences.", "The nature of my capstone required that I train myself on a tool that had not been explored in my DSI\u2019s curriculum (I unexpectedly had to teach myself how to use Selenium for Python due to the structure of a website I was scraping, you can read more about that here). After two intense weeks and some guidance from my instructor, I got the hang of using it for what I needed.", "Around that time, one of my classmates realized she would need to jump into Selenium as well and approached me to ask for guidance. I was thrilled to share with her everything I had learned, and I was equally thrilled when I saw how incredible her final capstone project and presentation was.", "And we weren\u2019t the only ones, that dynamic circulated throughout our cohort.", "That\u2019s one of the perks of being a data scientist. We leverage data to provide insights and solve problems, we get the opportunity to experiment and work with incredible tools, and we bring people together while collaborating with awesome colleagues along the way.", "Working within a Data Science Immersive with fellow students is one thing, learning from Data Science Immersive alumni who are actively working as data scientists in different fields is another.", "We had the opportunity to spend time in a panel discussion with five extremely talented individuals who came into the program with different backgrounds and were now established as data scientists in roles that played to their strengths.", "For example, one panelist was highly skilled in driving collaboration and served as the glue between the sales and data analyst teams in his organization. Another leveraged her amazing background in forensic accounting, her data science skills, and her ability to bring people together in her role serving clients and managing teams within a prominent forensic and litigation consulting practice.", "In all cases, they helped us understand that what we were experiencing in class is what they were experiencing daily. Whether it was in their initial job searches or in the roles they had taken on, the collaborative culture was the same.", "And now, in addition to living that culture in their day to day lives they were now turning back and actively guiding and welcoming us into their community.", "Deloitte\u2019s Human Capital Trends Report recently stated that 94% of companies globally believe that \u201cagility and collaboration\u201d are critical to their organization\u2019s success, and 32% of those companies say they are changing their organization\u2019s structure to be more \u201cteam-based\u201d.", "There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that anyone coming out of a Data Science Immersive experience like ours would perform extraordinarily well at a company with a collaborative culture and a team-based structure. In fact, they would also be a huge asset to the companies who are just realizing they need to shift in that direction as well.", "The culture of collaboration lives in this community, and companies who cultivate it today, will capitalize on it tomorrow.", "For more on Google\u2019s findings on effective teams from Project Aristotle, click here.
