Automatons were central to the good old Greek myths such as Pandora. Jewish culture has these mystical golems. The amazing Karakuri dolls have an important place in Japanese tradition.", "In the 17th century, several philosophers opined on putting mind into matter. They put forth a variety of theories. Rene Descartes believed in\u00a0the\u00a0dualism\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0mind\u00a0and\u00a0body. His views dismissed the possibility of mechanizing intelligence.", "Leibniz had different views. He believed that all human thought can be represented mathematically from few elemental symbols. For this, he proposed the Characteristica Universalis, the alphabet of logic.", "AI and automatons have featured in fiction since times that cannot be remembered. Speaking of a few, a lab-made creature was central to Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein. R.U.R. (Rossum\u2019s Universal Robots) premiered in 1921, introducing the word \u201crobot\u201d into literature.", "This laid the philosophical foundation for AI. Now, let us talk of the concrete scientific works which made AI happen. Such concrete history comes from the \u201cnew\u201d times. The field was only founded in 1956. The well-known Turing test was put forth in 1950. With this said, let us dive right in.", "Scientific work related to artificial intelligence saw a sudden rise in the 1950s and 1960s. This was set up by some preceding works. Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead published the Principia Mathematica in 1913. Around the same time, George Boole put forward his Laws of thought. These laid the foundations of mathematical logic.", "The real deal started when a 15-year-old runaway boy stormed into the office of Rudolf Carnap. Carnap was already an influential philosopher. At that time, he taught at the University of Chicago. He had published \u201cThe logical syntax of language.\u201d The boy came in without permission and pointed out errors in this work. Rudolf was awestruck. The boy was extraordinary. He didn\u2019t even wait to introduce himself. After searching for months, Rudolf finally found the homeless boy wandering in the college.", "Walter Harry Pitts, Jr. was his name. He had drafted a letter to Bertrand Russell three years ago (yes, at age 12). He had pointed out issues in the above-mentioned Principia. Russell was so impressed that he invited Pitts to study as a graduate student. But at that time, he was teaching at the University of Cambridge in the UK. Walter lived in Detroit in the USA.", "So when Russell joined the University of Chicago, our boy made the decision and came to join him. He wasn\u2019t enrolled as a student there. Even so, Walter had gained recognition. Soon enough, he was attending lectures at the University.", "The life of Walter is pretty interesting. I will be dedicating another post to that so we do not digress too much here.", "Back on board, in 1942, Walter Pitts met Warren McCulloch. McCulloch invited Pitts to stay at his home. They believed in Leibniz\u2019s theory that allowed the mechanization of all human thought. Thus they tried to frame a model for the neuroscience of the human nervous system. They published their seminal paper on the same in 1943. They titled it \u201cA logical calculus of the ideas immanent in neural activity.\u201d This paper was an invaluable contribution to the field of AI. They proposed a simple model, known as the McCulloch-Pitts neuron. It is still taught in every machine learning course. The ideas they proposed are the basis of almost all the state-of-the-art AIs today.", "Norbert Weiner\u2019s cybernetics and Claude Shannon\u2019s information theory came up in 1948. Cybernetics is the study of \u201ccontrol and communication in the animal and the machine.\u201d Information theory is the study of the \u201cquantification, storage and communication\u201d of information. Both influenced the field of AI.", "Cybernetics provided direct research on biological and mechanical intelligence. The concept proved invaluable in the future. Information Theory provided the essential mathematics.", "Soon after that, Alan Turing came up with the Turing test in 1950. He described a way to determine whether a machine is \u201cintelligent.\u201d In brief, the Turing test goes like this: a human converses with another human and a machine at the same time. The person has to identify which of the two is the machine. If the person were unable to do so, the machine would pass the \u201cimitation game\u201d. Although the Turing test is too narrow to use in modern systems, it was a big moment then. The name of Alan Turing made the paper, and hence the field more popular.", "In 1956, Dartmouth hosted a conference. Its main motto was to explore the concept of mechanizing intelligence. The participants would later become the most prominent names in the field of AI. The most important of these was Marvin Minsky \u2014 who built the first neural net machine, the SNARC in 1951. He would become the most reputed name in the AI world for the coming decades.", "Claude Shannon also attended. Future Nobel laureate Herbert A. Simon and Allen Newell debuted their \u201cLogic Theorist.\u201d It would go on to solve 38 of the first 52 theorems in Russell\u2019s Principia Mathematica.", "John McCarthy\u200a\u2014\u200aalso one of the pioneers of AI\u200a\u2014\u200acame up with the name \u201cArtificial Intelligence.\u201d The participants agreed. This was the birth of AI.", "As a result of this conference, interest in AI grew. There were many innovations. Newell and Simon created a \u201cGeneral Problem Solver\u201d in 1959. It could, in theory, solve any formalized problem. James Slagle created the SAINT (Symbolic Automatic INTegrator) to solve freshman calculus problems. These programs were impressive.", "Since the Turing test, natural language was an important domain of AI. Daniel Bobrow\u2019s program STUDENT was able to solve high school word problems. The concept of semantic net came up soon. It is a map of different concepts and relations between them (as in figure). Several successful programs were built upon it. Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA in 1966. It was able to have realistic conversations with humans.", "With so much happening in AI, the researchers got a bit too excited and put forward such statements:- Newell and Simon, 1958: \u201cWithin 10 years a digital computer will be the world chess champion\u201d. And, \u201cwithin 10 years a digital computer will discover and prove an important new mathematical theorem.\u201d - H. A. Simon, 1965: \u201cMachines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work a man can do.\u201d - Minsky, 1967: \u201cWithin a generation \u2026 the problem of creating \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 will substantially be solved.\u201d - Minsky, 1970: \u201cIn from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.\u201d", "Thus, the field received heavy funding. The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA, later renamed DARPA) granted $2.2 million to the team at MIT. The then DARPA president decided they should \u201cfund people, not projects!\u201d and evolved a freewheeling research culture. This allowed researchers to pursue whatever projects they deemed right.", "In 1969, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published their book titled Perceptrons. It highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of perceptrons (the monomers of neural networks).", "Yet their criticism proved fatal for the field of connectionism. They highlighted the inability of perceptrons to operate an elementary XOR circuit.", "The alternative approach of symbolic AI hence saw explosive growth. But, this approach did not provide any significant outcomes. In the 1970s, it was clear that the AI researchers had been overoptimistic about AI. The goals they promised were not yet achieved and were still a long way through.", "Researchers realized they had fundamental limits. There were computational limitations. AI was being applied to simple problems. But the real-life scenarios proved too complicated for the systems. The number of possibilities the algorithms were to explore was astronomical. This led to the problem of combinatorial explosion. And then, there was the classic question of \u201chow to give computers common-sense.\u201d This was the commonsense reasoning problem.", "This left the funders disappointed. The funding for AI thus disappeared and research stagnated. DARPA could no longer allow the hacker culture of research due to legal amendments. The money-givers became cold towards the field of AI. This period from 1974\u20131980 is thus called the \u201cAI winter\u201d.", "The Japanese government took an aggressive stand with AI research in 1981. It allocated $850 million for its \u201cFifth Generation Computer\u201d project. It was AI-focused. The envisioned computers could converse, translate languages, interpret pictures, and express human-like reasoning.", "Research in Japan was promising. In 1980, Waseda University developed the robot WABOT-2. It could communicate with humans. It could also read musical scores and play an electronic organ. The success of Japan prompted other governments and agencies to have a second look at the field of AI.", "Meanwhile, the field of connectionism re-emerged. In 1982, Hopfield gave a new form of neural network that could learn and process information. Geoffrey Hinton and David Rumelhart popularized reverse-mode auto diff. This technique was phenomenal and remains vital in machine learning to this day.", "Along with this, AI received commercial success in the form of \u201cexpert systems.\u201d These systems had in-depth knowledge of a specific topic. Folks at CMU built an expert system called XCON in 1980. It was in use at Digital Equipment Corporation. By 1986, it was annually saving the firm $40 million.", "In the late 1980s, another revolution overshadowed the success and growth of the AI field. Apple and IBM were producing more and more powerful computers at the same time. The personal computer revolution hit in. Desktop computers were cheaper and more powerful than the AI-based Lisp machines. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight. AI\u2019s successes with expert systems such as the XCON machine proved too expensive to maintain.", "There emerged several problems with expert systems. They could not learn. They were \u201cbrittle\u201d (i.e., they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs). They fell prey to problems identified years earlier. This included for example the qualification problem. The practical scope of expert systems became limited.", "New leadership at DARPA decided that AI was not \u201cthe next wave\u201d. They directed funds towards projects that seemed more likely to produce immediate results.", "In 1991, the goals of the Fifth Generation Computer project in Japan were not met. Once again, researchers had underestimated their difficulties.", "Over 300 AI companies had shut down, gone bankrupt, or been acquired by the end of 1993. This effectively ended the first commercial wave of AI.", "The mist of the personal computer revolution started to fade. More computing power was now available. Also, as personal computers started to become common, large datasets became available. Both of these were helpful to the growth of AI.", "We were solving some problems highlighted earlier and breaking what limited us. With more computing power, we were pushing the limits of what was possible. With large datasets, we were able to extract more and more knowledge. Practical AI algorithms started to make sense.", "A new paradigm called \u201cintelligent agents\u201d became accepted during the 1990s. An intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. It was hoped that one day we would be able to make these intelligent agents interact with each other. This would give us more versatile and intelligent systems.", "The AI community had diverse opinions about using mathematics in AI. The \u201cscruffies\u201d believed that intelligence was too complicated to be fit into mathematics. They argued that we humans seldom use logic in decision-making. The \u201cneats\u201d, on the other hand, believed that using logic to find optimum solutions was the way ahead.", "The newer, hotter versions of AI used sophisticated mathematical tools. These mathematical algorithms received widespread success. Russell and Norvig (2003) thus called it a \u201cvictory of the neats.\u201d", "Soon enough in 1997, IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov. He was the world champion at that time. What Newell and Simon had said would happen by 1968 had finally happened in 1997.", "The chess-playing computers today are far stronger than any human player. The highest Elo rating ever reached by a human is 2882. It is normal for computer engines (even those which can run on your pc) to reach 3000 Elo rating. The highest ever achieved was over 3350.", "In 2005, Stanford developed a robot for autonomous driving. It won the DARPA Grand Challenge. It drove for 131 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail.", "In February 2011, IBM decided to test its IBM Watson in the \u2018Jeopardy\u2019 quiz show. It was able to defeat the two greatest Jeopardy champions by a significant margin.", "As the internet grew and social media came up, the amount of data bloomed. Tech companies needed to perform smart operations on this data. The application of artificial intelligence thus became nothing less than a necessity. Now, Google sorts results using machine learning. YouTube recommends videos using ML algorithms. Amazon suggests you products with ML. Facebook\u2019s newsfeed is ML-generated. And in fact, Tinder finds matches for you using ML algorithms.", "With this AI mini-revolution, the technology has taken a firm hold. It is virtually irreplaceable. The AI field need only look ahead towards a supermachine future. And while the effects of advancements in AI are debatable, a full-blown AI revolution is inevitable.", "Your home for data science.
