In my face detection post, I showed how to detect human faces using Python. When I was testing the code with many images, I realized that there were animals in some of them. But the face detection model that we created was not recognizing animal faces. Then I wondered if there is a way to detect animal faces in images, after a little research on the internet, yes it was possible. Even found many free datasets on Kaggle with hundreds of pictures. Kaggle is a great place to find free datasets, they are also organizing data science contests. It\u2019s a great place to practice your data science skills and learn from others. Anyways, back to our project. I am so excited to combine both human and cat face detection models in one program so this way our machine will learn to differentiate between humans and cats. This will a fun project to work on. Let\u2019s get started!!", "First things first, the paperwork. Installing and importing the libraries is necessary when you are working on machine learning projects. We will use two libraries for this project, and they are called OpenCV and Pillow. OpenCV is a highly optimized library with a focus on real-time applications. Pillow is a great image processing library. Pillow will be installed as \u2018pillow\u2019 but imported as PIL. They are the same thing, don\u2019t get confused.", "OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.", "The installation process is very simple and easy. Write the following line of code in your terminal window:", "After the installation is completed, we can import it to our program.", "OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile, etc. Those XML files are stored in a GitHub folder. We will use the cat face detection and human face detection models.", "You can either download the XML files from Github if you have an account. If you don\u2019t, feel free to copy the code from the link above and paste it into your text editor and save them. I saved them as \u201ccatface_detector.xml\u201d and \u201chumanface_detector.xml\u201d.", "After saving the files in your folder, let\u2019s load them into our program.", "In this step, you will choose an image that you want to test your code on. Make sure you have at least a couple of images to check the accuracy of your program. The images can have both humans and cats or just one of them. If you are having a hard time to find cat images, I found a free dataset on Kaggle. Feel free to download and use for this project.", "Here are the images I will be using in our project:", "After choosing your images, let\u2019s rename them. Make sure the image files are in the same folder you are working on. After saving them, now we will do little retouches on the images.", "In this step, we will do some little retouches on the images for a better processing. I\u2019ve published a post on commonly used image manipulation techniques. Doing these retouching does help our machine to process and give much better results. For this exercise, first, let\u2019s resize the images so that they are at the same size. Next, we\u2019ll convert them to grayscale, our model works faster with grayscale images.", "To use these image editing techniques we will use the Image module that we imported in the beginning of the post.", "Lastly, let\u2019s import the edited ready images to our program so that we can run the cat face and human face detection models. We are using the Opencv library to import the images.", "It\u2019s time to detect the faces. We will run two lines of code. First one to detect human faces in the image. Second line is to detect cat faces in the image. As mentioned earlier we are suing the opencv classifiers.", "In this step, we are going to draw rectangles around the faces detected. These rectangles can be in different colors and their thickness level is also adjustable.", "Lastly, we will save the images with detected faces. To see the final results of your work, the best way is to save them and check. Make sure the variable names are passed correctly. Before you run this final code, I recommend going ahead and checking the whole code if everything looks okay.", "Here are the results of my work. The first one is human face detection and the second one is the cat face detection results. As you can see, our machine knows which one is human and which one is a cat face. I\u2019ve also tested the program by combining both images in one. The result I received can be found below.", "Instead of testing each image one by one, let\u2019s see what happens when we combine both images in one and run the code. We can see that our machine is now able to understand and differentiate between and cat and human faces.", "Congrats!! You have created a program that detects cats and human faces in an image. Now, you have an idea of how to teach a machine to do a couple of things at the same time for you. Hoping that you enjoyed this tutorial and learn something new today. Computer Vision is a great field and things you can do is unlimited. Feel free to test your code on different images and see how it works. It might not work on all images because the prediction depends on the trained data. In a future post, I am planning to show you how to train the machine with your own dataset so that it can give you a better prediction.", "Follow my blog and Towards Data Science to stay inspired.", "Your home for data science.
