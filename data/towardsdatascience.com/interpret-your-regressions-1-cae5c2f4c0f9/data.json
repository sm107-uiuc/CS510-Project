H. 1982. How should economists choose?American Enterprise Institute, Washington, D. C.)", "How many times have you ventured beyond the .fit() and the .predict() methods of the innumerous machine learning models that you make? Ever wondered what the term \u201cweight\u201d actually represents and how its interpretation is different in different algorithms?In gradient boosting, the predictions are a weighted sum of the predictions made by the previous tree models, and hence, the weights refer to the relative importance of each variable in the model. On the other hand, in a generalised linear model, weight implies the change in the target variable with a unit change in the respective feature.", "In this article, you will be taken through one of the most widely used algorithms of the Machine Learning world, Linear Regression and by the end of it, you will have unfolded many of the secrets that this seemingly simple algorithm holds.", "The dataset used here is the Bike Sharing Dataset available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can get the cleaned version from here.", "The target variable, aka the regressand, is the count of total rental bikes lent out on a specific day.", "The predictors or the regressors used are -", "- 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy", "- 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist", "- 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds", "- 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog", "The initial preprocessing of the dataset, dummy encoding, and splitting is done in the usual way. The steps followed can be referenced here.", "The InterpretML python package has been used in the explorations of this dataset. InterpretML is an open-source python package for training interpretable machine learning models and explaining blackbox systems.", "Starting off the exploratory data analysis with a visualization of the target variable, it can be assumed to follow a normal distribution, as it seems to be approximately symmetric.", "Moving ahead to the features, it is observed that all the categories present a stark imbalance in their distribution, and the regressand shares a moderately positive correlation value of 0.63 each with \u2018temp\u2019 and \u2018days_since_2011\u2019. These two features can be expected to hold high weightage in the model.", "Another point to observe is the correlation value of -0.94 between \u2018weathersit_1\u2019 and \u2018weathersit_2\u2019. This brings us to one of the assumptions of linear regression, the absence of multicollinearity. Multicollinearity means the existence of a relationship among some or all of the explanatory variables in a regression model. Say, in the regression of electricity consumption of a family on their income and house size(area), there is a constraint that families of higher incomes generally have bigger houses. Hence, it is not possible to measure the influences of the two predictors separately on the target. In the given dataset, both \u2018weathersit_1\u2019 and \u2018weathersit_2\u2019 refer to clear skies and misty(unclear) skies which are complementary events, and hence, there is a high negative correlation between them. Both these variables are kept in the dataset and not removed, but their individual effect on the count of bikes cannot be ascertained in the usual way.", "Training a simple linear regression model, assuming that the target variable shares a linear relationship with the features, gives us a correlation value of 79%. Thus, it can be said that this model is able to explain 79% of the entire variation present in the target variable.", "A look at the histogram of the residuals shows that the distribution is negatively skewed, i.e., the left tail is comparatively more elongated than the right tail. This violates the assumption of homoscedasticity, which implies that the variance of the error distribution should be constant, or in a model,", "From the plot, it is clear that the residuals do not follow such a distribution and hence, can be said to be heteroscedastic. Hence, in this case, Ordinary Least Squares cannot be used, (which is the most applied method of performing linear regression) and the Weighted Least Square technique needs to be used.", "However, since the model has already been built and fitted, let\u2019s move on to the interpretation of the weights of the model.", "The x-axis represents the numerical value of the weight assigned to the respective predictor variable.", "Among the continuous features, \u2018temp\u2019 gets the highest weightage. This is in correspondence to our observation that \u2018temp\u2019 shared an effective correlation with the bike counts. An increase in the temperature by 1 degree Celsius increases the expected number of bikes by 5282, given all the other features stay the same.", "\u2018weathersit_1\u2019 represents clear weather conditions and gets the maximum weight among the categorical features. On such days, it is normal to expect more people to go on bike rides and the estimated number of bikes is 1730 more, compared to other weather conditions, given that all other features stay the same.", "These interpretations always come with the clause \u201cgiven that all other features stay the same\u201d because if even one feature value changes, it brings an interaction effect in the model, which thereby influences the target variable.", "One thing to note is that \u2018days_since_2011\u2019 does not seem to get any importance in the model in spite of sharing a correlation with the target variable. To investigate this further, a look into how the individual predictions are made is given.", "The x-axis represents the product of the respective weight and feature value.", "Some features contribute unusually little or much to the predicted bike count when compared to the overall dataset. Temperature(0.48 degrees) contributes less towards the predicted value compared to the average and the feature \u2018days_since_2011\u2019 unusually much, because this instance is from late 2012(703 days).", "The feature \u2018days_since_2011\u2019 was introduced in the dataset to account for the trend, in this case, that the bike rental service became more popular over time. This led to the introduction of autocorrelation into the model. Say, in a time series regression of consumption expenditure on income, often it is found that consumption expenditure of current period, apart from the income of the current period depends on consumption expenditure of the previous period. If you have an income of Rs. 10000 per month, and in the month of March, you spent Rs. 9000, it is natural for you to spend less in the month of April. A regression like this is known as autoregression because one of the explanatory variables is a lagged value of the dependant variable. In this dataset, it could be that it had rained heavily on day 7 and hence, the next few days saw a decrease in the count of bikes than what should have been the usual. Hence, this autoregression needs to be adjusted for by the transformation of the variables.", "Now that you are at the end of this article, it is assumed (as it is always done) that you have had an insight into the vastness of the world of a \u201cSimple\u201d Linear Regression. Hope this article helps you in understanding algorithms better and making more efficient models.", "This article is based on the explorations of the book \u201cInterpretable Machine Learning\u201d by Christoph Molnar, Section 4.1 and you can find the Github repo here.", "Your home for data science.
