But, since it\u2019s 3AM and I have consumed too much coffee to be able to fall asleep \u2014 let\u2019s have some fun regardless! The data is analyzed on the state level (N_max = 50).", "Unless otherwise stated, all examples are fitted to simple linear models with a single independent variable (see directly below). The instances with missing data have been excluded from analysis.", "Interestingly, relating data on cancer-caused mortality to Trump votes yields a relatively weak (see R\u00b2_adj) but nonetheless seemingly significant (see p_F) relationship. Outliers in this particular model appear to be NC, UT, and WI. This relationship does not hold in case of Clinton voters.", "This model shows signs of correlation. Although the correlation is weak, it\u2019s rather significant as well. Outliers in this model also appear to be NC, UT, and WI.", "Well this is an unexpected outcome. States that have an issue with motor-vehicle accidents appear to have favored Trump in 2016. The correlation is actually in moderate range this time around. In fact, a similarly strong relationship (but in opposite direction) can be observed when substituting Trump votes with Clinton votes (see below).", "Examining the model with Trump voters a bit further, Breusch-Pagan (p = 0.1193) and Score test (p = 0.1449) suggest absence of heteroskedasticity in data. Shapiro-Wilk (p = 0.6651), Kolmogorov-Smirnov (p = 0.8544), and Anderson-Darling (p = 0.4715) tests for normality all suggest that the data come from a normal distribution. Durbin-Watson test (p = 0.89) suggests uncorrelated errors.", "Therefore, we might be able to predict with some confidence how a particular state has voted in 2016 presidential elections using only mortality rates due to motor-vehicle accidents. Alternatively, we can use states\u2019 voting records to predict their mortality rates due to motor-vehicle accidents.", "This model also shows signs of significant correlation, albeit weak between states that favored Trump and mortality rates due to suicide. Conversely, states that favored Clinton show lesser rates of such mortality \u2014 with an even better fit.", "Running diagnostics on Trump votes model yields the following:", "This model shows a weak correlation between the homicide morality rates and Trump support. However, the parameter estimates seem to yield a very nice t-test statistic. Potentially influential outliers are HI, LA, and TX.", "There is neither significant nor noticeable correlation between states that supported Trump in 2016 elections and mortality rate due to drug poisoning.", "It appears that the states supporting Trump in 2016 tend to suffer from high mortality rates due to various causes, as compared to states supporting Clinton. The most prominent examples are that of motor-vehicle and suicide related mortalities. One notable exception to this apparent rule is rate of mortality due to drug poisoning \u2014 the only example with no significant or noticeable correlation between the two variables.", "When it comes to Trump support and infant death rate, it appears that the states favoring Trump also have slightly higher infant death rates. Albeit significant, this relationship is relatively weak with only a slight correlation between the two variables.", "Correlation is higher, and the model fits better overall when we only look at non-hispanic black infant death instances. Running diagnostics on this model yields pretty tidy results, as expected.", "As expected, the trend is exactly the opposite for the states favoring Clinton:", "There is a negligent relationship between the states favoring Trump in 2016 election and hispanic infant death rate.", "In accordance with the mortality data, infant death rates also trend towards higher Trump support. This is particularly true in case of the non-hispanic black infant death rate where this relationship is very obvious and model fits quite nicely.", "There appears to be no obvious or significant relationship between Trump support and rates of Chlamydia.", "There also appears to be no obvious or significant relationship between Trump support and rates of Gonorrhea.", "There also appears to be no obvious or significant relationship between Trump support and rates of Syphilis.", "There appears to be no obvious link between sexually transmitted diseases and level of support for Trump.", "There is a very small correlation on a model of less-than-desirable fit indicating a potentially negative correlation between the Trump support and MMR vaccination coverage.", "There is a moderate evidence of states supporting Trump in 2016 presidential election and reduced coverage of DTaP immunization. Model diagnostics don\u2019t seem to be raising any red flags.", "There is neither an obvious nor significant evidence of relationship between HepB vaccination coverage and support for Trump in 2016 presidential elections.", "Just like it was the case for HepB, HepA data also lacks relationship to 2016 presidential elections data.", "Albeit an acceptable fit, the correlation between the two variables is way too small to make any deductions.", "All but DTaP vaccination coverage have been shown to not vary with Trump support data. On the other hand, DTaP vaccination coverage appears to be inversely proportional Trump support rates.", "No apparent association between these two variables.", "No apparent association between these two variables.", "No apparent association between these two variables.", "No apparent association between these two variables despite the model\u2019s okay fit.", "No apparent association between these two variables.", "No apparent association between these two variables.", "Despite the okay model fit, the correlation between the two variables is too low to make conclusions about the relationship between them.", "No apparent association between these two variables.", "No apparent association between these two variables.", "There appears to be no relationship between violent and property crime, and support for Trump in 2016 presidential election.", "There is a relatively evidence of states supporting Trump in 2016 presidential election and reduced educational attainment and quality of education.
