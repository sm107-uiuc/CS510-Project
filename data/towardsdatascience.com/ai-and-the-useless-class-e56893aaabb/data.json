This is a possibility that Yuval Noah Harari warns about in his book Homo Deus as well as during a presentation \u201cThe Future of Humanity.\u201d Harari explains that initiatives of the past previously required massive numbers of individuals, such as industrialization and waging wars, to function properly and for civilization to achieve progress. Whereas, 21st-century technologies could deemphasize and eliminate the need for the individual. Examples of AI enabled technologies that could completely replace the need for humans include autonomous cars and drones, facial recognition, and x-ray image analysis.", "It\u2019s a profound thought experiment that warns humanity about one possibility that could result from the unchecked proliferation of AI. Harari emphasizes that this is not a prophecy, rather, it\u2019s simply one possible outcome, and that humanity can affect the outcome given our choices today and into the future as the technology is developed.", "Regarding scenarios about the future of AI, futurists and philosophers are putting forth thoughtful predictions, possibilities, and visions that span the spectrum from dystopia to utopia. On one end of the scale, dystopian scenarios typically include variants of \u201cTerminator\u201d machine uprisings that enslave or eliminate the human race, or an ultra-efficient and unwavering \u201cPaperclip Maximizer AI\u201d that\u2019s determined to allocate all of the solar system\u2019s matter and energy to maximizing paperclip production. On the utopian end, there\u2019s a benevolent AI that uses technology to solve all of humanity\u2019s problems so humans no longer have to work and are free to pursue advanced cognition.", "For many of these scenarios, the impact on humanity takes effect after the singularity event, the point at which AI enables recursive self-improvement at an exponential rate. This leads to a Cambrian explosion of AI that, when viewed through a dystopian lens, renders homo sapiens\u2019 (modern-day humans) intelligence obsolete overnight.", "\u201cThe rise of powerful AI will be either the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity. We do not know which.\u201d -Professor Stephen Hawking", "Recognizing that the nomenclature across the industry and the meaning of \u201cAI\u201d can vary, the author of this article chooses to adopt Max Tegmark\u2019s definitions (defined in his book Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence) for the following terms to facilitate the remainder of this discussion. Hopefully, this will mitigate any confusion. As such, \u2018AGI\u2019 will be used to refer to the level of \u2018AI\u2019 that initiates the recursive explosion described by the singularity event.", "Intelligence: the ability to complete complex goals", "Human-level artificial general intelligence (AGI): ability to accomplish any general cognitive task at least as good as humans", "For definitions of narrow intelligence, general intelligence, universal intelligence, human-level AI, and Strong AI, please reference Tegmark\u2019s book for the balance of definitions. They have been omitted here since only the above is required for the purposes of this discussion.", "Continuing to reference Tegmark\u2019s book, he defines life as follows and categorizes it by three stages:", "Life: a process that can retain its complexity and replicate. What\u2019s replicated is information, arranged as bytes about how the matter is arranged. Life is a self-replicating information processing system. Information (software) determines its behavior and the blueprints for its hardware.", "Life 1.0: Life evolved (via natural selection) both its software and hardware (biological stage, bacteria)", "Life 2.0: Life designs (via learning) its software, and continues to evolve (via natural selection) its hardware (cultural stage, humans)", "Life 3.0: Life designs both its software and hardware (technical stage)", "Compare Tegmark\u2019s definition of life to the following statement made by Harari in Homo Deus, for a general understanding of the zeitgeist:", "\u201cScience is converging on an all-encompassing dogma that organisms are algorithms and that life is data processing.\u201d -Yuval Noah Harari", "Diving deeper, Harari presents the convincing claims that intelligence is both independent of substrate, biological (humans) or silicon (AI or AGI), and is decoupling from consciousness. He provides an elaborate discussion which illustrates that what humans (anthropologically) define as intelligence is nothing more than an organized, biological arrangement of subatomic particles in the human brain. He continues to explain that there\u2019s nothing preventing (i.e., the known laws of nature are not violated) those same subatomic particles from being rearranged in an organized, silicon arrangement to produce a non-biological intelligence.", "Recalling that consciousness was defined earlier as a subjective experience, but how, physiologically speaking, is that experience manifested? What is free will and what makes you, you? Where, precisely, in the human brain is a human conscious located and how does it function? These are fantastically difficult questions that, not for a lack of effort, the scientific community has yet to answer. For this reason, when consciousness enters the AI conversation, things can get complicated when trying to discern the role and/or influence consciousness has on intelligence. As such, consciousness is a loaded question that brings with it a variety of debates and theories that can quickly sidetrack the salient points of intelligence.", "Harari addresses, in detail, consciousness and provides an eloquent loophole to avoid the previously noted distractions. He concluded that \u201cconsciousness is being decoupled from intelligence.\u201d Therefore, one can interrogate intelligence without needing to consider consciousness. Recalling Tegmark\u2019s definition, intelligence is \u201cthe ability to complete complex goals.\u201d For example, if the complex goal is to perform facial recognition or identify a tumor from an x-ray image, AIs are, with ever-increasing rates of accuracy, successfully completing these complex tasks today. Thus proving intelligence does not require consciousness. Therefore, the reader can rest assured that consciousness is not being ignored altogether. Rather, it\u2019s simply not a prerequisite for discussing intelligence, and as such, the consciousness-related topics can continue in a separate and parallel discussion.", "When entertaining the concepts that intelligent life as we know it is simply data processing, and that intelligence can be achieved via organizing subatomic particles in a manner that\u2019s substrate agnostic, we arrive at the plausibility that, given sufficient resources (knowledge, labor, financial, time), creating AGI is both feasible and a legitimate possibility. Under these conditions, Harari\u2019s thought experiment begins to take form and it can be seen how a \u201cuseless\u201d class of people could result. What was once a civilization that required massive numbers of individuals to mobilize and drive productivity gains in a global economy, would switch to a superior level of intelligence (AGI) which has a lower unit cost, is capable of rapid scaling, and does not require individuals.", "When compared to AGI, humans are at both a software and a hardware disadvantage. Humans have to wait nine months to be born; then spend the next twenty years growing, developing, and learning; and add an additional four to ten years to obtain advanced degrees before fully integrating into the workforce. Comparatively, AGI can rapidly design and create its own on-demand software (instances) and hardware (e.g., 3D printed machines) that takes hours or days to execute, dwarfing the human rate of decades. It\u2019s simply not a level playing field.", "Historically, technological progress has been welcomed by humans because it always followed the same Industrial Revolution Formula:", "New technology is introduced which replaces a \u201cmechanical\u201d activity that humans previously performed, and as a result, humans are freed from the mechanical task (e.g., labor) to pursue higher-level cognitive processes that technology cannot competitively perform because it lacks human-level intelligence.", "In the First Industrial Revolution (18th and 19th centuries), mechanized production methods and the steam engine (new technologies) enabled the agrarian societies to industrialize and become urban. Previously, agrarian societies lived in small village communities and performed tasks, such as farming and making clothes, by hand (mechanical tasks). Machines were more efficient at performing these mechanical tasks, and humans moved on to other tasks that required intelligence.", "The Second Industrial Revolution (late 19th and early 20th centuries) was characterized by mass production (via the assembly line) and the invention of electricity (new technologies). This unlocked new technological advances for humans to pursue while machines continued to perform mechanical labor. Most recently, the Third Industrial Revolution (mid-20th-century to the present day) is being driven by automation, electronics, and information (new technologies). As was seen with the previous revolutions, humans offloaded tasks to machines (or computers) as humans, again, moved on to the jobs they have today that machines cannot perform. Arguably, the tasks offloaded during the Third Industrial Revolution are still \u201cmechanical,\u201d which will be explored further below.", "The thought experiment that industry experts, such as Harari, are proposing is that the previous Industrial Revolution Formula will no longer hold true as we transition to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Specifically, the Industrial Revolution Formula only holds true, if humans can \u201c\u2026pursue higher-level cognitive processes that technology cannot competitively perform because it lacks human-level intelligence.\u201d However, after AGI is introduced as the new technology, the previous condition is no longer true because AGI will have made modern-day human-level intelligence obsolete (ref the singularity event above). AGI will forever remain several, several steps ahead of humans because of its superior ability to design both its software and hardware. As each human is replaced, they will transition to the growing numbers of a \u201cuseless\u201d class.", "Creating a \u201cuseless\u201d class of people that cannot find employment means they are unable to maintain or improve their standard of living. Since the majority of gross domestic product (GDP), in advanced economies, is driven by consumer consumption, this could have disastrous effects on global economies. The owners of the AGI will be concentrated in the hands of a few technology oligarchs, continuing to consolidate their power and wealth that will exacerbate the economic inequality we see today. When analyzing the spending habits of wealthy individuals in the top one percent, it\u2019s noted that the wealthy simply don\u2019t spend money at a rate that compensates for the decreased spending of the average consumer class. As a result, spending by future technology oligarchs will likely be insufficient to compensate for the decline that will take place with the \u201cuseless\u201d consumer class. This also puts future tax revenues at risk since replacing a worker, that pays income tax on wages, with a robot, that doesn\u2019t pay taxes and can be depreciated as a capital expenditure to reduce a corporation\u2019s taxable income, would result in a net decrease in tax revenue for governments.", "For these reasons, this is why we\u2019re starting to see proposals (here and here) and pilot programs (here and here) for a Universal Basic Income (UBI) as well as robot tax plans such as the one proposed by Microsoft Founder, Bill Gates. At a high-level, the justification behind UBI is that jobs will be replaced by machines and that governments need to provide its citizens support from this systemic inevitability. The UBI counter argument calls into question many valid points such as funding feasibility and concerns over the use of funds and whether or not it will disincentivize participation in the labor market. The concept behind a robot tax is straightforward, it\u2019s a tax neutral strategy that taxes the robot as if it was a human worker making a wage and paying income tax. Evaluating the ideologies and feasibility of UBI and robot tax programs is not a trivial exercise and is not the subject of this conversation. The purpose was to raise awareness regarding the current-day initiatives that are attempting to 1) get ahead of the permanent job displacement by machines and 2) support a potential \u201cuseless\u201d class of the future.", "Today, much of the conversation concentrates on the future and how it starts with AI steadily taking over discrete tasks that humans perform today. Ultimately, giving way to an AGI explosion that will enable machines to replace humans altogether and with no future employment options. In his book The Most Human Human, Brian Christian astutely points out that there\u2019s a critical intermediate phase in the process by which jobs done by humans become automated: it\u2019s where humans do the job \u201cmechanically.\u201d Christian explains that, yes, a robot will be doing your job, but the robot is you.", "Christian is drawing attention to the fact that today, humans are refining our work processes and procedures so that job tasks can be completed in a logical and \u201cmechanical\u201d method. Under the veils of efficiency and increased productivity, humans are generating the very workflow and steps needed to \u201cstandardize\u201d the output. This means one human can be switched out with another human without affecting the output quality. This assumes the new human has adequate intelligence and is capable of following the \u201cmechanical\u201d procedures for the job tasks.", "At this point, it can be noticed that humans are, in fact, the robot that is \u201cmechanically\u201d performing the tasks of a job. How many times have individuals said, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m a robot at work.\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m performing this task like a robot.\u201d? Today, humans are mechanically converting their jobs such that they can be performed by a substrate-agnostic intelligence. Simply put, humans today are laying the groundwork for biological intelligence (humans) to be swapped out for silicon intelligence (machines). It appears the real issue isn\u2019t that robot will take our jobs one day. Rather, it\u2019s that the process has already begun and humans are unknowingly leading the charge. When considering this possibility further, I leave the reader with several interesting questions to muse:", "Is humanity, via draining jobs to mechanical behavior, complicit in setting itself up for replacement by machines (AI, AGI) and becoming a \u201cuseless\u201d class?", "If intelligence is substrate-agnostic, is a \u201cuseless\u201d class of people inevitable?", "What can be done today to avoid a \u201cuseless\u201d class outcome?", "If a \u201cuseless\u201d class results, what can be done to cope and are strategies like UBI and/or a robot tax the right way to think about addressing the problem?", "Are there even higher-levels of cognition that homo sapiens can perform that AGI cannot? If so, what are they?", "Will the pursuit and development of subjective experiences (consciousness) open the door to new possibilities for humanity, ones so rich that humanity welcomes being served by an AGI performing our intelligent tasks of the past?", "To avoid a dystopian outcome, what are we doing today to ensure the goals of an AGI do not conflict with those of humans? (Reference Max Tegmark\u2019s book for the initiative he\u2019s leading to help address this question.)", "Is it ethical to subject and exploit any form of intelligence (biological or silicon) to unconditionally serving the goals of humanity?", "If humanity is successful at turning over all means and methods of production to AGI, will that intelligence develop needs and wants of its own? If those needs are not met, what would an AGI \u201clabor\u201d strike or revolt look like on a global scale and how would humanity cope?", "Update: The author has published an article titled \u201cAI\u2019s (Auto)Complete Control Over Humanity\u201d which pertains to the topics discussed herein.", "Engineer, project manager, entrepreneur, thought leader.
