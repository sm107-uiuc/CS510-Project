I\u2019ve been roasting for 6 years now, and I\u2019ve gotten the majority of my green beans from them. I was curious though, how well Q-scores trended with cost, so I pulled all their data and did some simple analysis. In short, I found a general trend with cost so you have to pay more to get higher scored beans, which should be higher quality. I also found certain features correlate more to cost than other.", "The main caveat is that these beans are based on what Sweet Maria\u2019s procures, which is based in part on their customer base. So any analysis can not generalize outside of Sweet Maria\u2019s due to their curation. It would be very interesting to do this type of analysis across multiple sellers, but their data was not as easily accessible as Sweet Maria\u2019s.", "Sweet Maria\u2019s has a slightly different cupping criteria than the SCA criteria summarized below:", "Pulling data from Sweet Maria\u2019s was not the easiest to do. They don\u2019t have a database to pull from, but they have an archive of over 300 beans from over the years. So I viewed them all at the same time, then selected every bean to compare. This gave me an initial table, but I didn\u2019t have the scores.", "For the Q-Scores, I tapped on the image for the scoring, and I did this for all 300+ beans.", "From here, I selected everything and saved it to a data sheet.", "I used this data to manually enter the score into a new column. I have the opportunity to look at the other data, but I was mainly concerned about score. This allowed me to have nice clean data, but it did take some time and concentration.", "Overall, I found a trend between Q-score and price, but it isn\u2019t always the case. I looked at each regions, and African beans clearly dominate for Q-Score, but they have a looser trend for cost as compared to South American beans which have a stronger relationship between cost and quality.", "I also looked at processing and cultivar type. The main trend here is a stronger correlation for cost for Dry processed over Wet processed. Bourbon types have a strong correlation to cost as well.", "Finally, I looked at the correlation between cost and quality across some of these metrics. Correlation is a way to understand how different two variables are and how well they trend with each other. Correlation can be positive (proportionally related) or negative (inversely proportionally related).", "In looking by region, decaf beans has a negative correlation to price, but the sample size was small. South American beans have the highest correlation to between quality and price.", "Looking at processing and type, Dry processing has a higher correlation between quality and price than wet, and while some of the other numbers are bounce around, they have few samples.", "For type, Bourbon matches what we saw in the graph, which Heirloom has no correlation between quality and price.", "I looked at Sweet Maria\u2019s inventory of coffees, and I found a general correlation between grade and price. It is higher for certain regions and processing types over others, but I\u2019m glad to find when I spend more, I typically get more in terms of quality.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
