If you attempt to download and install CUDA Toolkit for Windows without having first installed Visual Studio, you get the message shown in Fig. 1.", "At the time of writing, the most recent version of Visual Studio (which is free) is the Visual Studio Express Community Version 2017, shown in Fig 2. You can get previous versions of Visual Studio for free by joining \u201cVisual Studio Dev Essentials\u201d and then searching for the version of Visual Studio you want.", "Once you have downloaded Visual Studio Express, its installation is straightforward.

Rebooting my PC before attempting to install CUDA Toolkit again solved this problem.", "These CUDA installation steps are loosely based on the Nvidia CUDA installation guide for windows. The CUDA Toolkit (free) can be downloaded from the Nvidia website here.", "At the time of writing, the default version of CUDA Toolkit offered is version 10.0, as shown in Fig 6. However, you should check which version of CUDA Toolkit you choose for download and installation to ensure compatibility with Tensorflow (looking ahead to Step 7 of this process). When you go onto the Tensorflow website, the latest version of Tensorflow available (1.12.0) requires CUDA 9.0, not CUDA 10.0.

A new window will appear, called \u201cEdit environment variable\u201d as shown in Fig 18 below.", "On checking the Environment Variables, I found the installation process which determines the CUDA installation path \u2014 Step 3.2, see Fig. 11 \u2014 had already added two paths to CUDA . These paths are shown in Fig 18 below, so I found I did not need to add a further CUDA path.", "Now that CUDA and cuDNN are installed, it is time to install Python to enable Tensorflow to be installed later on. At the time of writing, the most up to date version of Python 3 available is Python 3.7, but the Python 3 versions required for Tensorflow are 3.4, 3.5 or 3.6. Python 3.6 can be downloaded for Windows 10 from here. When you run the Python installer for windows, the setup window in Fig 19 will appear.", "Of the options in Fig. 19 above during Python installation, I chose to select all of them. These options are useful: Python\u2019s \u2018pip\u2019 installer is used at Step 7.2 of this guide to install Tensorflow. Additionally, I use the IDE (integrated development environment for writing and running python code) called \u201cIDLE\u201d at Step 8.", "In the \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d (shown at Fig 20 below), I chose the installation of Python for all users (which was not ticked by default); this gives the more useful system wide installation.", "Tensorflow provides instructions for checking that CUDA, cuDNN and (optional: CUPTI) installation directories are correctly added to the PATH environmental variables. As the three cuDNN files were copied into the subfolders of CUDA, I did not update the existing CUDA environmental variables path.", "Step 7.1: Calling up the command prompt with administration rights", "In this step a system-wide install of Tensorflow is carried out, not a per user install. System wide installation of Tensorflow requires administrative rights, therefore, accordingly the command prompt should be run with administrative rights.", "Open up the command prompt by running \u2018cmd\u2019 in the search bar, and then right clicking on command prompt to choose \u2018run as administrator\u2019. This opens up Administrator: Command Prompt as shown in Fig 21.", "Step 7.2: System wide install of Tensorflow via python pip", "Having opened the Command Prompt, the system-wide installation command for Tensorflow with GPU support is as follows:", "The \u201cpip3\u201d command (as opposed to \u201cpip\u201d) is required as the installation is to Python 3. Execution of this command in the command prompt is shown in Fig 22.", "The resulting output from the command is shown in Fig 23, and if all goes to plan there should eventually be a message to confirm that Tensorflow has been installed successfully.", "Go to the start menu in windows and search for the IDE called \u2018idle\u2019, which will be installed as part of your python installation if you selected as I did at Step 6. A Python window should appear labelled Python 3.6.x Shell. At the prompt (denoted by \u2018>>>\u2019), import the Tensorflow package. This will check that Tensorflow has been installed (as you can import it). The command for the IDLE shell to import the tensorflow package is as follows:", "To test CUDA support for your Tensorflow installation, you can run the following command in the shell:", "Finally, to confirm that the GPU is available to Tensorflow, you can test using a built-in utility function in TensorFlow as shown here:", "It takes a few minutes to return a result from this; when it is finished it returns True, and then the prompt `>>>`appears again. Importing tensorflow and these tests are all shown in Fig 24 in the Python IDLE Shell.", "These were the steps I took to install Visual Studio, CUDA Toolkit, CuDNN and Python 3.6, all with the ultimate aim of installing Tensorflow with GPU support on Windows 10. To date, my GPU based machine learning and deep learning work has been on Linux Ubuntu machines; by the same token, much of the machine learning community support online focuses on Ubuntu.", "For Machine Learning, the major drawback to using Windows is that it is necessary to build more things from source (for example using Cmake) than on Linux, and also to install additional software for the build processes, such as Visual Studio. For example, if you were to install Caffe2 on Windows, there are no pre-built binaries and Windows build is in testing and beta mode. I installed CUDA and cuDNN on Windows 10 more out of curiosity than anything else, just to see how straightforward (or otherwise) it was.", "As I intimated in Part 1, now that CUDA, cuDNN and Tensorflow are successfully installed on Windows 10 and I have checked Tensorflow\u2019s access to GPU, I am going to sweep the whole Windows 10 operating system away in order to make a fresh installation of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
