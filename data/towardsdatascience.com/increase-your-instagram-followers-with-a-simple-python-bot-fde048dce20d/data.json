And if you\u2019d like to build an audience that\u2019s relevant to you, and shares common interests, that\u2019s even more difficult. I always saw Instagram has a great way to promote my photos, but I never had more than 380 followers... Every once in a while, I decide to start posting my photos on Instagram again, and I manage to keep posting regularly for a while, but it never lasts more than a couple of months, and I don\u2019t have many followers to keep me motivated and engaged.", "The objective of this project is to build a bigger audience and as a plus, maybe drive some traffic to my website where I sell my photos!", "A year ago, on my last Instagram run, I got one of those apps that lets you track who unfollowed you. I was curious because in a few occasions my number of followers dropped for no apparent reason. After some research, I realized how some users basically crawl for followers. They comment, like and follow people \u2014 looking for a follow back. Only to unfollow them again in the next days.", "I can\u2019t say this was a surprise to me, that there were bots in Instagram\u2026 It just made me want to build one myself!", "And that is why we\u2019re here, so let\u2019s get to it! I came up with a simple bot in Python, while I was messing around with Selenium and trying to figure out some project to use it. Simply put, Selenium is like a browser you can interact with very easily in Python.", "Ideally, increasing my Instagram audience will keep me motivated to post regularly. As an extra, I included my website in my profile bio, where people can buy some photos. I think it is a bit of a stretch, but who knows?! My sales are basically zero so far, so it should be easy to track that conversion!", "If you would like to have access to my other web scraping articles \u2014 and pretty much everything else on Medium \u2014 have you considered subscribing? You would be supporting my work tremendously!", "After giving this project some thought, my objective was to increase my audience with relevant people. I want to get followers that actually want to follow me and see more of my work. It\u2019s very easy to come across weird content in the most used hashtags, so I\u2019ve planed this bot to lookup specific hashtags and interact with the photos there. This way, I can be very specific about what kind of interests I want my audience to have. For instance, I really like long exposures, so I can target people who use that hashtag and build an audience around this kind of content. Simple and efficient!", "My gallery is a mix of different subjects and styles, from street photography to aerial photography, and some travel photos too. Since it\u2019s my hometown, I also have lots of Lisbon images there. These will be the main topics I\u2019ll use in the hashtags I want to target.", "This is not a \u201cget 1000 followers in 24 hours\u201d kind of bot!", "I ran the bot a few times in a few different hashtags like \u201ctravelblogger\u201d, \u201ctravelgram\u201d, \u201clisbon\u201d, \u201cdronephotography\u201d. In the course of three days I went from 380 to 800 followers. Lots of likes, comments and even some organic growth (people that followed me but were not followed by the bot).", "To be clear, I\u2019m not using this bot intensively, as Instagram will stop responding if you run it too fast. It needs to have some sleep commands in between the actions, because after some comments and follows in a short period of time, Instagram stops responding and the bot crashes.", "You will be logged into your account, so I\u2019m almost sure that Instagram can know you\u2019re doing something weird if you speed up the process. And most importantly, after doing this for a dozen hashtags, it just gets harder to find new users in the same hashtags. You will need to give it a few days to refresh the user base there.", "The most efficient way to get followers in Instagram (apart from posting great photos!) is to follow people. And this bot worked really well for me because I don\u2019t care if I follow 2000 people to get 400 followers.", "The bot saves a list with all the users that were followed while it was running, so someday I may actually do something with this list. For instance, I can visit each user profile, evaluate how many followers or posts they have, and decide if I want to keep following them. Or I can get the first picture in their gallery and check its date to see if they are active users.", "If we remove the follow action from the bot, I can assure you the growth rate will suffer, as people are less inclined to follow based on a single like or comment.", "That\u2019s the debate I had with myself. Even though I truly believe in giving back to the community (I still learn a lot from it too!), there are several paid platforms that do more or less the same as this project. Some are shady, some are used by celebrities. The possibility of starting a similar platform myself, is not off the table yet, so why make the code available?", "With that in mind, I decided to add an extra level of difficulty to the process, so I was going to post the code below as an image. I wrote \u201cwas\u201d, because meanwhile, I\u2019ve realized the image I\u2019m getting is low quality. Which in turn made me reconsider and post the gist. I\u2019m that nice! The idea behind the image was that if you really wanted to use it, you would have to type the code yourself. And that was my way of limiting the use of this tool to people that actually go through the whole process to create it and maybe even improve it.", "I learn a lot more when I type the code myself, instead of copy/pasting scripts. I hope you feel the same way!", "The script isn\u2019t as sophisticated as it could be, and I know there\u2019s lots of room to improve it. But hey\u2026 it works! I have other projects I want to add to my portfolio, so my time to develop it further is rather limited. Nevertheless, I will try to update this article if I dig deeper.", "You\u2019ll need Python (I\u2019m using Python 3.7), Selenium, a browser (in my case I\u2019ll be using Chrome) and\u2026 obviously, an Instagram account! Quick overview regarding what the bot will do:", "If you reached this paragraph, thank you! You totally deserve to collect your reward! If you find this useful for your profile/brand in any way, do share your experience below :)", "In order to use chrome with Selenium, you need to install chromedriver. It\u2019s a fairly simple process and I had no issues with it. Simply install and replace the path above. Once you do that, our variable webdriver will be our Chrome tab.", "In cell number 3 you should replace the strings with your own username and the respective password. This is for the bot to type it in the fields displayed. You might have already noticed that when running cell number 2, Chrome opened a new tab. After the password, I\u2019ll define the login button as an object, and in the following line, I click it.", "If you\u2019re wondering what those weird strings are, don\u2019t be scared! On my article about web scraping a real estate website, I\u2019ve been through a similar task, which consisted in inspecting the web pages in order to tell the bot where to look. You can do that very easily, simply by right clicking the element you want to map, and selecting Inspect.", "Once you get in inspect mode find the bit of html code that corresponds to what you want to map. Right click it and hover over Copy. You will see that you have some options regarding how you want it to be copied. I used a mix of XPath and css selectors throughout the code (it\u2019s visible in the find_element_ method). It took me a while to get all the references to run smoothly. At points, the css or the xpath directions would fail, but as I adjusted the sleep times, everything started running smoothly.", "In this case, I selected \u201ccopy selector\u201d and pasted it inside a find_element_ method (cell number 3). It will get you the first result it finds. If it was find_elements_, all elements would be retrieved and you could specify which to get.", "Once you get that done, time for the loop. You can add more hashtags in the hashtag_list. If you run it for the first time, you still don\u2019t have a file with the users you followed, so you can simply create prev_user_list as an empty list.", "Once you run it once, it will save a csv file with a timestamp with the users it followed. That file will serve as the prev_user_list on your second run. Simple and easy to keep track of what the bot does.", "Update with the latest timestamp on the following runs and you get yourself a series of csv backlogs for every run of the bot.", "The code is really simple. If you have some basic notions of Python you can probably pick it up quickly. I\u2019m no Python ninja and I was able to build it, so I guess that if you read this far, you are good to go!", "The print statement inside the loop is the way I found to be able to have a tracker that lets me know at what iteration the bot is all the time. It will print the hashtag it\u2019s in, the number of the iteration, and the random number generated for the comment action. I decided not to post comments in every page, so I added three different comments and a random number between 1 and 10 that would define if there was any comment at all, or one of the three. The loop ends, we append the new_followed users to the previous users \u201cdatabase\u201d and saves the new file with the timestamp. You should also get a small report.", "After a few hours without checking the phone, these were the numbers I was getting. I definitely did not expect it to do so well! In about 4 days since I started testing it, I had around 500 new followers, which means I have doubled my audience in a matter of days. I\u2019m curious to see how many of these new followers I will lose in the next few days, to see if the growth can be sustainable. I also had a lot more \u201clikes\u201d in my latest photos, but I guess that\u2019s even more expected than the follow backs.", "It would be nice to get this bot running on a server, but I have other projects I want to explore, and configuring a server is not one of them! Feel free to leave a comment below, and I\u2019ll do my best to answer your questions.", "If you want to get more serious about this subject, I strongly recommend these books:", "Thanks for reading!
