In that case, you must have come across Git at some point along your journey. Mastering version control is one of the essential skills that is shared among all software-related fields.", "Version control systems are a particular type of software designed to help programmers track any specific application source code changes.", "In general, there are two types of version control systems, centralized and distributed systems. The main difference between those two types is, in centralized systems, the code files and the information about the contributors are stored in a single server. In distributed systems, however, the code files are copied on every contributor\u2019s machine.", "Git is a commonly used distributed version control system based on repositories. It was created by Linux\u2019s creator Linus Torvalds. Torvalds created Git for the management of the Linux kernel source code. Git at the core of many services like GitHub and GitLab.", "In this article, we will cover how Git works and its basic building blocks.", "Git\u2019s algorithms are designed to take advantage of real source code file trees\u2019 common attributes and how they usually get modified over time.", "When dealing with code files, Git doesn\u2019t focus on the file\u2019s name and instead keeps track of its content. Git was designed this way because, most often, the names of code files are not fixed.", "To store code files, Git uses delta encoding \u2014 which keeps the difference in file content \u2014 to save repository contents and the version\u2019s metadata explicitly.", "The way Git handles changes in the content is by storing different snapshots. Each snapshot is linked to a specific change in the source code. Git is also designed to work very well to apply or roll back the modifications performed between two snapshots.", "The main building block of Git is repositories (repo\u2019s). Think of a repository as a folder in your computer\u2019s memory \u2014 the folder containers different files, with different types and different editing dates.", "These files and their information and any subfolders are called the content of the repo. All versions of the content are stored in the repo. The repo is where the content is stored and where you modify the content, called the working directory.", "For example, suppose you have multiple doc files in a specific directory on your hard drive. In that case, this directory will be the repo, and the files inside it are the content. Say you opened one of those files to edit it \u2014 using a word processor \u2014 the application where you edit the doc is the working directory.", "The process of reading the current version of the content is called checkout, and the process of storing a new version is called a commit. Back to our directory example, opening the doc file in a word processor is checking it out while clicking the save button is the equivalent of committing the file.", "Every time you commit a file, you\u2019re creating a new version \u2014 snapshot \u2014 of this file in the repo. A series of versions create a branch. In Git, the main branch used to be named master. However, lately, Git changed that to main. The branches\u2019 concept is used to implement a project with a distributed developer base and provide a stable version of the code while working on developing new features.", "In Git, the term commit is used as a verb when creating a version and as the name for the resulting snapshot.", "Git contains many commands to deal with and manipulate repos. Commands such as init, add, commit, branch, log, etc. each of these commands help you perform a specific task.", "As we just mentioned, a group of changes is called a branch. A repo often contains different branches, the main one and separate ones for developing additional features.", "In Git, a branch consists of an ordered list of changes known as the changeset. These changes are sorted as they are applied to the version or the snapshot. Branches are just named pointers to a specific version. It keeps notes of where the changes are when a developer uses this branch.", "The idea behind branching is that every time you commit a change, a new branch is created for that changeset.", "After finishing the development on one of the branches, it\u2019s time to add these changes to the main branch. The process of doing so is called merging. Merging takes the contents of two branches and merges them into one.", "Based on the type of changes done and the content of the branches, there are three types of merges you can perform:", "The way Git checks for conflict is so interesting. It mainly tries to find the locations in content where a change has occurred; if the two branches have content in the same location, Git will stop and raise a conflict flag. If the same content is modified, yet the modifications are independent, Git can detect that and perform a fast forward merge.", "Understanding the inner work of Git may not be critical knowledge for a developer or a programmer to know, but knowing the high-level part of how it functions and how to use it efficiently is a skill that you can\u2019t advance in your career without obtaining.", "Git consists of repositories containing the different code files as well as the version metadata. In this article, we went through that basic of Git, how to create and deal with repos. How to create and merge branches and the different types of merging the Git offers.", "This series\u2019s next article will go through more advanced Git concepts, such as cherry-picking and rolling back.", "Your home for data science.
