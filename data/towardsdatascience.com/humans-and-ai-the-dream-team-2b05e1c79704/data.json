Or at least they\u2019ll make most of our labor obsolete. Of course, as clickbait articles tend to be, they greatly exaggerate the current technologies and how close certain technology is to replacing human labor. For example, you watch a video like this Wired documentary and you\u2019d think self-driving cars are about to take over the roads any day now. In fact, I think if you took someone not involved in the AI/machine learning/data science community and asked them what kind of technology they thought of when you said AI, probably one of the first things they\u2019d come up with are self-driving cars. However, this Vox article quotes Daniel Sperling, the founding director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis:", "\u2026fully driverless cars \u2014 which don\u2019t require anyone in the car at all and can go anywhere \u2014 are \u201cnot going to happen for many, many decades, maybe never.\u201d", "Just as self-driving cars are not about to replace human drivers, there are many areas where humans are not as close to being replaced as some of these articles would have you believe. In other words, AI is not as infallible as it\u2019s made out to be, and that\u2019s becoming even more clear with the current pandemic.", "The current COVID-19 pandemic has been a novel experience in the modern age. The last time we experienced a pandemic of this magnitude and social impact was the 1918 flu epidemic, and as you\u2019d imagine, data from that pandemic is not nearly as detailed or complete as what we have now. Additionally, the world in 1918 is vastly different to the world we live in today for so many reasons.", "All predictive models work under one basic assumption, that the future will act the same way as the past. Data will always behave in the same way, and all that will change is how different variables interact with each other. Models only know what the data tells them, and nothing else. It doesn\u2019t have general world knowledge, or even just a greater contextual knowledge (unless of course it\u2019s reflected somewhere in the data the model is given).", "All of this means many predictive models are going to be way off, as this article highlights. Models don\u2019t account for this level of catastrophic event. Plus even if features were added to models that may account for pandemic-specific issues, the truth is we really don\u2019t know what the future looks like. We really don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll stop social distancing, besides the fact we probably won\u2019t be doing it forever, and we don\u2019t know when people are going to even feel safe doing the things they used to. Moreover, as many people are saying, we may never go back to the way things used to be. If that\u2019s the case, predictive models, especially the more data-hungry ones, are going to be more notably off for a good amount of time.", "This is where humans come in. We\u2019re able to take new events and make educated predictions using very little data, because we have the much broader internal database of empathy and an understanding of how we humans behave. An algorithm may not predict where a person would go shopping now, but a human could. We might predict someone might go to a smaller store because it\u2019s less crowded, or closer to home. We can see changes in data and say, \u201cOh that makes sense for [insert reasons here].\u201d That same change would not make sense at all to an algorithm that doesn\u2019t understand exactly how a pandemic and the threats and anxiety associated with it impact human behavior.", "All of this isn\u2019t to say that we\u2019re up the creek without a paddle and all algorithms are now useless. Algorithms could still contain valuable insight, insight that we could combine with our own knowledge. We could look at the output of an algorithm and present it as, \u201cthis is what would normally happen according to our models, and this is what is currently happening, so if these events happen in the future, this is how we could expect our model to be wrong and how we could expect it to be right.\u201d The truth is, humans and AI have always needed each other. Even past the fact that humans created AI, AI still needs data from us, and humans can provide domain and general knowledge that an algorithm cannot. Data science has proven to be an invaluable tool in today\u2019s data-driven world. Models can sift through mountains of data that humans cannot, but humans are much better at adapting to novel situations. This is why it should never be about one replacing the other, it\u2019s about capitalizing on each other\u2019s strengths and working together as one.", "Your home for data science.
