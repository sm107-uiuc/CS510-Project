In other words, a Student\u2019s t-test for two samples allows to determine whether the two populations from which your two samples are drawn are different (with the two samples being measured on a quantitative continuous variable).2", "The reasoning behind this statistical test is that if your two samples are markedly different from each other, it can be assumed that the two populations from which the samples are drawn are different. On the contrary, if the two samples are rather similar, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the two populations are similar, so there is no sufficient evidence in the data at hand to conclude that the two populations from which the samples are drawn are different. Note that this statistical tool belongs to the branch of inferential statistics because conclusions drawn from the study of the samples are generalized to the population, even though we do not have the data on the entire population.", "To compare two samples, it is usual to compare a measure of central tendency computed for each sample. In the case of the Student\u2019s t-test, the mean is used to compare the two samples. However, in some cases, the mean is not appropriate to compare two samples so the median is used to compare them via the Wilcoxon test. This article being already quite long and complete, the Wilcoxon test is covered in a separate article, together with some illustrations on when to use one test or the other.", "These two tests (Student\u2019s t-test and Wilcoxon test) have the same final goal, that is, compare two samples in order to determine whether the two populations from which they were drawn are different or not. Note that the Student\u2019s t-test is more powerful than the Wilcoxon test (i.e., it more often detects a significant difference if there is a true difference, so a smaller difference can be detected with the Student\u2019s t-test) but the Student\u2019s t-test is sensitive to outliers and data asymmetry. Furthermore, within each of these two tests, several versions exist, with each version using different formulas to arrive at the final result. It is thus necessary to understand the difference between the two tests and which version to use in order to carry out the appropriate analyses depending on the question and the data at hand.", "In this article, I will first detail step by step how to perform all versions of the Student\u2019s t-test for independent and paired samples by hand. The analyses will be done on a small set of observations for the sake of illustration and easiness. I will then show how to perform this test in R with the exact same data in order to verify the results found by hand. Reminders about the reasoning behind hypothesis testing, interpretations of the the p-value and the results, and assumptions of this test will also be presented.", "Note that the aim of this article is to show how to compute the Student\u2019s t-test by hand and in R, so we refrain from testing the assumptions and we assume all of them are met for this exercise. For completeness, we still mention the assumptions, how to test them and what other tests exist if one is not met. Interested readers are invited to have a look at the end of the article for more information about these assumptions.", "Before diving into the computations of the Student\u2019s t-test by hand, let\u2019s recap the null and alternative hypotheses of this test:", "where \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 are the means of the two populations from which the samples were drawn.", "As mentioned in the introduction, although technically the Student\u2019s t-test is based on the comparison of the means of the two samples, the final goal of this test is actually to test the following hypotheses:", "This is in the general case where we simply want to determine whether the two populations are different or not (in terms of the dependent variable). In this sense, we have no prior belief about a particular population being larger or smaller than the other. This type of test is referred as a two-sided or bilateral test.", "If we have some prior beliefs about one population being larger or smaller than the other, the Student\u2019s t-test also allows to test the following hypotheses:", "In the first case, we want to test if the first population is significantly larger than the second, while in the latter case, we want to test if the first population is significantly smaller than the second. This type of test is referred as a one-sided or unilateral test.", "Some authors argue that one-sided tests should not be used in practice for the simple reason that, if a researcher is so sure that one population is larger (smaller) than the other and would never be smaller (larger) than the other, why would she needs to test for significance at all? This a rather philosophical question and it is beyond the scope of this article. Interested readers are invited to see part of the discussion in Rowntree (2000).", "In statistics, many statistical tests is in the form of hypothesis tests. Hypothesis tests are used to determine whether a certain belief can be deemed as true (plausible) or not, based on the data at hand (i.e., the sample(s)). Most hypothesis tests boil down to the following 4 steps:3", "There are several versions of the Student\u2019s t-test for two samples, depending on whether the samples are independent or paired and depending on the variances of the populations:", "On the one hand, independent samples means that the two samples are collected on different experimental units or different individuals, for instance when we are working on women and men separately, or working on patients who have been randomly assigned to a control and a treatment group (and a patient belongs to only one group). On the other hand, we face paired samples when measurements are collected on the same experimental units, same individuals. This is often the case, for example in medical studies, when testing the efficiency of a treatment at two different times. The same patients are measured twice, before and after the treatment, and the dependency between the two samples must be taken into account in the computation of the test statistic by working on the differences of measurements for each subject. Paired samples are usually the result of measurements at two different times, but not exclusively. Suppose we want to test the difference in vision between the left and right eyes of 50 athletes. Although the measurements are not made at two different time (before-after), it is clear that both eyes are dependent within each subject. Therefore, the Student\u2019s t-test for paired samples should be used to account for the dependency between the two samples instead of the standard Student\u2019s t-test for independent samples.", "Another criteria for choosing the appropriate version of the Student\u2019s t-test is whether the variances of the populations (not the variances of the samples!) are known or unknown and equal or unequal. This criteria is rather straightforward, we either know the variances of the populations or we do not. The variances of the populations cannot be computed because if you can compute the variance of a population, it means you have the data for the whole population, then there is no need to do a hypothesis test anymore\u2026 So the variances of the populations are either given in the statement (use them in that case), or there is no information about these variances and in this case, it is assumed that the variances are unknown. In practice, the variances of the populations are most of the time unknown and the only thing to do in order to choose the appropriate version of the test is to check whether the variances are equal or not. However, we still illustrate how to do all versions of this test by hand and in R in the next sections following the 4 steps of hypothesis testing.", "Note that the data are artificial and do not represent any real variable. Furthermore, remind that the assumptions may or may not be met. The point of the article is to detail how to compute the different versions of the test by hand and in R, so all assumptions are assumed to be met. Moreover, assume that the significance level \u03b1=5% for all tests.", "If you are interested in applying these tests by hand without having to do the computations yourself, here is a Shiny app which does it for you.

In the next sections, we detail how to perform the exact same tests in R.", "A good practice before doing t-tests in R is to visualize the data by group thanks to a boxplot (or a density plot, or eventually both). A boxplot with the two boxes overlapping each other gives a first indication that the two samples are similar, and thus, that the null hypothesis of equal means may not be rejected. On the contrary, if the two boxes are not overlapping, it indicates that the two samples are not similar, and thus, that the populations may be different. However, even if boxplots or density plots are great in showing a comparison between the two groups, only a sound statistical test will confirm our first impression.", "After a visualization of the data by group, we replicate in R the results found by hand.

However, only a formal statistical test will confirm this belief.", "Since there is no function in R to perform a t-test with known variances, here is one with arguments accepting the two samples (x and y), the two variances of the populations (V1 and V2), the difference in means under the null hypothesis (m0, default is 0), the significance level (alpha, default is 0.05) and the alternative (alternative, one of \"two.sided\" (default), \"less\" or \"greater\"):", "The output above recaps all the information needed to perform the test: the test statistic, the p-value, the alternative used, the two sample means and the two variances of the populations (compare these results found in R with the results found by hand).", "The p-value can be extracted as usual:", "The p-value is 0.95 so at the 5% significance level we do not reject the null hypothesis of equal means. There is no sufficient evidence in the data to reject the hypothesis that the two means in the populations are similar. This result confirms what we found by hand.", "For those unfamiliar with the concept of p-value, the p-value is a probability and as any probability it goes from 0 to 1. The p-value is the probability of having observations as extreme as what we measured (via the samples) if the null hypothesis was true. In other words, it is the probability of having a test statistic as extreme as what we computed, given that the null hypothesis is true. If the observations are not so extreme \u2014 not unlikely to occur if the null hypothesis was true \u2014 we do not reject this null hypothesis because it is deemed plausible to be true. And if the observations are considered too extreme \u2014 too unlikely to happen under the null hypothesis \u2014 we reject the null hypothesis because it is deemed too implausible to be true. Note that it does not mean that we are 100% sure that it is too unlikely, it happens sometimes that the null hypothesis is rejected although it is true (see the significance level \u03b1 later on).", "In our example above, the observations are not really extreme and the difference between the two means is not extreme, so the test statistic is not extreme (since the test statistic is partially based on the difference of the means of the two samples). Having a test statistic which is not extreme is not unlikely and that is the reason why the p-value is quite high. The p-value of 0.95 actually tells us that the probability of having two samples with a difference in means of -0.04 (= 0.02\u20130.06), given that the difference in means in the populations is 0 (the null hypothesis), equals 95%. A probability of 95% is definitely considered as plausible, so we do not reject the null hypothesis of equal means in the populations.", "One may then wonder, \u201cWhat is too extreme for a test statistic?\u201d Most of the time, we consider that a test statistic is too extreme to happen just by chance when the probability of having such an extreme test statistic given that the null hypothesis is true is below 5%. The threshold of 5% (\u03b1=0.05) that you very often see in statistic courses or textbooks is the threshold used in many fields. With a p-value under that threshold of 5%, we consider that the observations (and thus the test statistic) is too unlikely to happen just by chance if the null hypothesis was true, so the null hypothesis is rejected. With a p-value above that threshold of 5%, we consider that it is not really implausible to face the observations we have if the null hypothesis was true, and we therefore do not reject the null hypothesis.", "Note that I wrote \u201cwe do not reject the null hypothesis\u201d, and not \u201cwe accept the null hypothesis\u201d. This is because it may be the case that the null hypothesis is in fact false, but we failed to prove it with the samples. Suppose the analogy of a suspect accused of murder and we do not know the truth. On the one hand, if we have collected enough evidence that the suspect committed the murder, he is considered guilty: we reject the null hypothesis that he is innocent. On the other hand, if we have not collected enough evidence against the suspect, he is presumed to be innocent although he may in fact have committed the crime: we failed to reject the null hypothesis of him being innocent. We are never sure that he did not committed the crime even if he is released, we just did not find sufficient evidence against the null hypothesis of the suspect being innocent. This is the reason why we do not reject the null hypothesis instead of accepting it, and why you will often read things like \u201cthere is no sufficient evidence in the data to reject the null hypothesis\u201d or \u201cbased on the samples we fail to reject the null hypothesis\u201d.", "The significance level \u03b1, derived from the threshold of 5% mentioned earlier, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in fact true. In this sense, it is an error (of 5%) that we accept to deal with, in order to be able to draw conclusions. If we would accept no error (an error of 0%), we would not be able to draw any conclusion about the population(s) since we only have access to a limited portion of the population(s) via the sample(s). As a consequence, we will never be 100% sure when interpreting the result of a hypothesis test unless we have access to the data for the entire population, but then there is no reason to do a hypothesis test anymore since we can simply compare the two populations. We usually allow this error (called Type I error) to be 5%, but in order to be a bit more certain when concluding that we reject the null hypothesis, the alpha level can also be set to 1% (or even to 0.1% in some rare cases).", "To sum up what you need to remember about p-value and significance level \u03b1:", "This applies to all statistical tests without exception. Of course, the null and alternative hypotheses change depending on the test.", "A rule of thumb is that, for most hypothesis tests, the alternative hypothesis is what you want to test and the null hypothesis is the status quo. Take this with extreme caution (!) because, even if it works for all versions of the Student\u2019s t-test it does not apply to ALL statistical tests. For example, when testing for normality, you usually want to test whether your distribution follows a normal distribution. Following this piece of advice, you would write the alternative hypothesis H1: the distribution follows a normal distribution. Nonetheless, for normality tests such as the Shapiro-Wilk or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, it is the opposite; the alternative hypothesis is H1: the distribution does not follow a normal distribution. So for every test, make sure to use the correct hypotheses, otherwise the conclusion and interpretation of your test will be wrong.", "For the second scenario, suppose the data below. Moreover, suppose that the two samples are independent, that the variances in both populations are unknown but equal and that we would like to test whether population 1 is larger than population 2.", "Unlike the previous scenario, the two boxes do not overlap which illustrates that the two samples are different from each other.

See more details and examples in this article.", "As for many statistical tests, there are some assumptions that need to be met in order to be able to interpret the results.

Thanks for reading it. I hope this article helped you to understand how the different versions of the Student\u2019s t-test for two samples work and how to perform them by hand and in R. If you are interested, here is a Shiny app to perform these tests by hand easily (you just need to enter your data and select the appropriate version of the test thanks to the sidebar menu).", "Moreover, I invite you to read:", "As always, if you have a question or a suggestion related to the topic covered in this article, please add it as a comment so other readers can benefit from the discussion.
