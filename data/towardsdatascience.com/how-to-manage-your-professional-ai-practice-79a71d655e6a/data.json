(Here\u2019s a dated but still applicable PwC report.) This is in large parts due to modern management theories about functional departmentalization (yes, it\u2019s a real word), which separates key organizational activities into groups of specialized teams.", "Data science just happens to be becoming as valuable to an organization as a functional IT team, or a proper HR department. The professional industry that is appearing from applied data science is slowly separating between organizational departments, similar to accounting and IT, and consulting, which provides strategy and implementation services. If we compare the future of the data science team to these two specific departments, we get a good sense of what the industry will look like in a few years.", "For instance, within these departments there are usually procedural teams (bookkeeping and IT support), management teams (accountants and IT directors), and strategy teams (CFOs and CTOs). This is very analogous to data entry specialists, data scientists and machine learning engineers, and Chief Data Officers.", "So if you\u2019re trying to offer AI/ML consulting services, how should you position your professional practice? Here is a simple review and some recommendations on improving the professionalism of your firm, or better structuring your AI team within it for maximum client value delivery.", "Just like there are external auditors and security assessment firms for these two departments, there are also strategic consulting needs in the market right now for providing guidance and advice on direction. What to build next is more important than how to build it, which means that AI consulting is shifting from skill to guidance. (Here\u2019s the 2020 O\u2019Reilly report of Enterprise AI adoption.)", "This shift from tactical to strategic is where high-level value can be requested from clients, but is only valid if your capacity to provide advice from knowledge, experience, and wisdom. Did you implement similar solutions in the past? Do you have tried-and-true solution patterns that can be explored, even if the data is different? What about battle scars and lessons learned? All of these will come up in client conversations.", "What does it take to start and run a successful AI consultancy these days? Well, to call yourself an AI consulting firm, a self-given title is really all it takes right now. However, to be a trustworthy and legitimate consulting firm, you need to build credibility and justification as to why people should trust you with their AI needs. That\u2019s where marketing positioning comes in.", "Let\u2019s go through a thought exercise here: if you weren\u2019t running an AI shop, and instead were just running a generic consultancy, how would you run your shop? How would you package your services into repeatable processes?", "In his book Managing the Professional Services Firm, David Maister refers to the three main types of marketing strategies professional service firms tend to rely on: expertise, experience, and efficiency. These strategies are very applicable to AI consulting, and may reveal a bit of accidental (or intentional) misdirection from the Big Boys.", "Expertise says \u201cWe are skilled. We are capable. We have pedigree.\u201d This is the main go to approach for an AI shop. Why wouldn\u2019t you show the list of PhD\u2019s that you have on staff?", "The issue with relying only on expertise is that you can\u2019t bulldoze your patents and publications to a statement of work. You have to show the potential client that you can solve their problem. Applicability trumps elegance. By emphasizing the specificity of your research and credentials to your client\u2019s clearly defined problems, you will be able to showcase candidate solutions, and therefore move to contract.", "Experience, on the other hand, says \u201cWe have seen it all. We have battle scars so you don\u2019t have to. We have stories.\u201d (This is the main category of larger or older firms.)", "Experience is a double-edged sword in the world of AI consulting. Yes, people are relying on you to recommend solution architectures and key model selections for early prototyping, but things change quickly in the world of devops, and a lot faster in the world of AI. What makes your experience from 10 years ago still relevant today?", "You have to focus on the constants that you know well on the client side. KPIs. Delivery schedules. Maintenance and support clauses. The strong foundations of client engagement needs to be your bread and butter. A lot of solution options are valid and open for experimentation if the problem is well defined.", "Professionalism is what will get you across the finish line.", "Finally, efficiency signals the following: \u201cWe can optimize. We can streamline. We can tweak. We can make it for cheaper.\u201d", "Efficiency usually comes in when a system is already in production, or when a client has at least a baseline of implementation. At a minimum, Efficiency firms tend to need strong guardrails provided by the client to succeed on a given engagement. We usually see these teams perform more of the data consolidation efforts (acquisition, cleansing and pre-processing) and other clearly scoped activities (UI/UX, data warehousing, and webscraping).", "If you\u2019re an Efficiency team, do one thing and be the best at it.", "These different areas of focus are applicable at different points in time in a client engagement. You wouldn\u2019t use Efficiency as the main motivator for ideation and prototyping, just like you wouldn\u2019t rely solely on Expertise for basic ETL jobs. Each approach has its place and time.", "You want to understand your own unique offering in the context of a very noisy market. Find a near-desert island, make it your own, then grow to another one.", "To compare where you might be with the incumbents, let\u2019s look at popular models of AI consulting marketing.", "Already large and established consulting firms decided to launch or acquire a new AI consulting team and put their massive brand on it. This is Experience that\u2019s trying to pretend it\u2019s both Expertise and Efficiency. In reality, AI consulting is so young that no one can really claim that they have \u201cdone it\u201d for years.", "(Note: If you are one of these large firms, please tell your audit branch to check out our sister company AuditMap.ai, because no one likes to read thousands of internal audit reports.)", "This is a clear Expertise signal. This is where AWS, Azure, IBM and Google provide a ton of APIs and solutions for people and organizations to consume.", "Do you need to compete with some of the largest companies in the world? Well, you\u2019re in luck! These firms are in no way motivated by professional services \u2014 they don\u2019t want to provide those services, but they have to. In fact, they have extensive partnership programs (like APN and PartnerWorld) for the sole purpose of offloading pro services. They make their money by continuous consumption of their resources and APIs, not through consulting.", "You might need to go through the wringer of applying to each of these channels, but you\u2019ll come out the other end with badges of legitimacy.", "This is a hybrid model where a small, focused team that started building a solution and is still trying to find product market fit will offer consulting services in the same space as their product is trying to serve.", "If you\u2019re trying to hone in on your product market fit while at the same time generating revenue (FYI, this is a sweet spot for seed investors), this is a solid approach to ensure you build a solid product.", "However, if consulting is your only source of revenue through this channel, then your services are really only as good as your product. And that could be a difficult game to win.", "Back when we started our firm, AI consulting was still a lawless wasteland of wizardry and urban legends. Since then, a lot of professionalism is expected from clients, similar to any other consulting industry.", "If you\u2019re a smaller team, there are a few glimmers of hope that I can offer you:", "In terms of how to position your services, we notice that we have three main types of engagement formats.", "This is where your classic advisory services come in. Feasibility studies, brainstorming sessions and AI roadmaps are all valid deliverables. The premise behind this type of engagement is that even before a client can take their next step, they need to know in which direction that next step should be.", "This type of sale is a bit more difficult because the client effectively gets a report, and that\u2019s not the sexy, sexy AI that the management team was promised.", "Where we\u2019ve gotten a lot of success with this type of engagement is by providing a recommendation list of candidate projects. Each one of these projects is assessed against known risks, timelines, resource requirements, costs, and anything else that you should know before engaging. And that type of clarity is hard to come by.", "I can say without a doubt that this is by far the most fun type of engagement that we have.", "Every engagement is goal driven, and is divided into data science, machine learning engineering, and deployment. This is the most well-known approach to AI consulting, where a client defines a problem, and a consultant or team builds a solution to solve that problem.", "However, if you do this professionally, often times a lot of the research needs to be performed beforehand, even before the statement of work is signed. be ready to invest in research to close the sale.", "The often forgotten aspect of artificial intelligence consulting is that the final models need to reside somewhere that\u2019s not on your laptop.", "If you build a model for a client, there are deployment readiness concerns that you don\u2019t think about in the lab. What\u2019s the latency with a million concurrent users? What about edge cases? Security? Storage? Automatic model switchovers?", "This aspect of AI consulting requires a blend of devops, ML engineering, and business comprehension, because there will be some design decisions that need to be taken before you launch your product \u2014 because you can\u2019t do a hard reset once it\u2019s live.", "Where we started making a name for ourselves is in our ability to connect AI to the fundamental business case of our clients. We have executed some tough projects (as our clutch.co profile can attest to), but a lot of our success was in our ability to walk our client through the long-term strategic deployment of the solution. Who\u2019s going to own the project after were gone? How should they lower costs?", "It\u2019s important to remember that in any crowded market there will be commoditization.", "Multiple times a week Dan and I receive emails about new data science teams out in Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific, and even South America. Their prices are beyond competitive, and there\u2019s no way that we can beat them on a generic offering. But that\u2019s only valid if clients are looking for a generic offering.", "It\u2019s important to remember that in the world of AI consulting, artificial intelligence is less of a coded program, and more of a promise of a better tomorrow. If you can speak your client\u2019s language, you have the advantage to make them see a better tomorrow. And that\u2019s why they\u2019ll keep coming back to you.", "If you have additional questions about this article or our AI consulting framework, feel free to reach out by LinkedIn or by email.", "Your home for data science.
