They help visualize variation, find and correct problems when they occur, predict expected ranges of outcomes and analyze patterns of process variation from special or common causes. Quality control charts are often used in Lean Six Sigma projects and DMAIC projects under the control phase and are considered as one of the seven basic quality tools for process improvement.", "The DPMO (Defects per Million Opportunities) chart represents one of the newer attributes control charts used to track dpmo values when defect opportunities is much greater than one. DPMO charts were developed for electronics manufacturing environments as a way to evaluate processes which produce multiple, highly complex products.", "Once the total number of defects has been obtained from each sample, the following calculations are required to build the DPMO chart:", "The following control lines are included in the dpmo chart to help determining if the process is under statistical control:", "For the following example, let\u2019s build a dpmo chart for a microelectronic component where defects were obtained for 40 samples of 10 units each, where each unit had 2,751 defect opportunities. Let\u2019s take a look at the Python code!", "According the dpmo chart above, the process seems to be under statistical control since none of dpmo points exceed the upper control limit. Even for 3 out of the 40 samples (i.e. samples 25, 31 and 32) no defects were found. Considering that the dpmo average for this example was around 115 dpmo, the process \u03c3 (i.e. measure of the variation in the process relative to customer requirements expressed as a number of standard deviations on a normal distribution) is close to 5.30.", "Quality control charts represent great tools for analyzing processes stability and obtaining significant statistical information to be used during Lean Six Sigma and DMAIC projects for process improvement. Quality and industrial engineers must be capable of interpreting them accurately to identify undesirable trends that could lead to potential nonconformities in order to take preventive actions rather than corrective actions, and thus, reduce scrap and waste.", "This guide covers step-by-step tutorial on how to build a DPMO chart from scratch using multiple Python libraries. Taking into consideration its high popularity among professionals and academics, Python represents a great tool capable of building quality control charts for statistical purposes. While there are other programs and software available where they can be built as well (e.g. Minitab, R, Microsoft Excel), it is up to quality and industrial engineers to decide which one to use based on their coding and analytical skills while complying with the organization\u2019s objectives and the customers\u2019 specifications.", "If you found this article useful, feel welcome to download my personal code on GitHub.
