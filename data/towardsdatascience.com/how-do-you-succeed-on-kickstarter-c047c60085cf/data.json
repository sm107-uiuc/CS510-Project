If so, then showcasing your idea on a funding platform can improve your chances of making your idea a reality. One such platform is Kickstarter, where imaginative, innovative, and ambitious projects are brought to life through the support of others, who are referred to as backers.", "Backers pledge to projects through funding not only to help make them happen but also to support a creative process. Project creators thank their backers\u2019 support by offering unique rewards, which consist of sharing part of the project to the backer community such as limited editions or discounts.", "The first time I heard about this platform was when I clicked on an ad for a future language learning app called MagicLingua. The link got me to the Kickstarter page for this app, which consisted of learning a foreign by speaking rather than typing. Anyway, by the time it launched 420 backers pledged \u20ac53051 to help make this project happen. This app is available in the app store and has a website. Right now I am learning German through this app, and I kind of wish I was a backer.", "While many projects look exciting for backers to bring to life, there are also projects that end up not happening. In general, surprisingly, more Kickstarter projects fail than succeed. Why? Some of the reasons include: they do not hit their target, they do not meet their goals, and they do not attain the money they need to move forward. This does not necessarily mean that your idea would actually end up falling. On the bright side, the projects that do hit their targets raised from hundreds to thousands to millions of dollars. Moreover, you can develop a campaign to bring you success as long as you learn from others who succeeded or failed.", "In order to understand Kickstarter project outcome, I used the platform\u2019s project data to explore effects on backers as well as project goals. The data used for this analysis covers 378661 projects from 2009 to 2018 and 19 variables. The variables include the project name, primary category, secondary category, country, deadline, launch date, pledged amount, number of backers, project state (outcome), goal, and country. This post will focus on the following questions:", "1\u2014 Which project categories are more likely to succeed?", "2 \u2014What is the association between project outcome and fundraising goals?", "3 \u2014 Which categories are popular among backers and, among those, which subcategories highly fall behind their goal?", "Part 1: Which project categories are more likely to succeed?", "The data has two category variables \u2014 main category and secondary category. For this part, I\u2019ll focus on the main category since it has fewer levels. The most frequent categories are film & video, music, publishing, games, and technology.", "Given that projects succeed less frequently, there are some categories that succeed more often. These main categories are comics, theater, and dance projects. Comics have a success probability of 0.53, as dance projects have 0.61, and theater projects have 0.6. If your project ideas fall under these three categories, you might have good luck. The other categories, on the other hand, have significantly higher chances of failing, especially journalism, technology, and food projects.", "Looking back at figure 2, comics, theater, and dance projects are among the least frequent on Kickstarter data, which pretty much explains why these categories have higher success probabilities. Moreover, there are further reasons why the more frequent categories end up with significantly lower success probabilities. Factors that will be explored ahead include project fundraising goals, number of backers, etc.", "Part 2: How does the fundraising goal contribute to project success?", "One of the most common reasons that projects fail in Kickstarter is that they have funding goals that aim too high. The platform\u2019s funding process consists of an all-or-nothing model \u2014 if a project does not reach its goal, the funds do not get collected nor transferred from backers\u2019 bank accounts. This is convenient for backers to pledge their amounts for a project with the confidence that it succeeds.", "So, if the pledged amount exceeds a goal, then it most likely succeeded. Otherwise, it most likely doesn\u2019t go forward. According to Kickstarter data, approximately 36% of projects met their fundraising goals from 2009 to 2017.", "For projects that met their goal, 98% succeeded, 1.2% were undefined, and less than 1% got canceled or suspended. For projects that did not, on the other hand, 16% were canceled, 82.7% failed, and less than 1% were suspended or undefined. Therefore, we can see that the goal amount compared to the pledged amount is also an indicator of project success. This variable can be referred to as \u201cgoal outcome.\u201d Now, let\u2019s take a look at how these two outcomes compare in terms of goal amount.", "According to figure 5, the bar chart on the left implies that successful projects tend to have steady annual averages with small confidence intervals at the top of each bar, which indicates little variability in estimation. These estimates also imply that to be successful, creators tend to set goals that give their audience not just inspiration, but also confidence that they are attainable.", "Unsuccessful projects, on the other hand, contain yearly averages that reflect a bell-shaped curve. The chart on the right contains wider confidence intervals, unlike its counterpart on the left. Broken down by year, annual goals tend to show higher variability, meaning that these goals vary highly from close to zero to the thousands to the millions to the hundreds of millions of dollars. With that in mind, how many people would pledge to a project costing over $100 million while the most highest goal for a successful project was merely $2 million?", "Based on the charts above, the probability of project success decreases as the funding goal increases. Therefore, no matter how exciting your project looks, you want to try to reach out to as many people as possible during your planning stages, especially if you have to raise close to $1 million. Backers are willing to pledge if you have good progress, depending on your deadline.", "Part 3: Which categories are popular among backers and, among those, which subcategories highly fall behind their goal?", "Switching gears to another major contributor to project success is the number of backers. Backers pledge to contribute to projects for several reasons including support for a friend's project, support a new effort from someone they admire, inspired by the ideas in the project, and motivation by a project\u2019s rewards. Backing a project is not like purchasing a product, rather, it\u2019s pledging support to creative ideas that they wish for them to come to life in the real world.", "When it comes to goal outcome, project categories show different backer distributions where more successful projects have significantly more backers than less successful projects. Specifically, we can see darker spots in the heatmap below in some of the categories that succeeded.", "Relatively, projects that are games typically have an average of 807 backers besides 716 in technology, and 609 in design. More interesting, this category order is almost the same when it comes to failed projects, game projects have an average of 47 backers besides 33 in design, and 21 in technology projects.", "The pledged amount has a strong linear relationship with the number of backers \u2014 the more backers, the higher the pledged amount. Therefore, an interesting follow-up question is: by how much did subcategories miss or exceed their goals among the three main categories? In other words, how did the funding difference between the pledged amount and goal amount compare relative to project subcategories? The funding difference is calculated by subtracting the project goal amount from the pledged amount (pledged amount-goal amount). This difference is negative for unsuccessful projects and positive for successful projects. Moreover, these measures how much did projects missed or exceeded their goal, depending on their outcome.", "Looking at games, technology, and design categories, the bar charts below show average funding differences by subcategory and goal outcomes. For game projects, four out of eight subcategories stand out. On average, live games missed their goals by around $208,969 while gaming hardware and videogames both missed by about $90,062 and $83,939 respectively. Gaming hardware, on the other hand, exceeded its goal by $130,492 as tabletop games and videogames exceeded their goals by $45854 and $38552 respectively.", "For technology subcategories, the most interesting one is space exploration, which fell behind on its goals by $895,744 as robots only fell behind by $109043. On the positive side, the subcategories that exceeded their goals the most include 3D printing, camera equipment, fabrication tools, wearables, and sound projects.", "And, for design projects, two subcategories that fall behind their goals the most are architecture and civic design projects. Architecture projects, on average, fall behind by $547,242 while civic design ones fell by $229,955. The subcategories that seemingly exceeded their goals were product design, general design, and typography projects.", "Average exceeding or falling amounts gives an idea of how subcategories perform financially as well as how expensive those projects can be. Also, this analysis puts together goals, backers, and pledged amounts. So, if your project involves space exploration, be wary that it would be extremely difficult to reach your goal. However, it would be less difficult if your project is architecture, civic design, or live games. Since game projects are the most popular, gaming hardware and tabletop games would be very cool to showcase in Kickstarter.", "In this article, we took three different aspects of Kickstarter project success through data analysis on its historical projects.", "These observational findings can give you a basic idea of how Kickstarter works as well as whether a potential idea you have in mind can succeed in the platform.", "The code used for this analysis can be found here.", "Your home for data science.
