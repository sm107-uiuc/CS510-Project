The analysts needed their computers booted, so the dashboard was ready when they arrived.", "Huh? Why did we have to ask the admin about an issue with the analyst\u2019s dashboard? First, the good news. The analyst really liked the new dashboard. Now, the bad news. It was not broken (in their mindset) and the analysts trusted us to take it away or break the frame.
