It\u2019s known as the credit assignment problem and researchers are struggling to figure this out, they try to develop some kind of reasoning for the algorithms and so far no luck. But are we, humans, any better? Do we really know why we make such decisions and why we act this way?", "Let\u2019s try to work it out. This is the third part of the series on what\u2019s inspired RL and let\u2019s dive right into it.", "\u201cThere is no avoidance in delay.\u201d\u2014 Aeschylus.", "The credit assignment problem shines in the field of RL. Simplified, during training an agent many times asks himself \u201cwhat exactly did I do to end up here?\u201d. That\u2019s how he learns actually, he\u2019s catching the glimpse of what actions lead to the highest reward. But how to understand what actions were good when there are hundreds of them and you get a reward only in the end? And when there are hundreds of thousands and no one gives you the reward, as it happens for us, people?", "In reinforcement learning, there is a technique called eligibility traces and as you may have guessed, it was inspired by the studies of animals.", "Pavlov pointed out that stimulus has to leave a trace in the nervous system and eligibility traces are much like stimulus traces in our brain. It\u2019s rather difficult to think of a good example but let\u2019s imagine your whole life. What can you say about your early childhood? Nothing really much as the memories fade away the older you get, right?", "To picture it, let\u2019s imagine that you\u2019re living in \u0336 \u0336F\u0336l\u0336a\u0336t\u0336l\u0336a\u0336n\u0336d\u0336 \u0336 Gridland. The whole life for you is just moving from the bottom left cell, where you were born, to the top right, where you\u2019re going to die.", "Memories of your early life are fading as you\u2019re approaching the end but you still can recall at least something. That is your unique experience, that is the accumulation of our knowledge with only the most important parts, that is why you\u2019re special, and that\u2019s what eligibility traces are.", "On biological level, after an action is done and a reward is received, synapses, the connection between neurons in our brain, have those temporary stimulus traces which are decaying with the time passing. So when reinforcement is introduced, for instance, applause after a good speech, our brain gives more credit for the recent actions because for the current success of your speech it doesn\u2019t really matter what T-short you wore when you were a child.", "We\u2019re going to explore neuroscience later on in this series so stay tuned.", "But how is it related to the delayed reinforcement? People can work for days to get a single salary and for years to get promoted but our memory tells us what we did to achieve this. The same is with RL agent, eligibility traces are his memory and they tell him what actions to repeat to get a reward.", "There are many more ways to deal with the credit assignment problem but this one is the most \u201chuman\u201d. If you\u2019re interested, I highly recommend reading the paper on AlphaZero. It shows how computers use their perfect memory approaching the credit assignment problem.", "\u201cMap-making had never been a precise art on the Discworld. People tended to start off with good intentions and then get so carried away with the spouting whales, monsters, waves and other twiddly bits of cartographic furniture that the often forgot to put the boring mountains and rivers in at all.\u201d \u2014 Terry Pratchett, Moving Pictures", "What we have not talked about yet are model-free and model-based algorithms. This time it\u2019s not about models like machine learning models but models of environments, which are all the transitions between states, all the rewards and actions that lead to those rewards. This is very important and you should not be confused by those terms.", "With model-free ones your agent doesn\u2019t really know anything about an environment he\u2019s in. He gets all the dynamics of the world in the process of training by trial and error (or by the Law of Effect if you\u2019ve read my previous article).", "On the other hand, with model-based algorithms, the agent has all the information about the world either from the beginning or he can learn it during his interaction with the world. So he kinda has a map of the environment, see where I\u2019m going?", "This knowledge of transitions is very similar to cognitive maps, which for us, humans, are the accumulation of life experience, education and other knowledge. They are formed subconsciously on a daily basis in order to reduce memory usage, enhance recall and learning. But, of course, it\u2019s possible to apply them on purpose using technique like mind maps, memory palace and many more. Read on mnemonics if you\u2019re keen on about it.", "Experiments on rats in 1940s by psychologist Edward Tolman show that rats are capable of forming a latent representation of a maze they run through and that\u2019s very much relatable to RL agents. With model-free algorithms an agent, as well as a rat, has to figure out the transitions of the environment or, in our new terms, create a cognitive map of it. Catching the grasp of what happens in the world helps him to perform better.", "So once again, a model of an environment is all the transitions inside that environment. The transitions are optimized and serve a specific goal, much like cognitive maps. Those transitions can be learned by the agent himself (model-free algorithms) or be given to him (model-based algorithms), he can either draw a map or buy it.", "\u201cShe generally gave herself very good advice, though she very seldom followed it.\u201d \u2014 Lewis Carroll, Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland", "The distinction between model-free and model-based reinforcement learning algorithms corresponds to the distinction psychologists make between habitual and goal-directed behavioral patterns. Habits are behavior patterns triggered by appropriate stimuli and then performed more-or-less automatically. Goal-directed behavior, according to how psychologists use the phrase, is purposeful in the sense that it is controlled by knowledge of the value of goals and the relationship between actions and their consequences.", "Let\u2019s look at the example. Here we have a maze runner who is trying to escape a maze and also get rich.", "Model-free algorithms rely on experience obtained by many trials. Using his extra lives our runner figured the maze after a couple of attempts and now knows what to do. We may even say that he learned a habit for this maze.", "With model-based algorithms, as now we know, the runner has a map of the maze. By looking at it, he plans his moves to get the biggest treasure and runs for it. And here we\u2019d say that using the knowledge of transitions and applying step-by-step planning the runner behaves goal-directly.", "Now let\u2019s change the maze a bit. We\u2019ll swap places the biggest treasure and the death room.", "If the runner is applying a model-free algorithm, he\u2019ll die because he was trained on a different environment and in a way overfitted on it. To solve this changed maze he once again needs to spend some more time learning by trial and error and exploring this brave new world.", "But it\u2019s not the case with model-based algorithms. The runner will be given a map of the changed maze and will easily find the treasure. That is the relation between habitual and goal-directed behaviors and model-free and model-based algorithms. We, humans, however, do not have a discrete map of the world, figuratively speaking, so we apply our cognitive maps (understanding of what happens around) for planning and acting but this doesn\u2019t matter that we only behave goal-directly.", "Experiments on rats conducted by Christopher Adams in 1982 shows that rats placed in a chamber with a lever, which when pressed releases a small amount of food, can overtrain and learn a habit of pressing that lever.", "Rats were split into two groups, one group was trained for 100 iterations and the other for 500 iterations. On the second phase, both groups, each time they get food, were injected poison causing nausea, as earlier experiments showed that was supposed to decrease their interest in pressing the lever.", "Non-overtrained rats indeed started to show a devalued rate of lever-pressing meaning that they behave goal-directly. Overtrained rats, in contrast, showed close to no effect, in fact, it made them more vigorous. It\u2019s like they forgot that the food was given of goodwill and were demanding it now.", "This is how the two types of behaviors are linked. After a while a goal-directed behavior becomes habitual. This reminds me of me similar moments in our life, when we start to take things for granted: money, health, food and even people we love.", "We\u2019re the smartest beings on Earth, yet we are not able to evaluate most of our actions. We give advice and lecture others, yet don\u2019t know what to do ourselves. We say we\u2019re focused on our goals and punish agents for bad habits, yet every day we do stupid things. And yet we manage in the most complex environment ever while computers are only capable of playing games.
