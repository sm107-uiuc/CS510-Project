This is employed in the case of a classification algorithm to ascertain/evaluate the performance of your model.", "We start with a development dataset while building any statistical or ML model. Divide that dataset into 2 parts: Training and Test. Keep aside the test dataset and train the model using the training dataset. Once the model is ready to predict, we try making predictions on the test dataset. And once we segment the results into a matrix similar to as shown in the above figure, we can see how much our model is able to predict right and how much of its predictions are wrong.", "We populate the 4 cells as shown in the picture above with the numbers from our test dataset(having 1000 observations for instance).", "These 4 cells constitute the \u201cConfusion matrix\u201d as in the matrix which can alleviate all the confusion about the goodness of our model by painting a clear picture of our model\u2019s predictive power.", "A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or \u201cclassifier\u201d) on a set of test data for which the true values are known.", "A type 1 error is also known as a false positive and occurs when a classification model incorrectly predicts a true outcome for an originally false observation.", "For example: Let\u2019s suppose our logistic model is working on a spam-not spam email use case. If our model is labeling an otherwise important email as spam then this is an example of Type I error by our model. In this particular problem statement, we are sensitive towards reducing the Type I error as much as possible because important emails going into the spam email can have serious repercussions.", "A type II error is also known as a false negative and occurs when a classification model incorrectly predicts a false outcome for an originally true observation.", "For example: Let\u2019s suppose our logistic model is working on a use case where it has to predict if a person has cancer or not. If our model labels a person having cancer as a healthy person and misclassifies it, then this is an example of Type II error by our model. In this particular problem statement, we are very sensitive towards reducing the Type II error as much as possible because false negatives in this scenario may lead to death if the disease goes on to be undiagnosed in an affected person.", "Now, the above three metrics discussed are General-purpose metrics irrespective of the kind of training and test data that you have and the kind of classification algorithm you have deployed for your problem statements.", "We are now moving towards discussing the metrics which are well suited for a particular type of data.", "Let\u2019s start talking about Accuracy here, this is a metric that is best used for a balanced dataset. Refer to the diagram below which is sourced from this medium article.", "As you can see, a balanced dataset is one where the 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s, yes\u2019s and no\u2019s, positive and negatives are equally represented by the training data. On the other hand, if the ratio of the two class-labels is skewed then our model will get biased towards one category.", "Assuming we have a Balanced dataset, let\u2019s learn what is Accuracy.", "Accuracy is the proximity of measurement results to the true value. It tell us how accurate our classification model is able to predict the class labels given in the problem statement.", "For example: Let\u2019s suppose that our classification model is trying to predict for customer attrition scenario. In the image above, Out of the total 700 actually attrited customers (TP+FN), the model was correctly able to classify 500 attrited customers correctly (TP). Similarly, out of the total of 300 retained customers (FP+TN), the model was correctly able to classify 200 retained customers correctly (TN).", "In the above scenario, we see that the accuracy of the model on the test dataset of 1000 customers is 70%.", "Now, we learned that Accuracy is a metric that should be used only for a balanced dataset. Why is that so? Let\u2019s look at an example to understand that.", "In this example, this model was trained on an imbalanced dataset and even the test dataset is imbalanced. The Accuracy metric has a score of 72% which might give us the impression that our model is doing a good job at the classification. But, look closer, this model is doing a terrible job out of predicting the Negative class labels. It only predicted 20 correct outcomes out of 100 total negative label observations. This is why the Accuracy metric should not be used if you have an imbalanced dataset.", "This post was focused on understanding the Confusion matrix in its entirety.", "If you would like to know more about other metrics that can be used to evaluate a classification model like Recall, Precision, AUC-ROC, etc., you can refer to my following exhaustive article on this topic.", "Keep watching this space for more on Data Science, Machine Learning and Statistics!", "Your home for data science.
