But alongside this is the importance of soft skills in a data science role\u00b2. To be truly effective a data scientist should possess strong communication skills; be able to negotiate and persuade stakeholders; and ultimately lead projects and teams to success, in a range of commercial or industrial environments.", "This motivated me to compile a list of book recommendations for burgeoning data scientists to consider reading as part of their personal development. In my growing responsibilities to coach and lead project teams, I realised that although data scientists are generally very conscientious about their continuous development, they often focus heavily on the technical skills of the role and neglect to balance this with dedicated learnings on the softer skills side. I\u2019ve found it very rewarding to incorporate soft skills learning into my personal development plan, to strengthen my commercial awareness and understanding of how businesses, and more importantly people, operate. And I have encouraged that these learnings be picked up in the projects and teams that I have helped lead, with great effect.", "In these recommendations, I summarise the key data science learnings from each book that can be put into practice in the role. I focus on the books I think most strongly complement each other to round-out the many soft skills an effective data scientist should hold, gathered from my experiences growing from a Junior role to Senior role and as the Tech Lead on a variety of projects.", "This was the first \u2018self help\u2019 book I read when I transitioned into a data science role, and it was an excellent introduction to the effectiveness of personal development.", "Recommended for: anyone who has ever experienced imposter syndrome!", "Main message: recognise the cause of your worries, then rationalise them and form a plan to conquer them.", "Key learnings for data scientists: when worrying about project briefs, code bugs, presentations to stakeholders, etc. it\u2019s helpful to identify and mitigate the risks, so that you / your team / your stakeholders can be assured things are understood and under control.", "Fave quote: \u201cDecide just how much anxiety a thing may be worth \u2014 and refuse to give it any more.\u201d", "After enjoying Dale Carnegie\u2019s writing style I next read his book on influencing people, which is itself top-ranked as a highly influential book (so meta)! Don\u2019t let the title put you off: the advice is rooted in being your most authentic self, with a focus on interpersonal skills and the importance of empathy.", "Recommended for: sociopaths (j/k!) anyone looking to become more empathetic or personable.", "Main message: be sincere, honest, positive and humble when engaging others, treating them with genuine interest and respect.", "Key learnings for data scientists: various projects and teams will bring together a diverse range of people whom it is important to empathise with to understand their motivations and behaviours so you can bring them on a journey of building an ideal solution, which may or may not align with their initial expectations.", "Fave quote: \u201cThe only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.\u201d", "Great book to become aware of the differences between our conscious and unconscious thought processes.", "Recommended for: those who want to bring more reasoning and deliberation into their actions and behaviours.", "Main message: by recognising our \u2018fast\u2019 and \u2018slow\u2019 ways of thinking, we can better control the use of logic in our decision making and reduce any overconfidence that stems from emotion or unconscious bias.", "Key learnings for data scientists: in the various engagements with people across DS projects it\u2019s useful to understand how both your and their decision-making happens since not everyone involved will think in the same way, so you should tailor your approach to the situation and engage \u2018slow\u2019 thinking where necessary.", "Fave quote: \u201cHe had an impression, but some of his impressions are illusions.\u201d", "Introduces seven approaches for being effective at attaining your goals, especially when working with others.", "Recommended for: those in project management, team leadership, or a consultancy role.", "Main message: how to move from dependence to independence (self-mastery) and interdependence (working effectively with others).", "Key learnings for data scientists: the effective prioritisation of tasks is demonstrated through measures of urgency and importance (priority matrix of \u201cdo\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201cdelegate\u201d or \u201celiminate\u201d), which is useful for breaking down requests from stakeholders so you can focus on the most valuable parts. Methods to \u201csynergize\u201d a team are outlined to help ensure data scientists are aligned to the same goals and work positively towards them, relying on effective leadership to ensure a \u201cwin-win\u201d situation.", "Fave quote: \u201cSeek first to understand, then to be understood.\u201d", "A condensed version of the typical lessons covered in an MBA program. It highlights key aspects of business education and strategies with examples.", "Recommended for: those with limited business background or training, especially if now working with businesspeople or in a commercial setting.", "Main message: the thinking behind effective strategies and decision-making throughout a business model; from evaluating the market and measuring value to building a product and managing uncertainty.", "Key learnings for data scientists: stakeholders, higher management, and 3rd party providers or consultants, will all usually have a stronger foundation and background in business than a data scientist. To understand their motivations and essentially speak their language in order to gain their trust, it\u2019s crucial to study business theory; covering forms of value creation & delivery, marketing, finance, psychology, and the function of business models and systems.", "Fave quote: \u201cWhere there\u2019s hassle, there\u2019s opportunity.\u201d \u2014 (Hassle Premium)", "A method for improving your productivity through effective note taking and to-do lists.", "Recommended for: anyone who struggles to keep track of their ever-growing to-do list.", "Main message: using a simple written system of symbols and rules for recording actions, events and notes, you can improve your productivity.", "Key learnings for data scientists: work in tech tends to be fast paced, with various dynamic requests from the business, so it\u2019s important to manage this on a daily level \u2014 which is where the bullet journal method can help. A data scientist might wear many hats in one day, compiling various to-do lists that it\u2019s useful to then order and prioritise, so you know what to action now, schedule for the future, or just eliminate if unimportant (see \u201c7 habits\u2026\u201d above).", "Fave quote: \u201cTrack the past, order the present, design the future.\u201d", "The following books hold a variety of logic, reasoning and insight on the softer side of data science & biz-tech skills.", "These are a fascinating read that show how economics is at the root of so many parts of society, highlighting its importance and influence.", "The psychology of people in society is explored through examples of economics at play in business, marketing, strategy and innovation.", "These books highlight how the ability to think creatively and act on innovation are what current tech companies thrive on and seek to add/grow in their employ.", "These books introduce aspects of good leadership, from having good self-awareness and an appropriate mindset to be able to influence people in a positive and productive manner.", "These are some great reads on the use of maths & stats to help understand the behaviours of people and society, how we misunderstand and misjudge our biases, and how to better use probabilities to inform our decisions and the way we evaluate risk and the predictability of outcomes.", "Last, but by no means least, are some books about the importance of a positive and happy mindset; which is a good balance to have in the biz-tech industry because, as much as we work with logic and metrics and efficiency measures, we are not robots and should always invest in our mental health and wellbeing.", "I\u2019m curious and interested in anyone\u2019s further recommendations on biz-tech., leadership or soft skills resources for data scientists. These and other resources are gathered at my datascienceunicorn.com blog\u00b3. Please hit me up!", "P.S. As I\u2019ve compiled this list I\u2019ve realised the dominance of male authors in it and have made a mental note to seek out more female-authored books in these areas.
