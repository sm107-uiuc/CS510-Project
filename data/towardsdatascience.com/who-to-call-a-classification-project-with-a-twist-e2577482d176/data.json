Who should we contact to maximise revenue?\u201d", "In this scenario, Bank XYZ had on-boarded 2000 new customers through acquiring a smaller bank but due to resourcing and budget constraints, only 500 of these could be contacted. Using data from Bank XYZ\u2019s existing customer base and results of the campaign for its existing customers, my goal was to identify which of the 500 customers to contact to maximise revenue and provide recommendations for future campaigns.", "A successful subscriber translates to revenue for Bank XYZ. Based on domain knowledge, we estimated the value of subscription at $100. In general, we know that uptake for these type of campaigns is small, with the proportion of successful calls around 10\u201315%. As such, by contacting 500 customers randomly, we would expect revenue to be between $5,000 and $7,500.", "However, by using predictive analysis and selecting the 500 customers carefully, we demonstrated that more revenue can be generated for Bank XYZ.", "Spoiler: By using an XGBoost classifier, we were able to increase revenue to $14,500. Read on to find out how.", "I have chosen to keep the explanations high-level but do check out my GitHub repository to view the detailed analysis and code in my Jupyter Notebook. There is also an executive summary presentation for stakeholders.", "The data used for this project is the famous bank marketing dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. My first step was to do a test-train split and separate 2000 entries which will represent the 2000 new customers.", "After this, I was left with just over 39,000 data points and 20 predictive features including:", "The dataset was mostly clean so this step was quicker than expected. There were some missing values in the categorical data denoted by \u2018unknown\u2019. I chose to replace these with the mode in the first instance, and then refined my work by using the K-Nearest Neighbours imputer from sklearninstead.", "As expected, there was a significant class imbalance, with only 11% of customers subscribing to the term deposit. To adjust for this, I used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique.)", "I also explored the rate of subscription amongst various features. An example using the job attribute is shown below.", "Customers who were students or retired were more likely to subscribe to the term deposit.", "Before modelling, it was important to consider how performance would be evaluated.", "A false negative occurs when the model predicts that a customer will not subscribe (target = no) when in fact they would have. This is hugely detrimental, as Bank XYZ would lose out on potential revenue. As such, I needed to ensure the false negatives predicted by our model were minimised. On the other hand, a false positive occurs when the model predicts that a customer will subscribe (target = yes) when in fact they won\u2019t. In this case, we have wasted the cost of a telephone call. In this scenario, false negatives were worse than false positives.", "Accuracy is the most straightforward metric defined simply as the number of correct predictions over the total number of observations. However, consider a no skill model that simply predicted `no` for every customer. This model would achieve an accuracy score of 88% based on imbalanced class distribution. As such a model with high accuracy does not mean a useful or high performing model. Moreover, even if we adjust for class imbalance, accuracy still attributes the same weighting to false positive and false negatives, which isn\u2019t what we want.", "Recall calculates the number of accurate predictions (true positives) out of true observations (true positives and false negatives). I targeted a high recall value, as this minimised false negatives.", "Finally, I defined a specific profit metric, which took into consideration expected revenue and the cost of a call. If you\u2019re interested in that I invited you again to look at the full project on my GitHub.", "We trained the following classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbours, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classification, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost. Without any hyperparameter tuning, the tree-based algorithms were overfitting to the training set. We then tuned our models and applied cross validation using RandomizedSearchCV.", "Based on our profit metric, we selected XGBoost as our best performing model. We further tuned the XGBoost classifier using exhaustiveGridSearchCV to find the optimal hyper-parameter choices.", "With the model selected, I then fit it to the entire training set and generated predictions on the test set. To answer my specific problem I looked at the class probabilities and selected the top 500 data points with highest probability associated to class 1 (subscribing.) These details were given to the marketing team for the campaign.", "It turned out that 145 of the chosen 500 customers did, in fact, subscribe to the term deposit (actual target values) resulting in revenue of $14,500.", "I also investigated feature importances, to see which attributes had the greatest impact on the predictions. The top 5 are as follows:1. number of employees (a quarterly metric which represents economic state)2. consumer confidence index3. whether the customer has a university degree4. whether the customer\u2019s job falls into the admin category5. whether the customer is divorced.", "And there you have it. I hope you found this article interesting. I would encourage you to create hypothetical scenarios in your data science projects as it makes for a more interesting experience.
