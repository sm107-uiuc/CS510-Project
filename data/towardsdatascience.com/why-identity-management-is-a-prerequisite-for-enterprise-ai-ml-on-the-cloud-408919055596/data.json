Mostly, because of valid security concerns. And AI/ML\u2019s voracious appetite for data \u2014 much of it sensitive \u2014 has caused serious conflicts with enterprises\u2019 security posture.", "But the march for AI/Machine Learning on the cloud is seemingly inevitable. How can enterprises reconcile this demand with associated security concerns?", "Some enterprise look to the past. But, unfortunately, older security approaches appear to not work very well. Recent headlines from Capital One\u2019s (and others) data breach seem to have reinforced this point.", "In this article I will describe key considerations for identity-based security that provide the necessary secure foundation to support enterprise AI/Machine Learning on the cloud. By addressing these, security obstacles hindering AI/ML adoption can be mitigated and enterprises can once again accelerate the adoption of AI/ML.", "Today, AI/ML is driving the need for a completely new enterprise data approach \u2014 one that supports volumes of data that are orders of magnitude larger than that of older legacy transactional systems.", "Additionally, the scalability needs required to analyse and train on this volume of data has forced enterprises to move out of the comfortable confines of their relatively secure data centers. Now, only the major cloud platforms can truly provide the cost effective, on-demand, and scalable GPU foundation required for modern AI/ML.", "So, make no mistake, the march towards cloud-based AI/ML is underway.", "In the past, the primary enterprise security was based upon securing a network perimeter. Its goal was to establish an impermeable network barrier around the corporate data center under the premise that with a secure network perimeter, all systems, data, and resources within the data center are secure and can be trusted.", "At the time this made sense since most of applications and assets existed or collaborated almost exclusively inside the data center, thereby making application development, operations, and security management easier.", "Times have definitely changed and now, unfortunately, older techniques used to secure legacy data centers have been found to be based upon a fundamentally flawed assumption, namely, that the network perimeter is in fact secure. But this proven to be a flawed sound assumption when applied to the cloud for a number of reasons.", "Firstly, enemies today are smarter and are acquiring better tools causing network perimeters to seemingly become more become porous. Uber\u2019s recent data breach on the cloud certainly demonstrated this to be the case.", "Second, errors will be made is when enterprise\u2019s secure their cloud tenancy. Unfortunately, all it takes is a single configuration for an endpoint to be compromised allowing an enemy can quickly expand a foothold across a wide swath of the entire network.", "And I would argue that entropy alone \u2014 that security configurations do inevitably drift over time \u2014 is sufficient reason distrust a network-based security perimeter. Perhaps Capital One\u2019s recent experience on the cloud is the most poignant example of this occurrence.", "Lastly, the very nature of the cloud also creates a security issue: by default, many resources are designed to be accessible via the internet upon their creation. This creates a new level of complexity \u2014 providing security for all cloud components \u2014 that most enterprise are not prepared for. And all it takes is one error to cause a potentially catastrophic data breach.", "Enterprise security teams are right to be concerned. These issues are, obviously, a big deal!", "So big, in fact, that I believe it is fair to argue that modern cloud security approaches should now be designed under the explicit assumption that the network perimeter can be breached.", "However, AI/ML practitioners \u2014 Data Scientists \u2014 require vast amounts of sensitive data which exacerbates this issue. Clearly, allowing huge volumes of sensitive data to be persist on the cloud presents very real security risks that must be mitigated.", "Which, not surprisingly, has led to a new security paradigm.", "Today, identity has become the new security perimeter. Put very simply, the identity-based security ensures you are who you say you are, and, only allows you to do what you are permitted to do \u2014 no matter where you are located and no matter your access method.", "Identity-based security states that your identity \u2014 or your credentials associated with your identity \u2014 contain the means for authentication (who you are) and the information related to your authorizations (what you can do). More specifically, application, services, resource, or data cannot be accessed without the appropriate credentials offered by your identity.", "So, with identities becoming the focal point for cloud tenancy security, how should identities be managed? Here are a few key considerations relevant for an enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy.", "Frist, on-prem and cloud directories (for example: Microsoft\u2019s Active Directory or LDAP) should be synchronized (\u201c1\u201d in Figure 1). This allows identities and associated credentials to be managed consistently regardless of where the identity is created or used.", "From a data scientist perspective, this becomes the basis for identity-based approach to securing sensitive AI/ML data while also providing a convenient single sign-on (SSO) experience for accessing both cloud and on-premises resources (which addresses common frustrations of managing multiple IDs and passwords).", "Second, the on-prem instance is the master offering a single authoritative source for identities. This will simplify identity management processes and while also reducing security risks due to human error and configuration complexity.", "RBAC, or role-based-access-control is an approach for governing authorizations. Roles are typically maintained in an enterprise\u2019s identity directory (Active Directory, for example). These roles are used to govern access to resources.", "RBAC works like this (albeit, this is a simplification): Roles (\u201c2\u201d in Figure 1) are typically created to represent job functions; Permissions are assigned to roles to permit various operations to be performed. Then users/employees are typically assigned to groups which are then, in turn, assigned to roles. And voila, the linkage has been established between an identity, a group, a role, and a permission required to access a resource.", "This creates a helpful level of indirection: users are not assigned permissions, but only gain permissions by being a member of a role (\u201c3\u201d in Figure 1). Now, management of user rights is simplified since it only requires assigning appropriate roles to the user/employee\u2019s account.", "Perhaps most importantly, this approach not only provides a prescriptive method of defining data scientist (and other) roles in the organization, but also simplifies authorization management and thereby helps avoid confusion that can lead to errors that create security risks.", "RBAC combined with identity management is commonly referred to as IAM, or identity and access management.", "Let\u2019s assume that sensitive data has been been persisted on the enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy. This data is assigned a resource name (let\u2019s say, \u201cdata resource\u201d) within the enterprise directory. The security team has mandated that \u201cdata read\u201d permission is required to access \u201cdata resource\u201d. This relationship is also maintained in the enterprise directory.", "Continuing our scenario, a \u201cdata scientist\u201d role (\u201c2\u201d in Figure 1) has been established in the enterprise directory indicating that staff assigned this role are anticipated to perform AI/ML functions. Permissions to read the resource (\u201cdata read\u201d) are now added to the role indicating that this role has the ability to perform the appropriate operations against the resource (\u201cdata resource\u201d).", "Now, let\u2019s assume that a new data scientist has joined the enterprise. How are they provided access to the previously defined resource?", "First, their identity is created in the enterprise directory (for example, Active Directory) and since the enterprise directory is synchronized (\u201c1\u201d in Figure 1) to the cloud directory this data scientist will have a single identity across the enterprise.", "The newly hired data scientist\u2019s identity is assigned to the \u201cdata science project\u201d group reflecting, of course, their participation in a new data science project. Finally, to complete the scenario, the \u201cdata scientist\u201d role is added \u201cdata science project\u201d group.", "This now establishes the relationships in the enterprise directory that provides the credentials (\u201c3\u201d in Figure 1) to allow the data scientists to gain access to the necessary resource.", "First, an identity (for the new data scientist) is linked to a group (the new data scientists group, \u201cdata scientist project\u201d), which is linked to a role (\u201cdata scientist\u201d). The role is linked to a permission (\u201cdata read\u201d) which permits access to a resource (\u201cdata resource\u201d).", "Voila, the data scientist has access to the necessary resource.", "A few final things to note from this scenario:", "Once again, note that this is a somewhat trivial example soley presented to illustrate how the various components and relationships interoperate.", "The march towards enterprise AI/ML on the cloud has started. And it seems clear that older security approaches have not kept up with AI/ML\u2019s appetite for data. This has stalled enterprise adoption of cloud-native AI/ML, forcing enterprises to migrate towards a modern identity-based security approach.", "Newer identity-based security approaches are definitely more complex than older approaches. And managing identities, roles, and synchronizing them between the enterprise and its cloud tenancy does require a new level of discipline. Despite this, the demand for AI/ML in the enterprise is accelerating in industry after industry. And enterprises are now beginning to rethink their cloud security practices.", "It would appear that identity-based security is not just a prerequisite but perhaps also the catalyst for changing enterprises\u2019 traditionally cautious security posture allowing enterprise AI/ML adoption on the cloud to once again accelerate.", "Your home for data science.
