In data science, they are used to deploy machine learning models to production, so no, you can\u2019t avoid them in the long run. Today we\u2019ll create a simple but fully functional database-driven API with Python and Flask-RESTful.", "Here\u2019s a quick rundown of the technologies used:", "And that\u2019s pretty much it. This article should be easy to follow, and it shouldn\u2019t take you more than 10\u201315 minutes to complete (if following along with the code).", "The article is structured as follows:", "You can download the source code here. Let\u2019s get started.", "We want to create a database in which user data is stored (think registration form on a website). We have access to information such as usernames, passwords, actual names, and ages.", "Next, we want to develop a REST API to make the database handling easier. Also, API makes our logic available to any programming language, terminals, and tools like .", "We want to read from the database, insert into it, update and delete records \u2014 in the simplest way possible. So let\u2019s do just that, starting from the next section.", "To start, create a new directory somewhere, and inside it create a Python file. I\u2019ve named mine app.py, as that\u2019s a convention, but it\u2019s not a requirement \u2014 so name yours as you wish.", "Let\u2019s proceed with the imports, shall we? We need a couple of libraries: Flask, Flask-RESTful, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and Flask-Marshmallow. Here are the imports:", "When that\u2019s out of the way, we can proceed with the initializations. We must make an instance of the Flask application and the API and specify where the database is located. We're using , so make sure you're familiar with it first:", "We also have to make an instance of the SQLAlchemy and Marshmallow. The latter is used to make working with JSON responses a breeze. Here's the code:", "Awesome! Let\u2019s jump into the good stuff now, which is declaring a model for our users. SQLAlchemy needs this to construct and execute SQL on the fly, so we don't have to worry about that. As mentioned in the introduction section, we'll deal with data such as name, age, username, and password.", "We need to specify data types and their size, so SQLAlchemy can create the table. That all happens within a class which inherits from SQLAlchemy.Model. Finally, we'll pass the arguments to the constructor of the class. Here's the code:", "The above snippet should be easy to read and understand, as there\u2019s nothing complex going on. Now we can declare a schema for our users. It\u2019s just another class that inherits from Marshmallow.Schema, and is used to avoid the headache of JSON parsing. Here's the code:", "At this point, we are ready to initialize the database and to create the users table. To do so, open up a new window at the root folder, and do everything as shown below:", "Awesome! The last thing we need to do is to use the declared UserSchema. We'll declare two variables - one for fetching a single user and the other for fetching multiple users:", "We can now proceed with the actual API development.", "Right now, we\u2019ll handle five different things:", "And all of that logic is written in a single class, called UserManager. Feel free to name yours as you wish, but this one seems appropriate. Flask-RESTful is very friendly when it comes to the amount of boilerplate code we need to write. It's minimal. To start, we need to declare a class that inherits from Flask-RESTful.Resource. Here's a starter code:", "We\u2019ll start by implementing the logic for fetching one/all users. Every following code block be inside the UserManager class.", "Inside the UserManager class, we'll declare a static method called get. The naming is essential this time, as the method's name stands for the type of HTTP request we intend to make. A request is the most appropriate one for fetching data, so that's what we'll use.", "Let\u2019s proceed with the insertion of new users.", "This time we\u2019ll use the HTTP request. That means the user should pass the data for a new user in the JSON format \u2014 more on that in the testing section. Also, our new static method must be named post.", "Here\u2019s the logic we have to implement:", "It\u2019s a relatively simple function. Here\u2019s the code:", "Let\u2019s proceed with the update of existing users.", "To update an existing user, we\u2019ll use the HTTP request. The static method is then named, you\u2019ve guessed it, put. Here's the overview of the logic:", "This method is a bit more complicated than the previous one, but is still reasonably easy to implement:", "This is the final methods we\u2019ll implement. Its task is to remove an individual user from the database. I\u2019m sure you can guess by now what type of HTTP request we\u2019ll make and how the method must be called. Here\u2019s the logic:", "And that\u2019s it for the entire UserManager class. Let's finish the file next and begin with the testing.", "To finish with the app.py file, we need to attach the UserManager class to some actual endpoint. I've decided to name mine /api/users, but the naming decision is up to you.", "Also, we need to run the Flask app once the file is executed from the Terminal. Here's the code for both:", "And that\u2019s it \u2014 we can begin with the testing.", "To start our application, open a new Terminal window in the root folder and run the following command:", "Awesome! The API is now running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/users, and we can begin testing. To make the process smooth and straightforward, I\u2019ve decided to use the application. You don\u2019t have to do so, as you can do everything straight from the Python or even from the Terminal. We\u2019ll start with the insertions, as that makes the most sense for an empty database.", "If you\u2019re following along, open Postman and follow the instructions below.", "And that\u2019s pretty much it! Everything works as advertised, so let\u2019s wrap things up in the next section.", "It was quite a lengthy article to read \u2014 I\u2019ll admit you that one. Still, I hope you\u2019ve managed to follow along, and if not, please reference the source code .", "Knowing how to work with APIs and how to design them is an essential skill for any data scientist, and Python provides a surprisingly simple way to get started.
