It was originally created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python can be used for a number of different purposes, including creating web applications, read and modify files, connect to database systems, as well as handle big data and data science in general. Much like many programming languages, Python is also a fancy calculator; it can perform mathematical operations with ease.", "Let\u2019s take a look at some of the basic functionality within Python, and hopefully by the end of this blog you\u2019ll have a better understanding of what Python is, what it can do, and just how useful it is to data scientists and programmers everywhere.", "Before we go any further, let\u2019s understand and define what a variable is. A variable allows us to save data so that we can call it back, or reference it, without having to re-write the entire piece of data. Below are three different variables that we have saved to s1, s2, and s3 (we\u2019ll go into why this is bad naming practice later in the blog, but bear with me here).", "As discussed above, naming the variables as I did is bad naming practice so let me help you understand why. In Python, there are certain \u201crules\u201d that must be followed, as well as some \u201crules\u201d that are just good Pythonistic practice (see here for more information on a Style Guide for Python Code).", "The \u201cmandatory rules\u201d are: variable names can only consist of letters, numbers, and underscores (no special characters); variable names cannot begin with numbers; and finally, you can\u2019t name a variable after a built in Python keyword (e.g. if or else).", "Some of the \u201cgood Pythonistic practice\u201d rules are: variable names should always be descriptive (a rule I broke above; don\u2019t name the x or df); no capital letters (these are reserved for classes); variables should not begin with an underscore (this means something special that we won\u2019t cover in this blog post); multi-word variables should be in snake_case (all lowercase separated by underscores) rather than camelCase (new words beginning with capitals); finally, while you CAN name variables after built in Python functions (like print) it\u2019s a very bad idea to do so.", "In addition to performing our basic mathematical equations as above, we can also perform them using our saved variables. For example, adding s1+ s2 will yield 801.0. We cannot add s3 to either s1 or s2 because they\u2019re not both numbers. Attempting to do so will cause Python to throw an error and give you a brief explanation of why this isn\u2019t possible. That said, you CAN add s3 to s4 as they\u2019re both what we call strings!", "Now that we understand variables a little better, let\u2019s look at the basic data types within Python. Before we look at those, we need to understand what \u201cdata\u201d actually means. Most people think of data as spreadsheets of information \u2014 and they aren\u2019t too far off. Data is really just information. Everything that is run and stored in Python is considered data.", "Let\u2019s reference the examples we used above (and remind ourselves what they were below) when learning about variables again. In these examples, we saw three of the most common data types we\u2019ll find within Python.", "In the first variable above, s1, we see what is called an integer \u2014 often referred to in Python as an int type. An int is a number with no decimal part \u2014 such as all of the numbers used in our mathematical example at the top.", "In the second variable, s2, we see what is called a float \u2014 referred to in Python as a float type. A float is a number WITH a decimal part \u2014 even if that decimal part is a 0 like in our example above.", "Finally, our third and fourth variables, s3 and s4 are called a string \u2014 and referred to in Python as a str type. A string is how we store text data in Python. Strings are just strings of characters between a set of single-quotes (\u2018 \u2018) or double quotes (\u201c \u201c). Python is ultimately indifferent to which we use to create a string as long as we\u2019re consistent when we create a string.", "In many cases, we will want to store many values into a single variable, known as a container or a collection. The containers will hold an arbitrary number of other objects. There are a number of common containers within Python so let\u2019s dive right in.", "The first, and likely the most common, is called a list. A list is an ordered, mutable, heterogeneous collection of objects. To clarify: ordered means that the collection of objects follow a specific order, mutable means that the list can be mutated \u2014 or changed, and heterogeneous means that you can mix and match any type of object, or data type, within a list (int, float, or string). Lists are contained within a set of square brackets []. Instantiating a new list can be done in a few different ways, as seen below.", "Less common than lists are called what is known as a tuple. Tuples are similar in that they are ordered and heterogeneous, however they differ because they are immutable \u2014 meaning that once created they cannot be mutated or changed. Tuples are contained within a set of parentheses (). Tuples are slightly faster and smaller than a list so, while their existence is partly legacy from a time when they were more useful, they still have their uses. Instantiating a new tuple can also be done in a few different ways.", "We also have a set. Sets are unordered, mutable, unique collection of objects (similar to traditional sets in mathematics). A set can be created by calling the set() function, which will create an empty set, by passing our information through a set of curly brackets {}, or by passing a single argument of an iterable, in which case Python will return a new set containing a single element for each unique element within our iterable.", "Finally, the last container we\u2019ll discuss is a dictionary. Dictionaries are one of the most common container types that you\u2019ll encounter in your Pythonic journey. Dictionaries are unordered, mutable key-value pairs. They can be thought of much like an actual dictionary, where the key is the \u201cword\u201d and the value is the \u201cdefinition\u201d of that specific word. Dictionaries, much like the other container types, can be instantiated in a number of different ways.", "If you\u2019re ever unsure what type of object you\u2019ve just created, you can always check it by calling the type() function on the variable and Python will let you know what you\u2019ve created.", "With that, we\u2019ve looked at a (very) simple definition of Python, what a variable is and how to instantiate one, some basic data types, and some basic container / collection types within Python. While this isn\u2019t meant to be an all-encompassing crash-course, hopefully it\u2019s taught you enough to venture out into the world of Python, learn more, and apply it to your world. I personally use Python for data science, but as I mentioned above: the uses for Python are almost endless. If you\u2019re interested in learning a little more about how Python is relevant to the world of data science, take a look at my blog on the pandas library within Python and how that can help. Hope you enjoyed the read and I\u2019ll see you next time!", "Your home for data science.
