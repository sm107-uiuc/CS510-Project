But never in history, have the public and media been so acutely aware of the existence and importance of these models as in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers and policymakers are relying on these models to plan at the national and local levels. Moreover, the public is keenly following trends, hoping that these models can guide them about when life will be normal again, whether that means going back to work and school, planning the next vacation or simply getting a haircut. In the rapid wake of the first phase of the epidemic, quick projections were needed and the readily available models received attention from the media and government officials. It is now increasingly clear that this pandemic will continue to disrupt life for months and possibly years to come and critical decisions, regarding lockdowns, social distancing and resource distribution will continue to rely on some of these models heavily. New models are continuously emerging, and a variety of statistics and forecasts are rapidly spreading across social media platforms with some referring to this as an \u201cepidemic\u201d itself (see Guardian article). It is hard to know which of these forecasts are reliable and often conflicting messages from different models (see LA Times article), create a sense of further uncertainty during a time of crisis.", "We believe in the future, society will be better served if the variety of forecasts available is less, but the ones that are available are more vetted for their reliability. This prompted us to explore some available models, including two of the most influential ones, using three criteria (1) Transparency (2) Reproducibility and (3) Validity. Following, we describe our experience with this effort and lessons learned with the hope that in the future, it can begin to establish a better framework for evaluating future models. We used data from Italy and New York, available on Github CSSEGISandData COVID-19 and Github NYTimes COVID-19-data, two places where the pandemic has been acute but has achieved peak for deaths per day. We used varying amount of data in going back in time up to the peaks and then examined how the model performed in forecasting future short-term trends compared to observed patterns till May 1, 2020.", "Arguably two models, one developed at the Imperial College London (ICL) and the other at the Institute of Health Metrics (IHME), University of Washington, Seattle, have been the most influential for policy making in US, UK and Europe. In particular, around mid-March, the Imperial college model predicted deaths in the order of half a million for UK and 2 million for US due to COVID-19 in the absence of any mitigation effort. These projections drew the attention of policy makers for the urgency of implementing strict lockdowns and social distance measures. The IHME model gained attention from late March in US, especially after results started being quoted in the White House daily news briefings. In addition to deaths, the model can predict hospitalizations and ICU admissions, and thus have been likely used in state level resource planning. The model has come under criticism recently by infectious disease experts, but nevertheless it remains very widely quoted by government and media personnel.", "The source code for the Imperial College Model is publicly available through GitHub. The code for applying the model in 11 European countries is available and the posted results are reproducible. However, users who are interested in applying this method on other datasets would need more instructive guidance for the data processing details and the setting of the parameters. An available report describes the underlying methodology in a transparent way with adequate justifications provided for various model choices and assumptions. The methodology uses a Bayesian framework that builds upon a transmission model (see below) for underlying infected cases and specifies the distribution of death among infected cases by borrowing information across countries. The report also describes various sensitivity analyses for the projections to various model choices and assumptions.", "IHME model source code is also accessible through GitHub. The IHME model projections are available for different locations, including the US states and EEA countries on their website. However, the methodology and exact specification of parameters that are required to reproduce these results are not transparent and hence the results are not reproducible. A report provides a brief description of the underlying methodology which relies on fitting a fairly rigid parametric model to the observed data. The report, however, gives limited justifications on model choices and assumptions. In particular, it is hard to follow how the uncertainty in the projections is quantified and how the social distancing covariates is defined.", "Figure 1 shows that the IHME model generally produced good estimate of timing and intensity of deaths at the peak using data till 7-day prior to the peaks. But the peak predictions were not that reliable when data were used 14-day prior to the peaks. Further, the model is predicting a fast decline of deaths following the peaks. The current trend, however, suggests that the post-peak decline is following much gentler trends. In fact, the observed number of cumulative deaths often exceeded the upper confidence bands. The ICL model overestimated the number of daily deaths in Italy, though the observed trends were within the confidence band (shaded region) provided. For New York, the predicted and observed trends were quite similar, but the confidence bounds around projected trends were very wide when the models were built using data one or two week prior to the peak.", "Models for predicting infected cases, as opposed to deaths that incorporate different states of transition between Susceptible, Exposures, Infected and Removed (SEIR) have been used early on in the wake of the pandemic in the Wuhan province of China [Wu et al. 2020]. We could not find open source code for SEIR models which are easy to manipulate for fitting data from other countries. Instead, we used a slightly simplified SIR model [Song et al. 2020], which was recently developed by the University of Michigan researchers.", "The source code for this eSIR model is available through Github. The model is applied only to the Wuhan dataset and the results are reproducible using available code. The underlying methods described in the accompanying report [Song et al. 2020] are easy to follow and justified.", "A limitation of the model is that it requires specifying unknown values of parameters that represent the disease dynamics during the lockdown period. But because the code is easily accessible, we could rewrite a part of the code to perform further \u201ctuning\u201d of the unknown parameters using the last week of the training data. Specifically, we used an exponential decay function to model the decline of the transmission rate after the first intervention, where we assumed the decay plateaus after reaching a threshold. We treated the rate of decay and the threshold level as \u201ctuning parameters\u201d. We fitted the original model removing the last week of the training data and then searched for the combination of the two parameters that gives the best fit of predicted trend to the observed cases within that last week.", "Figure 2 shows that the eSIR model with additional tuning of parameters could give reasonably accurate prediction of future trends in reported cases. However, this particular model produces an extremely wide range of uncertainty and often, the range includes zero new cases over extended periods of time.", "Among the two popular models, we found that the Imperial College London (ICL) model is more transparent and reproducible compared to that by the IHME. The former model sometimes over predicted future deaths while the latter one clearly under predicted post-peak deaths. Both models predicted the timing of peaks reasonably well using data till one week prior. The ICL model produced a much wider bound of uncertainty for the NY state possibly because the pattern did not conform well with their internal training data used from European countries. The eSIR model is transparent and we could modify their code to come up with our own strategy of learning about some post-lockdown parameters through data-splitting. The model, as implemented currently, however produces an extremely large range of uncertainty \u2014 so much so that the best-case scenario provided by the lower confidence bound may not be meaningful.", "We advocate more emphasis on communicating uncertainty around projections. The ICL and eSIR models, both of which incorporate a flexible Bayesian modeling framework, can produce very wide bands of uncertainty around projected trends. The IHME model produces narrower uncertainty bounds, but it is likely to be underestimating uncertainty due to the use of a very rigid model that cannot explain observed trends. In the future, modelers need to communicate levels and sources of uncertainty more forcefully and be aware that, sometimes, the main finding might be the level of uncertainty itself. Media and government personnel also need to pay more attention to the range of uncertainty and be cautious about promoting statistics that have too much uncertainty around them. The best practice may be to emphasize more shorter-term projections and be aware of probable worst-case scenarios for longer-term trends as may be indicated by the upper confidence bounds of some of the most reliable projections.", "We also advocate more caution in using these models to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions given the large uncertainty in estimates. For example, in a medium article by COV-IND-19 Study Group, researchers evaluated the effect of March 25 lockdown in India using the same eSIR model that we used. They projected that in the absence of the lockdown, the number of cases will be around 35,000 by April 30 and if the lockdown was effective, then the number of cases could be as low as near 4000. In fact, by the day the article was posted (April 3), the number of cases in India was 2,567 and by April 30 the reported cases accrued very close to 35,000. While the authors, to their credit, acknowledge the large range of uncertainty, it is not easy for policymakers and the public to grasp the concept of uncertainty and such analysis may create the unintended impression that lockdown may not have been effective. The best approach to promote the effect of lockdown is to report empirical data in a transparent way, such as the growth rates in reported cases and deaths, which clearly show that the lockdown has worked well for India, like it has done for many other countries (see Figure 3).", "Results from our analysis should be interpreted with caution as well. We have only used data from two high-intensity regions to examine the validity of model projections. The patterns may be different in lower intensity countries/regions and we plan to present more extensive analyses using additional data in a research publication later. We have attempted to implement different models as best as possible based on available documentation. It is possible that we have not implemented some of them in the ideal setting the modelers had intended. Further, both ICL and IHME models have been updated very recently after we had completed our analysis, and these newer versions of the models may have improved validity. We also acknowledge that there may be ambiguity in what model validation may mean in a very dynamic situation like the pandemic where implementation and removal of interventions are expected to change the observed trends compared to the predicted values (see discussion). Nevertheless, we believe as more data become available through the entire cycle of the first phase of the epidemic and under different types of interventions, it would be increasingly possible to define and demonstrate model validation properly.", "Going forward in the future, more effort is clearly needed to better vet models following the principles of transparency, reproducibility and validity. Models that do not accompany open-source codes that other quantitative researchers can access, manipulate and experiment with cannot be relied upon. Specific projections using these models should also accompany additional open source codes, specifications, and data so that other researchers can exactly reproduce the results. Moreover, as more empirical data become available on the full cycle of the first phase of the epidemic, modelers should consider showing validation of their own projections using retrospective data. Yet, while we apply these principles, it is important to remember that everything related to the pandemic needs to be done in an urgent manner with limited time and resources. Thus, we call for quantitative researchers who are keen to contribute to the field, direct their effort in evaluating and possibly tuning existing models.", "Clearly, in the future, if the forecasting model is to be more precise, it needs to incorporate other types of data beyond the simple time-series data on the pandemic itself. Like prediction of the stock market will have limited value unless information on housing and labor markets, industry outlooks and consumer behavior are incorporated into the models, we cannot expect much more precision from the COVID-19 forecasting models unless other types of data, such as mobile and GPS-based movement information or survey data on public behavior under different types of interventions, are incorporated.", "Codes used for all the analyses in this article can be accessed here", "The article is a product of collaborative effort among", "Jin Jin, Post-doctoral Fellow,
