The p-value function takes in the test and control conversion rates and the size of each group.", "Confidence interval is the range of values for our estimation, and provides context for our estimation process.", "Here is the project that I did before for AB testing on DataCamp.", "Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It\u2019s a classic \u201cconnect three\u201d-style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level. As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress. In addition to driving in-app purchases, these gates serve the important purpose of giving players an enforced break from playing the game, hopefully resulting in that the player\u2019s enjoyment of the game being increased and prolonged. But where should the gates be placed? So let\u2019s load the data in and take a look!", "The data we have is from 90189 players that installed the game while the AB-test was running. The variables are:", "When a player installed the game, he or she was randomly assigned to either gate_30 or gate_40.", "The focus of this test will be on how the gate placement affects player retention, so let\u2019s plot the distribution of the number of game rounds players on the first week.", "In the plot above we can see that some players install the game but then never play it, some players just play a couple of game rounds in their first week, and some get really hooked. A common metric in the video gaming industry is 1-day retention: The percentage of players that comes back and plays the game one day after they have installed it. The higher 1-day retention is, the easier it is to retain players and build a large player base.", "Therefore, we understand that a little less than half of the players come back one day after installing the game. Let\u2019s look at how 1-day retention differs between the two AB-groups.", "It appears that there was a slight decrease in 1-day retention when the gate was moved to level 40 (44.2%) compared to the control when it was at level 30 (44.8%). Here we use bootstrapping: We will repeatedly re-sample our dataset (with replacement) and calculate 1-day retention for those samples. The variation in 1-day retention will give us an indication of how uncertain the retention numbers are.", "These two distributions above represent the bootstrap uncertainty over what the underlying 1-day retention could be for the two AB-groups. Let\u2019s zoom in on the difference in 1-day retention.", "From this chart, we can see that the most likely % difference is around 1% \u2014 2%, and that most of the distribution is above 0%, in favor of a gate at level 30. But what is the probability that the difference is above 0%?", "Let\u2019s start by calculating 7-day retention for the two AB-groups.", "Like with 1-day retention, we see that 7-day retention is slightly lower (18.2%) when the gate is at level 40 than when the gate is at level 30 (19.0%). This difference is also larger than for 1-day retention, presumably because more players have had time to hit the first gate. But as before, let\u2019s use bootstrap analysis to figure out how certain we should be of the difference between the AB-groups.", "The bootstrap result tells us that there is strong evidence that 7-day retention is higher when the gate is at level 30 than when it is at level 40. The conclusion is: If we want to keep retention high \u2014 both 1-day and 7-day retention \u2014 we should not move the gate from level 30 to level 40. There are, of course, other metrics we could look at, like the number of game rounds played or how much in-game purchases are made by the two AB-groups. But retention is one of the most important metrics. If we don\u2019t retain our player base, it doesn\u2019t matter how much money they spend in-game.", "Source code that created this article can be found in my Github.", "Thank you so much for reading my article!
