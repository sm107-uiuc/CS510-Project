Though, there are some cool things I have noticed during my Tableau exploration.", "Tableau was on the list of my mandatory stops on a journey into data science and data visualization. It is a very cool and convenient instrument for quick dataset acquainting and initial exploratory visualizations. It delivers a lot of tools necessary for the primary data analysis and further exploration. So, it is not a surprise that I am interested in it as a beginner data scientist. Though, first of all, I am a software developer, so I want not just to get a new fancy tool, but to understand, how it works. The main goal is to recreate any visualization from Tableau with Jupyter notebook and any Python library like plotly or matplotlib.", "Our task requires some exploratory analysis upon the data, so I have chosen a dataset which promised a lot of interesting things to be shown. It is the table of Kickstarter projects for 2018 (both failed and succeed) from Kaggle. It contains enough categorical variables for grouping (like project type and country), some dates and date ranges (well, they all have start dates and deadlines) and numerical variables for aggregating (money amounts).", "Just to be aware of data:", "Although my first impulse was to use pandas, I now have to look at the data with the help of Tableau.", "Tableau can open the dataset in a few clicks equivalent to the one code line with pandas. Though it brings additional features like automatic column type recognition: date/time, geodata, number, etc.. So, Tableau approach looks more attractive, so I took my dataset \u2026", "\u2026 and I got trouble with data types and my data was not parsed. After a brief look, I found, that the problem was in local Windows language settings. I live in Ukraine, so I have month names in my native language, but dataset contains English format, which Tableau could not recognize with the current language settings. I was a bit disappointed, that the program takes local settings and I cannot tune them within the program. Anyway, the problem was solved and I continue the work.", "Now we can see all the pros of auto type recognition:", "As we see, it correctly recognized currency, dates, and geodata. Except for the minor mistake: the \u201cstate\u201d column was recognized as geodata instead of a raw text. Nevertheless, it is a great feature, which will be helpful in analysis.", "Dataset cleaning is the most time-consuming step in the data analysis process. So we need to use any utilities to keep our time. Tableau is an excellent assistant in this process with its aliases, calculation columns, and filter systems. For example, we have the column \u201cstate\u201d in our Kickstarter dataset. It keeps several values: \u201csuccessful\u201d, \u201cfailed\u201d, \u201clive\u201d, \u201csuspended\u201d and \u201ccanceled\u201d. Though we want to work only with \u201csuccessful\u201d and \u201cfailed\u201d projects. Let\u2019s proceed with the next steps:", "First of all, all these steps may be performed in a few clicks and it is an obvious advantage of a visual interface. Also, calculation fields allow performing conditions of any complexity. And filters give us quick access to all values of the column.", "Since we work with comparison, here is the Python code for the same job:", "Of course, a lot of cleaning jobs left, though we have already performed our example, so let\u2019s move to the charts, the main goal of an article.", "It is the best practice I have met in data analysis: Tableau turns every column (feature or measure or filter or calculation field) into the drag-and-drop object. So you can create a fully informational visualization in a few mouse moves. For example, I just added the \u201cMain category\u201d feature to the columns and automatically generated \u201cNumber of records\u201d to the rows and the bar chart is ready. One more move to add total count as a bar label and here is the result with additional visual tips on each bar:", "The same action will take a bot more time but a few lines of code in the Jupyter notebook:", "And what about more complex graphics? Not a problem: drag the \u201cCountry\u201d column together with \u201cNumber of records\u201d row, change visualization type and we have the treemap. Even more: drag \u201cCountry\u201d feature into the filters section to remove the USA row from the visualization (so it becomes cleaner since the USA has the greatest number of records). The result is still interactive:", "Though, visualization is still reproducible with Python code:", "So we learned, that we can create simple visualization in a few clicks. Though we also need a few lines of code to have the same result in Python. Let\u2019s create something more complicated.", "Simple graphics show us the connection between two variables. If we need three of more features to be displayed we use aggregation technics. For example, what if we need to show the number of successful and failed projects for each category? Well, it is an easy task for Tableau. We already have a bar chart of categories, so, let\u2019s just add the \u201cState\u201d variable to the worksheet as color property:", "One move and we gathered more information. What about the code? Well, we need a lot of it for this graphic:", "Let\u2019s now create something like AB-test for the \u201cCountries\u201d feature and show the proportion of successful and failed projects. We perform the same steps for \u201cCountry\u201d as for \u201cCategory\u201d before and change the property of aggregation to show the percentage:", "Again, here is the code. Though it is even more complex this time:", "Also, Tableau has different settings for coloring schemes, labels fonts, and custom lines, as we see on our visualizations.", "Let\u2019s now move to another approach.", "As the title shows, we will create a map. Python has a lot of additional packages to work with geodata like Folium. Though, Tableau has built-in abilities to recognize geodata (like country codes) and build maps with it. Like in the previous parts, just drag-and-drop your variable into the worksheet and the Tableau will generate the map automatically:", "Few more clicks and we have a beautiful interactive map with colored signs for the number of Kickstarter records. And we still have full control for marks, colors, labels and other settings.", "As mentioned above, we use Folium and GeoPy (to convert country codes into the geodata) to create the same map:", "It is not so easy as in Tableau but still is reproducible.", "It is a reasonable question. Well, we already know, that matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and other Python libraries are very functional and capable of almost any visualization. On the other hand, Tableau is a famous and cool instrument with very similar capabilities. We could predict the answer to the article\u2019s title from the beginning. Nevertheless, I believe that this comparison is very important to show some not obvious thoughts:", "Despite my conclusions, I believe that everyone should use the tools he likes and used to. I have found Tableau easy in usage, good in quick primary dataset analysis and capable to create grouping and save ready images in a few clicks. Although Python libraries can do the same staff, Tableau can do it faster and do it pretty. So, I will surely use it in my work, especially if I need an art-like picture. Nevertheless, I will still prefer Jupyter notebook for complex analysis, for displaying several images in time, for quick notes, and for the great freedom it gives during the project.", "You can find the Jupyter notebook with all working examples and built-in graphics on my Github together with Tableau worksheets:", "Also, you are free to share some interesting tricks to be used in Tableau.", "Your home for data science.
