In their minds, Google has been noted as the dream employer in 2019 due to their amazing benefits, compensation, and impacts. Within days of my tenure, I received many messages on LinkedIn for referrals to get into Google.

They spread across various industries such as medicine, business, and education.", "In my case, I sometimes compare myself to the more capable senior peers who are also Kaggle and ML superstars. I sometimes have self doubt in my own skills; One time I worked long hours to crack codes that had been readily available if I just asked. I have a fear that one day HR would come and say I am a false positive in the middle of Google\u2019s stringent hiring process. These are the kinds of thoughts that I sometimes face in large tech companies such as Visa and Google.", "If this happens to you, then you are not alone.", "In the technology and data world, You are evaluated objectively through your impacts. You will go through performance review and get compared with others. As data analytics is always evolving, you constantly need to learn and upgrade your skills.
