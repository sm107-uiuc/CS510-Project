The model projects an extremely close outcome\u2014 a Democratic victory by a narrow margin (279\u2013259).", "Given such a tight race, the election may hinge on how well each party invests its limited time and resources across the 50 states. Below, I use predictions from the model to discuss strategies for getting to 270 electoral votes.", "Before jumping into the analysis, below is a visualization of the state-by-state predictions for the 2020 election:", "Each state is sorted into one of five categories \u2014 \u201cStrong Republican\u201d, \u201cLean Republican\u201d, \u201cToss Up\u201d, \u201cLean Democrat\u201d, and \u201cStrong Democrat\u201d.", "Using model predictions from the prior four elections, we find that the Democrat very rarely loses \u201cStrong Democrat\u201d and \u201cLean Democrat\u201d states, and very rarely wins \u201cStrong Republican\u201d and \u201cLean Republican\u201d states:", "If we assumed each of these are won by the predicted Party, the Democrats would have 182 electoral votes, needing 88 more to reach the target of 270.", "Below are the \u201ctoss up\u201d states from which they should draw:", "Colorado and Virginia are worth 22 electoral votes combined and are the most likely toss up states to go to the Democrats. It would be hard to argue a scenario in which these should not be major focuses for the 2020 nominee.", "Both states were flipped by Obama in 2008, and won by the Democrats in the next two elections.", "It\u2019s worth noting that 2018 congressional election results were favorable for Democrats, who won 56% and 55% of votes in Virginia and Colorado, respectively. Both were record-highs in the analysis period (1976\u20132018).", "However, polls suggest that Trump has a slight lead in Virginia over three of the four leading Democratic candidates.", "This further reinforces the point \u2014 Colorado and Virginia are projected to be close enough that they merit time and attention from Democrats to secure a victory.", "With wins in each state, the Democrats\u2019 magic number drops from 88 to 66.", "Now, let\u2019s explore three paths to victory to get those 66 votes:", "One of the biggest surprises of the 2016 election was Trump\u2019s performance in the rust belt region, where he won Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, and nearly won Minnesota.", "When we look at these states over time, we find a similar pattern in both 2000 and 2016. Like Trump, Bush performed quite well in this area, after relatively large Bill Clinton victories in 1996. Consequently, I would categorize the 2016 results as surprising, but not unprecedented.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that Trump & co. felt they had enough of a chance to win these states that they campaigned in them just before the election. They were right. On the backs of a large percentage of non-educated Whites, Trump was able to win the rust belt in 2016.", "At the end of the day, however, the margin of victory was minute\u2014 Michigan by 10,000 votes, Wisconsin by 23,000 and Pennsylvania by 43,000.", "It follows then, that the Democrat\u2019s most straight-forward path to victory is to win back these states. In addition to spending time and money there, they should deliberately craft their campaign messaging, keeping in mind that non-educated Whites will likely decide this region and therefore expunging words like \u201cdeplorable\u201d from their lexicon.", "If the Democrats do win Michigan (16), Wisconsin (10), and Pennsylvania (20) they get 46 electoral votes. The remaining 20 could be cobbled together with states that Hillary won in 2016 \u2014 Minnesota (10), Nevada (6), and either Maine (4) or New Hampshire (4) would land the Democrats at exactly 270.", "There are several states \u201cat play\u201d in the South. Florida (29) and North Carolina (15) have flipped between parties in recent years \u2014 worth 44 electoral votes combined. Arizona (11) and Georgia (16) have gone to the Republican every election since 1996, but are best-positioned among recent years to go blue.", "The model predicts the Democrats to be within 2% of victory in each of Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona.", "All three of these states saw an increase in the Democrat vote share in congressional elections. Most notably, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema became the first to win an open Senate seat in Arizona in 40 years.", "If the Democrats win Florida, North Carolina and Arizona they would get 55 electoral votes. Throw Nevada (6), Maine (4) and New Hampshire (4) into the mix and the Democrats could have a victory without any support from the upper midwest.", "The final path is an extremely risky political strategy, but an interesting thought exercise: try to take Texas.", "But is that even possible? Let\u2019s take a look at the results in Texas over the prior general elections:", "The closest the Democrats have come since Jimmy Carter\u2019s victory in 1976 was in 1992, when Bill Clinton won 48% of the vote that went to either the Democrats or the Republicans. Clinton, however, may have received some extra help from the fact that third-party candidate and native Texan Ross Perot won 22% of the vote.", "Since 2004, the Democrat vote share in Texas has risen from 38% to 45%. Hillary Clinton \u2014 who did worse than Obama did in 2008 in almost every state \u2014 performed better in Texas.", "In addition, demographic shifts likely favor Democrats, who are now making more of an effort to engage young and Latino voters.", "On the other hand, Texas is a big state and the Democrats need 800,000 more votes than they got in 2016 in order to win. This would likely require Democrats to pour the majority of their efforts into the state \u2014 a strategy that could backfire in a big way.", "If they somehow managed to pull off the victory in Texas, Democrats would need just 28 additional electoral votes, a total they could get from Florida alone, or a combination of just a few toss-up states.", "Your home for data science.
