This theory assumes that the company is worth the sum of all future dividend payments discounted to the valued today (i.e.present value). It can also be called Dividend Discount Model. During this article, we are going to learn how to value a company using the Gordon Growth Model with Python.", "One of the advantages of the GGM model is that it is quite straightforward to calculate.", "To calculate our model, we only need three elements:", "There are a few assumptions the model uses and that we need to keep in mind:", "We will be using a free API, financialmodelingprep, and Pandas Data Reader to retrieve company information and market data. Below is the required data to come up with a company valuation using the GGM model:", "2. To calculate the cost of equity (ke) through the CAPM model, we will need:", "3. To compute the sustainable growth rate we will need the payout ratio and the Return on Equity (ROE).", "Expected Return (i.e cost of equity) = Rf + B (ERm \u2014 Rf )", "Now that we know a bit more about the GGM model (or Dividend Discount Model), let\u2019s start building our script.", "The idea is to build a Python function that will take a company ticker as an argument. The function will return the company value as a result (i.e. stock price).", "In our first part of the function, we make an http call to the API end point to retrieve the dividend value of the company passed as an argument. In our example, we have passed the ticker for Johnson & Johnson (Note that the API recognise the company by the ticker).", "As shown in the code, we parse the first element of the financial list, which contains a dictionary. Within this dictionary, we extract the value of the key \u201cDividend per Share\u201d. We store the value in a variable call Dtoday after converting it into a float.", "If you are not familiar with how to parse dictionaries in Python, I recommend you have a look at the following article.", "Great, we have the first part of our model. Next, we need to calculate the Sustainable Growth rate. The formula to compute the rate is as follows:", "SGR = Return on Equity * (1 \u2014 Dividend payout ratio)", "We can obtain Return on Equity (ROE) and Dividend Payout Ratio from the company key metrics API end point. To extract the values, we need to parse the metrics dictionary and extract the values for the keys ROE and payout_ratio:", "Now we have calculated the Sustainable Growth rate as well. Finally, we can calculate the cost of equity by using the CAPM model:", "The first element that we need in order to calculate the cost of equity (ke) through CAPM is the Risk free rate. We will use 1-year Treasury Bills as a proxy since Treasury bills are considered risk free securities.", "We will use Pandas DataReader and FRED as the data provider. The web.DataReader method will return a Pandas DataFrame containing a time series with the interest rates provided by 1 year T-bills.", "We use iloc[-1] method to retrieve the latest element of the DataFrame since the latest element of our Pandas DataFrame Treasury contains the latest available interest rate.", "Next, we need to get the beta for the company. It can be easily extracted from the API company profile end point:", "Finally, the last element to compute the cost of equity is the expected market return (i.e. what is known as market premium in the CAPM model).", "We will use the index S&P 500 as a proxy for the market return. Then, we will calculate the market return for the last year. That is the metric that we will use as a proxy for expected market return.", "As shown in one of my other articles, we can easily retrieve S&P 500 prices and calculate the market return using Pandas DataReader and FRED as the data provider:", "Note that we can use iloc in order to extract the first element of the Pandas DataFrame. I.e. iloc[0] contains the S&P 500 price from last year. On the other hand, iloc[-1] contains the most recent S&P 500 price.", "Then, we compute the yearly return using below formula to get the rate of return:", "Perfect! We have all the required elements to calculate the cost of equity ( Ke). Now we only need to apply the formula to get the Ke through the CAPM model.", "Finally, we have all the required elements to calculate the value of our company through the Gordon Growth model and Python.", "In the case of Johnson & Johnson, we see that the stock price according to the model is $25.38 which is much lower than the current stock price of $150 per stock.", "One of the problems of the Gordon Growth Model is that the returned value is very sensitive to the inputs of the model. For example, a slight increase/decrease in the cost of equity will have a big effect on the calculated value.", "During this post, we have built a model and valued a company using the Gordon Growth model. You can use this script to value any company by passing it as an argument of the function valuecompany. Python will do the work for you.", "However, when using the Gordon Growth model to value a company, there are certain limitations to take into account and that will make the model not work:", "Hope you have enjoyed the read on how to calculate the Gordon Growth Model with Python!
