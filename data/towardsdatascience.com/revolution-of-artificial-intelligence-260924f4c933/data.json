It\u2019s predicted that machines will be more in control of their decisions in the future.", "Who knows? they may control us in the future or even send us to jail.", "In The UCL University, they developed a program that can predict the sentence in a criminal case according to the case files, this program showed human-like results with an accuracy of 80% using 500 samples, in addition to that, humans are not 100% accurate, our performance depends significantly on many biological factors like mood, mental state, and even physical state.", "Our intelligence doesn\u2019t only depend on biological factors, but also it is limited by our biological limits, our brain is fixed in size and doesn\u2019t have the ability to do distributed (parallel) processing like what machines do. humans till now are trying to use tools that make them overcome these limits, like using papers, reminders, and calculators.", "About 100 years ago we didn\u2019t have wide access to electricity, but now, with the rise of electricity, it transformed every major industry, communication, cars, etc. In the 18th century 70% of American residents were working in agriculture, today, less than 1% are working in it, this happened in around 200 years only, that\u2019s because of few revolutions that happened in the electrical field.", "\u201cAI is the new electricity\u201d, Andrew Ng said", "In the book \u201cThe inevitable\u201d that predicts twelve technological forces that will shape the next thirty years, Kevin Kelly said that everything will be much smarter using cheap powerful AI that we get from the cloud.", "Google bought in the last couple of years more than 13 Ai-companies, and we know that Alphabet \u2014 the parent company of Google and several former Google sub-companies \u2014 gains around 70% of its profit from google\u2019s searching engine, but it\u2019s expected that at 2026, Google will become a company that depends mainly on AI projects.", "Everything we do on the internet is recorded, when you search for \u201cMaher\u201d on google and click on my photo, you just taught google that this is Maher and this is what he looks like, every action you take online, most probably, is recorded to improve the internet and the AI engines in general.", "Like, will we tell machines to worship a certain god, or will they worship us, their primary creators, the engineers that designed them?", "What if an intelligent machine did something wrong like killing someone? Will we punish the machine or the engineer that programmed it? The engineer that made it intelligent and able to kill someone, technically he created a weapon that can auto-kill people.", "I think if machines gained consciousness, we should make them experience punishments by implementing a penalty system in them in order for us to be able to punish them if they made mistakes, as we don\u2019t know for sure that they will be all nice.", "Robots can be racists, in 2016 Microsoft created a Twitter bot called TayandYou, it took less than 24 hours before the bot was racist and against feminism, it turned to be a joke on social media, but still it raised some questions.", "Machines learn mainly from us and from their surroundings, so we should be careful about what we teach them. Sure that\u2019s for now, in the future they may have their own opinions and thoughts that they drive from experience and cognitive thinking.", "Till now, these machines have to answer to humans. They lack the ability to make decisions outside of what they\u2019re programmed to do. We didn\u2019t reach general artificial intelligence yet \u2014 It\u2019s the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can \u2014 but a lot of great minds say that we are not far from reaching there and see Scifi become true.", "In my opinion, AI is not necessarily a bad thing, they will be of great help to us, Garry Kasparov believes that Machines should empower us not overpower us, In 2014 in one of the international chess contests, AI alone won 42 chess match but the AI accompanied with a human won 52 matches, AI mainly train on the data we create and collect, so till now humans and AI needs each other.", "General AI could be the biggest achievement that humankind achieved since discovering fire and agriculture, after the machine reaches the technological singularity \u2014 the invention of artificial superintelligence \u2014 an upgradable intelligent agent would enter a \u201crunaway reaction\u201d of self-improvement cycles, with each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an intelligence explosion and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that would, qualitatively, far surpass all human intelligence.", "Will we enter a future where we live a restful life that we enjoy while computer and AI do all the work for us? will machines end the human race? will we live forever on a conscious computer like we see in the movies and abandon our bodies?", "These all are questions we need to answer if someday we managed to create a super-smart machine.", "Your home for data science.
