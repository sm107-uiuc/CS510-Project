You should not rely on an author\u2019s works without seeking professional advice. See our Reader Terms for details.", "Let\u2019s disassemble backtests and make them great again :) In the previous part, we have reviewed the main dangers of the classic backtesting routine with the historical data and standard metrics related to the strategy performance. We have introduced new statistics groups related to data, models, efficiency, and trades that can present more insights about the underlying strategy.", "However, as was mentioned, backtesting on a single historical path that was generated by some extremely complex stochastic process with numerous variables doesn\u2019t seem adequate at all. It allows neither probabilistic interpretation, neither a scenario-based view on the strategy. This, second part of the article is about techniques that open to us a broader approach to validation of our quantitative strategies:", "Like most of my recent articles, this one is inspired by books of Dr. Lopez De Prado and I recommend them to dive deeper into the topic. As always, the source could you can find on my GitHub.", "Long story short, we want to have more than one historical path to check our strategy performance. We could sample it somehow from the historical data, but in what way? We could take different parts from different times from the whole dataset as training and testing sets. For generating these parts we already know the mechanism \u2014 it\u2019s called cross-validation. For our purposes, we need as rich as possible a set of simulations \u2014 all possible combinations of subsets for training and testing the algorithm, which brings us the Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation algorithm:", "For example, we split the whole dataset into N = 6 groups G1\u2026G6, from which we take 2 for testing purposes randomly. Hence, we can have options of 15 splits shown above as columns S1\u2026S15. In each of these splits, 2 groups are for testing and 4 groups are for training with all combinations present. Now, we can test our algorithm 15 times more than with a single backtest and obtaining the distribution of related Sharpe ratios and other risk measures. Despite all the advantages, this method has some drawbacks:", "Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation is a powerful tool, but it limits us to the subsets of the data available. In financial mathematics, we are using Monte-Carlo simulations for thousands and millions of times to get accurate estimates. For example, in derivatives pricing, we use stochastic differential equations to simulate underlying prices, and depending on the equation, these stochastic simulations can look very different:", "Such simulations can give us many different backtest data, but we have two problems here: we don\u2019t know from which exactly stochastic process financial data is sampled from, and how to re-create exogenous variables as fundamentals, sentiment, etc.", "The end result is a distribution of backtest metrics over different scenarios, the same as with the combinatorial cross-validation approach.", "Simulations can be used also for the generation of specific regimes and scenarios we\u2019re interested in. For example, we are interested in knowing how our strategy will behave in cases of sudden market falls. How we could do it? If we take just historical data, we can find 2\u20133 of such crises depending on the market. Here, Monte-Carlo simulations are useful again, but we need to pick the parameters of the particular stochastic process very carefully: to model the exact risk that we are testing this strategy against. For example, for market falls described above, we can simulate the jump-diffusion process with a negative jump size and corresponding frequency.", "There are also other data-driven ways to simulate realistic scenarios based on the generative machine learning models as GANs. There are several promising approaches for both returns time series generation and correlation matrices sampling:", "However, usually, GANs don\u2019t allow us controlled scenario generation, since neural representations are entangled, i.e. we can\u2019t tell where is the \u201cbutton\u201d for manipulating drift, volatility, or another financial variable. Variational autoencoders could be an interesting approach here, I wrote an article on disentangled representation learning a while ago which might be useful here.", "Let\u2019s take Deutsche Bank stock price data as we did in the previous article. The backtests of the ML-based strategy looked very well until we realized that on other banks this approach fails, which doesn\u2019t allow us to consider our financial finding credible. Now, I would like to show, how we could realize it without looking at similar market players, but using probabilistic interpretations of the metrics.", "Let\u2019s reshuffle the first pieces of our price time series to generate 15 train and backtests paths (as we discussed above). We can see on some of the illustrations below, how our backtest data already has different market regimes and directions which immediately allows scenario-based validation:", "After we run the ML and strategy pipeline from the previous post, we should check the performances of ML models first on these backtest data, and only after we will be confident in machine learning performance, we can run strategy backtests. From the histogram below, we can see, that on average MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) is positive, however, there are several data pieces that give us negative performance (we already can estimate some risks from here).", "Let\u2019s assume the risk is acceptable and plot histograms for strategy Sharpe ratio, Deflated Sharpe ratio, and Probabilistic Sharpe ratio (see the previous article for more details). We can see a \u201cfatter\u201d left tail in the Sharpe ratios compared to the MCCs histogram, and, more important, the total prevalence of zero-valued Deflated Sharpe ratios on these backtests, which means, that our results are prone to the issue of the repeated experiments and are not reliable.", "As we can see, a single walk-forward couldn\u2019t open to us these problems, and simple combinatorial cross-validation already shows much more compared to the point metrics estimate.", "If combinatorial cross-validation works so well, what can we do with the simulations from the stochastic models? Let\u2019s look at the DB prices time series below, how it behaves? What stochastic model and what parameters are describing it?", "We can clearly see some jumps (and time-varying volatility too by the way), but for simplicity, let\u2019s assume that this process follows the Merton jump-diffusion model, with drift and volatility taken from the historical data (-3.036e-05, 0.02789), jump intensity, size, and its standard deviation chosen \u201con the eye\u201d (0.1, -0.01, 0.001). Let\u2019s simulate a couple of paths of such close price time series, predict corresponding low, high, open prices, and the volume and backtest strategies on these generated paths.", "From the first one, we can see from the distribution of MCCs calculated over multiple runs of the bagging classifier, that on average our model accuracy out-of-sample is negative. It should\u2019ve stopped us from running the backtest, but out of curiosity let\u2019s do this and we can see, that such a backtest can be lying \u2014 it outperforms the benchmark even with a poor model! A good point to the previous article on the importance of the correct metrics calculation and tracking.", "Re-launching simulation gives similar bearish time series, but now with more jumps over time (which looks more similar to the original DB time series), but the distribution of MCCs gives negative results again, and the backtest is again misleading.", "Of course, if we will re-sample this time series more times and will build a histogram of such predictions, we will clearly see a fat left tail in model accuracies which will clearly signal to us that our initial financial hypothesis doesn\u2019t hold anymore if we sample data with very similar dynamics, yet a bit different from the historical data. Which shouldn\u2019t be the case if we did our preliminary research right :)", "In this article, we have reviewed techniques that allow probabilistic backtest as compared to the historical walk-forward ones. The main problem of the latter is that it is just a single realization of a complex stochastic process that could have gone in many different ways, and we don\u2019t want to overfit to one sample from a distribution.", "We have used two major techniques to address this problem: combinatorial cross-validation and stochastic simulations, each with its benefits and drawbacks. In the previous article, we have seen that our ML-based strategy performed well on the DB stock price, but experiments on the other assets from the banking universe have shown, that this \u201cfinding\u201d doesn\u2019t generalize to the market. In this article, we have shown, that if we used not walk-forward estimates, but combinatorial CV or stochastic simulations, we could see that this strategy is not reliable even without checking other assets on the market, which could save us time for the research.", "We have studied additional metrics that tell more us about backtest performance and we have expanded them to the probabilistic estimates. We do this all to estimate the risk of our strategy performing poorly out-of-sample, which is relevant to measuring the \u201coverfitting\u201d of these strategies. We also know, that overfitting is about the tradeoff between in-sample and out-of-sample performance, and in these two articles, we were focused only on the OOS one. In the next, third article in this short series, we will focus on other measures of overfitting risk that takes into account in-sample data as well and will conclude with a general framework for testing quantitative trading strategies. Stay tuned and don\u2019t forget to check out the source code :)", "P.S.You also can connect with me on the Facebook blog or Linkedin, where I regularly post some AI articles or news that are too short for Medium and Instagram for some more personal content :)", "Your home for data science.
