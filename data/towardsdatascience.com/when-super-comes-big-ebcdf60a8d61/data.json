Nobody talks anymore about the supernatural, the superlative or the supercomputer. People prefer to talk about big businesses, Big Data and of course the Big King XL.", "It is clear that everything BIG is with a certain hype, and so Big Data is already part of our tech-business vocabulary nowadays. We talk about Big Data referring to massive flows of data that we want to store or process for a specific purpose: to generate new previously unknown insights. Along with Big Data we find the Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML) or Artificial Intelligence (AI).", "Broadly meant, we talk about something \u201cmassive\u201d when we really are not able to handle it in a traditional way (or in traditional databases), but one thing is clear: Big Data is still data. Now what we do is include and dust enterprise data along with other information that the company knows but has not yet decided to exploit or does not know its usefulness or potential.", "Big Data is still just data, however many people get lost when they start looking at all the technologies on the market, online courses, certifications.", "Which are the steps that we must follow in any Big Data project?", "If you want to learn more, go visit oscargarciaramos.com", "I refuse to join any data project in which I don\u2019t clearly know or don\u2019t understand what its purpose is. If you don\u2019t know it, you are doomed to failure.", "This is the most important part of all \u2192 Understand the business.", "This has to be our first step on any type of data or analytics related project.", "Your project must be the answer to a clear need of the company, your department or your team. Before you even think about data, talk to people and understand what the problem is.", "Are you losing millions of dollars? Is your team losing efficiency or time when collecting or processing data in bulk? How does this problem impact your business? Sometimes it is not necessary to develop a very complete Business Case to understand the impact of our project. Sometimes, it\u2019s just enough to understand it.", "How can we ensure that our project is a success? What are the meters or KPIs that will be monitored and followed up throughout our development or project process?", "Once the problem is solved, what does it mean for the company?", "This point is crucial. Are we moving forward with the project or is it really not worth it?", "This point can also serve as proof of the cost or budget of the project. Not only the technical complexity must be the cause of a project to be more or less expensive, but the value it really brings to the company.", "Why am I saying this? The value we bring does not necessarily have to be related to the technology necessary to solve the problem. We start from a business angle, and we will adapt or look for the necessary technology to solve it.", "Big Data is not our GOAL, but our DRIVER.", "If we can\u2019t define and articulate these 1\u20134 steps, there is no point in going ahead with the next point.", "Once we are clear about the goal of the project, it is time to start thinking about data.", "Evaluate your data. Do we have the data available within the company or do we have to go find it outside? Are we talking about structured, unstructured or semi-structured data? Do we need to collect them in real time, near-real time or in batch? What\u2019s more, what will be our retention or retrieval period? Are we talking about hot data or cold data?", "Yes, you read it right. There are 3 types of architectures.", "This is a decision that depends exclusively on the company and to make it requires analyzing many aspects such as the implementation, maintenance or ownership of the solution.", "There is an entire range of grays between black and white. Do we want control of the platform to reside and be controlled directly by IT or do we want it to be hosted by a software provider? How do we want the cost model to be, a large single investment at the beginning with fees (OnPrem) or pay-per-use (Cloud)? Do we know exactly the dimensioning of the solution or do we want an easily scalable and adaptable platform according to what circumstances? And most importantly, data security, do we want it to be in our own hands or do we trust our vendor\u2019s hands?", "There is no clear solution, but many aspects to discuss. Maybe, the best solution could be a hybrid model. Do not forget it and still consider it.", "Few are the companies that have expert profiles and full capabilities that cover a complete Big Data or Analytics project end-to-end. Let\u2019s not be afraid to outsource services. Let\u2019s talk to different providers or vendors, and stop seeing them as an enemy, but someone to lean on. Let\u2019s identify these gaps and be sure to plan the project according to these needs.", "Or at least, an iterative approach. Let\u2019s start with pilots, PoCs, MVP developments, small Use Cases\u2026 Let\u2019s not try to cover the whole project from the beginning, it will end in failure.", "Think Big, Start small, Move Fast.", "This is the key. Let\u2019s define achievable and realistic milestones. Once we validate our pilots and they start generating value for the company, let\u2019s put it into production. Never before.", "Data projects are fascinating in that they never stop improving.", "We could say that it is based on the term of continuous learning, and what we create now, we can improve it in a few months.", "As I said earlier, let\u2019s start with something small, something very well defined, let\u2019s see what its true impact and value is for the company and, once defined, let\u2019s start building.", "Feel free to leave a comment or share this post.
