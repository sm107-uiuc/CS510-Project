In this paper, the authors outlined a novel learning algorithm used to automatically generate data, learning environments and curricula to help AI agents learn rapidly. The paper can be found here.", "When is using synthetic training data more helpful than using all of the real data available?", "Experts in AI research are slowly starting to move away from the idea that more data is better. Surrogate datasets that are generated by intelligent sampling to a subset of training data may result in comparable test performance and less training effort. In the context of deep learning, this amounts to efficiently searching for optimal Neural Network architectures. Intelligent sub-sampling significantly decreases training effort since, oftentimes, training thousands of candidate NN architectures on full data sets can be expensive.", "A surrogate dataset can be created by intelligently sampling a subset of training data. Such surrogates enable competitive test performance with less training effort.", "There are several examples in the literature where surrogate training data has been applied including Curriculum learning, active learning, and a core-set selection:", "Graves et al., introduce a method for automatically selecting the path or syllabus, that a neural network follows through a curriculum so as to maximize learning efficiency.", "Konyushkova et. al., propose a novel data-driven approach to active learning (AL), where they train a regressor that predicts the expected error reduction for a candidate sample in a particular learning state.", "Sener et. al., defined active learning as core-set selection. Core-set selection works by choosing a set of points such that a model trained on the selected subset is competitive for the remaining data points.", "The key insight of Uber\u2019s paper is that the surrogate data does not need to come from the original data distribution. An example they give is humans learning a new skill from reading a book or preparing for a team game like soccer by practicing passing or dribbling.", "The goal of the paper is to investigate whether a data-generating Neural network can produce synthetic data that efficiently teaches a target task to a learner.", "In their paper, Uber AI Labs proposes Generative Teaching Networks (GTNs): a scalable, novel, meta-learning method for generating synthetic data.", "As stated before, the task of GTNs is to produce a data-generating Neural Network. Upon generating the GTN, a Neural Network learner is trained on the data generated by the GTN. The GTN and the learner network cooperate (the opposite of GANs, which compete) in order to rapidly produce high accuracy in a target task.", "In the study, the authors demonstrate that GTNs can generate a synthetic training set that enables accelerating learning, compared to training on full datasets, in two supervised learning domains, MNIST and CIFAR10.", "The MNIST dataset contains handwritten digits (from 0\u20139) and is commonly using for training image processing systems. The learning task in this context is the classification of the handwritten digit.", "The key takeaway from the MNIST results is the GTN method converges faster with fewer iterations than training on real data and subsamples of real data. While the converged error is larger in magnitude than the model trained on real data, it is not far from the converged value for the real data even though it took fewer iterations.", "The CIFAR10 dataset contains 10 classes of different images including cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. It is also commonly used for training image processing systems, for image classification.", "Similar to the MNIST example, the GTN error rate plateaus much faster than real data error rates, which in the case of the real data has not yet reached convergence after 120 inner-loop iterations.", "In this post, we reviewed Uber AI Lab\u2019s novel method for generating synthetic data for accelerated learning. GTNs are basically the opposite of GANs, where two networks cooperate in order to minimize a learner\u2019s error rate. The GTN method accelerates error convergence in the tasks of image classification when trained on MNIST and CIFAR10 data. Possible further applications include using reinforcement learning in order to generate new tasks that foster learning. Another possible application is the development of methods that can be used to coax GTNs to produce virtual worlds for us to learn, play or explore.", "I hope you found this article interesting!", "Your home for data science.
