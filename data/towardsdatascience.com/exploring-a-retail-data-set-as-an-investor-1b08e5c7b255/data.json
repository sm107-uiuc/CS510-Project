This trade survey presents national estimates as sales, sales taxes, expenses, inventories, among others.", "The challenge here is to explore only these data and discover what kind of relevant insights we can find out and also some answers to show to an investor which segment could be the best option.", "Of course, that can arise new questionings and doubts, but the following questions will guide us initially:", "To figure out those answers will be used the US Census Annual Retail Trade Survey dataset provided by Data.World. Through this dataset, we can have information access such as sales, sales tax, inventories, gross margin, expenses, purchases and total accounts receivable, collected in the United States, from 2004 to 2014.", "The US Census Annual Retail Trade Survey dataset brings out data organised by main segments and some of that has subsegments. After a data cleaning process, it was chosen to simplify and work only with the main categories, between 2004 and 2014. The segments and respective codes are:", "There are lots of metrics that we should check to have as much as possible an accurate overview of the segment for interest. However, this data set offers general information, allowing to make an only quantitative analysis. The idea here is to extract the most relevant information coming only from this dataset.", "Another important matter is this analysis is a study case, made to a \u201chypothetical investor\u201d, with no knowledge in the accounting area, just through some research in the area. The aim here is, even with limited data, show how the data analysis can help to identify relevant information to assist in decision making.", "Sales are probably the first metric that comes to mind when someone is thinking to invest in a certain area. We can say that is something logical, after all the more sales, more money. So we need to get a glance and pick up the segment with higher sales.", "In effect, it is not that simple. It is evident that if you don\u2019t sell, you are out of the market, but we need to keep in mind that sales differ to profitability. Sales are essential and can bring us valuable data, but there are many other important metrics that we needed to check alongside the sales. Anyway, that is a good point to start.", "The graphic above shows us the sales growth by year, in which we can realise a consistent increase close to an average of 5%, from 2004 to 2007. Due to the Great Recession, we can see a decrease beginning in 2008, dropping to -7.68% in 2009. From 2010, US retail starts the recovering growing up, on average 4.2%. According to this very first analysis, we can expect around 3.5% of growth for 2015.", "In the chart below we can have an interesting view of the total sales along the years by segment. Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers have the highest total sales, with $ 9.44 Billions along the years. If we compare with the second higher sales place General Merchandise Store, it will be found almost 31% fewer sales and comparing with the lowest sales place Sporting Goods, Hobby, Book and Music Stores, the difference reach more than 90%.", "The next chart beneath presents the YoY growth by segment and, besides the segments being in the position as before, it\u2019s possible to realize which areas were more sensitive to economic issues carried by the Great Recession. Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers segment was the second segment most affected falling -14.53% in 2009, right behind Gasoline Stations, dropping -22.28% in the same year.", "On the other hand, the least affected sectors were General Merchandising Stores, followed by Food and Beverage Stores with -1.03% and -0.14%, respectively.", "Nonstore Retailers had the most constant and more robust growth along the years, reaching 8.48% in 2014.", "When we analyse the average growth by segment (below), Nonstore Retailers has the highest ratio measured along the analysed period, with 6.85%.", "For comparison, Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers, the sector with the highest total sales over the years, had only the average growth of 1,87%.", "From the previous data analysed until now, we can get some conclusions. Despite being one of the most sensitive segments regarding the economic crisis, Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers had the strongest recovery with an average growth of 8.75%, measured from 2010.", "Nonstore Retailers had similar average growth (8.59%), but if we take into account the total sales, Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers sold $9.44 Billion. In contrast, Nonstore Retailers had little more than $3.74 Billion, resulting in a difference of $5.7 Billion.", "The previous analysis showed us that Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers seem the most promising segment, but as was said before, sales are different in profit.", "From now, our mission will be to seek relevant information that could confirm or not this previous conclusion. We can kick off seeking out expenses, costs and how those can impact the revenue, based on our dataset information.", "Let\u2019s begin with some of the most important profitability ratios used to explore the company\u2019s financial stability and overall health: Gross Profit Margin and Net Profit Margin.", "Firstly, we will analyse the Gross Profit Margin. This measure indicates how much the company make a profit over and above its costs. The higher this result, the more efficient company is in generating profit for every dollar of the cost involved. We can calculate through the formula", "Gross Profit Margin = (Revenue \u2014 COGS)/Revenue x 100", "where we can use Total Sales as Revenue, but first we need to find out the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) that refers to the direct costs of producing the goods sold by a company. The higher COGS, lower the margins will be. For that, will be used the formula below", "COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases \u2014 Ending Inventory", "The graphics above bring us an overview of how much the cost of goods impacts the retail margin. The segments with higher total sales (over $5 billion) also have a higher cost of goods, above 74% for Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers and reaching almost 82% in Gasoline Stations sector.", "On the other hand, the second area with the lower sales, Furniture and Home Furnishing Stores presents the lower value, with less than 49% of expenses with Cogs.", "Now we can access the Gross Profit Margin and discover how many profits each segment is generating per dollar of cost.", "Again, we can see a similar standard as before. The stronger segments in sales have a worse return for each dollar of cost. Gasoline Stations and Motor Vehicle and Part Dealers are in the baseline, generating 13 and 18 cents per each dollar in gross profit. On the top of the list is Furniture and Home Furnishing Stores, with 46 cents per dollar cost involved.", "Gross Profit Margin provides a general clue of a company\u2019s profitability, but ain\u2019t a precise measurement. To have a more accurate number, we need to find the Net Profit Margin. For that, we still need to include other expenses such as operational costs, taxes, interests into the calculation to find the net income and then.", "This dataset brings only the expenses file and for this reason, will be assumed that the additional costs are gathered into this file, for further calculations.", "The graphic above expose more precise numbers about the profit. Following the same standard used to analyse gross profit margin, those numbers are expressing how much of each dollar collected from sales returns for the company as a profit.", "Gasoline Stations, Electronic and Appliance Stores and Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealer have the lower numbers, translating profits below to 3.5%. In other words, for every dollar sold, returns less than 0.035 cents as a profit. Nonstore Retailers and Miscellaneous Store Retailers have the highest return close to 15% and 12%, respectively.", "Below we have a comparison between Net Profit Margin and Sales per segment, showing us that the highest-selling areas usually have presented lower profit numbers.", "A higher profit Margin is the target since it means the company generates more from sales. However, the strong sales coming from the lead position segments aren\u2019t necessarily converted in a high margin of profit. We need to find out how much money the percentage corresponds.", "Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers translated in profit only 3.30% \u2014 corresponding to $28.3 Million from average sales \u2014 while Nonstore Retailers, positioned in the middle of the sales chart get 14.55%, answering for $49.5 Million. Nonstore Retailers wins.", "If we compare Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers with the second higher net profit margin Miscellaneous Store Retailers, we have $28.3 Million (3.30%) against $12.6 Million (11.54%) coming from average sales. In this case, Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers turns the best option.", "So far, Nonstore Retailers seems the best option, despite not being the segment with more sales, it has the best net Profit Margin.", "Inventory is another critical area with a significant impact that must be investigated in retail trade. It means that is one of the sources of revenue generation and hence earnings for the company. In a simple way, it refers to the goods available for sale and raw materials used to make products for sale.", "Basically, have an elevated amount of inventory for a long time can be disadvantageous for a company, carrying storage and spoilage costs, besides obsolescence. However, a small inventory also can bring problems like losing profit from potential sales not done due to the insufficient inventory.", "That said, we need to measure how many times a company has sold and replaced inventory during a specific period through the Inventory Turnover ratio, using the formula", "Inventory Turnover = Sales / Average Inventory", "Several sources say that the ideal inventory turnover ratio for retail is between 4 and 6, but as we can see above, those number can vary according to the business area. In reality, those numbers are just references to guide the search of best results.", "As we can see above, Gasoline Station has a higher Inventory Turnover Ratio and the lower Days Sales Inventory, replacing the inventory 50.35 times a year and taking 7.32 days to sell off inventory. In this case, we can say that high sales demand and limited stock physical space could be the reasons for that. Nevertheless, it\u2019s rare to stop in the petrol station and face it with some gas pump closed for fuel shortage.", "Considering the reference values (4 and 6), we can say that the Sporting Goods, Hobby, Books and Music Store, Clothing and Accessories Stores and Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers showed the best inventory ratios, precisely between the desired ratio 4 and 6.", "Lastly, we are going to analyse Gross Margin Return on Investment (GMROI), a retail metric used to set if a company (in this case, segment) earns sufficient gross margin as from the purchased products.", "From that, we can figure out how much investment in inventory is required to generate the desirable gross margin dollars, using the formula below.", "GMROI = Gross Profit / Average Inventory Cost", "The chart above brings interesting numbers. We can say that the higher the GMROI, more money is being made per every dollar invested in inventory. Beginning from the Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers segment, revealing the lowest GMROI with 1.04, which means this segment earns revenues of 104%, just a little above the costs.", "Analysing Gasoline Stations, the segment with the best GMROI result with 6.59, returns 656% of earned revenues, thus selling the merchandise for more than its cost to acquire it. Nonstore Retailers comer right after, presenting 5.07 and returning 507% of revenues. Based on those results, Gasoline Stations and Nonstore Retailers seems good options to the investor.", "We will finish now doing a recap of key insights found so far.", "- US Retail Trade area, into the period from 2004 to 2014, presented an Average Year over Year growth around 2.5%, due to the Great Recession (2008\u20132009). Before that, the segment was showing a growth close to 5%. After the recovering started in 2010, it is expected the segment growth around 3.5% in 2015.", "- Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers segment has higher total sales, making $ 9.44 Billion along the same period. It\u2019s about 31% more sales than the second higher seller.", "- Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers was profoundly affected by the crisis, dropping -14.53% in the peak of crisis but also had the most vigorous recovery, with 8.75% in average, measure from 2010 to 2014. Nonstore Retailers also had a similar recovery (8.59%) but selling almost 40% less in comparison to Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers.", "- Furniture and Home Furnishing Stores has the lowest expense with Costs of Goods Sold (COGS), with less than 49% of expenses. Gasoline Stations and Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers have the highest COGS, with 82% and 74%, respectively.", "- Gasoline Stations, Electronic and Appliance Stores and Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealer are weak in Net Profit Margin, presenting 3.5% and returning only 0.035 cents per each dollar sold as a profit. Nonstore Retailers and Miscellaneous Store Retailers show the best numbers, translating almost 15% and 12%, respectively.", "- Nonstore Retailers has a higher Net Profit Margin, even being at the 5th place in sales. This segment returns 14.55%, corresponding to $49.5 Million. The highest seller Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers, returns only 3.30%, responding for $28.3 Million.", "- Despite to have a considerable inventory turnover ratio, Gasoline Stations and Nonstore Retailers have both the best Gross Margin Return on Investment (GMROI), reaching 6.59 and 5.07, which means it earns revenues of 659% and 507% of costs, respectively.", "Based on all information gathering in this article, we can conclude that Nonstore Retailers segment is the best option for investors. Despite not being the highest seller segment, it was the fourth less affected by the great recession, dropping only -2.43% and was the second place in recovery, with an average growth of 8.59%.", "Nonstore Retailers also has the best Net Profit Margin, returning 14.55%, or making 0.15 cents as profit for each dollar sold. Besides, that has the second-best GMROI, generating revenues of 507% of costs.", "I hope you enjoy it this article!
