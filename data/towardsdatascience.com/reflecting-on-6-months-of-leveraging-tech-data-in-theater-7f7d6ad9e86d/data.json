Launched in December 2018 in collaboration with The Artist Co-Op and Dramatic Solutions , the workshop series aims to cover important technological topics relevant to theater professionals.", "Below are the challenges we\u2019ve faced, the solutions we\u2019ve found, and the progress we\u2019ve made.", "There are some who feel that a large gap currently exists between available technologies and those used in the theater industry. Eventually, these individuals found each other \u2014 and formed a small group called Dramatic Solutions. Their mission:", "\u201cProvide tech solutions to the theatre industry through community.\u201d \u2014 Dramatic Solutions", "The authors choose to correspond to Dramatic Solutions as \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cour.\u201d", "Naturally, a group of theater enthusiasts with a flair for performance launched in-person events (guess those acting classes came in handy after all!). Aside from being positively impactful towards education\u00b9, in-person workshops provided a community-focused platform centered around creation, participation, and action. We also really wanted to perform in an Elon Musk/Mark Zuckerberg sort of way.", "We identified theater\u2019s largest \u201cpain points\u201d after analyzing industry data, talking with professionals, and issuing surveys.", "Here were the top 5 technological gaps we discovered:", "1) Ambiguity in decision making, especially those in marketing and sales.2) Low profitability and financial sustainability.3) Low accessibility for diverse audiences.4) Extreme volatility and low profitability of Indie Theatre. 5) Deadlocked propagation of new works and talent.", "We approached these obstacles with a positive attitude and a lot of research (we did mention we\u2019re also a group of tech nerds, right?). So we rebranded \u201cpain points\u201d into \u201cobjectives\u201d:", "One of the most stressful elements of running a production (or a business) is not knowing what to do. What do you do when you\u2019re not sure what to do? Yikes! Decreasing ambiguity in sales, marketing, and operations is therefore crucial for minimizing stress and allowing \u201cthe show to go on.\u201d", "It\u2019s difficult to grow when you\u2019re unable to financially sustain yourself or your endeavors. Theatre\u2019s notorious unprofitability impedes the number of shows and jobs available to the industry . Establishing profitability through sustainable market practices would generate more shows, reach wider audiences, and increase financial gains for creators and showrunners.", "Rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods, unfriendly zoning policies, and decaying transportation infrastructure is squeezing Indie Theatre out of its home in the East and West Villages faster than it can grow in the outer boroughs.\u00b2 \u00b3 Enabling Indie Theatre to \u201cpop-up\u201d in new neighborhoods and earn a profit is essential to keeping the thriving artistry of Indie Theatre pulsing.", "Multitudes of talent living in NYC are frustratingly vying for a limited number of residencies, roles, or general opportunities. Increasing employment via propagation of new work would not only support our local artistic community, but also provide artists with platforms to showcase and share their work.", "We were concerned that our audience would be overwhelmed by our content. Therefore, we designed our workshops around lectureship (75% of the event) before concluding our events with hands-on exercises.", "We didn\u2019t plan our events\u2019 curriculum; we improvised and dramatically improved through feedback from participants.", "Lectureship: After our first event, we realized 75% lectureship was way too much for our audience to absorb. We adjusted to 50% for the second event \u2014 then distilled it down to 25%. Moving forward, we\u2019re going to balance lectureship with hands on per topic per skill level.", "Seating: Our first two events were situated in an auditorium lecture-styled environment. Listening to our participants and working to accommodate a more \u201chands on\u201d environment, we switched to a collaborative, caf\u00e9 style set up (shown below). This new seating modification allowed participants at various skill levels to help each other. One hundred percent of our participants responded positively to this change. Moving forward, we plan on keeping the caf\u00e9 set up.", "Scheduling: Our events originally began at 6:00PM and ended at 9:00PM. The feedback helped us realize the start time was challenging for our participants\u2019 busy schedules, so we adjusted. Now our events begin later. Moving forward, we plan on keeping the \u201cafter\u201d schedule (in blue).", "Content: The content of our workshops has been positively received, perhaps owing to our research or user self-selection. All in all, we\u2019re excited that the most important part of our events were proven relevant. We\u2019re now continuously sourcing for future content. If you have an idea for a workshop, get in touch with us.", "Success stories from attendees in creative industries.", "\u201cAfter attending, I realized that I need to be strategic about how my website is laid out and that it needs to be user friendly. I redesigned my site and had a 175% increase in leads and a 30% increase in sales!", "Also, using the dashboard from the workshop, I\u2019ve been monitoring which content gets more likes and have been more strategic about how and when I post. My art is reaching the most people it ever has!", "\u201cUsing some of the tools we created helps me keep in better touch with people in my network. I feel so much less stressed out and confident that I am getting work done, I\u2019ve begun sharing this tool with people I work with and it\u2019s inspiring that its helping them too.\u201d", "\u2014 Mike Griffiths, Marketing Director at Dixon Place", "\u201cThrough the leveraging tech and data series, I feel like I\u2019m finally using my website to its fullest potential.

The Leveraging Tech + Data series has proved time and time again to be an invaluable resource in helping demystify these trends and how to use them to our advantage.

I\u2019m especially enthused when I see past attendees from our workshops helping others with their tech \u2014 indication that the propagation of knowledge and resources is gaining momentum.", "Sara: There is something so incredibly fulfilling uniting passions \u2014 art and tech. Artists and techies have common goals \u2014to listen, communicate and make a difference. My favorite sound will always be \u201cOoooohhh\u201d, which translated means \u201cI did it! It wasn\u2019t as challenging as I thought, and I will do it again!\u201d", "Danielle: It\u2019s amazing to meet individuals who are also passionate about advancing an industry which already brings me so much joy! Whether we\u2019re discussing dashboards or musicals, I love that our community is excited to collectively tackle large problems. We\u2019re blending science with art, storytelling, and engaging experiences.", "The momentum we\u2019ve gained from our first few months of operations indicates that the community we\u2019re building and the resources we\u2019re sharing are both wanted and needed.", "To continue this momentum, we\u2019re aiming our next few months on expanding our audience to include a more diverse range of skillsets. A workflow explaining our thought process is shown below:", "As demonstrated, we\u2019re introducing 2 new event types while maintaining our current Leveraging Tech & Data event. Each is briefly explained below.", "A moderately structured workshop with a tight agenda but loose schedule for those interested in a specific topic.", "A comprehensive course focused on the tools needed to leverage a brand across digital platforms.", "An open forum to ask experts anything in a specific scope as well as an environment for collaboration.", "To learn more about these events or attend, visit the Dramatic Solutions Eventbrite page.", "It\u2019s pretty amazing that just 6 months ago, the concept of a tech enabled community within theatre was nothing more than a peripherally scattered idea. Fast forward to the present and\u2026 wow! We\u2019ve come a long way!", "Reflecting upon this progress, our group is reminded of the principles that have guided us thus far \u2014 that of collective responsibility and the need for a feeling of belonging. We\u2019re exhilarated that our efforts have granted us significant ground in both these areas.
