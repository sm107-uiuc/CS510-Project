For instance, an A-theorist would argue that the year 1970 and the events that took place in that year are metaphysically different from the year 2020 and that the flow of time during this period has marked a period of continual transformation. Time can essentially be thought of as a real entity under this view, much like gravity.", "B-theory: Argues that the present is not metaphysically different from the past or future. In fact, an extreme B-theorist would argue that there is no such thing as the past or future \u2014 time is merely a concept that was invented by humans as a means of making sense of the world. If it were not for our memories, the past would not exist and the future is simply comprised of an individual\u2019s thoughts of what that supposed future could look like. For instance, one could make the argument that the year 2022 is technically not real, and no different to the present time. It is simply a group of dates marked on the standard calendar used by the world to mark our perception of a specific interval of time.", "These arguments are very philosophical in nature and I won\u2019t explore them extensively here. However, I find that they do provide a very good framework for thinking about time series forecasting and its effectiveness in general.", "For instance, when a time series analyst tries to predict weather patterns \u2014 are they really trying to \u201cpredict\u201d anything?", "Temperature data \u2014 for the most part \u2014 is largely seasonal. For a country in the Northern Hemisphere, we can say with a high degree of certainty that the average temperature in June will be higher than that of February. The reason we can assert this is simply because many years of past data exists in order to back this up.", "For instance, an ARIMA model identifies the below temperature time series as having a strong seasonal component \u2014 and makes forecasts accordingly.", "In that regard, a time series analyst is not predicting the future so much as \u201cpredicting the past\u201d. A model can predict that a hot July month is on the way, but this is also something that has happened in the past. It is not new.", "That said, physics does make the argument that entropy is an inherent property of time \u2014 that \u201call things tend towards disorder\u201d. Let\u2019s take the weather example once again. With climate change and rising global temperatures becoming an ever-increasing concern, this could mean that temperature forecasts become increasingly inaccurate going forward.", "For instance, there is still debate as to whether climate change will result in higher average temperatures across all months \u2014 or if it might even result in a situation where the melting of polar ice caps would in fact result in a global cooling. Indeed, the result could be hotter temperatures in summer and colder temperatures in winter.", "I am not an expert in this area and don\u2019t want to jump in on either side of the debate. However, under the argument that entropy increases over time \u2014 this also means that past data becomes increasingly useless in predicting the future.", "Past data can only predict trends similar to that which occurred in the past \u2014 they cannot necessarily account for the uncertainty posed by a change that fundamentally alters a system.", "A classic example of this has been the effect of COVID-19 on the hospitality industry.", "I previously wrote several articles here on Medium regarding how time series analysis can be used to forecast hotel cancellations, using models such as ARIMA and LSTM.", "However, even these models could not have accounted for the fact that COVID-19 would effectively bring global travel to a standstill and hotels would need to close as a result of the pandemic.", "This was a \u201cblack swan\u201d event that would not have been accounted for in past data. It is important to remember that model output is only as good as the data that is being fed into that model\u200a\u2014\u200ait cannot necessarily account for entropy and the fact that the future is subject to a high degree of disorder and uncertainty.", "Increasingly, the field of time series is attempting to account for such uncertainty by recognizing the value of forecasting probabilities rather than making hard predictions of how a time series will trend in the future.", "For instance, here is a forecast of hotel cancellations using a posterior probability distribution through the TensorFlow probability library. For reference, a posterior probability distribution refers to a distribution whereby a probability of an event happening is assigned after relevant evidence (i.e. posterior data) is taken into account. In essence, the model is generating a probability distribution for hotel cancellations by using the prior posterior data as the available evidence.", "Here, the model is indicating that this particular hotel could expect to see approximately between 100\u2013200 cancellations per week. However, the probability forecast does also indicate that the hotel could potentially see as many as over 500 cancellations per week in an extreme scenario. While this also does not account for the effect of a hotel closing down under a COVID-19 scenario, it does get a hotel manager thinking \u2014 \u201cunder what circumstances could my hotel see 500 cancellations in the space of a week, and what should I do to safeguard against this?\u201d", "Let\u2019s contrast this forecast to that conducted using ARIMA.", "We see that the ARIMA model does predict the general trend of the test data with reasonable accuracy, although tends to overestimate the cancellation frequency in some instances. Granted, ARIMA can also incorporate probability into its forecasts, so the comparison between the two is not necessarily thorough.", "However, ARIMA relies strongly on identifying the proper p, d, q parameters along with the correct seasonal order. For reference, p = number of autoregressive terms, d = number of differences to make a time series stationary, q = moving average of previous forecast errors.", "Should a sudden change in the nature of the series occur, then these parameters can quickly become irrelevant to future forecasts.", "For instance, with the apparent rise of so-called \u201cstaycations\u201d during COVID-19, this could well cause a significant shift in the seasonal factor of hotel cancellations.", "A hotel could see a lower number of cancellations in the future for certain holiday periods given that flight costs are not a factor for local residents. On the other hand, cancellations could also rise as local customers might have more choices as to where they can stay, e.g. cancelling a hotel booking to stay with a friend.", "My main argument in all this is that time series needs to be mindful of the role of uncertainty in time series forecasting, and more willing to embrace experimentation when forecasting, i.e. what would the forecast look like if certain parameters were changed?", "For instance, instead of assuming that the seasonal effect in an ARIMA model will hold over time \u2014 what would the forecast look like if it was significantly altered?", "This \u201cscenario analysis\u201d method of forecasting will become increasingly valuable in the future. There is little value in a forecast that \u201cpredicts the past\u201d, but there is potentially a lot of value in those that can predict \u201cimagined futures\u201d.", "Ultimately, forecasting is a tool to predict the future. However, given that many potential futures exist, it only makes sense to generate many potential forecasts. All too often, we make the mistake of assuming that the future will always be the same as the past. The true value of time series analysis hinges on \u201cscenario planning\u201d \u2014 identifying the potential futures ahead of us and taking action to safeguard against extreme scenarios.", "Disclaimer: This article is written on an \u201cas is\u201d basis and without warranty.
