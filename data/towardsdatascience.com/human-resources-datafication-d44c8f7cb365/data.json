Human Resource (HR) strategy is the idea that sets a direction for all the key areas of HR. It is our increasing ability to use analytics to understand more about people, HR processes, and demographics. This includes activities with hiring, performance appraisals, development and compensation", "As data analysts/scientists in the HR space, we would develop a strategy to tackle HR goals and insights over the entire organization. We want to start off with Data we already have within the organization starting with our current employees. This might involve strengths and job descriptions across the organization. An example of this and a good solution would be to use an interactive organizational chart.", "Start by collecting everyones updated resume, continuing education history, performance appraisals, and projects completed. This gives you the ability to identify your current employees\u2019 knowledge, skills and strengths. An interactive organizational chart can be a tool beyond the basic job descriptions and skills.", "Evaluating performance reviews allows management to determine when employees are willing and able to assume additional responsibility. When employees consistently rank high then its time to take on some more challenging work. This blog is meant to describe some tips when analyzing HR strategy and activities within the firm.", "There are a few KPI\u2019s worth mentioning in the HR analytics space. The following 8 metrics are quantitatively evaluated.", "We want to collect and evaluate this data in order to define where we are as an organization in terms of HR. The culture and behaviors of employees makeup an organizations team atmosphere and it is HR\u2019s job to build a strategy for success. I have gathered Human Resource data provided by Kaggle.com in order to show an evaluation of an organization. CLICK HERE FOR LINK", "The first step of a data science project is to make sure we clean and evaluate our data. Cleaning involves dealing with null values, assessing what data is currently available to us, and using different cleansing techniques to organize the structure of our data. Big, dirty, messy, and incompatible data sources can lead to ineffective analytical models. We want to understand our data and here are a few ways on how to do that:", "Our output is 300 rows by 21 columns.", "Checking for NA results and learning how to deal with them. One way might be to fillna with 0:", "After some basic cleaning techniques we can start analyzing and evaluating. I personally like using Seaborn and Matplotlib in order to visualize my data. After viewing our data columns, I believe that evaluating pay_rate might be beneficial. We might even want to predict newer employees pay_rate based on performance scores, position and other characteristics! Let\u2019s take a look on our available data before trying to solve for new employees.", "Make sure to import seaborn as sns before running your line of code. What can we analyze employee pay rates?", "I\u2019d probably ask some questions about the \u201cNeeds Improvement\u201d performance score\u2026 Why are these employees at a higher pay rate than employees that \u201cExceed\u201d the employee performance scores. \u201cExceptional\u201d seems accurate.", "Our second chart shows pay rates based on positions in the company. Obviously, President and CEO are at a higher pay_rate than other employees. The positions/pay_rates seem to be accurate as long as they align with your company\u2019s HR strategy.", "Our next plot will help with analyzing some diversity within the organization. Diversity is a KPI when evaluating our Human Resource Strategy.", "Organizational diversity in the workplace refers to the total makeup of the employee workforce and the amount of diversity included. Diversity refers to differences in various defining personal traits such as age, gender, race, marital status, and many other secondary qualities.", "Take a look at some of our diversity evaluation bar plots below:", "It\u2019s not much of a difference but on average males have a higher pay_rate than females.", "We binned our ages based on decades in order to evaluate diversification based on age. We can see that our ages ranges are pretty diverse.", "After cleaning our data and evaluating pay rate based on performance scores positions, and diversity measures you should have a good sense of what our data looks like. Before we get into our modeling you always want to clean and evaluate our data.
