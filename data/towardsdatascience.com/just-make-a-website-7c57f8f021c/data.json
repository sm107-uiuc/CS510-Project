They write to communicate insights, they blog, and they tweet. The number of topics in the domain of data science is exceedingly vast. From NLP to facial recognition, from predicting customer churn to detecting rare deep space events, the bounds of focus are without limit. However, most data science experience involves Python and data collection: rarely do data scientists deal with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the so-called web dev languages. Ironically, this lack of design experience limits the reach of data scientists who might otherwise display their projects in a beautiful portfolio or blog. In reality, making your own data science website or blog is quite easy, despite the upfront fear of CSS and HTML, to such a degree that you can learn all you need in a few days to produce a beautiful personal website.", "There is a truly baffling amount of resources to make your own website, whether for personal or company use, and even more truly baffling amount of tutorials on how to make them, and this is one of them!", "My hope with this post is to provide a clean, up-to-date, minimal guide for making a website with little-to-zero knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.", "The most confusing parts of web development aren\u2019t even HTML or CSS. With Google and Stack Overflow, the tricks and tools for modifying a webpage\u2019s appearance are relatively straightforward. Rather, the difficulty comes from understanding how the technologies weave together, and what abstractions make up a \u2018website.\u2019", "This post will walk through the three main abstractions of a website:", "Here\u2019s a quick overview of what they do, just for a basic understanding or refresher.", "is \u2018hypertext markup language\u2019, and it\u2019s just used for laying out the building blocks of a webpage at the most basic level. All the tags you see like <p>code stuff</p> are HTML, and even right-clicking this page you\u2019re reading and clicking \u2018Inspect\u2019 will open your browser\u2019s editor to show you the immediate, backbone layout of the page. HTML mostly concerns big chunks of a webpage in terms of rectangles. HTML has nothing to do with style, color, or interactivity. Its code isn\u2019t really functional, or strictly-speaking programming. Rather, HTML is the bricks underneath the paint. You can\u2019t style it or interact with it, but you can paint it (CSS) and add doors and windows (JavaScript) later.", "is \u2018cascading style sheets\u2019, and it relates to appearance and style. It concerns different font families, different font sizes, colors, opacity, layering, and shape alterations. It may seem like the most surface level aspect of design, but CSS actually does quite a bit of heavy lifting for user-experience. Even the best under-the-hood design and functionality (driven by JavaScript) is useless without an intuitive feel driven by clever CSS utilization. Whenever you hover the cursor over a \u2018thumbs up\u2019 icon on social media and it changes color or size, that\u2019s the unconscious power of CSS driving a sleek and and satisfying user experience.", "is the actual bona-fide \u2018programming language\u2019 of the trio. A programming language is generally a title reserved for functionality and interactivity due to the context of interconnected abstractions, and JavaScript handles those abstractions in the form of functions and data flow under the hood of a website. Whenever a user clicks on a button, fills out a form or a search bar, or clicks on a link to another page, invisible scripts must be run to handle the intended effect. These come in the form of basic functions, as well as classes and objects.", "are things you shouldn\u2019t worry about for building your own website! Unless you\u2019re a master web developer or building a website from scratch for the challenge, you can pick up the tutorial-free basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript up as you go, and this is possible because of templates.", "It\u2019s a pre-developed codebase of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a simple enough backbone to alter intuitively. A lot of intro programmers might perceive this as cheating at first, because it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re building your own brand or putting in the effort. But it\u2019s crucial for the learning process, because HTML and CSS are best learned top-down. Tutorials just don\u2019t provide the personal investment necessary to learn.", "Formal tutorials provide structured knowledge, but building your own brand is a fundamentally messy and idiosyncratic process, and learning the basics of HTML tags and CSS rules will stick much better by using a beautiful template, and making small alterations as you go. First change the <title> and <p> tags to see what changes, and you will pretty quickly obtain a personalized, if stylistically unoriginal, website. Start altering some CSS rules to see how colors and fonts change, and pretty quickly you\u2019ll have developed your own stylized website. Learning is always a process of interconnected experience, and using a template is the fastest way to learn.", "Use Google to find \u2018free html5 templates\u2019 or \u2018free responsive html templates 2020\u2019, etc. There are endless options, so just pick one that looks nice and simple. I used HTML5 UP, a Creative Commons free template base, but any of them will be more or less the same. Github Pages is also integrated with Jekyll themes, another free template source, and because hosting (see Step 2) on Github pages is free, Jekyll is a great option for building a quick blog or personal website.", "Once you\u2019ve downloaded a template or theme, open up the file base as a new project in your favorite code editor, which should probably be Visual Studio Code, and start tinkering! The index.html file contains the HTML, the building blocks where you can mess around with text and structure, and the main.css file contains the CSS rules. Just play around and pretty quickly you\u2019ll see how much you can do without any tutorials. Open up the index.html file (which should open by default in your browser) to preview it, and then trial-and-error for hours by making small alterations to observe which code changes produce which visual changes. Then, only use tutorials or guides once you understand the context of your confusion enough to judge whether a tutorial will be worth it. Most of the time, a long sequence of quick Google/Stack-overflow solutions is all you really need to learn.", "This is a relatively simple step. Most of the effort behind building a website involves getting a webpage to look good, and a lot of that work is CSS. Once that\u2019s done, you just have to find a place for that code to live \u2018in the wild\u2019. If you want your website to be accessed from anywhere, anytime, then you should take advantage of any major free hosting service on the web. The standard free hosting location is Github Pages for smaller websites such as blogs and personal websites, and the process of setting it up is straightforward. It pretty much involves creating or initializing a repository on Github with the code on your computer (in the project directory you used in Visual Studio Code, for example), making it public, and setting up Github Pages in \u2018Settings\u2019. In \u2018Settings\u2019, scroll down to \u2018Source\u2019, and select \u2018master branch\u2019 in order to make the HTML code in that repository visible at: your_username.github.io/your_project_repository_name", "For example, if my Github profile name were bluepanda, and my website repository was named bamboo, and Github Pages is enabled in the manner above, then after a short delay the URL bluepanda.github.io/bamboo should display your website! A good Github Pages guide is here, though the documentation is always helpful for an up-to-date guide.", "How do you finally get your website set up at a custom domain name such as bamboo.com, rather than the slightly awkward bluepanda.github.io/bamboo ?This step is quite quick and easy, but a little strange and intimidating due to how complex configuring DNS settings feels. First, you\u2019ll need to look for a domain name provider! This will cost money, but usually on the order of $8\u2013$12 a year. It\u2019s as simple as searching for your custom desired domain such as bamboo.com on your provider of choice (a quick Google of \u2018domain name providers\u2019 should suffice to provide the main big ones, but they\u2019re all basically the same), and then paying!", "Then comes the DNS settings, and it\u2019s the trickiest part. The important thing to know is that it\u2019s easy to do, and you can worry about understanding it later. In the meantime, it\u2019s definitely worth just following the documentation step-by-step. The steps merely involve getting a CNAME file added to the repository by adding your custom domain name (such as bamboo.com) in the Github Pages settings, as well as setting up an A record with your DNS provider. A little Googling may be useful here if you run into confusion, but Github\u2019s documentation for setting up a domain name is pretty good.", "And that\u2019s it! Using an 1) HTML template, 2) Hosting it on Github Pages, and 3) Registering that repository with a custom domain name are all of the steps to creating your own website! Even if you\u2019re already quite experienced with some of the steps in this guide, I hope it\u2019s been useful to see how all the steps connect, since I\u2019ve found that rarely are Steps 1\u20133 in this guide integrated together in one tutorial.", "Your home for data science.
