And with the people comes politics, and with politics comes the money.", "That\u2019s why in the next years there will be a major push towards research in the Energy Sector, and Data Science is going to play a big role in this huge battle. Finding new patterns in the data is a clear path to obtaining powerful solutions for our energy-hungry world.", "In this article, we will take a look at some problematic case-scenarios in which Machine Learning and data-driven techniques are being proven to offer great solutions, possibly making this field one of the main protagonists in the war against Climate Change.", "One of the most trivial solutions to lower CO2 emissions would be consuming less energy, which is often produced burning fossil fuels.", "But looking at the trends of the last few years electricity demand doesn\u2019t seem to slow down: with the rise of electric cars (even though their environmental impact is surely lower than their fossil counterparts), this growing need is not likely to stop soon.", "Furthermore, nowadays we tend to put batteries everywhere: in bikes, clothing and even shoes. And batteries need electricity. Lots of electricity. Thus, reducing the number of occasions in which we need energy in our daily lives is far from being an easy fix.", "It is finally time to introduce the concept of Energy Efficiency.", "It\u2019s true, clean energy is coming.", "But the time in which 100% of energy produced comes from renewable sources is not so close unfortunately. We need to bridge the gap of our transition to clean energy with efficient ways to use dirty energy. Besides, even in an ideal, green society, making sure that efficiency is at its peak is no useless task.", "But why would a Data Scientist be interested in Energy Efficiency? It should be the job of mechanical, civil engineers and architects, shouldn\u2019t it?", "Looking at data and finding patterns can dramatically help in finding often out-of-the-box solutions in every field, including Energy Efficiency.", "Let\u2019s look at a case-study: data centers around the world use 3% of the energy produced on Earth. That\u2019s a lot!", "The cause of this huge energy usage is the need to keep the center at a certain temperature, avoiding overheating and breakdowns of the electronic components. As a consequence, if no clean energy is used to operate a data center, it can have a major effect on CO2 emissions. And let\u2019s not forget about the cost of operating these places.", "That\u2019s why Deepmind (an artificial intelligence company acquired by Google) in 2016 succeeded in lowering energy consumption in a Google data center by 40% (source). Tell this to any IT engineer and you will not be believed.", "The incredible result was achieved applying machine learning algorithms to a dataset of sensor data, acquired in the center over the years of operation. The goal of the algorithm was to predict the future PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness, which is the ratio of the total building energy usage to the IT energy usage) based on a number of parameters such as temperature, power and cooling setpoints.", "The final trained pedictive model, being \u201cconscious\u201d of the whole environment, was able to make smarter, non-linear decisions and could operate the data center in a substantially more efficient way, while keeping temperatures under control.", "While the traditional engineer has the expertise to make a single component, maybe a cooling fan, more efficient, data scientists are able to look at the big picture, often finding an easier and more powerful solution to the problem.", "What about our schools, offices and houses?", "It is well know that heating and cooling takes a big chunk of the electricity bill of any building: a 2011 study shows that increasing efficiency in buildings represents the biggest opportunity to lower greenhouse gas emissions.", "If we could find a way to create an algorithm to make HVAC systems (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) way more efficient in general, CO2 emissions would be greatly reduced, along with the energy bills. The biggest obstacle is the lack of sensors to acquire the data and the uniqueness of each different building.", "Reinforcement Learning comes to the rescue.", "A number of recent studies propose Reinforcement Learning (RL, a branch of machine learning in which an agent interacts with an environment, becoming progressively better at a specified goal defined by a reward function) as the solution: applying this kind of algorithm to increase efficiency of different buildings shows incredible and promising results, with up to 70% (!!!) reduction in HVAC energy usage (source).", "No sensor data is needed in RL.", "An agent is given free control of the heating and cooling in a computer simulation of the actual building, where it is free to explore the consequences of its decisions and learn how to consume less energy while keeping the desired temperature. This makes the solution flexible to every kind of building, cost effective and easy to implement thanks to the installation of a simple smart thermostat.", "The transition to 100% renewable energy comes with a drawback, and Data Science may offer the solution once again.", "Solar power and wind power are highly unpredictable: that\u2019s why supplying the grid exclusively on these kinds of renewables may have a negative effect on the overall grid stability. Furthermore, we must take also into account the growing number of electric cars in the streets, and their consequent need of large \u201cquantities\u201d of electricity, which may also represent a problem.", "Thus, we can associate a \u201cvalue\u201d to the clean energy produced, which correlates to the need of power of the grid in a particular moment in time. If the value is high, it means that putting that electricity into the grid makes it more stable and reliable.", "Is there a way to maximize this \u201cvalue\u201d for a particular wind or solar farm?", "This is the question that Deepmind once again tried to answer in a recent research study: the researchers applied a neural network on available weather forecast data and turbine data of a wind farm to predict the power output 36 hours ahead. The trained network then allows to boost the value of the energy produced (by roughly 20%) and thus to contribute to the power grid when it is most needed.", "As illustrated in this article, several data-driven solutions are being tested to help lower greenhouse gas emissions and guide us to a completely renewable future. And many more are being studied right now.", "A real world implementation of these findings is very much needed: if you are interested, the opportunities in this field are now more that ever.", "Data Science has the ability to contribute to this battle, and knowing how much it can do, it absolutely should.", "Your home for data science.
