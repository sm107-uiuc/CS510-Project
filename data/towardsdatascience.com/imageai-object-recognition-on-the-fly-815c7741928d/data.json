Here\u2019s an exercise. Look out the window and count how many objects you can recognize. Object recognition is bringing that part of the human faculty into a computer. It enables a breadth of applications previously very difficult for a computer \u2014 from self-driving cars to advanced security. Your Facebook face recognition to traffic management.", "Computer vision has truly gone far from classifying entire images into recognizing individual objects in the image. That\u2019s the difference from, \u201cHere\u2019s a picture of road with vehicles\u201d to \u201cThere\u2019s 12\u201315 cars and 4\u20136 motorcycles in this photo\u201d. That\u2019s an algorithm that gives sufficient context to declare say, \u201cmedium traffic\u201d.", "A lot of the big cloud providers have ready-made APIs to do this. There\u2019s Google, Microsoft and Amazon\u2019s implementations. If you have the budget, then simply plug it in your application and you\u2019ll have the Not Hotdogs app. But I want to focus on something that you can get your hands dirty with. Most of these APIs are powered by deep learning models and in object recognition, YOLO is your guy. I recommend checking out their amazing opener for the YOLO v3 implementation:", "We present some updates to YOLO! We made a bunch of little design changes to make it better. We also trained this new network that\u2019s pretty swell. It\u2019s a little bigger than last time but more accurate. It\u2019s still fast though, don\u2019t worry.", "The authors have a sense of humor but don\u2019t let that fool you. It is a great algorithm. It is named You Only Look O nce since the algorithm\u2019s main contribution is that it is very fast. Other models perform a two-stage region proposal and object classification stage. YOLO uses a single model to output the bounding boxes and the class probabilities. It blows away other algorithms in terms of speed and accuracy.", "There\u2019s an open-source library for that. ImageAI is a Python library that can easily enable developers to do object recognition with off-the-shelf trained models. One can also do custom training with their own objects.", "I tried the simple recognition use case in this Kaggle notebook. It\u2019s as simple as the following snippet:", "I tried it out on the Open Images dataset, picking out pictures with at least one \u201cPerson\u201d object in it. The YOLO model was off-the-shelf from ImageAI, which is trained on 80 classes including persons, vehicles and house items. I set the model to output regions with a probability to be an object to be greater than 50%.", "From left to right. (1) 100% a person, but notice the tie. (2) It\u2019s amazing that overlapping bounding boxes are recognized. (3) An out-of-focus person can still be recognized. (4 & 5) Drawings are recognized as persons. (6\u20138) Multiple persons can be detected. (9) The model thought there were two dogs.", "(1) This is an example where the algorithm is stumped. (2) Feeling good! (3) The 404 message is mislabeled as a clock. (4) Multiple persons mislabeled as a single person. (5) I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s happening here \u2014 some kind of party? (6) Wrong labels all around! (7\u20139) All correct.", "(1) I don\u2019t think this image contain a person anyway! (2) Pretty cool that a bowl was found. (3\u20139) Persons!", "The image with the person walking through rubble raises a possibility that this same technology can help disaster recovery efforts. Drones that patrol forest fires or floods for example can recognize stranded persons.", "It outputs the objects in a Python dict so you should be able to manipulate it easy for your app. Here\u2019s a mundane application. Being able to tell individual objects in a photo can auto-sort your growing stockpile of camera images. Or at the very least, spot clocks, bowls and skateboards.", "Your home for data science.
