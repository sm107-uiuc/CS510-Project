While most languages might limit the ways you can do certain things, Julia tends to give the programmer a toybox and say", "This makes for some very interesting expressions inside of Julia that can be incredibly useful for in-line programming. Included in these interesting expressions are both dispatch lines and duck-typing, which I discussed previously in this article. However, there is also another fantastic tool that Julia programmers have at their disposal I would like to bring to your attention:", "Though their name may be a bit misleading, and sound relatively standard, they are certainly anything but. Syntactical expressions in Julia are part of the fundamental methodology of the language, and make the language far easier to type, especially given that everything is put into a method in Julia. What you might be surprised to learn is that both Julia\u2019s dispatch and the object-oriented programming trick are both indeed the culmination of syntactical expressions.", "Syntactical expressions in Julia use the assertion operand, better known as the equal sign. In Julia, this operand becomes a lot more useful, as it can be paired with functions, logic, and variables on either end. Consider this subtract 5 function I wrote:", "While this function is relatively concise, we can use a syntactical expression to apply the logic anytime the function is used in one line rather than three, without ever having to properly define a function at all. As I briefly mentioned, on the other end of the assertion operand we can place logic as well, and this will define a new function for us.", "Not only is the second example far superior in the way it is written, it will also give us a slight boost in performance!", "While that small of a performance boost might be somewhat in the margin of error, it seems to be relatively consistent. And to have the same logic in a third of the lines is certainly a step up in readability. However, as I said; this is only the beginning of the long list of abilities we have at our fingertips with syntactical expressions.", "The first and most obvious use that all Julia programmers are likely aware of is using syntactical expressions to dispatch Julia types to different functions. We can apply this system to our subtract five function, for example:", "Now we have a function to handle subtracting five from an integer, as well as subtracting five from an array. Thanks to syntactical expressions, we can dispatch these two types under the same method based on what type of variable we pass through that method. This is a very practical use for syntactical expressions, and is very commonly used inside of the Julia language.", "What is not as commonly used in the Julia language, however, is duck-typing. Using syntactical expressions, we can actually manipulate the Julia language to type more like an object-oriented programming language by creating syntactical methods and then asserting them as children of a type.", "And we can use those methods just like we would in a similar object-oriented programming language:", "But the uses don\u2019t stop there. Let\u2019s bring our roots back into mind for a second, and think about how this can apply to machine-learning. Of course, there are often in-line statistics that can be done, but I think a good example of actually applying this concept to models is sigmoid or relu. Consider this sigmoid function:", "Though this function is certainly fine, and concise enough to get you the job, I think taking it a step further with a syntactical expression will swoon any employer far more than a regular function ever could:", "Syntactical expressions are definitely one of the greatest defining features in Julian programming. Not only do they make the language incredibly expressive and straightforward, they also form their own methodology entirely just by having a few extra uses for one operand, which is pretty cool in my opinion. Syntactical expressions are the driving force behind Julia\u2019s multi-paradigm flexibility and provide the language with several key concepts that sometimes aren\u2019t even generic. Overall, this syntax is certainly a big advantage that I have enjoyed having on my side inside of the Julia programming language.", "Your home for data science.
