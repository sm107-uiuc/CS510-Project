What we first think is image datasets. This is because Deep learning and image datasets have a special relationship. Deep learning became popular mainly due its capability to do wonders on images. Few years back, we were all thrilled when deep learning was able to distinguish between an image of a dog vs image of a cat, or horse vs zebra. The excitement only increased when deep learning entered the field of object detection in an image. Those bounding boxes of various colors around different objects in an image looked very cool", "This special relation of image and deep learning has also fuelled almost all literature around deep learning tutorials. For many of the techniques , such as understanding black-box models, the examples which are used are image datasets. The MNIST digits image dataset has become the \u201cHello World\u201d of deep learning tutorials. Image datasets have been a great source to understand deep learning.", "But what about the good old tabular data? Most of the enterprise data as well as our personal data is in form of tabular data. There will be immense value in using deep learning for tabular data. However the literature of applying deep learning to tabular data is in short-supply", "With this story, my attempt is show how deep learning can be immensely useful for tabular datasets.", "In order to illustrate this, let us take a very simple example of Titanic Survival data. Many data scientists will already know this very famous dataset from Kaggle. For those who are unaware of this dataset, it is data of passengers in the fatal Titanic accident. For illustration purposes, here is a sample extract of this dataset", "Now let us apply deep learning to this tabular dataset. Deep learning is based on neural networks which are inspired by how our brain works. You have \u201cinput\u201d neurons which picks up signals and sends them to \u201coutput\u201d neurons", "In our case, the inputs are fields like Family (Parent+Sibling), Fare, Age, Passenger Class (Pclass), Embarkment port, Sex. And output is whether the passenger survived or not.", "Our deep learning architecture , illustrated here, has input neurons, followed by 10 intermediate neurons and 2 output neurons. The input neurons are sending signals to intermediate neurons , which are then sending signals to output neurons. This network of neurons, also called neural network, is shown below for visualisation purposes. The \u201cblue\u201d line indicates a \u201cpositive\u201d signal and \u201cred\u201d line indicated a \u201cnegative\u201d signal", "It looks messy, isn't it ? However let us explore different parts and see what things we can interpret", "A tabular dataset is mainly a collection of rows and columns. We are always interested to know what is the importance of the columns. In case of the Titanic dataset, one way to check the importance of columns is to see whether it has an influence on the whether the person survived or not.", "The neural network on tabular data can inform which input columns influence the output columns. Shown below is neural network only for signals of high strength which are emitted by from neuron \u201cSex_Male\u201d. The signal gets transmitted towards neuron \u201cDied\u201d. This signifies that most of the male passengers did not survive", "So deep learning can help us to reach such analysis without having to go through each and every columns", "Tabular datasets are much rich and complex as compared to an image. Given that there are many columns, it is always useful to find out what are the important column combinations. Generally we are used to manually finding what are the important columns in any tabular dataset. We tend to make pivot tables , sort, apply formulas in order to find important columns combinations.", "What if I told you that deep learning will automatically do that for you ? It sounds like magic, but it is true. And because of this, it is called \u201cdeep\u201d learning. The middle layer of neural network will try to find all combinations of input which have an influence on the output.", "One such example in the titanic dataset is illustrated below. The \u201cred\u201d indicates a \u201cnegative\u201d signal. We see that combination of neuron \u201cAge\u201d and neuron \u201cPclass\u201d (Passenger Class) passing a negative signal to neuron \u201cDied\u201d. This means that less the Age (negative signal) and less the Passenger Class (Negative signal), the passenger did not die (survived)", "Passenger Class on Titanic were 1st class, 2nd class and 3rd Class. So less class value means 1st class from a numeric perspective.", "To confirm this, we can make a scatter plot between Passenger Class and Age as shown below. The color of the points show whether passenger survived or not. This scatter plot analysis indicates that passenger with less age (children) in first or second class survived.", "Now without deep learning, you would have to make scatter plot for all combinations of columns manually. But deep learning was automatically able to learn from the data the important combinations in the data", "Let us say you were asked to make a short summary of a tabular data. How do you go about just by looking at bunch of rows and columns. Deep learning can help you. As deep learning is inspired by \u201cbrain\u201d architecture, it tries to \u201cunderstand\u201d the underlying structure of the tabular data.", "The way this is done is to look at what each neuron is \u201clearning\u201d or \u201cunderstanding\u201d about the data. For illustration purposes, shown below are all neurons which impact the \u201cSurvived\u201d neuron. As we see from the visualisation that neuron 7 and neuron 8 have an impact on the \u201cSurvived\u201d neuron.", "We can see that neuron 7 has a \u201cpostive\u201d (blue) signal towards neuron \u201cSurvived\u201d and neuron 8 has \u201cnegative\u201d (red) signal towards neuron \u201cSurvived\u201d (means Died).", "Now we can analyse what is \u201cinside\u201d the neurons 7 and 8. This will show us what these neurons have learned about the data. We can \u201cpeek\u201d inside neuron to see this. Each neuron can be represented in terms of strengths received from input neurons. We can visualise the \u201cinside\u201d of neuron using a radar chart", "So inside neuron7, we see that it has high value on Female, Fare, Age and low value on Pclass. And neuron7 is sending a positive (blue) signal to neuron Survived.", "Similarly the neuron8 has high value on Pclass and low value on Fare, Female. This neuron is sending a negative (red) signal to neuron Survived", "So we can make following two line summary", "\u201cPassengers who were Female, paying high Fare and travelling 1st class had high probability of surviving.", "Passengers who were male, paying low Fare and were in 2nd or 3rd class had less probability of surviving\u201d", "This is amazing. It is like having an expert analyst with you, who would look at rows and columns and try to understand what the data means. It feels that you are Iron Man and Deep learning is Jarvis , who is assisting you with all analysis", "So that was a brief overview of how we can use deep learning to analyse tabular data. There are many other interesting ways. So friends, let us break this strong relation between Deep learning and image datasets.", "Now Deep learning has a new friend \u2014 tabular datasets.", "You can visit my website to make analytics with zero coding. https://experiencedatascience.com", "Please subscribe to stay informed whenever I release a new story.", "You can also join Medium with my referral link.", "Your home for data science.
