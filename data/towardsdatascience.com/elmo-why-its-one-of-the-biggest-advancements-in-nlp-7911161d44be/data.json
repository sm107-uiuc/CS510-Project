ELMo has been shown to yield performance improvements of up to almost 5%. But what makes this idea so revolutionary?", "What\u2019s ELMo? Not only is he a Muppet, but ELMo is also a powerful computational model that converts words into numbers. This vital process allows machine learning models (which take in numbers, not words, as inputs) to be trained on textual data.", "Why is ELMo so good? There are a few primary points that stood out to me when I read through the original paper:", "Let\u2019s go through each of these points in detail and talk about why they\u2019re important.", "#1: ELMo can uniquely account for a word\u2019s context. Previous language models such as GloVe, Bag of Words, and Word2Vec simply produce an embedding based on the literal spelling of a word. They do not factor in how the word is being used. For example, these language models would return the same embedding for \u201ctrust\u201d in the following examples:", "They have no trust left for their friend.", "ELMo, however, returns different embeddings for the same word depending on the words around it \u2014 its embeddings are context-sensitive. It would actually return different answers for \u201ctrust\u201d in these examples because it would recognize that the word is being used in different contexts. This unique ability essentially means that ELMo\u2019s embeddings have more available information, and thus performance will probably increase. A similar language modeling method that accounts for context is BERT.", "#2: ELMo was trained on a lot of data. Whether you\u2019re a veteran machine learning researcher or just a casual observer, you\u2019re probably familiar with the power of big data. The original ELMo model was trained on a corpus of 5.5 billion words, and even the \u201csmall\u201d version had a training set of 1 billion words. That\u2019s a lot of data! Being trained on that much data means that ELMo has learned a lot of linguistic knowledge and will perform well on a wide scope of datasets.", "#3: ELMo can be used by anyone! One of the most important factors that has driven the growth of machine learning as a field is the culture of making research open-source. By making code and datasets open-source, researchers can allow others in the field to easily apply and build on existing ideas. Conforming to this culture, ELMo is extensively open-source. It has a website which includes not only basic information about it, but also download links for the small, medium, and original versions of the model. People looking to use ELMo should definitely check out this website to get a quick copy of the model. Moreover, the code is published on GitHub and includes a pretty-extensive README that lets users know how to use ELMo. I\u2019d be surprised if it took anyone more than a few hours to get a working ELMo model going.", "A powerful combination of context-aware word embeddings and big data, ELMo has achieved state-of-the-art performance on big datasets in NLP, including SQuAD, NER, and SST. ELMo has revolutionized how we approach computational linguistics tasks such as question-answering and sentiment detection, and it\u2019s obviously a key advancement in the field, as it has been cited more than 4,500 times. Furthermore, submissions to the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) conference, the largest international NLP conference, doubled following the publication of ELMo, from 1,544 submissions in 2018 to 2,905 submissions in 2019 (though this could also be attributed to the publication of BERT in early 2019).", "I would also point out that ELMo is pretty similar to BERT in that they\u2019re both from Sesame Street! Okay fine \u2014 they\u2019re both language models that account for a word\u2019s context, were trained on a large dataset, and are revolutionizing the field of NLP as we know it. (I\u2019ve written a blog post on BERT as well, which you can find here if you\u2019re interested).", "ELMo is one of the biggest advancements in NLP because it was essentially the first language model that brought contextualization into focus, allowing for better performance across a multitude of tasks.", "Your home for data science.
