It is by no means comprehensive but aims to highlight key technical points within each topic. The problems discussed are from this data science interview newsletter which features questions from top tech companies and will be involved in an upcoming book.", "Random variables are a core topic within probability and statistics, and interviewers are generally looking for an understanding of the principles and basic ability to manipulate them.", "For any given random variable X, it has the following properties (below we assume X is continuous, but the analogous holds for discrete random variables). The expectation (average value) is given by:", "and the variance is given by:", "For any given random variables X and Y, the covariance, a linear measure of relationship, is defined by:", "and normalization of covariance is the correlation between X and Y:", "There are many probability distributions, and interviewers generally aren\u2019t testing whether you\u2019ve memorized specific properties on each (although it is helpful to know basics), but more so that you can apply them to specific situations properly. Because of this, the most commonly discussed one in Data Science Interviews is the Normal distribution, which has many real-life applications. For a single variable the probability density is given by the following, for a mean and variance parameter:", "For fitting parameters, there are two general methods. In maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) the goal is estimate the most likely parameters given a likelihood function:", "Since the values of X are assumed to be i.i.d, then the likelihood function becomes:", "It is convenient to take logs (since log is a monotonically increasing function, maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood):", "Another way of fitting parameters is through maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP), which assumes a prior distribution.", "where the similar log-likelihood from before applies.", "Generally, interviewers won\u2019t expect you to delve deeply into linear algebra unless there are specific machine learning emphases. However, it is still helpful to review basics since it helps with the understanding of various algorithms and theoretical underpinnings. There are many sub-topics within linear algebra, but one sub-topic worth discussing briefly is eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Mechanically, for some square matrix A, we have a vector x is an eigenvector of A if:", "Since a matrix is a linear transformation, eigenvectors are cases whereby the resulting transformation of the matrix on that vector results in the same direction as before, although with some scaling factor (the eigenvalues). There are many real-life use cases of eigenvalues and eigenvectors: for example, identifying the orientation of large datasets (discussed in PCA), or for dynamical systems (how a system oscillates and how quickly it will stabilize).", "The decomposition of a square matrix into its eigenvectors is called an eigendecomposition. Note that while not all matrices are square, through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), every matrix has a decomposition:", "Although the mathematical details are beyond the scope of this discussion, both eigendecomposition and SVD are worth looking into in detail before your technical interview.", "This is a topic occasionally asked in interviews due to relevance with overfitting and model selection. With any model, we generally are trying to estimate a true underlying:", "through data where w is usually noise that is zero-mean and a Gaussian random variable. As mentioned prior, MLE and MAP are reasonable ways to deduce parameters. To assess how well the model fits, we can decompose the error of y as the following:", "There is a trade-off between bias and variance, and this is a useful framework for thinking about how different models operate. The overall goal is to control overfitting (and not generalizing well out of sample) to produce stable and accurate models.", "This method is one of the most frequently taught methods and has many real-life applications, ranging from predicting housing prices to studying the efficacy of medical trials. Interviewers asking this are generally trying to assess your understanding of the basic formulations and occasionally the relevance of knowing some of the theory to real life applications.", "In linear regression, the goal is to estimate y = f(x) of the following form:", "where X is a matrix of data points and \u03b2 the vector of weights. In the least-squares context, linear regression minimizes the residual sum-of-squares (RSS), which is given by:", "In regression, one can use MLE to estimate the \u03b2 values by using a multivariate Gaussian:", "which leads to results that are the same as minimizing the RSS. For a MAP context, there can be priors for \u03b2, of which leads to Ridge Regression, which penalizes the weights to prevent overfitting. In Ridge regression, the objective function becomes minimizing:", "This topic is less common in interviews but is often alluded to during discussions about data-preprocessing or feature engineering. Decomposing data into a smaller set of variables is very useful for summarizing and visualizing data. This overall process is called dimensionality reduction. One common method of dimensionality reduction is Principal Components Analysis (PCA), which reconstructs data into a lower dimensional setting. It looks for a small number of linear combinations of a vector x (say it is p-dimensional) to explain the variance within x. More specifically, we want to find the vector w of weights such that we can define the following linear combination:", "Hence we have the following procedural description where first we find the first component with maximal variance, and then the second that is uncorrelated with the first, and continue this procedure iteratively. The idea is to end with say, k dimension such that", "Using some algebra, the final result is an eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix of X, whereby the first principal component is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue and so on.", "Classification is commonly asked during interviews since due to the the abundance of real-life applications. Tech companies love to ask about classifying customers and users into different segments.", "The goal of classification is to assign a given data point to one of K classes, instead of a continuous value (as in regression), and there are two types of models. The first is generative which models the joint probability distribution between X and Y. That is, for an input X, we want to classify an arbitrary data point x with the following class label:", "This joint distribution between X and Y is given by:", "and for each given class k we have:", "The result of maximizing the posterior means there will be decision boundaries between classes where the resulting posterior probability is equal.", "The second is discriminative, which directly learn a decision boundary by choosing a class that maximizes the posterior probability distribution:", "So both methods end up choosing a predicted class that maximize the posterior; the difference is just in the approach.", "One of the popular classification algorithms is logistic regression, and is often asked in conjunction with linear regression during interviews as a way to assess basic knowledge on classification algorithms. In logistic regression, we take a linear output and convert it to a probability between 0 and 1 using the sigmoid function:", "In matrix form, the decision looks like the following, where a 1 is the target class if the output is at least 0.5:", "The loss function for logistic regression is the log-loss:", "Note that the posterior is being modeled directly and hence logistic regression is a discriminative model.", "Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is not a commonly asked topic during interviews but serves as an interesting topic to know since it is a generative model rather than a discriminative model (which logistic regression was). It assumes that given some class k, the distribution of any data from that class follows a multivariate Gaussian:", "Recall from Bayes rule that maximizing the joint probability over labels is equivalent to maximizing the posterior probability, so LDA aims to maximize:", "where f(x) for each k is the class density function. LDA assumes that densities are multivariate Gaussian, and additionally assumes that the covariance matrix is common among all classes. The resulting decision boundary is linear (and hence the name), as there is also Quadratic Discriminant Analysis where the boundary is quadratic.", "Decision trees and random forests are commonly asked during interviews since they are flexible and often well-performing models in practice. In particular, it helps to have a basic understanding of how both are trained and used, as well as how the feature splits occur (entropy and information gain).", "A decision tree is a model that can be represented in a tree fashion whereby at each split, there is a separation based on features, resulting in various leaf nodes whereby there is a result (classification or regression). For this discussion, we will focus on the classification setting. They are trained in a greedy and recursive fashion starting at the root, where the goal is to choose splits that increases the most certainty on which class a particular data point belongs to.", "The entropy of a random variable Y quantifies the uncertainty of its values, and is given by the following, for a discrete variable Y which takes on k states:", "For a simple Bernoulli random variable, this quantity is highest when p = 0.5 and lowest when p = 0 or p = 1, which aligns intuitively with the definition since if p = 0 or 1, then there is no uncertainty on the result. Generally, if a random variable has high entropy, then its distribution is closer to a uniform one than a skewed one.", "Consider an arbitrary split. We have H(Y) from the beginning training labels, and say we have some feature X that we want to split on. We can characterize the reduction in uncertainty by the information gain, which is given by:", "The larger this quantity, the higher the reduction in uncertainty in Y by splitting on X. Therefore, the general process is to assess all features in consideration and choose the feature that maximizes this information gain. Then, recursively continue the process for the two resulting branches.", "Typically an individual decision tree may be prone to overfitting, so in practice, usually random forests yield better out-of-sample predictions. A random forest is an ensemble method that utilizes many decision trees and averages the decision from them. It reduces overfitting and correlation between the trees by two methods: 1) bagging (bootstrap aggregation), whereby some m < n (where n is the total number of) data points are arbitrarily sampled with replacement and used as the training set, 2) a random subset of the features are considered at each split (to prevent always splitting on any particular feature).", "Clustering is a popular interview topic since there are many real life applications. It is often done for data visualization, and can be used to identify outliers that useful in cases like fraud detection. It also helps to have a basic understanding of how the parameters are learned in this context, versus an MLE/MAP approach from prior.", "The goal of clustering is to partition a dataset into various clusters looking only at the input features. This is an example of unsupervised learning. Ideally, the clustering has two properties:", "K-means clustering partitions data into k clusters and starts by choosing centroids of each of the k clusters arbitrarily. Iteratively, it updates partitions by assigning points to the closest cluster, updating centroids, and repeating until convergence.", "Mathematically, K-means solves the following problem by minimizing the following loss function (given points, and centroid values):", "The iterative process continues until the cluster assignment updates does not further the objective function.", "A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a model whereby for any given data point x, we assume that it comes from one of k clusters, each with a particular Gaussian Distribution.", "That is, among the K classes we have:", "where the \u03c0 coefficients are the mixing coefficients on the clusters and are normalized so they sum up to 1. Let \u03b8 denote the unknown mean and variance parameters for each of the K classes, along with K the mixing coefficients. Then the likelihood is given by:", "The parameters can be calculated iteratively used Expectation-Maximization (EM) which is discussed below.", "Expectation Maximization (EM) is a method to estimate parameters for latent variables, such as the two examples of K-means and GMMs above, whereby some variables can be observed directly, whereas others are latent and cannot be observed directly. In particular, for clustering, the cluster assignment is the latent variable since that is not directly observed.
