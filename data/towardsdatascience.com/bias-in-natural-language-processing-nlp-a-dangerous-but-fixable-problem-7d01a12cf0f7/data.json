Essentially, it\u2019s when machine learning algorithms express implicit biases that often pass undetected during testing because most papers test their models for raw accuracy. Take, for example, the following instances of deep learning models expressing gender bias. According to our deep learning models,", "In these examples, the algorithm is essentially expressing stereotypes, which differs from an example such as \u201cman is to woman as king is to queen\u201d because king and queen have a literal gender definition. Kings are defined to be male and queens are defined to be female. Computer programmers are not defined to be male and homemakers are not defined to be female, so \u201cMan is to woman as computer programmer is to homemaker\u201d is biased.", "Other forms of bias other than gender bias are also prominent in our models. Here are examples of some other forms of bias:", "Now if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019re probably thinking: But how can machines be biased if they don\u2019t have emotions?", "The key is that machine learning models learn patterns in the data. So let\u2019s say our data tends to put female pronouns around the word \u201cnurse\u201d and male pronouns around the word \u201cdoctor.\u201d Our model will learn those patterns from and learn that nurse is usually female and doctor is usually male. Whoops. By no fault of our own, we\u2019ve accidentally trained our model to think doctors are male and nurses are female.", "So how do you address this? Like many problems, bias in NLP can be addressed at the early stage or at the late stages. In this instance, the early stage would be debiasing the dataset, and the late stage would be debiasing the model.", "Solution A: debias the datasets. For this to be successful, we first have to remove existing datasets that contain biases. For example, MIT recently withdrew a popular computer vision dataset called Tiny Images after learning that it was filled with social biases, including racist, misogynistic, and demeaning labels. This doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t use those datasets, but it means that we should remove them and edit them to account for bias. Similarly, new datasets must be checked to account for bias. As of now, the most agreed-upon way to debias datasets is diversifying the dataset. For example, if a dataset consistently puts female pronouns around the word \u201cnurse,\u201d it can be debiased by adding data in which nurses are male.", "Solution B: debias the models. This is done by modifying the actual vector-representations of words. For example, the Hard Debias algorithm and Double-Hard Debias algorithm modify the vector-representations to remove stereotyping-information (such as the link between \u201creceptionist\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d) while maintaining useful gender information (such as the link between \u201cqueen\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d). These algorithms show promising results and are definitely a good step in addressing NLP bias.", "Do we still have time to address bias? Though NLP has progressed rapidly as a field, it\u2019s never too late to address bias in NLP models. No matter how we address these bias issues, however, we still have to address them as early as possible, preferably before the models reach a real-world setting. Here\u2019s an example where bias wasn\u2019t caught, and a biased model ended up reaching real-world application and having big consequences:", "COMPAS, an artificial intelligence system used in various states, is designed to predict whether or not a perpetrator is likely to commit another crime. The system, however, turned out to have an implicit bias against African Americans, predicting double the amount of false positives for African Americans than for Caucasians. Because this implicit bias was not caught before the system was deployed, many African Americans were unfairly and incorrectly predicted to re-offend.", "COMPAS, an AI to help law enforcement identify low-risk and high-risk criminals, turned out to be implicitly biased against African Americans. Image obtained from ProPublica, the organization that discovered these biases.", "Bias in NLP is a pressing issue that must be addressed as soon as possible. The consequences of letting biased models enter real-world settings are steep, and the good news is that research on ways to address NLP bias is increasing rapidly. Hopefully, with enough effort, we can ensure that deep learning models can avoid the trap of implicit biases and make sure that machines are able to make fair decisions.", "Your home for data science.
