As the name suggests the Bin Packing Problem comes up every time we have to \u201cfill\u201d something with something else.As you can imagine there are n-dimensional variants that take into account other useful information such as volume or cost (Knapsack Problem).", "Let\u2019s start warming up the engines. We are going to use just this two packages:", "To install them, just type this in the command prompt \ud83d\udcbb:", "Now let\u2019s open our favorite notebook or IDE and start code by importing the two packages.", "Here is one of my favorite steps: the parameters definition.", "\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Let\u2019s firstly define the number of bins we want, then the dictionary containing the estimated/measured value of the resources at our disposal.", "To each key of the dictionary will correspond the estimation of the contribution value of that resource. Yes, a sort of score.", "Given the extreme complexity in the search for the optimal solution in NP-hard problems, we could not succeed without a greedy approach. Here comes into play the binpacking package.", "\ud83e\uddee Greedy algorithms allow to get to solutions of difficult problems in an approximate but acceptable way. In short, with greedy approaches, we pay the solution of the problem at the expense of its accuracy.", "The use of the package is extremely easy.", "Done! Incredibly painless. Let\u2019s try to visualize the result in a different way cleaning up the values using a list comprehension.", "We staffed all the resources and created 6 (probably) balanced groups.", "Ok, but now it\u2019s time to see how the algorithm performed. Let\u2019s find out if the groups are truly balanced between them.", "What we expect are 6 groups each with a total value very close to the sum of the total values divided by the number of groups.", "So it\u2019s easy to calculate the ideal value per group and the values of the found groups.", "\ud83d\udcca Let\u2019s try to show them.", "Here is the graph: the red horizontal line represents the ideal average desired value per each group (Fig.2).", "Ta daa! As we expected we built 6 balanced groups. Each group has in fact a score very close the idealValue (11.666). I think the goal is (approximately) achieved. \ud83e\udd73", "Remember, in fact, that what we have obtained is a solution compatible with our problem but not optimal, since we used a greedy algorithm.", "In short, the Bin Packing Problem is really very common in everyday life.Greedy approaches like the one just seen (bin packing can be solved by using different greedy approaches) can come useful in a good set of occasions especially if they are extremely easy to implement.", "Some food for thought? What if we want to try to take into account the cost of items? What if we also want to integrate a 2nd or 3rd dimension?Probably the simple 1D Bin Packing would fit a bit tight.", "I think we should talk about it in the next articles\u2026 So, stay tuned! \ud83d\ude09", "\ud83e\udd1d If you have any doubts, feedback or requests for collaboration, please do not hesitate to contact me on Linkedin.
