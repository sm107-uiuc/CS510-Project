A child is exposed to a vast amount of signals (through eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and nerves) and his brain learns/adapts quickly as to how to analyze these signals and react to them. After the spoken language, then came the advent of written language which created vast repositories of data that can be analyzed to date.", "So many people state that we have entered the era of Big Data just now, but the data was all around us always, it\u2019s just that the amount of \u201cRecorded\u201d data has started booming due to 4 main factors which have also contributed to Machine Learning becoming so popular nowadays (The following 4 points were put forth in an informative guide released by AnalyticsVidhya):", "Now, let\u2019s talk a bit more about history to understand the two fields that this post is all about- Data Mining and Machine Learning", "Data Mining came into being in the 1930s, originally known as knowledge discovery in databases, and Machine learning was introduced around the 1950s when the first ML program Samuel\u2019s Checker program was released.", "It involves a systematic hunt for nuggets of actionable intelligence in the existing data available.", "The field of study interested in the development of computer algorithms to transform the data into intelligent action is known as Machine learning.", "Now, that the boring definitions are out of our way, let\u2019s jump into the most interesting part, the differences!", "Data Mining is a subset of business analytics and it focuses on teaching a computer \u2014 how to identify previously unknown patterns, relationships, or anomalies in the large data sets that humans can then use to solve a business problem. This is a manual process that requires human intervention and decision making. The process can be made intelligent by a human by introducing smart features.", "For example: If a credit card company has a lot of data on customer behavior and they want to understand the patterns of customer attrition, then they will deploy data mining techniques to find out associations between different customer characteristics which can strongly indicate customer attrition in future.", "Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and it focuses on teaching a computer \u2014 how to learn to analyze large datasets and \u201clearn\u201d the patterns in it (from the training dataset) that can help make predictions on new data. Apart from initial programming and fine-tuning, the computer doesn't need human intervention at all to learn from data and improve on its predictions by itself. The machine will become intelligent by itself as it feeds on more and more data.", "For example: Netflix is a perfect example of Machine learning. I saw Money Heist today on my suggestions list, so, how can Netflix figure out what I would like to watch next? There is a strong machine learning algorithm in place at the backend which is continuously analyzing the viewing preferences of other users with similar profiles as mine and hence it makes the suggestions based on that. As you watch more, the algorithm learns more about your preferences of the genre and you'll get the suggestions based on that!", "Virtually, all the Data Mining involves the use of Machine learning but not all Machine learning involves Data Mining.", "Example: You might apply machine learning to data mine automobile traffic data for patterns related to accident rates but on the hand if we talk about Self-driven cars, they are based on purely machine learning without any data mining being involved.", "In continuation of this, you can read my following post to understand the 4 types of Machine learning algorithms! Do check it out!", "Keep watching this space for more on Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and Statistics!", "Your home for data science.
