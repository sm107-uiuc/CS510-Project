I recently conducted and published the results of a poll that indicate salary is not the most important consideration on the mind of job seekers. A smart candidate will carefully consider all aspects of a job offer including health insurance, employer contributions to retirement, paid leave (vacation, sick time, time to care for sick family), the opportunity for tuition support, etc.", "The problem for candidates, who might not consider salary to be the most important factor when evaluating a job offer, is that recruiters often demand to know a salary expectation during the first conversation. Sometimes even before the first conversation. And worse, recruiters will screen candidates based on salary. A companion article talks about why asking and screening questions on the basis of salary is a mistake.", "The best advice I can offer candidates who have difficulty with answering questions about salary expectations is to respond with a question of your own. This article provides a script that candidates can use when speaking with recruiters about salary.", "The discussion starts on LinkedIn or email:", "Recruiter: Hey Adam, we have an opportunity to share with you.", "Candidate: Okay sure, let\u2019s set up a chat.", "When the conversation continues on the phone:", "Recruiter: What is it that has you on the job market right now?", "[The recruiter has asked a question that implies a premise which the recruiter should know might not be true. The recruiter contacted this candidate. How can the recruiter be sure the candidate is searching?]", "Candidate: I\u2019m not actively searching. But, you indicated you have a great opportunity for me. Can you tell me more about that opportunity? If it turns out that I don\u2019t think it is a good fit, I can likely help connect you with others who might be a better fit.", "Recruiter: So, for the right opportunity you\u2019d be willing to move on from your current work?", "Recruiter: So what do you know about [insert recruiter\u2019s company name].", "[Candidate and recruiter talk about the company].", "Recruiter: Let\u2019s talk about compensation. What salary target do you have in mind?", "Candidate: Since you contacted me, I have not worked out what an appropriate salary would be for this position. Also, salary is not my main motivation. Do you have a budget in mind for this position?", "Recruiter: [Mumbles, and stutters a bit, isn\u2019t accustomed to getting this question]. [Awkward silence].", "Recruiter: [Tries to avoid giving an answer]. We have a range and if you have a target in mind I could speak with the team if it happens to be outside of that range.", "Candidate: [Repeats the question]. Great. What is that range you had in mind?", "Recruiter: [Pauses]. Umm. [Sound of paper rustling or computer clicking and typing]. We were looking at $XXX,XXX on the low end and $YYY,YYY on the upper end.", "Candidate: Okay, thanks. Sounds like it would be worth our while to continue this conversation. What other questions do you have for me?", "In this script the recruiter asked the candidate what their salary expectation is. The candidate did not provide a response. Instead the candidate answered the question with a question.", "The recruiter attempted to avoid answering. The first attempt to avoid answering was with a long pause. The candidate waited out that pause. The recruiter\u2019s second attempt to avoid answering was with a non-response. After that the candidate asked again.", "Eventually the recruiter provided information about salary, first.", "The candidate has now learned what the hiring range is. The candidate has also avoided giving a number that is so high they\u2019ll be screened out of the search. Likewise the candidate has avoided giving a number that is so low that they will risk under compensation.", "Most importantly, the candidate will remain in the search. The candidate and the recruiter can continue the conversation which is of mutual interest. This will allow the candidate to gather additional information about the company, its benefits, culture, and other factors. If the candidate later receives an offer there will be an opportunity to speak about salary but, by then, the candidate will be more well informed and much better positioned to participate in a meaningful negotiation.", "Other questions that are designed to screen the candidate based on salary are, for example \u2014", "Recruiter: \u201cWhat is your current salary?\u201d Or, \u201cwhat was your salary at your previous position?\u201d", "In response to this question it is valid to respond:", "Candidate: \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve brought up the topic of salary. It is important for me to note that salary is an important factor but it is not the most important factor for me. But since you raised the topic, what is the budget you have in mind for this position?\u201d", "Candidate: \u201cI and a few of my colleagues left our former employer because their salary offerings were not competitive. That previous company was not offering a salary that is commensurate with our level of experience within the industry. As a result, my previous salary would not appropriately inform our discussions on this topic. What is the budget you have in mind for this position?\u201d", "And another option (possibly a favorite):", "Candidate: \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve brought up the topic of salary. It is important for me to note that salary is an important factor but it is not the most important factor for me. What salary did you provide for the person who most recently held this position? And what salaries did you provide for the other 5 most recent personnel to hold this position?\u201d", "This article provided a script that can guide candidates when it is time to respond to questions from recruiters about salary expectations. This article also provided several alternate approaches. Some approaches are more forward than the others. How you choose to proceed is up to you.", "Some candidates consider salary a top priority. Perhaps most do. But a recent poll I posted to three social media platforms indicates that as many has half of the candidates on the market likely have at least one other factor or consideration that is more important than salary on their mind. A companion article provides additional discussion about how and why asking this question can be problematic.", "I enjoy speaking with current and aspiring data scientists about this and other related topics. Reach out to me via LinkedIn (link below) or Twitter (link below) if you want to talk.", "Thanks for reading. Send me your thoughts and ideas. You can write just to say hey. And if you really need to tell me how I got it wrong I look forward to chatting soon.
