We\u2019re a health tech company focused on patient education at the point of care. In English, that means we put devices in doctor\u2019s offices with content for patients. We have over 100,000 devices in the field \u2014 which means lots of data.", "This article is for the many Junior/Associate Data Scientists out there. If you\u2019re just beginning your journey, if you\u2019re a bit confused and lost, if you\u2019re not always certain what you\u2019re supposed to be doing or how to best contribute to your new company, you\u2019ve come to the right place.", "I\u2019ve seen many data science articles explaining the ins-and-outs of what doing more advanced data science work is like, the skills great data scientists need, the types of projects such masters tackle. But as I went through my Associate Data Scientist journey, I had a hell of a time navigating what to do to actually be useful as a more junior team member.", "This article is an attempt to alleviate that issue for other budding Associate Data Scientists.", "My main goal is to provide a basic blueprint, with examples, of how an Associate Data Scientist can quickly add significant value to an organization.", "I was lucky enough to figure things out along the way to the degree that I am now a Data Scientist \u2014 I\u2019m hoping this will help some of you along the same path!", "The first problem every Associate Data Scientist encounters is probably the same: How do you\u2026", "Answering this question took me a good amount of stumbling, talking to all sorts of people in the organization, and generally asking dumb questions a lot.", "What I discovered was that automating monitoring processes tended to be the lowest-risk, highest-reward effort I could spend my time on.", "In general, if you can find tasks that could be automated, but haven\u2019t been due to lack of bandwidth or priority, these are great projects to test your chops on. Almost every company has them, they are low-risk/high-reward, and if you can get an MVP out quickly, momentum tends to build fast. There are tons of articles on why getting an MVP out quickly is a good thing, so I\u2019ll let them explain the logic there.", "In my workplace, I saw obvious inefficiencies in how we were monitoring our KPIs for new software releases. Manual monitoring processes tend to be places ripe for improvement. They usually exist due to a lack of production processes put in place.", "At Outcome, we would push software updates in phases, with each phase going to a larger percentage of our 100,000 device network. However, during each phase, an analyst would pull the KPIs for that software release manually. This was obviously a waste of time, but we hadn\u2019t had the time to automate the process.", "So, you have an idea for a project to automate some process. Now what? Well, as data scientists, we know that part of our job description is to \u201cgenerate insights\u201d.", "My main response to this for a long time was \u201cwhat the hell does that mean?!\u201d I have an engineer brain by default. I need a tangible, concrete explanation. Absent that, I had to make my own.", "For me, a great \u201cinsight\u201d is anything that decreases the amount of time needed to make a decision.", "In concrete terms, this is what people usually mean when they say insight. They want a delivered piece of information that makes clear what they should do \u2014 the sooner the better. In the case an insight causes you to reverse a previous decision, it still decreases the amount of time needed to make a decision because it just shortened the amount of time between your \u201cbad\u201d decision and your new one.", "What this means is that a good goal for any Associate Data Scientist is to simply decrease the amount of time between data ingestion and action. Obviously, that\u2019s a broad mandate, but that means you get to learn about systems end-to-end, and every Data Scientist should know at least a bit about every part of the data stack (more on that in this AI Hierarchy of Needs graph). Besides, the Data Scientist role is currently so broad and poorly defined, your range of duties will likely encompass the entire stack anyway.", "In my case, beyond simply automating a data pull to save time, I realized 2 things.", "We run ad campaigns on our network, and one of our main KPIs is the number of plays our ad campaigns have in aggregate in a day. This number shouldn\u2019t vary much, except on weekends, where they should drop to close to zero.", "The analyst checking the number would check this KPI, and it was often normal. But, every now and then, a large campaign would end, causing the number of plays to drop drastically. This could look like a large issue with a given software release.", "I realized that the number of plays is (obviously) correlated with the number of devices in the field and the number of campaigns playing. I built a simple, piece-wise linear model (simple is better for simple systems, you fancy neural network people) to account for the number of campaigns, number of devices, and weekends. By training the model on pre-software update data, I could project the KPIs out post-software update and set guardrails based on the variance of the pre-software update data.", "This allowed the analyst to look at one graph, delivered to him via Slack, and know whether or not the KPIs were \u201cwithin expectations\u201d!", "After building a couple of these systems, I began to run into an issue most Data Scientists run into at some point. People weren\u2019t taking action. And action is everything. What good is a well-delivered insight if nothing comes of it? (Or was it a well-delivered insight at all, in that case? Ooooh.)", "If a model was built, a dashboard constructed, or an alerting system developed that never caused action, did it really exist at all? (Yes, it did, but you get the point.)", "The main insight that changed my thinking on this actually stems from an article on why laziness doesn\u2019t exist. The main takeaway being:", "Taking action requires a why and a what. If someone isn\u2019t taking action, they don\u2019t have a strong enough reason to do something or they don\u2019t know exactly what to do.", "This is exactly what I was seeing. People were either confused about the meaning of an alert, or they weren\u2019t sure what to do in response to an alert. In both cases, the alerts caused anxiety and no action, which was worse than no alert at all.", "In your work, this means you need to make sure that when communicating insights, you clarify the exact why the insight is important and what to do about it. Actually, this is true of any communication leading to action. Poorly run meetings are a good example of what not to do. If you\u2019ve ever been in a meeting without a clear why and what, you\u2019ll know that the meeting meanders, nothing is accomplished, and everyone\u2019s time is wasted.", "I don\u2019t go to meetings if they don\u2019t have a clear agenda. Meetings with no agendas are one of my biggest pet peeves. Also, acronyms suck. That\u2019s just an unrelated, personal thing, but Elon Musk agrees.", "My specific problems began to occur as the nature of the monitoring I was attempting to automate became more complex. Rather than having specific actions (of which there could be dozens), I began to provide general statements with a small data dump. A data dump was something I could have worked with.", "The data dump was not something a consumer would ever want to work with. And the customer is who matters.", "The Slack channels I set up for these new channels began to be used less as the alerts became too general. My only choice was to create more specific messages and action steps.", "I discovered a very effective method of doing this is by thinking through the exact resolution steps to an issue \u2014 for complex issues, this can be a difficult exercise in forethought. However, done properly, it makes action steps and needed messages crystal clear. And with clarity came the reuse of my channels and actions taken as a result!", "The \u201cAnomaly Detection\u201d project began of my own initiative, and grew over 6 months of steady work, made possible by the freedom and trust given to me by my excellent manager. At the present moment, \u201cAnomaly Detection\u201d pushes alerts to over half of our Engineering-Product-Design org (~20 of 40 individuals) and several other stakeholders outside of that org. It has become a large source of operational de-risking efforts, and new channels are continuously being added.", "Not a bad outcome for something that started as a side-project!", "I\u2019m not some magical genius. I\u2019m from Nebraska. (Love you, fellow Nebraskans.) Plus, I was dropped as a child. (Who wasn\u2019t, though. Love you, mom & dad!).", "What I did my first year as a Data Scientist is something any Junior/Associate Data Scientist could do, and I\u2019m hoping some of you will take inspiration from the good fortune I\u2019ve had and effort I\u2019ve made. So, as you start your journey, I leave you with a saying my math teacher used to give us before every test (which were also rough, but fun, journeys \u2014 I was a math nerd):", "Good luck, have fun, and do well!", "Your home for data science.
