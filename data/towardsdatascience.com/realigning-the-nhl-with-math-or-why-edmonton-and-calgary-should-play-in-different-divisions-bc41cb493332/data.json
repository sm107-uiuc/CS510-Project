A passionate fanbase will finally enjoy a winter sport after the loss of the Supersonics in 2008, and Vancouver will gain a regional rival.", "Adding a 32nd team will also require the NHL to realign its divisions. Currently, the NHL has 8 teams in the Pacific Division and 7 teams in the Central. Seattle will almost certainly be placed in the Pacific Division, leading to a temporary imbalance within the Western Conference. There has been plenty of internet chatter about which team will be moved to compensate, with the leading candidate being the Arizona Coyotes due to a lack of traditional rivalries and their position as the team that sits the furthest to the east within the Pacific Division.", "But what if teams were assigned to divisions solely based on compactness, without any regard whatsoever given to classic rivalries? What would the divisions look like?", "Fortunately, this is a solvable problem. By calculating the distance between every NHL city, we can separate the slate of 32 teams into 4 divisions in a way that minimizes the total travel distance within the divisions.", "1) I used the closest major airport to each NHL team\u2019s arena as the origin/destination point for each city. This creates a few interesting edge cases \u2014 for example, both New York teams have their origin/destination point listed as La Guardia Airport, which makes their effective travel distance between each other 0 miles in our model. While this is demonstrably incorrect, the purpose of a model is to make useful predictions, not to be 100% precise. Besides, the recommendation that two teams who play in the same city should stay in the same division will not shock anyone.", "2) It is worth stressing again that this model gives no weight to keeping traditional rivals together. This model is entirely about generating the most compact divisions by minimizing travel distances. I do not intend to suggest that my results make sense from a business perspective, but this information could serve as a data point in a larger conversation about realignment.", "First, we need to divide our 32 teams into two conferences of 16 by minimizing intra-conference distances. Interestingly, the current alignment of teams is optimal. The NHL has done a good job on this front by shifting Columbus, Detroit, and Toronto from the west to the east in recent years.", "Even though the Eastern Conference is not altering its composition by the addition of Seattle, the current alignment is still worth examining. Unsurprisingly, there is significant room for improvement \u2014 our model shows that total intra-division distance could be reduced by 15.8%.", "10 of the 16 teams in the East are better off through my proposed realignment. Having Tampa Bay and Florida play in the same division as the Canadian and northern New England teams has always been a curiosity driven more by momentary convenience than common sense, and almost all of these teams are significantly better off by re-aligning.", "I can certainly see Pittsburgh, Toronto, and Washington fans crying foul here. Pittsburgh would lose its divisional rivalry with Philadelphia, but this would be a reversion to a not too distant past state \u2014 as recently as 1998, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia were in different divisions. It may feel counter-intuitive to have Buffalo and Toronto playing in different divisions, but recall that the goal of this exercise is to minimize total travel distance. While it may be better for Toronto to have a close rival, it harms the other teams more than it helps Toronto. However, if we were to swap Washington with Buffalo, we would only be 582 miles (1.29%) worse off, while preserving several traditional rivalries.", "It\u2019s an extremely close call, but the NHL would save 530 miles of divisional travel distance by swapping Edmonton into the Central Division and keeping Phoenix in the Pacific. While such a move would obviously make the Cascadian + Albertan teams travel longer distances, this change would benefit the southwestern teams more than it would harm the northern teams. Ultimately, this information should be put into its proper context \u2014 is it really worth saving 0.6% of total travel distance when the cost is breaking up the Battle of Alberta? My guess is no.", "While the attention will deservedly be on Western Conference realignment in the coming weeks, the NHL would do well to realign the Eastern Conference with a focus on compactness. In doing so, the NHL could reduce travel time and carbon footprint of its product considerably. They could then spend some of these credits down the road on something like a conference-free Stanley Cup Playoffs, which will be the subject of a future post!", "All maps were designed in Tableau; NHL logos are utilized under the fair use doctrine. I have uploaded my distance matrix and data files to GitHub; they are available here.", "I would like to thank Professor Shi Chen of the University of Washington for his advice and encouragement as I embarked upon this project. I\u2019m also grateful to Ian Martinez, whose mentorship and infectious optimism are a constant source of inspiration.", "Your home for data science.
