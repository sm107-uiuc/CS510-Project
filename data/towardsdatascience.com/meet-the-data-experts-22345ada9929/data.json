Displaying the different competencies\u2026 | by Steven Finkelstein | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Meet the Data Experts", "description": "Displaying the different competencies of data analytics and data science experts via spider charts."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://hackernoon.com/top-10-roles-for-your-data-science-team-e7f05d90d961", "anchor_text": "blog", "paragraph_index": 13}], "all_paragraphs": ["Have you ever wondered what all those \u201cdata people\u201d do each day? It could be your daughter, husband, colleague, or mentor, but every time they discuss their job, your eyes just gloss over. Data science, data analytics, and all those \u201cdata\u201d terms have ambiguous and overlapping definitions. On top of that, job postings from many organizations will lump a half dozen data skills together for any and all job titles. These are often unrealistic. This post is my attempt to sort through the BS and assign proper categories for each \u201cdata expert\u201d. They are primarily influenced by job postings at Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook. If anyone should know the proper definitions for these roles, it\u2019s the Tech giants.", "These categorizations will help you understand the strengths and weaknesses of each individual and what is the right question to ask each person. It will also help any aspiring data analytics professionals who want to understand which job path makes the most sense for them. These positions will frequently overlap and each individual is unique, but this should serve as a guide that is directionally correct in defining these roles.", "There are dozens of different job roles for people with data expertise; however, most positions tend to match up closely with the following ten:", "Each skill is rated on a scale of 1\u20135 (5 being the best). A 1 does not mean this person is unskilled in this area. These scores are relative to the other data analytics roles within the organization. Let\u2019s establish the six skill sets for which we graded each role:", "1.) Domain Expertise- Understanding the insights and analyses\u2019 impact on the business.", "2.) Data Manipulation- The ability to write clean code or configure a tool that can ingest, manipulate, analyze, model, and visualize data. Depth over breadth is more important because technical skills easily translate between tools.", "3.) Communication Skills- The ability to explain complicated technical concepts to a non-technical audience.", "4.) Managerial Competence- Requires emotional intelligence, strong social skills, and the ability to communicate clear responsibilities to each member of the team. Must be a leader who can manage direct reports.", "5.) Databases- Understanding systems that store data, including data model designs, databases, data warehouses, and data pipelines. This includes knowledge of SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as, the cloud.", "6.) Statistics- Knowledge of statistical and machine learning models, including the appropriate assumptions, use cases, and conclusions that can be made beyond the data set. This includes knowledge in statistics and machine learning software tools such as R, Python, and SAS.", "Assumptions- The analysts are positioned close to the business (e.g. Business Analyst, Policy Analyst, etc.). - The Data Scientist chart displays an upper bound of their abilities (i.e. a \u201cunicorn\u201d)", "The above charts are called spider (or radar) charts. The longer the point travels from the center of the \u201cweb\u201d to the edge of a specific category, the higher the value for that category.", "From the table of data roles and the spider charts, you could conclude the following: - Analysts can produce some quick insights with a wide range of tools, but could struggle with handling big data.- Data engineers tend to have the strongest computer science backgrounds.- Unsurprisingly, statisticians have the best understanding of machine learning and statistical models (i.e. statistics).- Statisticians and applied machine learning engineers are extremely similar.- The \u201cperfect\u201d data scientists can do it all. However, most data scientists are simply applied machine learning engineers or statisticians with a title change in name only.- The higher up you move in the organizational hierarchy, you tend to have a better grasp of concepts, but your skills might slip at the granular level (e.g. data wrangling using a new library).", "The primary inspiration for this piece was a blog written by Cassie Kozyrkov, a Chief Decision Scientist at Google. The definitions of the data analytics roles and scoring were primarily influenced by open job posts at leading technology companies, including Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple.", "Your home for data science.
