For a beginner, it can be scary to jump into the water but trust me, all you need is a pair of swimming pants and you are good to go. And by swimming pants, I mean some basic hardware and software.", "A frequently asked question is \u201dwhich laptop should I buy for Python programming?\u201d The good news is that Python does not require much. In this article, I will go through the basics to get you set up.", "Put your pants on and let\u2019s get started on your Python journey.", "Disclaimer: There are no affiliate links in this article.", "I\u2019m tempted to say that any machine will do. If you buy one which is less than 5-10 years old with a modern OS, chances are it will run. I\u2019m not saying it will be a smooth experience, but it will work. What hardware you need will vary based on what you intend to code.", "When it comes to hardware, you are looking at either a desktop computer or a laptop. (Unless you want to develop on your phone. More on that later) What you choose is based on several needs. It often comes down to power vs. portability.", "Python code is just text so the code itself is very light. There are other factors you need to look at when deciding what hardware you want to purchase. Since CPU, RAM, and GPU aren\u2019t that important, I\u2019ll start with the other parts you will interact with.", "One of your main tools is your screen. The higher resolution the screen is, the more code you can display. With high-resolution screens, the text can appear small and stress your eyes so play with the settings to get an optimal setup you can use for hours.", "For your desktop, you want to look for a screen you can rotate 90 degrees so you can display more lines of code. 4k resolution screens are getting cheaper these days, so if you can afford it, I would recommend you look at 27 inches and up with 4k support. If you are looking for a budget screen, skip the 4k option, and go for the one that will fit your desk. You can code on a smaller screen, but I would get the biggest screen I could fit on my desk within my budget.", "If you find yourself toggling between software a lot, you should consider the ultra-wide options. With these monitors, you can have your applications lined up side by side. After working on a 38\" ultra-wide for a couple of years, I find it hard to go back to a dual-monitor setup.", "You\u2019ll almost spend as much time typing on your keyboard as you\u2019ll be looking at your screen. After all, you are writing code. A keyboard that works for you, might be the worst for another person. Choosing the right keyboard is individual, just remember that you will be using it for hours and hours so it is important that it is comfortable to use.", "I have used a variety of keyboards in the past and recently threw my custom WASD keyboard away replacing it with an Apple Magic Keyboard.", "The WASD keyboard has mechanical keys (which is preferred by many programmers) with a nice travel distance. It is a heavy device making it appear solid. To me, the height put me off as my wrists hurt from long typing sessions. You can avoid this by getting wrist support, but the ultra-flat Apple Magic keyboard is more comfortable to me. The travel on the Apple Magic keys is shorter, but the feel of the keyboard is very comfortable and I can type for days.", "You should try the keyboard for several long sessions before you make up your mind. If it feels good after a couple of 10-hour days, you might have found your typing mate. If you live somewhere with good return options, give it a spin and send it back if it doesn\u2019t fit your fingers.", "If a normal, flat keyboard hurts, you can look for options where the keyboard is split and tilted. My brother-in-law recently introduced me to the Ergodox EZ keyboard which looks like a very interesting option.", "I suggest you get a keyboard with a US layout. This layout is perfect for writing code. I am Norwegian, but I have a US layout on all my keyboards for this reason. You can always toggle languages in software if you need your native letters. I\u2019m looking at you \u201d\u00e6,\u00f8,\u00e5\u201d.", "You might not use the Numpad much. In that case, you can look into compact keyboards. Several manufacturers create compact versions of their keyboards. Make sure they didn\u2019t put the arrow keys in a strange position.", "It\u2019s tempting to say that it doesn\u2019t matter what mouse you go for because you will not use your mouse much after all. Even though typing is your main activity, you will browse the web (mostly StackOverflow) and use your mouse for a lot of other operations. This is just as personal as the keyboard when it comes to preferences, but make sure you get a mouse that does not hurt your hand. Your hand is your tool, take care of it!", "As much as I love the Apple Magic Keyboard, the Magic Mouse is not that great. In my opinion, Apple was never good with mice and the Apple Magic Mouse has a very bad ergonomic shape. The only reason I use one these days is because of the integrated trackpad on top of the glass. It is fantastic for browsing, but I have a Steelseries Kana right next to it when I need to do some more heavy-duty work as the grip is more comfortable.", "You should consider the form factor when purchasing a mouse. Using a normal keyboard is already twisting your wrists into an unnatural position. You might want to consider getting a mouse with a slight vertical angle to take some stress away from your wrist. The Logitech MX Master 3 is a popular option these days and has a slight tilt. I currently have this in order and hope it is as good as all the reviews say it is. You can get mice with a full vertical layout or a joystick layout if that works better.", "There is not much to say about the CPU as most CPUs will run Python. A stronger CPU will always be faster than a weak one so purchase the CPU you can afford. Python is already a slow language. No need to make it even slower with a poor CPU.", "Note that Python is also single-threaded.", "In CPython, due to the Global Interpreter Lock, only one thread can execute Python code at once (even though certain performance-oriented libraries might overcome this limitation). If you want your application to make better use of the computational resources of multi-core machines, you are advised to use multiprocessing or concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor. However, threading is still an appropriate model if you want to run multiple I/O-bound tasks simultaneously.", "If you find yourself working with heavy calculations you might need more RAM, but for most tasks, you don\u2019t need much. Some tasks need to store results in memory while you work on them, but again, for most tasks, you should be fine with a low amount of RAM.", "Remember that applications like the browser and your IDE will use a lot of RAM, so if you\u2019re not on a tight budget, go for more RAM in general. 4GB might do, but that is on the very low end of the scale and you will see that most of it will probably be used throughout the day. Today most desktops are equipped with 8GB-64GB of RAM \u2014 which of course will have no problem with Python.", "As you probably guessed, Python is not GPU heavy either. You will be fine with almost any graphics card. One thing you might consider is that you can use GPU for machine learning so if you plan to go down that route, you could invest in a better graphics card just to be prepared.", "Python code is just text and if you look at your python programs, you will see that we are talking kB and not MB. This means that the code itself does not require much space on your hard drive. The data you create with your code, on the other hand, might require space so this is what you have to add to the equation. Another thing that will eat up some hard drive space is your operating system and other software installed.", "There are two kinds of hard drives \u2014 the solid-state drive SSD and the Hard Disk Drive HDD. An SSD is way faster than an HDD so as a general rule you would like to use an SSD. They are pricy compared to an HDD so again, it comes down to budget. You can consider using an SSD for your operating system and an HDD as a second hard drive just to maximize size.", "We are storing more and more content in the cloud and your code would in most cases be uploaded to Github. This means that the need for a hard drive is not as important as it was 10\u201320 years ago. I store most of my work files using iCloud. It works both as a backup and it is easy to sync the files between devices.", "I guess you didn\u2019t see that one coming. When you buy a laptop, a web camera is almost always included in the screen frame. When you buy a desktop, you have to buy that separately (unless you buy an iMac or similar). If you go from beginner hobbyist to junior developer, you will most likely see yourself doing digital meetings with the team. You don\u2019t want to be that guy without a camera. As a bonus, it forces you to keep your room tidy.", "OK, onto the portable little brother.", "You can always bring extra equipment, like a keyboard and mouse, but let\u2019s focus on what makes a laptop a laptop. The examples we are looking at here are a bit on the expensive side, but remember that you can get away with second-hand laptops and I\u2019ll also let you in on a secret. You can get away with the cheapest laptop you can find. The key is online coding environments.", "You will be looking at your screen all day. An 11\" or a 13\" will give you great portability, but working on a 15\"- 17\" will give you more space. The Macbook Pro 16\" 2019 model with its retina display (3072\u00d71920) has a footprint of the old 15\". The DELL XPS, the Lenovo X1 Carbon, and the Razer Blade all have a brilliant resolution of 3840 x 2160. With bigger screens, you can get better resolution, but you are giving away some of that portability. In my opinion, they are so light anyways that it is a clear advantage to go a bit bigger.", "According to Just Josh he can view more 30% more lines of code on the Macbook Pro 16\" vs. his Surface Book 2 15\" and Aero 17\" laptops. They all have the same vertical screen height of 8.5\".", "If you go for a MacBook Pro, you have to be aware that between 2015\u20132019, Apple shipped them with a butterfly keyboard. This keyboard has been notorious for malfunctioning and the key travel is almost non-existent. In 2019 they started shipping models with the new Apple Magic Keyboard and these are a delight to type on. They are not mechanical but feels just like the standalone version of the Magic Keyboard. If you do get a MacBook with a butterfly keyboard, Apple has a warranty program where you can get a replacement if you have issues with it.", "Hate it or love it, Apple\u2019s lineup has the touch bar instead of the F-keys. I love this as it gives a lot of flexibility, but there are a lot of people out there who absolutely hate them. If you depend on Function keys, make sure you try the touch bar to make up your mind.", "Some of the gaming laptops have started including mechanical keyboards so if you are looking for that tactile feel, you can get your hands on that on the go as well.", "Beware! One thing you need to be aware of when you get a laptop is that manufacturers need to make some compromises to make these machines light and small. You have to check the layout of the keyboards. In the newest lineup on the MacBook Pros, the ESC key is back in its physical form. Good news for programmers. Razer Blade had an absurd placement of the arrow keys, but it looks like they have changed this in their newest lineup. Make sure you do some research so you don\u2019t end up hating every other keystroke.", "Some manufacturers might as well not include a trackpad. In my experience, no-one can remotely match the MacBook trackpad. Maybe Razer, but I haven\u2019t tried it myself, only heard from fellow co-workers that it is a great one. If you don\u2019t want to bring a mouse, make sure you are happy with the trackpad.", "If the trackpad is abysmal, you might get better at navigating with your keyboard though. At least it is not a complete loss.", "Hopefully, you managed to grab a machine by now. But what about software. You will need software to run the code, right? Depending on what you are programming, you can get away with a minimal setup for your programming machine.", "The first thing we need to look at is the operating system.", "To start programming, you need an operating system (OS). Python is cross-platform and will work on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is mostly a matter of personal preferences when it comes to choosing an operating system.", "You are probably familiar with Windows as they are widely used throughout the world. The latest version of Windows is Windows 10. Generally, you should be on the latest version of the OS, but if you have an older machine or other software requires it, you might be stuck with Windows 7 or older. You should be fine with both, but be aware that if you want to use Python 3.5 or above, Windows XP is not supported.", "If you go for Windows, there are some shell options for you. Windows comes with the Command line, but also Powershell. Powershell feels more like a normal terminal you would know from the Linux- or Mac world.", "A newcomer that is even better is Windows Terminal. This highly customizable terminal is a blast to use.", "In the past, people have had issues with certain libraries not being supported on Windows. You might not know what libraries you will use in the future, but if you end up having issues installing any libraries, that could be the reason.", "The Windows license is normally bundled with your machine purchase. If not you are looking at an expense between $139-$309.", "Both Mac and Linux belong to the UNIX family. You can look at them as two different branches. The development will feel similar in both Operating systems.", "The Mac has a built-in terminal that works right out of the box. You can install variations, like iTerm if you like more flexibility, but the original does its job perfectly. Python comes pre-installed with macOS, but make sure you check the version so you are up to date.", "Most text editors and IDEs work on macOS.", "macOS, like Windows, is not Open source, but it comes with the machine. macOS only works on a Mac (officially) so you are tied down to Apple hardware.", "Linux is not really the operating system, it\u2019s a kernel. What you would consider an OS is the distributions/distros. One of the benefits of using Linux is that these distros are lightweight and super customizable. You can shop around and find the one that fits you perfectly. Some popular distros are Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, and CentOS.", "Linux is great for development. It comes with a terminal as well and a lot of the text editors and IDEs work on Linux. Linux is open-source so it is a budget-friendly alternative.", "Of course, you need Python. Head over to python.org, download the installer, and run it. If you write \u201cpython3\u201d in a terminal (if you downloaded a python3 version) you should see it execute and print what python version you are running.", "There are many text editors out there, but please don\u2019t be that guy who says you can write code in Notepad. At least know how to save yourself by saying \u201cOh, I meant Notepad++\u201d in case you get an evil stare\u2026", "Some things you are looking for in a text editor is:", "We\u2019ll only look at a chosen few. Make sure you browse the web to look for your favorite.", "Atom is a lightweight text editor you can run on all operating systems. It is highly customizable, with themes and CSS/Less customization. A package manager, file system browser, git integration, and last but not least, \u201cTeletype\u201d which lets you cooperate on the same code in real-time, makes this a great choice for a text editor.", "Thonny is a minimalistic IDE that is perfect for beginners. With a powerful debugger, you make sure you understand your code. I never used Thonny in the past, but quickly grew fan of the tool.", "Sublime has been in the game for a while and used by many. It has some nifty features, like \u201cMultiple Selections\u201d that allows you to rename many variables at once, and customization.", "Jupyter is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.", "You have probably seen the nice graphical presentation of data using Jupyter before. You can install the Jupyter notebook or use the browser version. If you want to work with data, Jupyter is your goto tool.", "Developed by Microsoft and loved by many. This extensive tool allows you to write code, debug, install libraries, use Git for source control and unit test your code.", "To find the right version for you, head over to their compare page and make sure you have a look at their python specific page.", "Here\u2019s a little surprise for you. You might not realize that your trusted old phone can be used to achieve great things. I must admit, I have never done any proper coding on my phone (only when I desperately needed to while on vacation), but from what I have seen online, several apps will get the job done.", "Pythonista is a popular one and fronted as a full IDE for development on the phone.", "Koder is another alternative. This is a code editor and not a full IDE, but it has syntax highlighting and support for cloud services like Dropbox.", "Buffer Editor looks slick and minimalistic. It has Git- and Dropbox support.", "Pydroid is all over Facebook Python groups and with pip support, GUI support, like PyQT, offline interpreter, syntax highlighting, and code prediction, I\u2019m not surprised it is a popular choice.", "If you prefer maximum portability, you can consider using online editors. You might experience some difficulties installing libraries or similar, but you can get a lot done online as well. I used online editors for 6 months at the University for our python class last year. The benefit of logging in on any computer with a browser is great.", "Here is an overview of a few you can try out. Remember that there are always more options than what I have found, so make sure you do some research. Maybe you will find another service you like.", "Repl.it hosts a variety of languages, among them python. You can collaborate with fellow programmers, connect to your Git repositories, and it has plug-in support. The free version will take you far and there are pricing options for teams.", "As the name suggests, pythonanywhere allows you to code no matter where you are located. This service is python only and you can have two consoles running at the same time in the free version.", "Programiz has an online editor that is simple to use. As far as I know, it is only an editor for you to test your code and not an environment where you store your files. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong.", "I hope getting started with Python doesn\u2019t look scary anymore if it did earlier. As you can see, you don\u2019t need much to start learning Python. If you have a browser, you can start learning. When you get more into Python and realize this is something you enjoy doing, you can consider upgrading. When you do that, you still don\u2019t need much to proceed. That is the beauty of this lightweight programming language.", "Of course, purchase what you can afford. You must always consider if you need what you are purchasing, but hardware can never be too good.", "I hope you will enjoy this fantastic journey and that some choices are clear now that we have discussed a variety of alternatives.", "Your home for data science.
