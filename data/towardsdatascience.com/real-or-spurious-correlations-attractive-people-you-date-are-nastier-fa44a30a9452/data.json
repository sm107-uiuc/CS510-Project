But somehow, among the people you\u2019ve gone on dates with, those who are more attractive tend to have worse personalities. There\u2019s a strong negative correlation between attractiveness and personality.", "Before you conclude that attractive people must be nasty, we can use some basic data science skills to test our intuition and see if something\u2019s gone horribly wrong (spoiler: yes, something is wrong).", "If you enjoy causal inference problems and paradoxes like this one, check out Lord\u2019s Paradox (another common inference problem):", "But how do we know if the negative correlation between attractiveness and personality is real? Data scientists deal with correlations regularly, and a good way to gain more intuition about the data and learn analysis methods is via simulation. So let\u2019s simulate some data to test our intuition.", "First, let\u2019s import the common data science modules: numpy, pandas, and seaborn (for visualizing simulation results).", "Let\u2019s specify a few simulation parameters and simulate some data. We\u2019ll set a random seed so you can replicate my results, but you can skip it if you prefer. Your simulations will work too but your results won\u2019t be identical to mine, but they\u2019ll be very similar.", "Since personality and attractiveness are randomly generated using np.random.randn(), the simulated values are drawn from normal distributions and the two distributions aren\u2019t expected to correlate.", "Now let\u2019s specify your dating criterion. This parameter reflects how picky you are. We\u2019ll set it to 0.80, which means you\u2019re going to date only people whose combined attractiveness and personality values are the top 20th percentile in your pool of 500 potential dates.", "Now let\u2019s decide who you actually go on a date with.", "Filter the data so it contains only people you dated.", "The dateddataframe has 100 rows (you can verify with dated.shape). Of the 500 people you could potentially date, you dated 100 of them (the top 20th percentile).", "Let\u2019s plot the correlation between the personality and attract features of the people you dated. Remember, you\u2019d chosen your dates based on how good they look good (\u2018attract\u2019) and whether they have great personalities (\u2018personality\u2019).", "Assuming you\u2019ve used the same random seed as me earlier on, the correlation between attract and personality should be about \u20130.48, which you can verify by using the pandas .corr() method: dated.corr()", "Also, if you regularly fit statistical models in Python, I highly recommend the Pingouin library.", "Good data scientists understand chance and probability very well. The negative correlation above might be all due to chance, so it\u2019s always essential to run multiple simulations to see if we can repeat the results above.", "To avoid repeating code (DRY principle in software development\u2014 don\u2019t repeat yourself), let\u2019s define a function that runs simulations. We\u2019re basically taking all the code above and putting them inside a function.", "Things to note in our newly-defined simulate function below:", "Below is the histogram of 1000 correlation values from 1000 simulations. The midpoint of the histogram is about \u20130.65 and all your simulated correlations are smaller than 0. That is, in all 1000 simulations, the correlations were negative: The attractive people you dated had worse personalities!", "What if the negative correlations were because of our simulation parameters? Now, let\u2019s instead assume you have a smaller pool of people to choose from (300) and you decide to be more lax with your dating criterion (0.7: you\u2019re willing to date people who are above the 0.7 quantile).", "Again, all our simulations had negative correlations (about \u20130.60) between attractiveness and personality.", "Do you think the negative correlation is real or spurious? That is, do attractive people really tend to have worse personalities, or is there something wrong with the nature of the data we\u2019re dealing with? Spoiler: It\u2019s the latter, but I won\u2019t tell you why (because the answer can be found in the data), other than tell you it\u2019s a causal inference problem.", "Before you conclude, play with and tweak the code above, simulate more data, and change the parameters (or even the code itself). Crucially, plot your simulated data and results in different ways and you might see interesting patterns in the data.", "I look forward to your thoughts, comments, or answers below. If you\u2019ve enjoyed this article, follow me for more data science articles and I\u2019ll explain how causal inference can help us solve this (cor)relation problem in future posts!", "If you are interested in improving your data science skills, the following articles might be useful:", "For more posts, subscribe to my mailing list.", "Your home for data science.
