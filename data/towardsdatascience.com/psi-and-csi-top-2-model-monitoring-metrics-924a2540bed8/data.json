I have written a post on model validation vs model monitoring and the importance of these 2 stages, you can check it out as a prequel to this post.", "Moving on to the subject matter of this post, we will learn all about the PSI and CSI i.e. Population Stability Index and Characteristic Stability Index which are one of the most important monitoring strategies used in a lot of domains especially credit risk domain.", "PSI and CSI, both of these metrics focus on the shift in the POPULATION DISTRIBUTION.", "These two monitoring metrics are based on the premise that a predictive model works best when the development and the validation/OOT (out of time) samples are not significantly different in terms of economic conditions, underlying assumptions, the campaign-style, and focus, etc.", "For example: if we built a predictive model to predict attrition rate for credit card customers in normal economic circumstances and then if we proceed onto testing it against a sample from recession-hit times, the model might not be able to predict accurately as the population distribution in different income segments might have changed significantly which might drive the actual attrition rate really high but the model might not be able to capture it, thus, predicting erroneous results. But, as we understand this now and if we proceed onto checking the population distribution shifts between the DEV time and the current time, we can get a fair idea if the model results are reliable or not. And this is accomplished by PSI and CSI as important monitoring metrics.", "It is a metric to measure how much a variable has shifted in distribution between two samples over time. It is widely used for monitoring changes in the characteristics of a population and for diagnosing possible problems in model performance \u2014 many a times, it\u2019s a good indication if the model has stopped predicting accurately due to significant changes in the population distribution.", "The above definition has been so aptly explained in this research paper. I have also given a reference link at the end of this post.", "Originally, Population Stability Index (PSI) was developed to monitor changes in the distribution between an OOT and the development time period samples in the credit risk scorecard analytics. The use of PSI has become somewhat flexible in nature now to examine the distributional shifts for the model-related attributes as well as in the overall sample populations, including both dependent and independent variables- CSI, we\u2019ll cover this in the next section.", "PSI tends to overall population shift whereas CSI tends to focus on the individual model variables used.", "A change in the population distribution can be due to:", "Since a distributional change need not necessarily involve a dependent variable, PSI can also be used to examine the similarity/dissimilarity between any samples, e.g, to compare education, income, and health status between two or multiple populations in social-demographic studies.", "STEPS TO CALCULATE PSI (Reference: Link)", "We can use a conditional formatting range as well, Red-Amber-Green zone, Red is the alarming state where the PSI is more than 20%, Amber is a 10\u201320% where the model should be kept under observation and Green is a stage where the model is deemed fir for use i.e. <10%.", "Now, basis on the use case, these thresholds are adjusted according to business relevance but the idea remains the same to keep a watch over the population shifts.", "It answers which variable is causing a shift in population distribution. It compares the distribution of an independent variable in the scoring data set to a development data set. It detects shifts in the distributions of input variables that are submitted for scoring over time.", "It helps to determine which changing variable is responsible majorly for causing the model score shift.", "When a model deteriorates in performance, checking distributional changes in the model variables can help with identifying possible causes. This is a step that is taken generally after one has checked PSI and it\u2019s not in the green zone (<0.1 in general) to check that the overall population distribution can be attributed majorly to which variables.", "At least one variable that has changed significantly or if several variables have moved to some extent, it might be time to recalibrate or to rebuild the model.", "CSI invariably has the same steps as PSI while calculating it. Just that the deciding is done on the dev sample values of a particular variable by binning it and setting those limits as hard cutoffs. Then, while calculating the frequency values for any validation/OOT sample, apply those same cutoffs to the data and calculate the frequency values and apply the same formula as we did while calculating PSI.", "Thus, PSI can help us determine the overall population distribution comparison with the DEV sample and if it shows a significant shift then CSI can help us further narrow it down to a few variables which are causing the fluctuations.", "If you wish to know more about rank-ordering, which is an essential concept in credit risk modeling, please check out the following post:", "Watch this space for more on Data Science, Machine learning, and Statistics!", "Your home for data science.
