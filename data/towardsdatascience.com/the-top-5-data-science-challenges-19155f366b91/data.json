They are not company-specific, so you can expect to experience some of these yourself, unfortunately. However, since many people do share these challenges, there are also several different solutions that may work for you in your situation. I will be discussing some of the most common and or difficult challenges I have faced as a Data Scientist. Of course, there are more than just five challenges, but these ones are the ones I will focus on in this article. Please keep on reading if you would like to learn more about common problems and unique solutions. Please keep on reading if you would like to learn more about common problems and unique solutions.", "This challenge occurs where more than one Data Scientist or person is at fault. One of the main focuses as a Data Scientist is to work on the business problem statement \u2014 it\u2019s the whole reason why you are utilizing Data Science in the first place. Most of the time it is actually not the Data Scientist who comes up with it themselves, but a team. That team usually includes stakeholders like a Product Manager.", "However, there can be a technical disconnect and the business problem statement can be framed poorly by either party.", "A Product Manager may say: \u201cwe need to make more recommendations so people can buy more\u201d, where a Data Scientist may say: \u201cwe need to be 95% confident, above 80% of the time when recommending products to people\u201d. Both are good problem statements in general, but they are also both not granular enough or actually outlining the problem well. The problem statement needs to be something you can find a solution to, not a solution itself.", "Here is a better example of a business problem statement problem:", "\u201cOn average, our customers only buy 1 item per order\u201d", "That is it. It really is that simple. Both parties did find ways to complicate the statement originally, but now it is efficient. Notice how there is no solution \u2014 but it is a direct, easy-to-digest statement that anyone can understand. It implies that 1 item is not enough, and that a possible solution would be something that allows consumers to be more likely to buy more than 1 item. A Data Science solution would be utilizing a Machine Learning recommendation system. It is important to not get ahead of ourselves at work, and to focus on what is the real problem at hand.", "Most Data Scientists or anyone really working with data within a company encounters the issue of imbalanced data. An example is when you, say, have a classification problem, and are using logistic regression to either assign a 0 or 1 to new data. The target variable would hopefully be 50% of 0, and 50% of 1. However, this nearly does not happen as you would expect it to be. If you are trying to classify a new animal as either a dog or a cat. You would want, for example, 1,000 cat and 1,000 dog rows of training data. This way, the model would be confident in identifying the difference between the two. If you had 1,900 cats and 100 dogs in your training data, then you would misleadingly have high confidence that most new animals should be a cat. This is a common problem.", "A possible solution would be to use other Machine Learning algorithms that upsample the minority class, or create new synthetic data. One technique is called imbalanced-learn [4]. You can oversample using the following specific methods:", "These over-sampling methods are extremely powerful and can serve as a solution for your imbalanced data. There are also even more techniques like under-sampling, a combination of both, ensemble methods, batch generator for Keras, and a batch generator for TensorFlow.", "An example of how over-sampling works can be:", "Some Machine Algorhtims libraries, like RandomForest, have a parameter that allows you to easily designate your data to bebalanced as well.", "The overfitting problem occurs when you build a Data Science model that learns the training data too well. The model becomes too specific, absorbing detailed information about the training data, as well as noise in the data \u2014 which is not useful in predicting new, real data. However, the model will, as a result, not infer or generalize properly. The goal of a model is to perform well on unseen data, so you will want to find and use solutions that perform well on new data.", "After you have established your business problem statement, you will also need to start looking for data in general, and then create your specific features that will be fed in as input for training data in your Data Science model. As you learn more about your company data tables, you will also see how you could use other columns as new features. However, there is another solution that works off the problem of having limited features to use in the first place.", "Create statistics about your current metrics. For example, if you normally have a feature like clicks_per_user and you would normally stop there. You could instead create new metrics just from that one column like the following:", "\u2014 75% percentile clicks per user", "\u2026and many more different ways you could describe the range of that one feature.", "Sometimes Data Scientists can get so used to working alone, they get comfortable having 20 Jupyter Notebooks that are just different versions of the same, main project. We end up using some naming convention that we forget the next day. Then, we try to share and reenact what w created, and it does not work and everything becomes a mess. We become overwhelmed but realize there is a better way. That way is Git and GitHub.", "These tools help you to work on your own code changes by creating a separate branch that is built off of your master branch/codebase. You can then create a pull request to compare the code changes and have others approve of those changes before merging into master so that you are not only creating a code review, but you are allowing everyone to become more aware of your specific code that should be learned.", "As you can see, there are many challenges that Data Scientists face. The ones that I discussed are just some of the many. However, they are the ones I have either experienced the most, or the ones that I believe should be talked about more.", "Below, is a summary of the raised Data Science problems, as well as some example solutions to those problems.", "I hope you found my article both useful and interesting. Please feel free to comment down below what you have experienced as a Data Scientist or in a similar role as a challenge. Do you agree with mine, or have you dealt with some different, more important ones?", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Sr/MS Data Scientist.
