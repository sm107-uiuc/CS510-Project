You spent a lot of time learning the background of it, the theory, and practical realities. After many years you know how the difference between cast-iron and stainless steel pans will be represented in the dish that you make.", "However, you\u2019ve only ever cooked for a small group of people. Now all of the sudden, you have to prepare your signature dish simultaneously in a factory setting which will package it up a ship it to grocery stores nation-wide. At the same time, a franchise restaurant is adding your dish (with a by-line) to it\u2019s menu and it will be available at their locations all across North America.", "You aren't worried though, you\u2019ve prepared this dish hundreds of times at your small place in NYC and it always turned out well. You can add and multiple the ingredients in your sleep, and have spent countless hours explaining the methods and steps to other chefs.", "How do you know that what has worked so well in one place is going to work just as well in another? Enter external validity! (And not a moment too soon, this metaphor was getting pretty thin\u2026)", "In a prior article I covered internal validity concepts and risks as they pertain to data science. In this article I want to spend some time discussing external validity.", "Instead of being concerned about causality between the independent and dependent variable, external validity is concerned with whether the results or outcomes you experienced in one instance can be expected in a different instance.", "In statistics this is often the case when you take a sample of a population that your interested in and you want to understand whether what you observed in the sample can be generalized to the population.", "In other instances, we set up experiments or pilots because we want to know if a new idea or theory will work before we invest significant resources in putting it into production.", "For example, say you believe that posting articles on Medium on weekends is more effective than posting during the workweek, say Tuesday evenings. You conduct a pilot with your companies blogs about community service events. Based on your evaluation (and your expert understanding of internal validity!) you find much higher read rates and longer view times when posting Medium stories on weekends. Yay!", "Now you brief out your findings in the next staff meeting, and tell your boss that they need to immediately move outreach and marketing efforts for the company to take advantage of this. But your boss has one question, \u201chow do we know that what you found in your pilot will hold true for our entire outreach strategy?\u201d", "How could he ask this? Did he not see your slide deck?!?! Before you begin the presentation again, realize that what is being asked is simply a question abut the external validity of your experiment.", "External validity is the extent to which the casual relationship observed and proved within a particular study can be inferred to exist in a larger sample, population, or under different circumstances.", "When focusing on external validity, you want to consider that perhaps there are differences between the population where the observed causal relationship was found, and a different group not involved in the initial study.", "In our example, did the causal relationship between weekend versus weekday posting times and the observed changes to their reading time have any unique characteristics?", "We conducted our experiment based on the community outreach events blogs, but does this hold true for all of the company\u2019s content? Could it be that there are differences between the types of content which might account for different outcomes than what was observed in our experiment?", "Let\u2019s look at the things we need to be concerned about when thinking through external validity. Five classic threats to external validity are:", "Across subjects \u2014 as one of the main threats or concerns to external validity, we need to wonder whether or not observed results are applicable to subject that were not part of the actual study.", "This is of interest especially in pilot programs, when we are testing the effectiveness before deciding to scale up a program. Even if the treatment worked for the subjects of the study, how can we be certain they will work the same for subjects not a part of the study.", "One main way is through random selection of subjects from a larger population of concern. In this way we can be fairly certain the random selection allows us to make inferences between what was observed and what can be expected in the larger population.", "However, this does not necessarily apply when you are looking across populations. In these instances, you need to focus on extrapolation. Extrapolation is the act of analyzing the similarities and differences between your pilot population and another population, keeping in mind the causal mechanisms and attributes needed for success to make a reasonable prediction of how your program will work in the different population.", "Time \u2014 is another concern for external validity. Just because a program or new technique worked in one instance, how do we know that it will continue to work in the future?", "Part of understanding this is to have a strong grasp of the causal linkages between the variables so that you can monitor whether those variables change over time.", "Settings \u2014 are important because they can become an independent variable by themselves. Additionally, at times studies must be carried out in particular settings that are different than the target natural settings they may be applied to in the future.", "A general example is conducting a trial in a laboratory or a particular school, and then attempting to generalize the findings to expect certain outcomes in other locations. How much does your pilot setting resemble the production environment?", "Treatments \u2014 can be operationalized in many different ways. This problem expands if you have a program that is carried out over many locations because it will be more difficult to attempt to have a consistent treatment between the locations, or even to know exactly what the differences are.", "Therefore, how do we understand exactly what the treatment is and compare outcomes from all of the locations as though they received the same treatment?", "Outcome measures \u2014 are a concern if the outcome measure can be operationalized in several different manners. For example, did the posting times cause all of the outcomes (i.e., higher viewer rates, longer reading times, more claps, ect.) or are some of these things causing the others, such as longer reading times cause more claps (alternative hypotheses is that people scan quickly during the week and aren\u2019t looking for relaxations, relaxation reading leads to claps).", "It is important to look at the focus on internal validity versus external validity. Ultimately, it doesn\u2019t matter if your experiment or pilot is highly generalizable (strong external validity) but it is does not actual cause the outcome that you think it does(weak internal validity). And it is also obvious that is your program does not actually cause changes to the dependent variable, there is no point is scaling it up.", "Additionally, focusing strictly on controlling all of the variables possible to tighten your internal validity can negatively impact your external validity. This is because you may artificially create an environment for your experiment that doesn\u2019t exist any where else but inside your pilot study.", "There must be a balance between internal and external validity in order to create useful evaluations because the goals are often about understanding whether the program or treatment will work in other situations, not just finding the perfect causal mechanism in the experiment.", "Good pilots and experiments only matter if they can be applied successfully at scale or in production. However, its easy to create a pilot that does not work the same way in these instances. The key is to make sure you adequately account for external validity in your pilot design and evaluation.", "Your home for data science.
