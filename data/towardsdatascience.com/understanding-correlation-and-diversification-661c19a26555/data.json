In plain English, correlation tells us the likelihood that two variables move together. A high correlation means that when one variable goes up, the other is very likely to go up as well. The stock returns of similar companies, like Coke and Pepsi, are positively correlated:", "A negative correlation means the opposite (when one variable goes up, the other variable usually goes down). Stocks and Treasury bonds tend to be negatively correlated.", "A correlation of zero equates to statistical independence. If two variables are statistically independent, it means that each has no bearing on the other. If you and your best friend each throw a six sided die, the results will be independent (no matter how much of a mind meld you two might share).", "Time for a little bit of statistics. The variance of a variable is a measure of how much it well\u2026 varies. You can picture variance by imagining a game where you drop a feather on the ground and attempt to predict where it will land. If there\u2019s no wind that day (or you are playing indoors), then it\u2019s pretty easy. Without a gusty wind to blow it around randomly, we know that the feather can\u2019t go too far. Thus, we can say that the final potential landing spot of the feather has a low variance:", "If you happen to drop your feather in the middle of a tornado, then it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess where the feather will end up (it could land several miles away or more). The extremely large range of potential landing spots is an example of high variance:", "Another way to think about it is that low variance means low uncertainty and high variance means high uncertainty. So it makes sense that where possible in finance, data science, and life in general, we want to decrease variance. Less variance means outcomes are more predictable, plans are less likely to go awry, and we are less likely to take a loss (whether it be a financial or emotional one). Therefore, we can spend less time and resources on insurance, contingency plans, and hedges.", "That\u2019s where correlation comes in (or the lack thereof). Let\u2019s say we have two normally distributed random variables, X and Y. Both have a mean of 0, a standard deviation of 1, and a correlation of 0 against each other. For a primer on the normal distribution, check out this blog post.", "What\u2019s the standard deviation of the average of our two random variables? We need to introduce a few mathematical rules to figure this out:", "Taking the average is like applying a constant of 0.5 to each random variable, and then summing. So we can combine our two rules above to figure out the variance of the average like so:", "Cool, now we can calculate the variance and the standard deviation of the average of X and Y (let\u2019s use the actual numbers \u2014 Var(X)=1 and Var(Y)=1):", "To simplify our notation, let\u2019s refer to the average of X and Y as A. We can calculate the standard deviation of A easily because we already know its variance:", "Wait what happened? X and Y both have standard deviations of 1 and yet their average has a standard deviation of 0.71 \u2014 the average of the variables is less volatile than the individual variables themselves. I want to emphasize two keys here:", "It\u2019s important to note that this effect only occurs when the variables have correlations less than 1 (ideally a lot less than 1). If two things are perfectly correlated, then we can\u2019t expect their movements to diversify \u2014 rather, they would move together in perfect lockstep (and even if we averaged thousands of these perfectly correlated variables, the variance would not decrease).", "Also bear in mind that the average of two uncorrelated variables will not always have a lower variance than the individual variances of the variables. When one variable has a high variance and the other a low one, the variance of the average of the two variables will be between the two individual variances. But because of diversification, the actual variance of the average will be significantly less than the arithmetic mean of the the individual variables\u2019 variances.", "We saw how the standard deviation declined from 1 to 0.71 when we averaged two independent variables. What if we have access to more uncorrelated variables to add to our portfolio? The following plot shows what happens to standard deviation as we incrementally add more uncorrelated random variables:", "The first few variables added cause standard deviation to drastically decline before diminishing returns set in. This is expected \u2014 the more variables that we\u2019ve already included in our average, the less we should expect each new variable added to impact things. But even so, we can see the Law of Large Numbers in action \u2014 the more variables we average, the lower the variance, and the more certain we can be. Switching to finance for a second, the more uncorrelated investments we can find, the lower the variance (and standard deviation) of our portfolio\u2019s return, and the more certain we can be that we won\u2019t lose money. To see why the finance industry uses the portfolio\u2019s standard deviation as a proxy for its risk, check out my previous blog.", "This is exactly what would-be world beating hedge funds attempt to do. They try to find as many uncorrelated return streams as possible, combine them in a portfolio, and then hope to print money. Often it doesn\u2019t work out quite as planned, but it\u2019s a nice dream.", "Ok, now that we are all jazzed to find as many uncorrelated investments to fill our portfolios with, it\u2019s time for me to rain on our parade a bit:", "This post is Part 3 of my primer on investment portfolio optimization. If you haven\u2019t already, check out Parts 1 and 2 as well:", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data scientist. Founder Alpha Beta Blog.
