Let me show you \u2026", "I\u2019m using this problem as an example to depict \u201chow you should think while solving a competitive coding challenge\u201d; how to write better algorithms, faster.", "For me, competitive coding is a form of art (just like obfuscated programming) where a person tries to solve a given problem most efficiently with a minimal amount of code.", "Usually, Lesser Code = More Efficiency", "Keeping that in mind, I\u2019ll start with the piece of code that a beginner can understand, and then improve it further, step by step, to the pro level. Each time explaining my approach to you.", "Have a look at the problem statement first: \u2014", "As you can see, you need to pick the same number of stones from the odd-positioned piles as from the even-positioned piles; while picking no more than the number of stones available in the corresponding pile.", "Pause and have a second to wrap your head around it.", "We\u2019re gonna build a function called maximumStones which will accept an integer array arr, representing the number of stones in each pile. And return a single integer representing the maximum total number of stones you can pick.", "I\u2019ll be using Python for the sake of simplicity and faster development.", "How many lines of code do you think you\u2019ll need to solve it?", "Don\u2019t try to identify the problem for its genre. It may be a greedy problem or a problem from dynamic programming, we don\u2019t care. Let it come to you naturally.", "If we do exactly what was written in the problem statement, we\u2019ll end up with the code like this:", "Don\u2019t get intimidated by it. It\u2019s actually straightforward.", "Here, we have calculated the sum of the number of stones in the odd-positioned pile and in even-positioned piles in variables a and b respectively, beforehand. Then, we\u2019re looping until the difference between both (a and b), in variable c, becomes zero, that is, until a == b.", "In each iteration, we see which piles need modification. If the odd-positioned piles(a) have a greater number of stones (c > 0), then we\u2019ll subtract stones from those piles, otherwise, from the even-positioned piles.", "How many stones do we need to subtract? c number of stones", "While subtracting each time, we need to confirm whether we can subtract the whole pile (if picks[k]-c > 0) or not; and whether the c==0 or not.", "Result: 13 out of 14 test cases passed (One Wrong Answer)", "So how can we identify the error?", "Identify the code redundancy and unused loops, and get rid of them.", "In our case, while-loop was not serving any purpose, that was basically running for one time only. Once we have determined the value of c, we just need to subtract the stones from those corresponding piles only (either odd-positioned pile or even-positioned piles).", "And as you can see in our previous code, we were writing the same thing twice, in both the for-loops. So we can remove that too with a single condition for determining element choice \u2014", "Result: No improvement (Since we had removed the unnecessary code only)", "Now, since you have come this far, you\u2019ve grasped the logic of what we are doing. But the question is, Do we really need to do all of this to get what we want?", "If you\u2019ll think about this critically, you\u2019ll find, we don\u2019t need to subtract stones from each specific set of pile one at a time. Actually, we do not need to do that at all. Because every time we are subtracting those stones, we\u2019re basically subtracting from the whole array of stone piles.", "So if we have already calculated the difference (abs(c)), then we can directly subtract it from the sum of the whole array, arr.", "And we can further simplify it like this\u2026", "So here we are, the single line of code as our final answer is \u2014", "Result: 14 out of 14 test cases passed (Success!)", "Don\u2019t jump to solve the problem as soon as you get a glimpse of it. Think about it for a couple of minutes, because, not every problem requires you to think straightly.", "Some problems want you to think out of the box. A fresh perspective; a crucial piece of knowledge can save you a huge huge amount of time in coding and debugging.", "There are a couple of rules of thumb that you need to keep in mind \u2014", "Obviously, there is more to competitive programming than I can cover in this article.
