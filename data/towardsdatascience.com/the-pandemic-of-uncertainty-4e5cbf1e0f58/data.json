But alas, so many questions remain.", "Are we past the peak? Did we flatten the curve? Is a second wave of infections going to hit? Is the disease more deadly than anticipated? Is it less? What\u2019s going on in Sweden and Japan? Is China really recovering?", "Anyone who can answer these questions \u2014 and so many more \u2014 with confidence and conviction is lying or deluded, perhaps a bit of both (I\u2019m confident of that).", "I can already hear the objections, \u201cbut this study says\u2026\u201d Or \u201cDr. so and so says\u2026\u201d Or (my personal favorite) \u201cScience says\u2026\u201d", "The trouble is, too little is known about this disease and the complicated population effects at this point to be certain of anything \u2014 this is why the early models were \u201cwrong\u201d and continue to be revised (what does it mean for a model to be \u201cwrong\u201d or to be \u201cright\u201d for that matter is another question for another day). Moreover, the progress of science is fraught with uncertainty; theories and hypotheses are held tentatively until better theories arrive to sweep them off the field or more data corroborates them.", "This is further compounded by the social science aspect of epidemiology, which is a multi-disciplinary field rooted in medicine, biology, economics, and behavioral sciences. This makes it particularly challenging to draw firm conclusions so early in the process because human decisions impact the outcomes of any models, and these decisions cannot be precisely modeled or predicted. This tends to lead to models being particularly sensitive to their underlying assumptions and choices.", "Let\u2019s take a current example looking at the ubiquitous R0 (\u201cR-naught\u201d) estimates. This much discussed value is a measure of how quickly a disease spreads. From a classic text (Anderson and May), \u201cR0 is more precisely defined as the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host population where everyone is susceptible.\u201d", "Take the seasonal flu for example, which has a median R0 value of 1.3 or so, meaning that everyone who gets infected by the disease will, on average, infect 1.3 people. Higher R0 values mean higher infection rates with values over 1 generally leading to a pandemic, where a value below 1 means the disease won\u2019t proliferate quickly enough and will eventually die out. This seems rather straightforward, but it\u2019s far from it.", "R0 for COVID-19, or any other disease for that matter, is not a constant and it is not a strict function of the given virus or disease in question. In other words, the flu could have a lower R0 (and in some societies, it almost certainly does) or it could have a higher R0. It is dependent on properties of the disease and on human behavior and attitudes about the disease.", "For example, if it is culturally acceptable to sneeze into one\u2019s hands, shake hands, never wash one\u2019s hands, all within a city of tens of millions crammed onto a tiny island, then the R0 for the flu in this society would likely be much higher than 1.3. On the other hand, if the culture discouraged close, physical contact, expected masks to be worn when feeling ill and hands to be sanitized regularly, and in a society with the population density of Greenland, we could expect a much lower R0. Furthermore, this value can change as attitudes and common practices change.", "When I\u2019ve seen this value discussed in the media, usually a single number is given. In many studies too, a single number is provided (the better ones yield ranges and estimates) as if this is the R0 from on high, which can lead to the impression that this is purely a value out there to be discovered and provided by the disease. If attitudes do change \u2014 as they clearly have in the case of COVID-19 \u2014 regarding personal hygiene, interaction with others, masks, and the like, then R0 can be expected to change too. How much will it change? Well, that\u2019s not easy to say either which adds another dimension of uncertainty to an already complicated model. Because we don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll have to make some assumptions.", "The best authors will defend those assumptions. But oftentimes, you will often see authors deferring to other authors and importing their assumptions, assuming these other authors have adequately defended their own assumptions. There is the pressure to publish after all, which is particularly heightened in such a case as this.", "I don\u2019t want to come across like I\u2019m besmirching academics and researchers. Relying on other experts in the field is often times the best approach, but there are cases when one unexamined or glossed over assumption can have the devastating effect of leading an entire field astray (look no further than the assumption of Brownian motion to describe stock prices to see the disservice done to finance and taxpayers over the past 20 years).", "The world is messy. Even if we could have excellent, controlled experiments at a population level (which, we really can\u2019t) it is difficult to separate the signal from the noise. This can lead researchers to come to very different conclusions when trying to study the same, complex phenomenon.", "Let\u2019s stick with that R0 estimate, but look at some previous influenza outbreaks where we have more literature to draw from.", "Biggerstaff et al. [2014] wrote an article examining the literature estimating the R0 values for four major pandemics (1918 Spanish Flu, 1957 H2N2, 1968 H3N2, and the 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu) plus seasonal influenza and cases of novel outbreaks. They reported R0 estimates for each of these influenza types from 111 peer reviewed, academic papers from 1950\u20132013. I\u2019ve summarized some of the findings below.", "What you can see, is that for most of these, there is a wide range of values and a larger spread, particularly for the diseases with more studies. Visually, we can use a box plots to see what this looks like.", "The first thing that pops out \u2014 the seasonal flu has a few studies with R0 values over 15! That\u2019s insanely high. These estimates happened to come from a study of a UK boarding school for the 1977\u201378 flu season. The values may be this high because of the close quarters of the school, the lack of pre-existing immunity, or simply due to the relatively small sample size (763 students) in the study making these points uncharacteristic of other outbreaks. Let\u2019s zoom in on the other points though:", "What\u2019s noticeable here is that \u2014 even with the outliers \u2014 we can be relatively confident about the expected R0 value for the seasonal flu because we have 47 studies with data going back to the 1890s on this! So we know generally how the flu behaves. Does that mean we\u2019re going to be able to predict the deaths and infections of the flu in 2030 in Moldova?", "Not necessarily. Are the conditions in Moldova in 2030 more akin to those with R0 close to 1, 2, or higher? There\u2019s a lot of context that needs to be taken into account that is very difficult to summarize in a single number when building a model.", "This feeds into some of the inherent uncertainty when dealing with these types of dynamical systems. The choice in parameters can change everything.", "One group\u2019s model may predict 10 times as many infections as the next group\u2019s, and both be built upon justifiable assumptions. You can even see wide ranges within a single paper based on these values.", "Take the Imperial paper that predicted 2.2 million deaths over the next 2 years in the US if no action is taken. It provides a sensitivity analysis for the UK based on R0 values of 2\u20132.6. Depending on the R0 selection, deaths may increase by ~2.5X!", "Lest you think that epidemiology models always miss to the high side, a 2015 article in The Lancet discusses a meta study of 10 HIV models in South Africa. All of which, underestimated the rise in HIV, the authors ask, \u201cif we can get model predictions so wrong in the data-rich setting of South Africa, where there are ten leading HIV epidemiological modelling groups focusing their attention, where can we get it right with confidence?\u201d", "Our best models for the current pandemic are, to put it frank, unreliable. Neil Ferguson (the author of the Imperial study) revised his model after actions were taken in the UK to predict 20k deaths from the pandemic. As of writing, the UK is sitting just under 30k total deaths. Even the top experts in the world can\u2019t say for certain what will happen \u2014 there\u2019s simply too much uncertainty.", "What can you do about it?", "The future is always unknown, but we have to live our lives regardless. It\u2019s prudent to weigh the risks and costs of mitigation in all situations, but even more so when the stakes are high.", "Thankfully, risks are often asymmetric, in other words, prevention is cheap relative to the downside. Mitigations such as wearing masks, washing hands, and so forth, are easy to implement and carry large benefits relative to the cost.", "Such simple steps are often credited with contributing to Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore\u2019s relative success in dealing the disease.", "The shrewd use of these models is not as a crystal ball, but as a tool to see the downsides and mitigate your own risk accordingly. With so much uncertainty, science and the experts can\u2019t do much more.", "Your home for data science.
