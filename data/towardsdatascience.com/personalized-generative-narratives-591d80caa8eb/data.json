However, for this project, I decided to take the work several steps further. Before I dive in, however, allow me to set some context\u2026", "Before embarking on my journey to become a data scientist, my work was primarily rooted in the immersive experience design industry. While I have been in the industry for nearly a decade, in 2015 I founded my own immersive experience company called Screenshot Productions.", "At Screenshot, we craft intimate, immersive experiences often for a single audience member at a time with the goal of placing the individual within universal human experiences and challenging them to consider their place and responsibility within a larger whole. We often customize interactions and dialogue for the individual audience member and in some cases create entire unique scripts based on answers to pre-show questionnaires.", "While this format provides a conduit for great emotional impact, it is not at all scalable. We often find ourselves only able to accommodate 100\u2013150 audience members per performance weekend and have to charge (prohibitively) high ticket prices in order to merely break-even on production costs.", "The central question at the heart of this project, then, is: Can we utilize data science and specifically generative deep learning to provide a similarly impactful and personalized experience over a long-form, interactive narrative such that we can impact hundreds of thousands of individuals simultaneously?", "Can we leverage personality insights derived from a user\u2019s social media profile in conjunction with fictional dialogue to craft robust, interactive and completely personalized narratives in a scalable format?", "Before getting too excited, allow me to say that the short answer is: not at this time. As text generation is still a relatively young field and my time at Metis was relatively brief, I didn\u2019t strive to create a long-form narrative. Rather, I took the opportunity during my time at Metis to craft a short-form goal as a stepping stone to this larger one:", "To successfully create a generative model that marries a user\u2019s big five personality profile with a fictional character and generates a short paragraph or tweet from that character\u2019s perspective.", "To this end, I was indeed successful.", "Just as in my previous project, the data I utilized was pulled from a massive film corpus compiled by the University of California Santa Cruz. The corpus was broken down by genre and contained 960 film scripts where the dialog in the film had been separated from the scene descriptions.", "The process was to clean and preprocess the data such that I was left with a pandas dataframe broken down by character and all dialogue instances as rows (for the full code, check out my project repo). Next I filtered the dataframe for characters that had 100 lines or more and each line consisting of at least 3 words such that I would return protagonists and main characters of any given film in conjunction with lines that actually had some significance in determining their personality.", "From here, I created a relational database that included the following information in a nested structure: film genre, film title, film character, and then all dialogue from each character across all genres:", "Next, I created a script that ran each individual character\u2019s dialogue through the IBM Watson Personality Insights program and returned back their detailed big five personality profile. Note that this is just the function to run each character through IBM Watson but that Watson needs to be configured separately:", "At this point, I had a 3,000+ database of characters and their associated personality profiles, so I moved on to Twitter where I used Tweepy to pull the last 200 tweets from any given user and wrote a similar script to also run their personality through IBM:", "The Twitter profile was then compared to all characters in the relational database and using cosine similarity, I printed out the character in each genre that was most similar to the user using this function:", "For the final step, I leveraged OpenAI\u2019s GPT-2 architecture to generate a short tweet from each character. The GPT-2 instance was trained using the GPT-2 Simple python library created by Max Woolf (thanks Max!), was trained individually on each character\u2019s dialogue in the corpus and was fine-tuned to print out a tweet\u2019s length of original content.", "The results of all this legwork were encouraging! I tested this with a number of Twitter handles from persons in my cohort alongside some famous profiles like Elon Musk (who was most similar to Spock from Star Trek) and felt that the results in most cases made good sense.", "With all this in place, I built some basic mockups for how the user might interact with this as a Flask application. The below pictures illustrate the genuine results from the @realDonaldTrump handle:", "In the above, we see that Trump is 99% similar to Charlie Croker from the Italian Job. The description for the character reads: \u201cthe leader of a cockney criminal gang released from prison with the intention of doing a big job in Italy to steal gold bullion from an armoured security truck.\u201d", "Yea\u2026sounds pretty spot on to me.", "The quote at the top is the output of the generative, fine-tuned GPT-2 model trained on the entirety of Charlie Croker\u2019s dialogue.", "While I\u2019m very happy with the results of this project, this is just the beginning.", "As mentioned at the outset of the article, the long-term goal is to actually create a dynamic, long-form narrative delivery that unfolds over the course of several months, that is delivered across a number of devices and mediums (text, video, AR/VR) and that dynamically responds to how the user interacts with it. This is obviously quite ambitious (and certainly not possible to realize during the course of a 12-week data science program) but I\u2019ll be working tirelessly in the coming year to make it a reality.", "In addition to merely create a long-form narrative, I\u2019m very interested in using the personality aspect to open up users to divergent patterns of thinking. Let\u2019s say that a user has a very low openness to new experiences on their big five personality profile. At the outset of the narrative, they will receive content from a character with a similar tendency to being closed-off to new experiences. However, as the journey goes on, the perspective of the character in the story will shift to be more open until at the end of the journey they are at the opposite end of the spectrum.", "The hope here is to essentially act as the antithesis of something like the Youtube algorithm. Youtube funnels the user down a path of more and more \u2018extreme\u2019 content based on your watch history. A user who watches a video that might have some right-wing tendency (or comments) for example might then be given a video with slightly more right-leaning views and so on. The end result is that the user is entrenched in content from a hyper specific viewpoint.", "For this project, I would like to establish a baseline personality for any given user, marry them to the corresponding \u2018fictional\u2019 characterization and expose them to divergent patterns of thinking through a customized narrative delivery. Said another way, I\u2019d like to open up the user to previously unexplored patterns of thinking, to broaden their viewpoint and ultimately help them to break out of established patterns of thought, rather than further entrench them in existing ones.", "The applications for this project are exciting and varied.", "I began thinking of this project as a way to scale the immersive experience genre, and while I think that is still valid, I see much more benefit and impact in a therapeutic application.", "It is well documented that the more we use certain neural pathways, the more entrenched they become. I like to think of these pathways as the tracks of a sled going down a snowy hill. The more the sled goes down the hill, the deeper the tracks become, until it is very hard for the sled to go any alternate way down the hill. Negative patterns such as additions can be thought of in this way: It can seem impossible to do anything but engage in the destructive behavior time and time again.", "However, it is similarly understood that our brains are remarkably flexible and that through neuro-plasticity we can actually rewire our brains\u2019 circuitry. There are a myriad of ways we can do this: through attention, meditation, psychedelics, psychological therapy etc. but as an experience designer, I\u2019ve always been fascinated and moved by the profound impact of story.", "I believe that stories are a uniquely powerful way to inhabit experiences that are different from our own and it is my hope that in this finished project, I\u2019ll (with the augmentation of data and generative deep learning) be able to effectively challenge the individual to find empathy and connection to others experience and thereby change their own operational modality.", "Your home for data science.
