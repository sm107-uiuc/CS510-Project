But, most often, newcomers try to take the fast track through the learning process to land a job faster.", "Rushing the learning process is not always a good thing; in fact, sometimes, people may tend to skip over some important aspects of the field in their attempt to shorten their learning period or because they find them intimidating.", "\u201cThe biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.\u201d \u2014 V. Anton Spraul", "Regardless of your target career \u2014 software developer, web developer, or data scientist \u2014 all IT-based career share one thing in common, that is, programming knowledge.", "In this article, I will walk you through the 5 steps \u2014 I believe \u2014 the correct approach to learning to program. Before we start, I want to clarify I won\u2019t be talking about how to program in a specific language. Rather, I will talk about developing the intuition and the thought process of solving a programming question.", "Being a programmer is more than just sitting in front of a computer clicking rapidly on a bunch of keys. When a programmer is given a programming question, sitting done and writing code is probably the last step.", "The first step is \u2014 and I know this is \u201cold-fashioned\u201d \u2014 solving the problem logically using a pen and a paper. Whenever I teach programming to a complete beginner, I start by explaining the logic behind solving programming problems and will use the pen and paper to solve many problems before we actually get into coding.", "To develop your programming intuition, you need to practice:", "This step is quite crucial, yet many seem to skip altogether. Learning the correct thought process and how to address programming problems will help reduce the time you spend solving problems in the future. It will also help you learn multiple programming languages faster and more efficiently. A great book about the process of problem-solving is Think Like a Programmer.", "Many beginners and some experienced programmers avoid learning data structures and algorithms because they believe it\u2019s complicated and not useful in real-life applications.", "Although you could \u2014 arguably \u2014 go somewhat far in your career without a solid knowledge of algorithms and data structures, having a good hold of these concepts will strengthen your knowledge base and allow you to be a better programmer.", "Algorithms are not a computer-only concept. An algorithm is a set of steps that, when followed, solve a specific problem. If you really thought about it, we develop and use algorithms daily! When I wake up in the morning, I always make some coffee. I get the coffee beans, grind them, fill my coffee machine with fresh water, and brew my coffee.", "I just followed a specific set of steps to solve a specific problem : my caffeine addiction !. When you learn how to solve a problem logically and develop intuition, you\u2019re basically learning how to develop and apply algorithms.", "On the other hand, data structures are how your inputs and outputs are going to be presented. Back to my coffee algorithm, the coffee's initial state will affect how I will prepare it. For example, if I have whole coffee beans, I will need to roast them and ground them first before I can brew my coffee. However, if the beans are already ground, I can jump straight to brewing them. Think of whole coffee beans and ground beans are the possible data structures for my coffee. Hence, different forms of data \u2014 or coffee \u2014 require different types of processing.", "There are many resources out there that you can use to build a fundamental knowledge of algorithms and data structures. My favorite two are The Imposter Handbook and this Coursera course.", "Complexity theory is one of the vital aspects that everyone writes code for a living \u2014 regardless of what the code does \u2014 should be very familiar with.", "Complexity theory describes how well an algorithm performs with respect to the size of the input and how it is implemented. In Layman\u2019s term, it describes how good your algorithm is. Computers, although capable of performing impressive tasks, have their limitations. If you develop an algorithm that is so complex it current computers can\u2019t run it, it might not be beneficial.", "When you\u2019re working on real-life applications, trying to tackle many problems, you always need to keep in mind your answers' complexity. For example, if I gave you a book and asked you to open page number 5, you can simply go through pages 1~5. Because 5 is pretty near the beginning, passing through the p[ages before didn\u2019t take much time. But say I wanted you to open up page 489. This will probably take you a little bit more time to do.", "That\u2019s what complexity theory describes. Although the problem is the same, different solutions can be prosed, not all of them will have the same effectiveness. Choosing the best solution is a skill that every developer needs to work on, and the base of that is complexity theory.", "The imposter handbook has a chapter on complexity theory that is very simple to follow. MIT and Standford also offer free courseware to learn about complexity theory if you want more in-depth information.", "Wait! It\u2019s not the time yet to learn a specific programming language, but you\u2019re almost there.", "You have solved many problems, developed your intuition, and know the basic algorithms and data structures used. You want to start writing code and build cool projects.", "Before you do that, my advice is to implement your algorithms and problem-solving skills using pseudo-code first. As we just discussed, an algorithm is a set of steps used to solve a specific problem. Pseudocode is defined as \u201ca plain language description of the steps in any algorithm.\u201d This means pseudocode is used to describe an algorithm's steps as a form between plain English and programming languages.", "Often, pseudo-code is used for human reading rather than machine reading. It\u2019s a way of explaining your thought process to other people and not to the computer.", "Let me put it this way; if your algorithm doesn\u2019t make sense to other programmers, it is even way complicated or inaccurate.", "California Polytechnic State University has written a good guide on the standards of pseudo-code. Moreover, this DEV article explains how to write pseudo-code and when to use it.", "Finally, you are ready to start coding.", "Once you\u2019ve built a solid foundation of problem-solving, algorithms, and complexity theory, you can sit down and start choosing a programming language to start learning. According to Wikipedia, there are more than 700 programming languages out there. Not all of them are well-known or used today.", "At this point, you might ask yourself which programming language to start with?", "The good news is, all programming languages are fundamentally the same. This means if you have a well-developed programming intuition, you can apply it to any programming language. You just have to learn its syntax.", "I want you to think of the different programming languages as different ways to say the same thing. For example, if I want to say that there is a nice garden near my house, I can probably say:", "All programming languages have the same vocabulary, variables, loops, data types, conditional statements, functions, class, etc. They just have slightly different ways of writing them.", "So, no matter which programming language you start with, you can learn another syntax in no time, provided your foundation is solid. That being said, based on your target career, some programming languages may be better to learn than others.", "Regardless of your target career path, if you want to build an IT career, you will need to learn and be good at programming. Although there are many paths you can follow to learn how to program, the correct path \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 is:", "If you follow the first 4 steps, the language you choose in the 5th step will not matter much. Think of the first 4 steps as the pillars of your knowledge; the stronger the pillars, the higher you can go with learning.", "Your home for data science.
