Unfortunately, the challenges we face do not have a set end date or perfect solution. Unlike other issues we face, COVID-19 will not simply fade away once its been \u201ctoo long\u201d or \u201ctoo damaging\u201d to the economy and livelihoods. In other words, there is no deal or concession we can make with the virus to instantly solve this problem.", "Due to this dynamic, the best we can do is to attempt to execute mitigation methods such as social distancing and wearing a mask until the exponential trajectory of cases is low enough to stay contained until a solid vaccine comes to market. This sounds straight forward, but as we have seen across the US when case counts begin to fade, the illusion that we are in the clear just to be greeted by a massive spike in cases shortly after we go back to our normal lives. So how do we predict when we are in the clear and when we are at risk again without simply using our hindsight bias to explain our current situation?", "Data Scientists across the world are working on this problem to predict the next outbreak. Methods range from simple statistics, graph networks, contact tracing and sometimes even involve the classic approach of throwing a \u201cNeural Network\u201d at the problem. Many of these approaches are tailored to population and viral cases, which allow for quick implementation. At the same time, there is a sector of Data Science(maybe the oldest) which has not been tapped to level that it could help. This is, of course, Quantitive stock trading or technical trading. Methods to predict outbreaks of stocks have been refined continuously for almost 100 years, mainly because the use case was immediate and money is a rather universal motivational driver. Technical trading indicators do one thing better than many other statistical models \u2014 they use the current environment. This helps to give more certainty as well as allows for decisions to be made by the person based on the algorithm instead of just reading a predicted number off a screen. Of the many indicators there is one whose job is essentially to indicate potential breakouts of stocks, so why not give it a try as we try to predict Outbreaks. Introducing MACD.", "The Moving Average Convergence Divergence or MACD is a 2nd to 3rd derivative indicator used in technical trading to help understand short term momentum changes and directions.", "The MACD(EMA short\u2014 EMAlong) works by tracking a short term Exponential Moving Average against the long term EMA. By doing this we are able to see when short term trends start to either converge or diverge from the longer term trend. If we begin to see the short term moving average diverge we can extrapolate that a potential break out is underway. On the other hand as the two averages converge we begin to see consolidation and under performance. Altogether the MACD is a measure of Momentum.", "To make even more granular decisions a Signal line can be plotted as well. The signal line tracks the momentum of the MACD, so another derivative level down. This allows us to see when the MACD moves above or below its own EMA. In short, when the MACD crosses the Signal moving upward we consider this a \u201cBuy\u201d signal and when it crosses moving downward we consider this a \u201cSell\u201d.", "To put this into practice we can take a look at what a MACD looks like for the recent breakout(or outbreak) for Tesla\u2019s stock. The red line here is the Signal(9 day EMA of MACD) and the White is the MACD(12 day EMA \u2014 26 day EMA). The histogram on the chart is a handy visualization of the difference between the MACD and Signal which I find most useful to track. For the most part, the MACD and signal were flat with little histogram action. Near the right of the chart where we see the marker line the MACD crossed the Signal followed by a rapid increase in the histograms. This is when the break out from about $800 to $1700 in about 1 month or so. Its easy to see how this happened after the fact, but its important to note that when the lines crosses or neared crossing there was very subtle movements. If you were to faithfully take the buy signal just based on MACD you would have made over 100% on your money in just about a month or two! We can see that currently, the MACD has pulled away from the Signal which signals massive momentum. Even if it slows down we remember that it isn\u2019t until the white line is about to cross the red downward that we should consider the rally over. *Disclaimer: I\u2019m not giving stock advice.", "By understanding how the MACD can signal Breakouts in stocks even when there is little visible action, I realized that we have the same objective with COVID-19. Case data is similar to stock price(obviously our hopes are inverse though). Given this, we may be able to see potential outbreaks before they happen and work harder to stop the histogram from widening out of control.", "As discussed by applying the same EMA equations and their derivatives to COVID cases we may be able to better predict and act on potential outbreaks that may not be visible in a typical case graph. In order to tackle this problem, I downloaded COVID case data from https://covidtracking.com/data/download for the US, my home state of Michigan, and Florida. From here I set up the model in Excel and calculated each of the derivative values. Note this could be done for anything from hospitalizations to cases, but cases will be used for simplicity of these examples.", "As you can see the first set of MACD value can only start 26 days into the data and the signal can only start 35 days into the data. This obviously affects the length of data as each of these sets only had about 170 days worth. To get a general idea of the result and similarity to the chart above let's check out the US MACD chart.", "I will go more in depth on the case count vs MACD on the next two examples, you can cross reference this chart with USA new cases if you\u2019d like. What we see here is the initial spike in mid February. Up until about the end of March cases continued to grow momentum until finally leveling off and eventually were moderately contained which is when momentum decreased. Just a reminder this chart does not show the number of cases but rather momentum so a y axis value of zero essentially means the same number of cases are added day after day, while a dip below 0 means the new cases are decreasing. The negative section here is right about when states started their reopening. Unfortunately on the 112 day of the data we saw the MACD cross the Signal, which is likely when people started to feel to comfortable. Following this momentum has grown and we have seen that the US continues to add more cases than ever. If this signal had been taken as a trigger to mitigate we may not be in the state we are. To take a more granular look lets look at state based data and how the outbreak were either mitigated or ignored against case data.", "As we know many states in the US are struggling with an explosion of new COVID-19 cases. One of those states is Florida. For most of the year Florida has had less than average COVID Cases. This unfortunately gave the illusion that they were in the clear and in turned allowed them to move back measures to mitigate the virus. Its very clear in hind sight that they were not in the clear, but that was not as obvious before the break out on the chart above. Lets look closer to understand what Florida could have seen with MACD.", "Imagine we are living on day 79. As we can see above up until day 79 there was little changes in cases. This would lead most people to believe that the virus was under control and not much could change regardless of changes in rules and mitigation efforts. MACD had picked up some subtle signals at this point and tells a different story.", "Take a look back at what the case data told us between day 67 and day 79. To the naked eye it looked like there was a steady case growth of 500\u2013700 cases per day with no changes to worry about, but small steady growths showed on the MACD chart that the changes were more than subtle. In the full chart we see that this turned into an explosion of cases, 15,000 added yesterday July 12. This is evidence that there must be much better metrics that lye beneath the raw data that could have signaled and stopped such a terrible outbreak. In that moment on day 67\u201369 nobody could have predicted the growth we saw, but a trading indicator from 1970 did just that. These simple numbers hiding in plain sight could have saved lives and hopefully will in the future.", "Here\u2019s the chart from my home state, Michigan. We were hit hard from the start but as we can see from the data, our mitigation effort crushed the momentum, keeping the short term EMA below the Signal for most of the time. From this data source there is not a single moment from early COVID that shows explosive momentum in MACD(this would have been in mid Feb). Unfortunately, the fun summer months created a moderately sloped cross around the 79th day. Luckily the case numbers have not been explosive, yet. The momentum has only just become positive and seems to be contained. But, the chart is showing us exactly what we saw in Florida which is a bit disturbing. The positive side of this is that we still have time to act and create the \u201csell\u201d signal(white crosses below red) we are all waiting for. If my state wears masks, socializes responsibly, and looks at the longer term benefit of a life without COVID rather than short term pleasures, we can create that \u201csell\u201d signal and soon find our lives beyond COVID.", "With a metric as powerful as MACD it is no longer a guessing game. We can see momentum move before cases do, which means we can take action to save lives in the most vulnerable populations. This could be one of our only legs up on an enemy in the form of a virus. I hope that this method can make at least a small contribution to the fight against COVID and can help people realize that following the data is always the best choice.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
