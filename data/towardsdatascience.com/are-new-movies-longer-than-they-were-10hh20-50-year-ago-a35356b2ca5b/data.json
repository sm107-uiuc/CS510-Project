When was the last time you went to the cinema and watched blockbuster which was shorter than 120 minutes? More and more movies (thank you Marvel for encouraging this trend!) have also scenes after subtitles, so you wait patiently all the way till the end, even if your bladder is killing you for some time already.", "These are the times when you could think \u201cGosh, movies are getting ridiculously long lately\u201d. Are they? I asked myself the same question. I discussed the matter with some fellow movie lovers. They had similar feelings. That wasn\u2019t enough for me. I decided to use my data analysis skills to investigate this issue. In this article you can read what I have found out.", "There is no better place to look for data about movies than IMDb.com. It\u2019s the biggest movie website in the world. Developed since 1990 (sic!), its database includes around 5.3 million titles and 9.3 million personalities. That\u2019s unbelievable, but it started as the list of actresses with beautiful eyes (for real, check IMDb history on Wikipedia).", "IMDb data is available for personal use on the IMDb Datasets page. We don\u2019t need detailed database for our study. In our final dataset we only need three columns for each movie:", "Unfortunately, we need to download two datasets and join them later. In title.basics.tsv.gz there is a lot of data about every movie, TV show and episode in the database. In title.ratings.tsv.gz there is info about number of votes and average rating of items from the database.", "Let\u2019s start writing our movies_data.py script with crunching this huge amount of data and preparing it for further investigation.", "So far it looks good. We have two datasets. One has 900k rows and 3 columns, the other has 5.5 million entries and 11 columns. Both datasets have tconst variable, which is unique id for every title. We can merge existing data on this column.", "In total there are 900k unique titles.", "Now we can investigate our data further. There is a column called titleType, which indicates if the title is a movie, TV show, episode, short etc.", "There are 11 types of titles. We are interested only in movies, so we will leave in our dataset rows marked as movie and tvMovie. We could argue if we should consider TV movies, but in the final dataset they contribute for only 5% of all titles and they don\u2019t change the results, I checked that.", "The number of titles dropped to 271k.", "Another thing we should consider are possible genres of the movies. We need to be sure that we consider only feature movies, not documentaries etc. We can check the genres column.", "There are 1313 unique genres! IMDb has a weird way to build database, because there is only one column for the genre. If a movie is drama, comedy and fantasy at once, it will be written as Comedy,Drama,Fantasy. After looking through the array, I could find for example:", "This column is a mess. Since first draft of this article to publishing it 4 new genres were added. Fortunately, we don\u2019t need to deal with this. We only want to filter out documentaries. Pandas has a great tool to filter rows containing some string.", "Finally we have only the movies we need in our data. Now we can drop all unnecessary columns. As stated before, we only need three columns:", "In the end we need to change data type of those columns to numeric and drop rows with missing values.", "After this step our number of movies dropped to 197.5k.", "Before we continue with further analysis, it is good to check descriptive statistics of our dataset to determine if everything looks all right.", "We can notice that at least one movie is only 1 minute long, which doesn\u2019t look right. There are probably some mistakes in the database.", "According to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, an original film needs to be 40 minutes or less to qualify as a short film, whereas a feature film is more than 40 minutes. That\u2019s a great rule to drop movies which are too short.", "What\u2019s more important, we are only interested in popular movies. There are thousands of movies in IMDb database which have only a few dozen votes. They can skew our results. Let\u2019s say a popular movie is the one with more than 1000 ratings. We drop all movies which don\u2019t apply to this rule (good bye thousands of TV movies and garage productions!).", "In our final dataset there are 27,951 movies. The shortest one is 43 minutes long and the longest is 450 minutes long (the price of Iron Bladder goes to anyone who can watch it without bathroom break!). The oldest movie(s) is(are) from 1911.", "On average every movie in our dataset have almost 25k votes, but the standard deviation is 81k, which probably means that the distribution is skewed right and the mean is overvalued by minority of movies with huge amount of votes (there is at least one movie with over 2 million ratings!). Median looks closer to reality, 50% of movies have 3,440 votes or less.", "Now we can save our data to CSV and move to a new script. This one takes a long time to execute. Python needs to download in total over 100MB data and process it few times. If we start over with a new script and smaller dataset, our workflow will be much faster.", "New dataset has the size of 515 KB, less than 1% of the original ones! That\u2019s how you get rid of irrelevant data!", "Let\u2019s create a new script called movies.py.", "We should start with thinking about the first year of our studies. Cinematography in the beginning of XX century was still in its infancy. There were not many movies created back then and most of them were just short presentations of new technology and experiments. Let\u2019s make a histogram with a number of titles in our dataset from these early years of movie history.", "Ok, somewhere around early 1930\u2019s number of movies starts to increase. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the years before 1930:", "These are just histograms with default numbers of bins (10), we just use it to quickly visualize our data. If we want to know the exact number of movies in our dataset, we should instead look at the table (or create histogram with more bins).", "There is only 1 movie from 1911 in our dataset and 1924 is the first year when the number of titles is higher than 10. This is not enough data to create reliable results. We need to decide what year we should start with. I decided to use the same rule of thumb as with popular approach to normal distribution. According to that, minimum sample size to create it is 30. Now we can calculate starting year of our data.", "Our dataset will start from the year 1931. Of course, we could take a quick peek at the table above to determine it, but the goal was to practice loops and conditions to automate the process in case of more complicated data.", "Our final dataset consists of 27,743 titles. What\u2019s interesting, the median release year is 2003, which means that 50% of all movies in our dataset were released in 2003 or later. It means that people mostly watch and rate new movies. Median for runtime is 100 minutes and the mean is 105 minutes, which looks right.", "Let\u2019s plot distribution of runtimes. We limited it to 40\u2013200 minutes range to improve readability. There are not many titles longer than 200 minutes and 40 minutes is lower band of our data. Every bin corresponds to 10 minute range.", "The most popular runtime is 90\u2013100 minutes. Vast majority of movies is 80\u2013120 minutes long. This is consistent with our movie-watching intuition.", "Let\u2019s find an average movie runtime by year. We group dataset by year and get descriptive statistics of every subset.", "We can create a plot of this data. Besides average movie runtime we can also create confidence interval based on the standard deviation. We will use simple formulas for that:", "Looks like our intuitive thinking about movies getting longer was wrong. It\u2019s true that in the first decades of cinema movies were shorter, they were on average 90 minutes long in early 1930s and reached 100\u2013110 minutes in mid-\u201850s. Since then there is no trend in our data. Also the confidence interval is fairly consistent with 80\u2013130 minutes runtime.", "However, it looks like 2018 can be a beginning of new uptrend, because it\u2019s one of two years in movie history when the average runtime was longer than 110 minutes. It\u2019s too soon to speculate, especially because 2018 didn\u2019t end yet and the number of movies getting at least 1000 votes will increase faster than for other years even in early 2019 (there are 597 titles in our dataset from 2018 and 955 from 2017).", "We can wonder what part of our dataset was considered when creating confidence interval. It\u2019s easy to check that. We need to find a number of movies longer (shorter) than lower (upper) band of the confidence interval and divide it by the number of all movies from given year.", "Now we can add new column to our statistics_grouped data frame:", "On average 78% of movies from every year fit into the confidence interval. We can add extra line to our previous plot showing this proportion by year.", "The plot looks a little messy, but the message is clear. Since late \u201940s our confidence interval contained more than 70% of titles every year.", "Let\u2019s create another plot, this time with median and interquartile range and check the results. We are mostly interested in the confidence interval, which will now contain 50% movies. 25% of the shortest titles and 25% of the longest ones will be outside the blue area.", "Here we also cannot see any clear pattern. However, the jump in recent 2\u20133 years is quite high. Still, it doesn\u2019t mean this is the start of new trend, but we should check that sentiment in the future. We can also notice, that the median is on average lower than the mean. It fluctuates around 100 minutes, about 5 minutes shorter than the mean. It makes sense, because mean is affected by a small percentage of long movies and median is just the central value from every year.", "OK, so now we know that movies in general are not getting longer. Maybe our intuition wasn\u2019t wrong and it only happens with the most popular movies, the biggest blockbusters. We can create few more plots and every time consider smaller sample of most popular movies from every year.", "Let\u2019s take a look only at movies since 1960, so we can have a closer look at data most interesting for us. Maybe if we take only 50 most popular movies from every year, there will be some trend visible.", "Because we want to check few different values, we can create a function to return statistics about n most popular movies from every year. We can use it later.", "Now we can get the data needed and create our plot.", "There is still no visible trend. What\u2019s more, when we consider smaller amount of more popular movies, even the peak from 2017\u20132018 disappears.", "What if we take a look at 30 most popular movies? Or 10? We can create new plot with means for different values. This time we will drop confidence intervals. Our top_n_movies function will be useful to do that.", "No matter what number of most popular movies we take, there is no sign of trend. When we consider less movies from every year, there is more volatility on the chart, which is in pair with our statistical intuition \u2014 smaller sample leads to higher volatility.", "To be sure that more popular movies are not longer, let\u2019s create a table with mean from all n-most popular movies of the year \u2014 mean of means.", "The difference between mean runtimes are marginal, they oscillate around 106 minutes with one exception of top 10 movies from every year, where the average is 103,7 minutes. As we said earlier, the sample here is small and volatile, so it doesn\u2019t mean that most popular movies are in fact shorter than average.", "We looked at the movie runtimes year after year. Let\u2019s create one last plot. This time we will generalize and create a new dataset with the decade movies were released instead of a year. Thanks to that we will have smaller number of groups and we can create a boxplots for them.", "There is a big jump between 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s, then a smaller one after 1950\u2019s and since then the differences are marginal.", "In conclusion, our intuition was wrong. There is no trend in the movies runtime. The differences are too small to be noticed. We can say that for the last 60 years movies on average have the same length. No matter what criteria we take into account, the result is the same. Thanks for the read! Now we can go back to watching movies!", "Your home for data science.
