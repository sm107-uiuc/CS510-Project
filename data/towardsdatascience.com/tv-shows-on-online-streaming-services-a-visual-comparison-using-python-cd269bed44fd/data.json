Take a look below at the Google Trends results of the interest over time from 1st January to 12th June. The boost in web-searches for COVID-19 and Netflix is clearly evident around the mid of March 2020 when COVID-19 cases were soaring worldwide and businesses were shutting down for the inevitable lockdowns. There is also an interesting weekly pattern where the number of searches increases during the weekend.", "I suppose, by far, the most popular service is Netflix. To back up my assumption, here is a bar chart of the daily average searches of Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+ and Hulu.", "In the distribution on the left, there were 56 searches for Netflix on an average per day from the beginning of the year till 12th June, followed by Amazon Prime Video at 9, Disney+ at 4 and Hulu at 4.", "If we measure popularity in terms of average daily Google searches then Netflix undoubtedly tops the list with a wide margin. Netflix, looks like, is six times as popular as Amazon Prime Video. Disney+ and Hulu are only half as popular as Amazon Prime Video and 14 times less popular than Netflix. Phew!", "Netflix has almost 2.5 times the total subscribers of Amazon Prime Video. Both are global service providers while Disney+ and Hulu have specific target countries.", "Disney+ and Hulu belong to the same parent company, The Walt Disney Company. Disney+, being not even an year old, has 80% more subscribers than Hulu, even though Hulu has much more number of shows and a better target audience distribution (refer to visualizations in the following sections). Hulu was launched in 2007, the same year in which Netflix was launched. Amazon Prime Video was launched a year before them in 2006.", "It is surprising that the combined subscribers for online streaming services by The Walk Disney Company cannot surpass the total number of Netflix subscribers. Rather, all three \u2014 Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+ , would not be able to match the total number of Netflix subscribers.", "Below is the link to the Kaggle dataset used:", "The dataset looks like the table on the left.", "The dataset has 5611 instances with Age, IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes Ratings missing. I did not drop the rows, instead filled \u2018Age\u2019 only with the string \u2018N/A\u2019. I also removed the \u2018%\u2019 signs from the Rotten Tomatoes Ratings using str.replace. The plots for the rating sites did not require NaNs to mask though I had to preprocess them a bit for Rotten Tomatoes. Since these are numeric columns, while exploring and visualizing the data, zeros would result into unwanted skewness in the dataset unless filtered, which happened to me (Yes.. silly). A detailed code can be found on my repository (link at the bottom of the blog).", "I also converted all the TV Show titles to lower-case and removed punctuation to see overlaps of names. Also, I created another column which contained the TV Show Titles and the year of release to distinguish from ABC Show 1991 from ABC Show 2020.", "For visuals, I chose the color codes for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ and Hulu.", "I created the reset_bar_width function to set the bar width dynamically because I like the barchart on the right.", "Here the code for setting the bar width:", "To generate this graph, I filtered the TV shows beyond 1930 (they are incorrect) and then grouped by present or absent in each online streaming service. Within those groups, I sorted the TV Shows alphabetically to infuse randomness \u2014 not sure if it was needed. The graphs look nice though:", "There were five clearly defined target age groups 7+, 13+, 16+, 18+ and all. Almost 44% of the data was unknown so I labelled them as \u2018N/A\u2019. Quite interesting to see that Disney+ has the most number of shows suitable for kids and quite consistent on ratings as well as we will see in the following visualizations.", "Boxplots are the best to visualize the distribution for continuous variables. The consistency of Disney+ is evident here as I mentioned before. Netflix, Amazon and Hulu are competitive to each other with similar rating distributions. Overall, Netflix has a wider range.", "I attempted to create a WordCloud of the shape of a triangle to fit the infographic. I barely used this but I really wanted to. I mean I used a transparent version since the colours, spacing and styling were not matching.", "This is to generate a barchart with the labels and values. I formatted the graph in the actual infographic just a tad bit.", "What I did here is first selected the hex code from my infographic\u2019s template (#FFC000). I used power-point this time and the color picker tool is very helpful in getting custom hex codes. The text placement for the words were easy. I selected a constant function of x and plotted the words. For the numbers, I selected a constant to plot the first text and decreased it by the difference between the current and previous bar height (or in other words, the difference between the current and the previous count of words in the dictionary) to plot the rest. I adjusted the first number (102) in the plot according to the rest as it has one more digit and it wasn\u2019t totally aligned.", "So, here is the code and below that is the graph:", "The top 10 words were love, world, show, life, war, story, girl, adventure, man and american. I expected love, life and world will be among the top 10 and here they are \u2014 \u2018love\u2019 reigning all the way.", "I accumulated all the charts and calculations into an infographic using Microsoft Power Point. I framed the outlines and used the font \u2018Broadway\u2019 for the headings and the front page texts.", "This is the first time I tried my hand at creating an infographic and soon will move towards using Tableau. I would love to hear some feedback on this creation as it is my first attempt and would like to improve.", "My Links: Medium | LinkedIn | GitHub", "Thanks for visiting.
