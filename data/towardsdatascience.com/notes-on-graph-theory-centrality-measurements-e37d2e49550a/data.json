All this analysis can be done using some simple topological measures that score nodes by their importance as a part of the big network.", "First, I\u2018ll try to introduce graphs abstraction by giving its definition and its mathematical representation since we will need it for later.", "Graphs are everywhere it\u2019s a well-suited tool to present data where connections and links are important for us to understand it. Like molecules structure that presents a collection of basic atoms which are linked to other, forming complex structure where each atom\u2019s connection in this collection means something\u2019s in terms of the usage or the characteristics of this molecule, in fact, changing one of this connection can give you a totally different molecule.", "This example will help us understand the basic anatomy of a graph that is generated by a bunch of nodes that are connected by edges. Basic anatomy? Yes, but keep adding these nodes and edges and you can create some complex networks that ever existed. Take the example of Facebook where nodes are users and edges are friendships or follows.", "As said, graphs can build up to become a complex structure, take the Facebook social network. Thus, it will be hard to study it just by observing it visually, so for that, we need to build mathematical tools that will help us understand or analyze our graph structure.", "We start with the graph definition as a mathematical object. A graph is defined by its set of nodes and set of edges so it\u2019s trivial that a graph G will be defined as :", "N denotes the set of nodes in our graph and E is the set of edges we also define the norm of our graph as the number of nodes", "As I said earlier we can\u2019t just use the geometrical shape of graphs to analyze them, but we need some sort of tools that encapsulate the information in our graphs and also easy to do mathematical analysis on it.", "For this, we define the adjacency matrix as binary 2d array n*n where n denotes the number of nodes. Each value can be either 1 if the two nodes are linked else it will be 0. And as you see in the example the adjacency matrix is symmetric for the undirected graph (a type of graph structures) we will see more about this in the next stories.", "Now that we have built the basic notions about graphs, we're ready to discover the centrality measurements by giving their definitions and usage. I'll try also to order them in a way you can see easily when to use each type of those measures.", "Centrality measures are scalar values given to each node in the graph to quantify its importance based on an assumption.", "Node degree is one of the basic centrality measures. It's equal to the number of node neighbors. thus the more neighbors a node have the more it's central and highly connected, thus have an influence on the graph.", "Although node degree gives us an idea about each node connectivity, its a local measure and doesn't show us the global picture. Let me give you an example :", "As you see the two nodes have the same number of neighbors which means they have the same node degree but look at their neighbors, Node 1 is connected to nodes with a high degree and so if we are choosing based on connectivity we will choose it for sure thus node degree as a measure doesn't take neighbors connectivity in consideration that why we call it a local measure.", "Eigenvector centrality measures a node\u2019s importance while taking into consideration its neighbors, in other words, it measures the node degree but goes a step further by counting how many links its connections (neighbors ) have . it uses the decomposition of the adjacency matrix . and so the Eigen centrality for each node i is the ith entry of the A matrix eigenvector with the biggest eigenvalue.", "we 've seen that Eigen centrality is global since it rewards nodes with high and important connectivity(connection in terms of quantity but also quality ). but imagine adding a new node and connecting it to a hub node. this node will have a low degree but a high Eigen centrality since its neighbor is a hub (high degree node ). To clear this imagine you are new to Facebook and you start following Barack Obama or a popular person, that doesn't mean you are that important inside of the network.", "in order to reduce the danger of fake or biased central nodes. The Google founders Larry Page and Sergei Brin invented a new centrality measure (PageRank ) that flattens/damp the effect of hub connection using a damping factor.", "This type of centrality measures node efficiency in terms of connection to other nodes. Witch node is more efficient when trying to send signals to other nodes using just fewer links? to understand this better let me give you another example.", "Imagine we have a road network where cities are your nodes and roads are the edges. you own a clothes business and you want to install a new storage facility to supply your clients in all the cities. Trivially you will choose to place it in a city that is closer to all the other ones, in order to reduce your transportations costs.", "for this use case, closeness centrality would be a good metric to choose your location since it measures the average path length. thus the higher your closeness centrality value, the more your node is close to other nodes in your network.", "A close measure to closeness centrality in terms of emphasizing on shortest paths is the betweenness centrality. It measures the percentage of shortest paths where our studied node lies in them. Thus a node with high betweenness centrality may have considerable influence over the information passing between other nodes. and so they represent a critical part of your network since removing them will disrupt links between vertices (nodes ) in your graph.", "As you've seen centrality measures gives node a scalar score that is easy to interpret and also helps you compare nodes in your networks in term of importance and criticality.", "Another major point is that every centrality measure got an assumption in the background, for example, closeness and betweenness centrality define importance as node efficiency in the information flow within your graph. Others like Eigen centrality or degree centrality rewards highly connected nodes. So my advice to you will be is to use a centrality measure based on your study case and if you want to take it a step forward you can combine them in one general centrality measure that fits your problem needs.", "Finally, if your using python, I suggest using the Networkx library where they have implemented these centrality measures, so take some time playing with them. And see you soon with another story on graph theory.", "Your home for data science.
