Every day we hear headlines of AI companies raising vast sums of capital to give them the resources to prospect the veins of AI gold. The money is flowing to these new frontiers. In the US venture capital funding for AI grew 72% year over year to a whopping $9.3B in 2018.", "Dataminr, a New York based AI and machine learning company that makes sense of news and information in real time, raised US$392 million in 2018, for example. Silicon Valley AI powered computer security and management companies CrowdStrike, Team Tanium, Cylance, Inc. each raised over $100 million last year. And Pony.ai raised $102M to develop its latest self-driving systems.", "But the Wild West frontiers have also opened up also in the East. Namely China. SenseTime, that focuses on innovative computer vision and deep learning, raised not one but two tranches of $600M in 2018. It now claims to the be the world\u2019s most valuable AI startup. And UBTECH, who describe themselves as an AI and humanoid robotic company, raised $820M in 2018. Face++, which leads in facial recognition, has raised over $600M and is current looking to raise $500M. And iFlytek, a company that claims to own 70% of the Chinese voice recognition market, is looking to raise $565M. These are really big numbers and we can expect bigger numbers to come.", "In Europe there are a few AI breakout stars such as Dataiku, a French AI tools company that helps enterprises move AI from experimentation into production. They raised over $100 million in 2018 but the deep pockets funding this growth are predominantly American venture capitalist firms such as New York\u2019s FirstMark.", "In London alone the recent London AI Mayor\u2019s report identified over 650 local AI companies double that of Berlin and Paris combined. Many of these companies are young startups with a particular concentration in the insurance, financial and legal sectors where there is demand. Money has poured in to these exuberant young company but funding tends to be in the millions and a few tens of millions at this stage versus the hundreds of millions in the US and China.", "But like any gold-rush there are a lot of prospectors who are making grandiose claims. Walk into any company pitch event or AI meetup \u2014 the modern day frontier saloons \u2014 you can find startup founders braying loudly as to how their venture is powered by the latest deep learning advances. But if you dig below the surface in the cold light of day there seems to be a lot of fool\u2019s gold. As London MMC Ventures noted in a recent AI report over 40 per cent of 2,830 so called AI startups in Europe are not really using AI.", "And there are even claims that AI tech giants, such as Microsoft and Google, are not always overly forthcoming about their reliance on humans to power their \u201cAI solutions\u201d. The Australian company, Appen, is in the global business of validating search results with a global team of over 1,000,000 flexible workers. It it a veritable army of people who are manually checking search results. Not what we would assume of these global AI leaders who preach automation of everything. As Lance Ng:", "\u201cTech companies benefit from the perception that they\u2019ve built sophisticated automation and A.I., rather than a system that relies on manual labor.\u201d", "We consider AI startups as those that either (1) would not exist if there were no AI modern technologies, such as deep neural networks \u2014 it is core to their existence or (2) provide AI infrastructure and tools such as AI specialist hardware, cloud services for AI applications, or tools to accelerate the implementation of AI solutions.", "The playing field for AI is wide and long consisting of AI makers \u2014 those who make AI technologies \u2014 and the takers \u2014 those who take AI technologies and extract value. In part one of this series I introduced a seven layer value chain for who will make money in AI.", "There are (1) AI chip and hardware makers who are looking to power all the AI applications that will be woven into the fabric of organisations big and small globally; (2) the cloud platform and infrastructure providers who will host the AI applications; (3) the AI algorithmic and cognitive services building block makers who provide the vision recognition, speech and deep machine learning predictive models to power AI applications; (4) enterprise solution providers whose software is used in customer, HR, and asset management and planning applications; (5) industry vertical solution providers who are looking to use AI to power companies across sectors such as healthcare to finance; (6) corporate takers of AI who are looking to increase revenues, drive efficiencies and deepen their insights; and finally (7) nation states who are looking to embed AI into their national strategies and become AI enabled countries.", "While AI startups are looking to offer new chips, cloud services and algorithms, this area of the AI value chain is dominated by deep pocketed technology giants such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon. They have become the picks and shovels of this gold rush. Whatever AI company is digging for gold the giants want to make sure they are powering that organisation with their AI hardware, cloud and algorithmic solutions.", "It takes a fortune to design, build and distribute hardware chips and so there is room for only a few startups. The British based Graphcore has raised over $110M to build chips optimised for machine learning. But they are playing in a competitive space as the likes of Google, Facebook and Microsoft introduce their own AI optimised chips. For example Google Cloud has introduced its Cloud Tensor Processing Units that are power their cloud services. And chip incumbents such as IBM Research and Intel are not standing still as they look to offer their own chips optimised for AI. The Chinese AI chip manufacture Cambrian is powering the hundreds of millions of mobile phones from Chinese Huawei.", "Similarly the tech giants are in a heavy weight content to see which of their cloud service can run the millions of AI applications that will be everywhere. Will it be AWS Startups, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure or even Chinese Alibaba? The battle is intense as the overall cloud market is estimated to be worth US$400 billion in 2020. And increasingly the cloud market battle will be over the AI enabled cloud.", "And then the tech giants are battling to make sure they provide the best underlying AI algorithms and cognitive services to power the millions of AI applications that will be built. These building blocks will be made that much more accessible by companies offering cloud based AI products. Computer programmers can today write a few lines of code to plug into really powerful AI services through application program interfaces (APIs). Google , Amazon, Microsoft, IBM are all offering machine learning and cognitive services in the cloud. This new category of AI as a Service (AIaaS) will power a wealth of conversational agents and chatbots, speech, natural language processing (NLP) and semantics, vision, and enhanced core algorithms programs. The algorithmic space is heavily contested but there are startups who seem to be finding room to carve out their own space by focusing on very deep domain and technology specific solutions. Affectiva, a startup offering emotion recognition software as a service, has raised over $50M. And Clarifai, a startup that provides advanced image recognition systems for businesses to detect near-duplicates and visual searches, has raised nearly $40M over the past three years. The market for vision related algorithms and services is estimated to be a cumulative $8 billion in revenue between 2016 and 2025.", "Enterprise software has been dominated by giants such as Salesforce, IBM, Oracle and SAP. They offer human resource software (HRS), customer relationship management (CRM) software, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications for departments such as finance and manufacturing. But many startups are rushing to offer the next generation of enterprise services filling the gaps where the incumbents don\u2019t currently tread. Some startups are even attempting to disrupt the incumbents figuring existing enterprise solutions are too expensive, cumbersome and complex for the enterprise of tomorrow. Today there are over 200 AI powered companies just in the recruitment space, many of them AI startups. Cybersecurity leader DarkTrace and RPA leader UiPath have war chests in the $100s of millions. But incumbents want to make sure their ecosystems stay on the forefront and are investing in startups that enhance their offering. Salesforce has invested in DigitalGenius a customer management solution and similarly Unbabel that offers enterprise translation services. And Salesforce recently acquired Datorama, an AI powered marketing company started in 2012, for a rumoured $800M. SAP recently acquired Recast.AI to accelerate its natural language processing capabilities for conversational agent technologies.", "And tools startups have been raising a lot of money. Petuum, Inc. a tools provider based in Pittsburgh in the US, has raised over $100M since being founded in 2016. They to help accelerate and optimise the deployment of machine learning models.", "And then AI startups are creating solutions for specific industries. BenevolentAI has raised over $200M to help power its moonshot to accelerate the creation of medicines through advanced data analysis. Everywhere we look across healthcare, finance, agriculture, automotive, legal, industrials huge sums of money are being raised by startups to solve industry problems.", "So what makes these AI startups successful? What is it that has allowed these companies to gain momentum and raise such large sums of money? It is clear that many AI startups are providing valuable point solutions to enterprises and are succeeding as they have access to (1) large and proprietary data training sets, (2) domain knowledge that gives them deep insights into the opportunities within a sector, and (3) a deep pool of talent around applied AI.", "Successful AI startups have really understood the nature of AI technology and how it is bought and consumed. AI is an enabling technology \u2014 a set of tools, technologies and methods that can be applied to solve a myriad of use cases. In the 1980s the introduction of SQL databases allowed structured data to be stored and queried in a tabular format. This enabled millions of applications giving rising to the enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management billion dollar industries . Similarly AI will enable a huge number of use cases. Vision algorithms are being used, for example, in nearly every industry from spotting manufacturing defects to recognising shop lifters to helping autonomous vehicles navigate the streets. Natural language processing can be used everywhere from reviewing customer sentiment in social media to reviewing legal documents for contract completeness to screening resumes and CVs to identifying potential opportunities for financial trading. And speech to text technology is being used in medical transcription algorithms.", "As AI is such an enabler many AI startups will be helping to solve problems for corporations and organisations. This means AI startups will often be B2B focused and heavily focused on the enterprise. At Best Practice AI we identified over 600 common business use cases of AI and over a thousand case studies of how AI is being used in the enterprise. There is almost a limitless number of ways that AI can be combined and engineered to solve business needs.", "And our directory of over 3,000 global AI startups identified that most of these are trying to break into the enterprise.", "And it is not surprising that so much of the activity is focused on the enterprise. Analyst firm Gartner recently predicts that enterprises will derive a stunning $3.9 trillion, yes trillion, in value from all the AI use cases by 2022. No wonder most AI startups are focused on providing solutions to the enterprise, be it horizontal solutions that work across all industries, such as AI powered HR, or AI solutions tailored for a specific industry.", "Those startups that are doing well generally understand the nature of AI technology and the opportunity in the enterprise. But more than that AI startups that are starting to scale have all crossed the commercial divide from a technical world to the enterprise. They have learnt:", "This culture popularised by Silicon Valley works well in a business to consumer (B2C) world where the consequences of a bug in an application are relatively limited. Software developers globally have embraced the lean startup and agile methodology. But this means live applications can often have bugs and break. This doesn\u2019t really work well in the enterprise.", "This is especially true in highly regulated enterprises such as financial services, agriculture or pharmaceuticals. Technology is driving greater more and more regulation. Europe introduced GDPR regulation in 2018 that provides rights to individuals as to the use of their personal data by companies. There will be significant fines \u2014 up to 2% of a company\u2019s revenue \u2014 for the misuse of consumers\u2019 personal data. And in the financial industry the response of \u201cwhoops, I guess the app didn\u2019t work\u201d doesn\u2019t work when you are dealing with real financial data and financial transactions. Revolut a new UK challenger bank that relies heavily on AI has found itself in hot waters with the regulators over alleged compliance lapses. And in a world where the consequences of automated decision can be life-changing, such as autonomous vehicle crashing or critical health care treatment diagnoses, you better make sure you are confident in the reliability and accuracy of your automated decision making.", "Corporates are increasingly putting in place board governance and oversight to manage reputational risks to their firm from the use of AI. For example if the datasets used to train AI algorithms have sample biases then a company\u2019s brand can suffer if they are seen as being discriminatory. We all saw the recent headlines where algorithms were shown to be much better at recognising the gender of white males compared to other ethnic groups. Or the recent case from Amazon where they abandoned their hiring recommendations systems as the machine learning simply mirrored the fact that hiring historically was heavily male, white and young.", "Increasingly startups will need to offer enterprises some level of assurance around the risks of their AI offering. Does your AI startup technology provide explainability for fully automated decisions that have legal effect? For example if your technology can be used to automate hiring decisions then you will need to explain how the algorithms work under GDPR. You need to demonstrate that the algorithm is not biased against people based on protected classes such as gender, age, socio-demographics or health challenged (feel free to take a look at our introductory readings on the topic of explainable AI). The Information Commissioners Office in the UK recently released a discussion paper that identifies eight AI specific risk areas that enterprises are likely need to manage including (a) fairness and transparency in profiling which is especially concerned with bias and discrimination, (b) accuracy of the AI models, (c) the level of automated decision making be it fully automated or human in the loop, (d) security and cyber risks and (e) tradeoffs in accuracy versus privacy versus explainability.", "Startups and corporates are going to need to be really well versed in this topic which is increasingly being referred to as Responsible AI practices. As a startup don\u2019t move too fast and break too many things. It could get you in a lot trouble. And ensure you are embracing and demonstrating Responsible AI practices (a topic I will write more on later).", "In the past few years we have seen a tidal wave of consumer mobile applications that addresses any imaginable consumer need. Apps can be built in weeks, launched and consumer traffic bought by placing ads on Google and Facebook. But this approach doesn\u2019t work in the enterprise. There is something of a zero sum game where there is little appetite from the chief information officer (CIO) and other executive leaders to embrace, yet, another technology solution. We all recognise work frustrations trying to use the latest application from HR or finance or sales or marketing. We struggle to remember our passwords. None of the new applications work the same. And then we often can\u2019t remember where we stored that file be it in the project or personal cloud folder. Technology leaders are frustrated trying to integrate more technologies into their existing and often fraying legacy databases and technology platforms.", "To get the attention of a CIO and a head of department, such as a chief marketing officer (CMO), your solution better be addressing a really important problem. The type of problem it should be addressing should be one where the manager is going to bed worrying about it and their bonus plan is clearly tied to it. \u201cNice to haves\u201d do not work in the enterprise. I was chatting recently with a CTO of an AI startup who has spent two years building an AI product suite to drive enterprise intelligence but the sales aren\u2019t coming. Why? Not high enough value yet.", "An example of a really high value use is from HireVue. They worked with Unilever to save over 50,000 hours in candidate interview time and delivered over \u00a31M annual savings and improved candidate diversity with machine analysis of video-based interviewing. That\u2019s a lot of money. Reinfer, a British startup that uses advanced NLP algorithms to sift through billions of emails and messaging to determine what people are communicating about, recently completed a pilot with a major international bank. It identified major issues in post-trade operations by analysing mailboxes with the use of machine learning with the potential for millions in operational savings. These are really high value use cases.", "Startups need to ensure they master enterprise sales. These skills are at a premium for AI suppliers as it takes time and hands-on experience to master consultative sales . The most valuable training course I took early in my career was the SPIN sales methodology \u2014 S(ituation), P(roblem), I(mplication), N(eed). Selling requires time to identify stakeholders, get a meeting with those stakeholders, assess the current business situation, ask questions to identify critical problems, assess the implications of those problems across multiple departments, build a consensus as to the implications and the need. And even then there is no guarantee that your solution to this need will get budgetary prioritisation.", "A typical corporate manager has a to-do list that lasts from here to kingdom come. For a startup solving a high value use case need is critical so don\u2019t just base your company on a \u201cproduct hunch.\u201d", "And patience is at a premium when a sales cycle can last 12\u201318 months. Many AI startups run out of money or assign precious resources to sales opportunities that are not qualified. Make sure you qualify out opportunities quickly if you think they will ultimately not lead anywhere. Re:infer found the sales cycle was really really long but they stuck with it identifying a really high value use case, finding an internal champion, and completing a successful sales pilot. They also identified that enterprises\u2019 readiness to rollout AI across an organisation can really slow the sales process.", "Startups need to be able to explain the value of their unique algorithm, technology, product or solution in a language that is readily understandable by a business audience is critical. They need to be bi-lingual. With many AI startups being founded by young, wicked smart and highly technical minds there is often a communications gap with the \u201csuits.\u201d We see executives\u2019 eyes glaze over all the time as the minutiae of this cutting-edge technology is explained. And if little context is provided as to how this technology can help drive a business forward \u2014 by impacting revenues, efficiency and customer service \u2014 the executive will lose patience rapidly. It is critical that startups speak the language of technology and business. They need to translate between technical and commercial languages.", "It is important that startups make it really simple to implement a pilot. AI solutions often require much data and much time to train the machine learning models. And AI often requires significant engineering integration into back-end technologies to work well. It can take months to acquire, clean and wrangle data then months to use it to train models. In enterprises that are very busy there is little appetite to do a lot of heavy lifting to setup a pilot. Companies want quick proof of concepts. DigitalGenius has done a good job on this front. Their customer service technology works on top of existing enterprise platforms, such as Salesforce, and they have minimised the amount of time it takes to train the technology to answer customer queries. They have also made it very simple to integrate into existing work-flows providing human-over-the-loop decision making. KLM, the Dutch airline, claims to respond to over 50% of customer enquiries on social media by implementing a machine learning chatbot with DigitalGenius.", "Startups need to ensure they have the skills to cross the commercial divide from the world of techies to the enterprise. The Harvard Business Review recently reported that the startups most likely to succeed have technical founders who have quickly hired business people. \u201cOne theory for why technical skills seem to matter more for a founder is simply that the average technical founder has better business skills than the average business-trained founder has technical skills.\u201d But blending the DNA of founders with commercial people often requires alchemy. I have lost count of the number of times that I have seen startups struggling to get this cultural fit right. The most common is technical founders will hire sales \u201cfarmers\u201d instead of sales \u201chunters.\u201d Farmers don\u2019t know how to go out and hunt for business which is what is required for a startup . The are used to big, fat marketing departments bringing them a torrent of leads to harvest.", "Building out enterprise AI technologies and products often require longer product development life-cycles than is typically associated with rapid prototyping of a mobile app, for example. It can take well over a year to get a product to market. Ensuring that investors understand the timescales and the investment profile is critical. And ensuring that a startup does not fall into a funding gap between seed and Series A is critical. In talking to a recent UK investor they said:", "They are encouraging the companies they fund to take more capital to ensure they have the runway for product development and sales.", "And the need to be bi-lingual players out in raising funds. Many investors today are not trained in the sciences and have a level of discomfort evaluating deep tech. Unless a startup can convince investors in their language of business market opportunity, use case, value proposition, go-to-market and economic, then they will struggle to raise money.", "I have often seen this language issue play out after money has been raised. Many startups are spin-outs from researchers in universities. The startup research team will work day and night to get a prototype out the door. To other academics the prototype will be simply mind blowing. But the air quickly gets sucked out of the room when an investor or a business professional takes a look at the demonstration. They don\u2019t get it. And then they try the demo and it breaks quickly. Without a reasonable understanding of the research and technology, the significance of development milestones might not be appreciated. All in all it can be difficult for the early progress of an AI startup to measured and recognised. This often means without the requisite understanding of the subject matter further fund raising can be difficult to secure.", "AI is generally a scale game. The more and higher quality the data, the better the AI algorithms which leads to deeper insights, greater productivity, enhanced products and services, and a better customer service. This can lead to more enterprise customers that leads to the collection of more data which leads to deeper insights and so on. That leads to more customers and more financing. There is a real potential for a flywheel effect and the creation of defensibility. Successful AI startups have figured this out and have been able to push the accelerator and get further and further ahead of their competition.", "AI is really a case of the big AI startups will get bigger. Scale matters.", "Most of the winners in this AI gold rush are likely to favour those with scale. The technology giants, such as Google or Microsoft or Alibaba are racing ahead. They can hire the best research and engineering talent, have access to the largest datasets built from their billions of monthly users, created the best products and have incredibly deep pockets. The countries with the most data and opportunities to take advantage of AI suggest leadership will come from China and the US.", "For startups to flourish in this highly competitive market they will needed to be supported by leading researchers with a whole battery of IP patents and published papers, deep domain expertise, and have access to ideally unique and quality datasets. But more than anything AI startups need to cross the commercial divide from a technical world into the enterprise. Successful startups know that they need to:", "They also need to ensure that they can raise smart and patient capital.", "Many startups will not find gold, but those that can scale will find themselves as global enterprises or quickly acquired by the heavyweights.", "And even if a startup has not found a path to commercialisation, then they could become acquihires (companies bought for their talent) if they are working on enabling AI algorithms with a strong research oriented team. We saw this last year when our client, BloomsburyAI was acquired by Facebook.", "I am a lover of technology and how it can be applied in the business world.
