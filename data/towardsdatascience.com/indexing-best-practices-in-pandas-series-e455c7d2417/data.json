That in itself is a very vast topic to cover in an article. For that, I would recommend you to read a book or Pandas documentation. But, I can tell you this much that this article will lift you off the ground in the journey of learning Machine Learning.", "In this post, we are going to talk about some of the best ways to perform indexing in Pandas.series. It is known that index in a Pandas.series need not be whole numbers. In the following example, we use strings for the index:", "Here, the index type of the variable george is object (pandas indicates that strings index entries are objects)", "\u2192 .is_unique \u2014 This is a function that determines whether an index has duplicates.", "Similar to NumPy arrays, a Series object can be both indexed and sliced along the axis.", "The indexing rules are somewhat complex. They behave more like a dictionary, but in the case where a string index label (rather than integer-based indexing) is used, the behavior falls back to Python list indexing.", "This series can also be indexed by position (using integers) even though it has string index entries! The first item is at key 0, and the last item is at key -1:", "Note: If the index is already using integer labels, then the fallback to position-based indexing does not work!:", "\u2192 .loc and .iloc \u2014The optimized data access methods are accessed by indexing off of the .loc and .iloc attributes. These two attributes allow label-based and position-based indexing respectively.", "When we perform an index operation on the .iloc attribute, it does a lookup based on index position (in this case pandas behaves similar to a Python list). pandas will raise an IndexError if there is no index at that location:", "In addition to pulling out a single item, we can slice just like in normal Python and you can also pass in a list of index locations to the index operation:", ".loc is supposed to be based on the index labels and not the positions. As such, it is analogous to Python dictionary-based indexing. Though it has some additional functionality, as it can accept boolean arrays, slices, and a list of labels (none of which work with a Python dictionary):", "If you get confused by .loc and .iloc, remember that .iloc is based the index (starting with i) position. .loc is based on label (starting with l).", "\u2192 .at and .iat \u2014 The .at and .iat index accessors are analogous to .loc and .iloc. The difference is that they will return a numpy.ndarray when pulling out a duplicate value, whereas .loc and .iloc return a Series.", "\u2192 .ix \u2014 It is similar to [] indexing. Because it tries to support both positional and label based indexing.", "Slicing can be performed on the index attributes \u2014 .iloc and .loc. Slicing attempts to pull out a range of index locations, and the result is a series, rather than a scalar item at a single index location.", "Slices take the form of [start]:[end][:stride] where start, end, and stride are integers and the square brackets represent optional values. The table below explains slicing possibilities for .iloc:", "The following example returns the values found at index position zero up to but not including index position two:", "A slice using the result of a boolean operation is called a boolean array. It returns a filtered series for which the boolean operation is evaluated.", "When the mask is combined with an index operation, it returns a Series where only the items in the same position as True are returned.", "Multiple boolean operations can be combined with these operations.", "While using boolean operators, beware of operator precedence, to avoid enclose operations in ().", "We looked at the index. Through index operations, we can pull values out of a series. Because you can pull out values by both position and label, indexing can be a little complicated. Using .loc and .iloc allow you to be more explicit about indexing operations. We can also use slicing to pull out values. In addition, we can also use boolean arrays to filter data.", "I am giving away a free eBook on Consistency. Get your free eBook here.", "This concludes this post on indexing in Pandas.series.
