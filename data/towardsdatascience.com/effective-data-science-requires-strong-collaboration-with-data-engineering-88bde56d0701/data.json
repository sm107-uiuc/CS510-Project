Without a good relationship between the two teams, there will always be a disconnect. My belief is data science cannot exist without data engineering. Data science will always need someone to collect and validate the data, creating the company\u2019s source of ground truth. Why not be a part of that experience and work closely with your data engineers?", "When I began my job search in data science and engineering, I often met teams that appeared disconnected from one another. The data science and software engineering teams did not come across as having a good relationship with one another. This baffled me. How can you operate effectively as a team when you are not communicating and acting like one?", "Starting in my current role, I began working on a data science team with little knowledge of who the software engineering team was and what they did. Looking back, I now know we have three main teams: data science, software engineering, and customer success.", "The main thing I learned while working with these teams is working collaboratively and communicating are two skills that can be hard to master but essential to function, especially when working remotely.", "Our project team is not only interdisciplinary, but it is globally diverse. Which makes communication even more essential to make sure everyone is on the same page. As I mentioned, communication between the teams was lacking, and it took me a while to realize what the software engineering team did. I attribute this to a lack of effective communication between the teams and not being introduced from the start. After doing some digging, I realized they were apart of two critical aspects of the project (1) data engineering and (2) the customer-facing application. So why were we not participating in regular initiatives with them? Because the relationship was broken.", "As I transitioned into a leadership role and became the team lead for my group, Tools and Machine Learning Platforms, I took it upon myself to improve our broken ties. Though I knew some of them, I did not know everyone, so I introduced myself and got to know the software engineering team. I started to learn who did what on their side, how they provide us with what we need, and areas lacking in communication and collaboration. My goal was to mend the bridges and understand where our relationships needed to improve. I did this mending through the two main areas where we needed help from software engineers: data engineering, and the customer-facing application.", "The first primary aspect of the software engineering team that needed better alignment was data engineering. Data scientists need a strong relationship with their data engineers. Working in Tools and ML Platforms, I began getting asks for many new datasets, to fix old datasets, or resolve problems with tables. Once I realized we had a data engineering team, I stopped this. We had data engineers, so why was Tools expected to duplicate efforts?", "We did not need two teams engineering datasets. We needed the two teams to align on who the data engineers were, what they were providing us, and how we could offer them feedback to improve. To help mend the relations between data engineering and data science, I took on three tasks:", "The small task force of people I got together consisted of the lead people on the data science team and the data engineers. We set up calls to meet every two weeks to discuss data quality issues that we saw on the data science side and give the data engineering team a platform to showcase their work or dive deeper into different topics. This meeting cadence allowed us to understand better who did what in data engineering and how we could work together. The data engineers are now able to receive feedback on issues that they were not aware of.", "After establishing bi-weekly calls to interface regularly with the data engineering team, I began to transition any datasets I was maintaining to the data engineering team. The group I was leading was not going to be responsible for these datasets. Instead, we wanted the data engineers to take charge in the area they were proficient in. They are the experts in this area. Therefore they should be the ones maintaining the ground truth datasets. They took on these datasets to optimize, standardize, and give back for use in an easy to use format. The transition set the stage for reducing duplicate work.", "Software engineering and data science needed to work as joint partners in the project. Duplicating efforts is a waste of time and money.", "By year\u2019s end, as the relationships grew more substantial, the team leads and product owners on each side sat down. We set up calls for 2021 that would allow us to clean the backlog for data engineering together. These calls enable us to discuss backlog items, future work, and planning. They gave us a better platform to understand the priority of work items coming into the team. Now we can start planning work on the longer-term with the team leads and product owners leading the charge.", "The other area of software engineering that closely aligns with data science is customer-facing application development. This application uses our analyses and libraries. Therefore we should have a closer relationship to maintain parity. To further communication and collaboration in this area, I began meeting once a sprint to deliver our library changes to them and discuss what they needed to do on their end with it. This was not an ideal solution, but we needed to start doing it to gain more trust in the process.", "As we began engaging more closely with the software engineers on the application, we began to develop a plan that would align our processes. This alignment would make work more efficient and less problematic through automation and standardization. The last problems inhibiting us from fully owning our analytic deployment would be resolved. As we started to plan the work, we formed a small, interdisciplinary project team to design and, eventually, perform this work. It included software engineers and data scientists from both sides. We developed an architecture diagram of the changes, pitched the ideas to both sides, and planned the work in the backlog for 2021. We will kick off the new year by coming closer together.", "Collaboration and communication with teams is an ongoing effort. People will come and go from those teams, their positions will change, and roadmaps will shift team focus to new initiatives. You will always need to champion an environment in which people work together to resolve common problems. As 2020 comes to a close, and we start planning out 2021, we are continuing the collaboration and communication between data science and data engineering. We are no longer two teams handing things over the wall to one another, but rather one team working towards a common goal, and working together to drive value for our customers.", "If 2020 taught me anything, it taught me that building strong relationships between your teams is essential. It would be best to promote a culture of collaboration and effective communication to work towards a common goal. Through these experiences, I have worked to mend the communication gaps between the teams and find platforms for individuals to discuss their questions, ideas, and concerns. I was surprised at the last project team meeting of the year to be given an excellence award for garnering trust within the teams. My leadership recognized the efforts and acknowledged that we are headed in the right direction. We are ready to form stronger ties in 2021 and join forces towards our next goals as the team we need to be.", "Data science will always need someone to collect and validate the data, creating the company\u2019s source of ground truth. Don\u2019t push aside your software engineers. Stand with them, and drive action as a team.", "How have you worked with your software engineers, customer teams, and business partners to improve collaboration and communication?", "If you would like to read more, check out some of my other articles below!", "I want to share with you what I have learned during my life and career thus far.
