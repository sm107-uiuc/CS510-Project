But AI for business is simple:", "\u201c99% of the economic value created by AI today is through one type of AI, which is learning A to B or input to output mappings.\u201d Andrew Ng", "Almost every business application of AI today is about learning to produce certain outputs from certain inputs:", "That\u2019s it! Almost everyone who uses AI to make $$ does it exactly like this.", "AI is powerful because it turns data into insights. But AI is less efficient at learning than people are (yes, way less efficient), so it needs a lot of data in order to learn. If you have lots of data, you should think about AI!", "Data is a competitive advantage, not Algorithms.", "That\u2019s why Google and Facebook have no problem open sourcing their algorithms. But they definitely don\u2019t open source their data. If you have a lot of data no one else has, then that\u2019s the perfect opportunity to build a unique AI system.", "So you have a lot of data. Now what do you do? Here are the 3 best ways I know to discover AI use cases:", "Where do you have software that automates rule-based decisions?", "There is a good chance AI can improve the accuracy of these decisions, because AI models can capture more of the underlying complexity that connects A to B. By comparison, when you write rules into software manually (the traditional way), you can only encode rudimentary dependencies.", "For one of our clients (ImmobilienScout24), we increased revenue from emails by 250%. By simply replacing rule-based email segmentation with smarter, and more fine-tuned AI-based segmentation.", "Another great heuristic I first heard from Andrew Ng is:", "\u201cPretty much anything that a normal person can do in <1 sec, we can now automate with AI.\u201d Twitter", "So what are some things humans can decide in < 1 sec?", "Also many jobs are a sequence of < 1 sec decisions. Like driving:", "Anything you can do in less than 1 second, AI can most likely do too. (or it will be able to soon).", "Large corporations like Zillow, Avito, Home Depot, Santander, Allstate and Expedia are running data science competitions on Kaggle. These are challenges they want outside data scientists to solve. So these competitions give you an idea of what types of AI solutions they are working on. It\u2019s really a great resource.", "Have a look at the competitions and get inspired.", "Many companies struggle (and ultimately fail) to build an efficient data science team. Why is it so hard?", "You might have a lot of data and a lot of ideas, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need your own data science team. Only after you\u2019ve built your first AI systems will you really know how much manpower you\u2019ll need in the long run. So\u2026", "Your first goal should be to pick the lowest hanging AI fruit and finish it quickly. This gets you miles ahead:", "With that first finished system under your belt, you are in a much better position to hire and train a data science team. Or maybe you find that you don\u2019t want (or need) to hire a whole team, because that low-hanging fruit already accounted for 80% of what you can feasibly do with AI.", "If you do build an AI team, you should build it for the whole company, not just one department. A horizontal AI team.", "AI experience is very transferable: To a data scientist, your CRM data looks almost the same as your inventory data. And to an algorithm, they look even more similar. So it makes a lot of sense to build one AI task force for the whole firm.", "Side note: For that to work, you should also have your data in one place!", "Either they have no experience, or they\u2019re trying to sell you open source for a markup. In AI, everyone is cooking with water, meaning they\u2019re using publically available algorithms.", "Work with someone who takes the time to really understand the business problem you\u2019re trying to solve and has high standards when it comes to engineering quality. If you want lots of results with fewer headaches, then the plumbing is more important than the cute algorithm that flows through it.", "The best ideas develop when you put three types of people in a room:", "Together, these three people can make realistic plans, really fast.", "If you need help along the way, drop me a line.
