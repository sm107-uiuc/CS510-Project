People are urged to stay at home, as countries close their borders and scramble to slow the spread of the virus. Schools are closed, and students have been sent home to continue the semester virtually (including our study abroad program, DIS Copenhagen).", "In this unprecedented time, people have reacted in a variety of ways. Various countries, political leaders, and the World Health Organization have all been criticized for their handling of the crisis. In particular, China has been the target of animosity since the outbreak started in Wuhan, and as a result, anti-Asian racism has heightened. Figures like Dr. Anthony Fauci and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo have emerged as leaders during this crisis.", "We wanted to take a closer look at how the coronavirus period has affected people\u2019s outlooks, attitudes, and mentalities. We looked to Twitter, a social media platform for microblogging and status updates, as the source for measuring these changes.", "The first event on the WHO COVID-19 timeline falls on December 31, 2019, when the city of Wuhan reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia, and a novel coronavirus was identified. Thus we chose that week as the starting point for the \u201ccoronavirus period.\u201d To mine tweets, we used this library that we found on GitHub since it allowed us to search by keyword, date, and language. For each week between December 29, 2019 to April 25, 2020, we collected (at most) 1000 tweets per keyword, and we limited our search to top tweets in English. To evaluate general trends during the coronavirus period, we collected an additional 1000 tweets per week without a specified keyword.", "We chose some keywords that are directly linked to the virus, as well as keywords we expect to have changed in frequency or in sentiment. For example, we have a China-related set of keywords, since the outbreak started in Wuhan China and has resulted in heightened anti-Asian sentiment. We also have Fauci and Cuomo, two figures who have gained attention in the wake of the pandemic.", "Baseline data: To get a clearer view of changes in tweets during this time and decrease the bias, we will establish a baseline by mining 1000 top tweets from each month of 2019 before the pandemic (from January to November). By comparing against the baseline, we hope to distinguish pre-existing trends from those that can be attributed to recent events.", "Data cleaning: For word frequency analysis, we split strings, then removed stop words (as defined by the nltk library), punctuation, and links. For sentiment analysis, we only removed links.", "To determine the sentiments of tweets, we used the VADER package from the nltk library. This package gives four different scores for a given piece of text: negative, neutral, positive and compound. The former three are the proportions of the text that align to that category, thus they will always sum to 1. The compound score is different in that it is a normalized, weighted composite score of each word\u2019s valence score. It is a useful metric to judge classifying text as either negative, neutral or positive, following the below criteria", "For all the tweets in each keyword category, we calculated its sentiment scores. Then we determined the average sentiment scores for that keyword category by week. Doing this allowed us to track how people felt about each keyword and how that changed over time, from late December to the present.", "For the word frequency analysis, we simply counted the frequency of each word for each keyword category, throughout the weeks. While doing this, we excluded counting the frequency of the keyword because these tweets were mined by looking for these keywords. From each counter, we found the hundred most-common words and amalgamated them into a set. We then took this data and created a matrix, where the columns represented a week and the rows represented a word in the set and the frequency of that word in that week\u2019s collection of tweets.", "We created bar chart race animations by creating word frequency matrices for each keyword and uploading them to Flourish. These animations show the most commonly used words \u2014 the top 25 for the general Twitter dataset and the top 15 for each keyword \u2014 by week, showing shifts in popularity of topics. Some of the words displayed in these animations are meaningless (e.g. \u2018like\u2019 in the general Twitter animation, the number one most-common word in that dataset), but we can still observe meaningful trends across our data.", "Across these two keyword bar chart races, we see a similar pattern and timeline regarding the change in the most common words. During the early stages of the COVID-19 timeline, the most common words for each of the keywords are related to other pressing topics of the time, unrelated to COVID-19. \u2018Fauci\u2019 has words such as the flu or HIV, related to the flu season, his role as the NIH director, and his prominence in the AIDS/HIV field. Meanwhile, the chart for \u2018china\u2019 is dominated by politically-affiliated tweets, like Iran, Russia, US, and war. However, COVID-19 begins to top both charts quickly, in a multitude of forms (i.e. \u2018coronavirus, \u2018\u2018corona\u2019, \u2018virus\u2019, etc). For \u2018china\u2019, \u2018virus\u2019 first enters the top 15 on the week of Jan. 5th, around the time that China first announced a mysterious, pneumonia-like illness which we now know as COVID-19. \u2018Coronavirus\u2019 dominates that chart from then on, as well as words associated with it, such as \u2018wuhan\u2019, \u2018cases\u2019, and \u2018outbreak\u2019. Similarly, \u2018fauci\u2019 sees a rise in terms like \u2018nih\u2019, \u2018transmission\u2019, and \u2018director, as the public is introduced to Dr. Fauci, who was an otherwise, relatively unknown character to the public.", "We see that Twitter conversations during the early portion of the timeline is dominated by information on the virus and the figures related to it. However, we see the conversation shift away from information, into more politically-nuanced ones beginning in March. \u2018Trump\u2019 quickly rises to the top of the charts, mirroring the prevalence of his COVID-19 briefings and his views/opinIons on COVID-19. People are not looking for or talking about COVID-19 in a medical or informational way; most people by this point are well-acquainted with such information. Thus the conversation on these terms broaden, as governmental bodies and the public consider and try to confront the ramifications of the pandemic.", "This bar chart race in particular highlights the associations and the specific topics that people have attached to COVID-19. Predictably, in the beginning the top terms in the \u2018corona\u2019 tweets are \u2018virus\u2019, \u2018china\u2019, \u2018chinese\u2019, etc. \u2018Trump\u2019 enters the chart mid-February as the White House Coronavirus Task Force begins in earnest as well as his briefings. During this time, interestingly, \u2018hoax\u2019 trends highly, perhaps as a result of a lack of widespread knowledge on COVID-19 and the relatively small impact of COVID-19 in the U.S. at the time. However, by March, \u2018hoax\u2019 falls from the top 25 of the chart, and terms like \u2018stay\u2019 and \u2018home\u2019 begin to trend. as stay-at-home orders are issued across states and quarantining at home becomes the new normal for many.", "Compared to the keyword bar chart races above, the words we see appearing in general Twitter dataset are much more varied and less specific, which is to be expected as these come from random tweets. From this chart, we can gain a general sense of hot topics across Twitter as well as how long it takes for different topics to become relevant to the public. For example in February, \u2018bernie\u2019 entered the top 25, which aligns with the lead up to several, contentious Democratic primaries and the prevalence of social media usage amongst his supporters.", "We might have expected that \u2018coronavirus\u2019 or affiliated terms would have a larger presence in February, as by this time the WHO had declared a global health emergency and the Trump administration had restricted travel from China for foreign nationals. Instead we see that, \u2018coronavirus\u2019 first appears in the top 25 on the week of March 1st, peaks in the week of March 8th, and then drops off the rankings on the week of March 15th. This could be by chance, as these are random tweets, however it also could be read as the initial panic of coronavirus, information regarding it becoming more widespread, and then a later decrease in focus upon it as people have gathered enough information regarding COVID-10, and they begin to adjust to the new \u201cnormal\u201d. The week of the 15th, \u2018quarantine\u2019 also appears on the chart, mirroring this phenomenon.", "During data collection, we noticed that, for several of the keywords, the library retrieved far fewer than the 1000-tweet limit in the early weeks. In other words, these keywords weren\u2019t widely discussed. However, as time went on, their mentions shot up. We\u2019ve plotted their weekly tweet counts here:", "The number of tweets mentioning \u2018corona\u2019, \u2018coronavirus\u2019, and \u2018wuhan\u2019 all spike on the week of January 12, when China announced its first death from the illness. It takes another month for the scientific term for the virus \u2018covid19\u2019 to come into wider use. And a month after that, Fauci and Cuomo gained more attention for their continued efforts. It appears that the mentions for \u2018wuhan\u2019 are already starting to decrease, as the city ends lockdown and begins its return to normal life.", "As a baseline, we plotted the progression of general Twitter sentiments from January to November 2019. It appears there is high variability in Twitter sentiment to begin with. Positive sentiment generally lies between 1.00 and 0.50 \u2014 in other words, statements are 50\u2013100% positive. Neutral and negative sentiment lie between 0.0 and 0.30.", "In the coronavirus period, we expected to see a decreased positive sentiment and increased negative sentiment. However, we were surprised to find lower negative sentiment scores. There was one notable dip in positive sentiment in the first week of March \u2014 the week when the first death was reported in the US.", "Insights from coronavirus-related keywords: Before the pandemic started, the term \u2018corona\u2019 was mostly associated with the beer. We can see that \u2018Corona\u2019 started off with compound sentiment consistently above zero, or positive. However, March marks a change in meaning: the compound sentiment inverts to the negatives and the level of negative sentiment trends upward.", "\u2018Covid-19\u2019 had surprisingly low levels of negative sentiment and high levels of positive sentiment. We noticed similar trends with the \u2018coronavirus\u2019. The biggest dip in compound sentiment occurred in March, when countries started taking more drastic measures. For example, the E.U. barred most travelers from outside the bloc. Within the US, states like California issued shelter-in-place orders. Looking at the raw data, we can see that many of the tweets are announcements regarding health and safety updates on the virus, news headlines, fundraising, and promoting virus-prevention protocols. All these topics tend to have neutral or positive sentiment. Here are a few examples:", "\u201c$1 MILLION That\u2019s how much you\u2019ve helped us raise on @Facebook in 24 hours for the #COVID19Fund.

Read a summary of the call here: http://ow.ly/1CQJ50yLXuI", "The sentiment in the first few weeks looks markedly different from the rest. Looking at the raw data, we realized that the library pulled tweets by users with \u2018covid19\u2019 in their twitter handle. Thus in the first three weeks, there is no mention of the virus among tweets, accounting for the difference in sentiment.", "Insights from China-related keywords: \u2018Wuhan\u2019 was the only term that gave meaningful insight into this period of time. The other three terms (\u2018asian\u2019, \u2018china\u2019, and \u2018chinese\u2019) fluctuated similarly to the baseline data. Along with the \u2018virus\u2019 keyword, this indicates that the usage of more general terms didn\u2019t change significantly during this period. We observed negative compound sentiment throughout the entire period, with two anomalous spikes on 1/5/2020 and 4/5/2020. This is no surprise since the coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, and many feel that the early cases there were mishandled.", "Insights from public figure keywords: We were expecting sentiments for Fauci and Cuomo to trend upwards over time. However, we did not find any significant changes, and their sentiments fluctuated similarly to the baseline. We did observe that Fauci\u2019s positive sentiment scores were slightly higher than the baseline. While baseline tweets had positive sentiment scores between 1.0 and 0.50, Fauci\u2019s positive sentiment fell between 1.0 and 0.75, particularly later on as he gained popularity,", "We acknowledge Twitter data may not accurately be representative of the sentiment and outlook of all demographics. We could expect to see very different results if we used different data sources, such as news outlets. People that are negatively affected by the coronavirus may not be on Twitter or have the time to tweet about their misfortunes, particularly those with low socioeconomic status. Celebrities and others in privileged positions have faced backlash for social media posts that are insensitive to challenges that people are facing due to the pandemic.", "On the whole, we expected higher negative sentiment on Twitter during the coronavirus period. We expected to see more people complaining about quarantine life and social distancing. In reality, we saw some spikes in neutral sentiment. As a potential explanation, we found that many of the tweets linked to coronavirus keywords were about news and health/safety updates. We were also expecting to see a decrease in negative sentiment towards Asians during the coronavirus time period. However, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the general sentiment stayed about the same. It is heartening to see the volume of tweets about fundraising, promoting awareness of safety guidelines, and acknowledging front-line workers.", "Your home for data science.
