If you are interested to learn more about the high-level or best practices of modern BI stacks, feel free to check out the link to see our progress.", "A data warehouse is a type of analytics database that stores and processes your data for the purpose of analytics. Your data warehouse will handle two main functions of your analytics: store your analytical data & process your analytical data.", "Why do you need one? You will need a data warehouse for two main purposes:", "Your data warehouse is the centerpiece of every step of your analytics pipeline process, and it serves three main purposes:", "At the moment, most data warehouses use SQL as their primary querying language.", "The TL;DR answer is that it depends. It depends on the stage of your company, the amount of data you have, your budget, and so on.", "At an early stage, you can probably get by without a data warehouse, and connect a business intelligence (BI) tool directly to your production database (A simple BI setup for people just starting out).", "However, if you are still not sure if a data warehouse is the right thing for your company, consider the below pointers:", "First, do you need to analyze data from different sources?", "At some point in your company\u2019s life, you would need to combine data from different internal tools in order to make better, more informed business decisions.", "For instance, if you\u2019re a restaurant and want to analyze orders/waitress ratio efficiency (which hour of the week the staff is most busy vs most free), you need to combine your sales data (from POS system) with your staff duty data (from HR system).", "For those analyses, it is a lot easier to do if your data is located in one central location.", "Second, do you need to separate your analytical data from your transactional data?", "As mentioned, your transactional systems are not designed for analytical purposes. So if you collect activity logs or other potentially useful pieces of information in your app, it\u2019s probably not a good idea to store this data in your app\u2019s database and have your analysts work on the production database directly.", "Instead, it\u2019s a much better idea to purchase a data warehouse \u2014 one that\u2019s designed for complex querying \u2014 and transfer the analytical data there instead. That way, the performance of your app isn\u2019t affected by your analytics work.", "Third, is your original data source not suitable for querying?", "For example, the vast majority of BI tools do not work well with NoSQL data stores like MongoDB. This means that applications that use MongoDB on the backend need their analytical data to be transferred to a data warehouse, in order for data analysts to work effectively with it.", "Fourth, do you want to increase the performance of your analytical queries?", "If your transactional data consists of hundreds of thousands of rows, it\u2019s probably a good idea to create summary tables that aggregate that data into a more queryable form. Not doing so will cause queries to be incredibly slow \u2014 not to mention having them being an unnecessary burden on your database.", "If you answered yes to any of the above questions, then chances are good that you should just get a data warehouse.", "That said, in our opinion, it\u2019s usually a good idea to just go get a data warehouse, as data warehouses are not expensive in the cloud era.", "Here are some common data warehouses that you may pick from:", "If you\u2019re just getting started and don\u2019t have a strong preference, we suggest that you go with Google BigQuery for the following reasons:", "(Note: we don\u2019t have any affiliation with Google, and we don\u2019t get paid to promote BigQuery).", "However, if you have a rapidly increasing volume of data, or if you have complex/special use cases, you will need to carefully evaluate your options.", "Below, we present a table of the most popular data warehouses. Our intention here is to give you a high-level understanding of the most common choices in the data warehouse space. This is by no means comprehensive, nor is it sufficient to help you make an informed decision.", "But it is, we think, a good start:", "At this point some of you might be asking:", "\u201cHey isn\u2019t a data warehouse just like a relational database that stores data for analytics? Can\u2019t I just use something like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL or Oracle as my data warehouse?\u201d", "The short answer is: yes you can.", "The long answer is: it depends. First, we need to understand a few concepts.", "It is important to understand the difference between two kinds of database workloads: transactional workloads and analytical workloads.", "A transactional workload is the querying workload that serves normal business applications. When a visitor loads a product page in a web app, a query is sent to the database to fetch this product, and return the result to the application for processing.", "(the query above retrieves information for a single product with ID 123)", "Here are several common attributes of transactional workloads:", "Analytical workloads, on the other hand, refer to workload for analytical purposes, the kind of workload that this book talks about. When a data report is run, a query will be sent to DB to calculate the results, and then displayed to end-users.", "(The above query scans the entire products table to count how many products are there in each category)", "Analytical workloads, on the other hand, have the following attributes:", "Below is a comparison table between transactional vs analytical workload/databases.", "Transactional workloads have many simple queries, whereas analytical workloads have few heavy queries.", "Because of the drastic difference between the two workloads above, the underlying backend design of the database for the two workloads are very different. Transactional databases are optimized for fast, short queries with high concurrent volume, while analytical databases are optimized for long-running, resource-intensive queries.", "What are the differences in architecture you ask? This will take a dedicated section to explain, but the gist of it is that analytical databases use the following techniques to guarantee superior performance:", "As you can probably guess by now, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, and Oracle databases are designed to handle transactional workloads, whereas data warehouses are designed to handle analytical workloads.", "Like we\u2019ve said earlier, yes you can, but it depends.", "If you\u2019re just starting out with small set of data and few analytical use cases, it\u2019s perfectly fine to pick a normal SQL database as your data warehouse (most popular ones are MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL or Oracle). If you\u2019re relatively big with lots of data, you still can, but it will require proper tuning and configuring.", "That said, with the advent of low-cost data warehouse like BigQuery, Redshift above, we would recommend you go ahead with a data warehouse.", "However, if you must choose a normal SQL-based database (for example your business only allows you to host it on-premise, within your own network) we recommend going with PostgreSQL as it has the most features supported for analytics. We\u2019ve also written a detailed blog post discussing this topic here: Why you should use PostgreSQL over MySQL for analytics purpose.", "In this post, we zoomed in into data warehouse and spoke about:", "Originally published at The Analytics Setup Guidebook by Holistics: Understanding The Data Warehouse.", "Your home for data science.
