In particular, we argued that data in an individual\u2019s personal data cloud should be deemed as an asset of private property. To recap, here are our main takeaways from that article:", "The ideas in this post are further explained in the law review article published in the Harvard Journal of Law and Technology Digest (2021) here.", "As mentioned before, personal data ownership is possible only with respect to data that individuals hold in their personal data clouds. In our previous article, we also emphasized that it would be unreasonable for individuals to claim ownership over all personal data that is out there. Such a broad claim can not be justified due to the lack of clarity regarding what data should be considered \u201cpersonal\u201d.", "This is particularly true, bearing in mind that there are many layers of data. Such layers of data can be differentiated depending on (i) the level of sensitivity or proximity to an individual\u2019s private life; (ii) who owns it (device manufacturer, service providers, data aggregators, government, or individuals themselves); or (iii) whether the individual can access that data or affect how that data can be used.", "Here are some examples of data that fall into complex, ambiguous categories: data collected by national tax agencies, personal data collected by federal immigration authorities, medical data collected by health providers, employee data collected by employers, location and mobility data collected by ride-sharing service providers, public data concerning lists of sexual offenders, social network sites which host data manually provided by the users of the platform. And so on.", "There is another dimension to the collection of personal data and its use in marketing. From the advertising business point of view, companies that seek to connect with their customers are most interested in the following layers of data:", "As we have previously shown, even if service providers are legally required to provide very detailed information about the data they collect (that would clearly fall into categories 3 and 4 above), they refuse to do so. In fact, we have tested dozens of services and figured out that users are lucky if they even get copies of some of their input data.", "From our earlier study of more than 250 stakeholder comments on proposed CCPA regulations, we learned that businesses and service providers treat most of the data they collect about their customers as proprietary data or trade secrets.", "There is a widely held sentiment among individual consumers that each and every one of us should own our data. The moral justification of conferring personal data ownership rights to individuals is extremely powerful. During the last two centuries, a solid philosophical school of thought (refined by Immanuel Kant) has advanced the argument that individuals have a unique and intimate bond with their personal property. Here is one relevant quote:", "In making the object my own, I stamped it with the mark of my own person; whoever attacks it attacks me; the blow struck it strikes me, for I am present in it. Property is but the periphery of my person extended to things. \u2014 R. von Jhering", "Such a personal nexus is even more evident in the relationship between individuals and the data they constantly generate. Still, regardless of how strongly this ethical feeling is shared among the members of society, moral theory alone is practically meaningless unless:", "(a) individual consumers have tools that help them compile copies of their data and control how that data is used;", "(b) there is a clear delineation of what kinds of personal data such ownership rights cover; and", "(c) there is a solid economic rationale to justify the conferral of ownership rights over personal data.", "Regarding (a) and (b), technologies that are built on the user-centric, user-held data model help achieve both of these goals. However, some consumer data rights advocates submit that even if one could agree that individuals should own their personal data in principle, the property law system would not be able to handle the complexities presented by data. Are they correct?", "A well-educated lawyer would likely comment that ownership rights cover both tangible and intangible assets. The historical roots of this division of assets can be traced back to the times of classical Roman law (first 250 years AD) when Romans distinguished corporeal things (res corporales), i.e., parcels of land, cattle, and other material possession, and incorporeal things (res incorporales), which would be a person\u2019s rights and obligations, other types of assets that can be inherited, and intangible property, such as the right to one\u2019s social name.", "This system of corporeal and incorporeal things has been inherited in virtually all legal systems. Almost all Western democracies (with some exceptions in Germany and Greece) have consistently recognized that objects of ownership include both corporeal and incorporeal assets.", "For those who need further illustrations, here are some examples of incorporeal assets that are without any doubt considered as objects of personal ownership:", "It goes without saying that data is a new type of asset, but this does not mean it cannot be treated as an object of ownership. In fact, tech giants have already established their position that all the data they hold in their servers constitutes a proprietary asset and trade secret. The same should be true for individuals\u2019 unique sets of data in their personal data clouds.", "Over centuries, philosophers and lawyers have attempted to set forth the philosophical bases of private property and establish rights over property that law bestows upon individuals. On the other hand, the role of economists has been mainly focused on explaining the general utility of private property.", "From an economic perspective, the creation of ownership over new types of assets requires (a) strong justification for whether or not there is a need to recognize ownership and (b) clarification of what is protected by ownership, what exceptions and limitations to ownership exist, and what remedies are available for those whose ownership rights have been violated. In the following sections, we\u2019ll analyze some of the issues that arise if we approach personal data ownership from the perspective of costs and benefits.", "The main objective of economics is to determine the most efficient allocation of limited resources. This notion of scarcity plays a crucial role in complex economic decisions that actors have to make every day. It is no secret that in the current economic environment, many brands struggle to understand even the basic characteristics of their customers and are looking for new opportunities to establish direct relationships with individual consumers. However, asymmetries in the market make this task difficult (i.e., lack of tools and high costs of direct-to-consumer interactions, among other things).", "The scarcity of information about customers is a powerful driving force in consumer markets. In this regard, a user-centric, user-held data model helps individuals possess their personal data and activate that data in interactions with various brands and service providers, who are hungry for accurate data about their customers. This is significantly different from Facebook-era \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d situations, in which individual consumers had to agree to the Terms of Use of service providers unconditionally. In the user-centric, user-held data environment, personal data becomes a long-term asset that brings daily value to the individual.", "The second question that economists may consider in assessing the possibility of conferring ownership rights to new assets relates to the problem of monopolies. Would the asset holder be likely to gain a market monopoly and thus adversely affect other stakeholders? How would such ownership rights affect competition in the market? What will be the effect on the quality of goods and services at hand? Will prices increase? Finally, would artificial barriers that make it harder to enter the market arise?", "The current data ecosystem is dominated by the four tech titans: Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple (there are more large players, but these are the largest and most well known). The fact of the matter is that these four technology whales are already dominating the data market. Their positions in various verticals, as well as business practices, led to an intervention by regulators in the EU and California, who adopted the GDPR and CCPA in respective jurisdictions.", "The GDPR and CCPA confer certain data rights to individuals, such as the right to know, right to access, right to delete, right to opt-out of the sale of data, and the right to data portability. It is important to emphasize that both GDPR and CCPA are public law (i.e., legislative) interventions and that their main objective is to adjust the balance among players in the market (specifically, data processors and individuals whose data is being processed). The GDPR and CCPA should therefore not be confused with private law instruments, such as property rights, as these instruments serve very different purposes.", "From an economic point of view, private law institutions \u2014 such as ownership \u2014 have two main objectives: (a) delineate the relationship between individuals and the property they own and (b) prevent others from meddling with that personal property. As the owner of the asset, the individual is free to choose what to do with it. There are four \u201cclassical\u201d rights that all democratic systems grant to the owner of an asset: the right to possess, right to use, right to dispose of, and the right to earn fruits from the asset (these rights were already known in the classical period of Roman property law).", "Hence, as the owners of personally held data, individuals can make independent choices regarding how they want to utilize their property; they can determine the conditions under which third parties can access their data and revoke permissions as they see fit.", "From an economic point of view, it is also important to investigate how the conferral of new property rights would affect innovation. To provide an economic justification for the conferral of ownership rights over user-held data, we need to examine how value is generated.", "Traditional economic models are based on vertical value chains where value is added at each step of distribution. However, in the user-centric data economy, most decisions are based on data and AI-powered tools that help automate the process and reduce the transaction cost at every step of the interaction. Interactions in the user-centric data economy are based on the ability to provide bespoke personalized value to individuals while more thoroughly preserving their privacy. The user-centric environment would also have fewer entry barriers than the current ecosystem, as applications could be built to run directly on top of user-held data.", "The user-centric, user-held data model opens new opportunities for all stakeholders in the data market: individuals are finally able to exercise their autonomy and take advantage of tools that let them control the use of their personal data, while companies have new opportunities to directly engage with their customers and offer new types of bespoke products and services.", "Furthermore, the whole society benefits from the user-centric, user-held data model, as it fosters the implementation of new technologies, such as edge computing, machine learning, personalization of AI, differential privacy, etc. In terms of social fairness, individuals will know that their personal data is stored securely and is responsibly used by third parties, which increases their empowerment and sense of security.", "We have shown that in the user-centric, user-held data environment, data ownership rights are extended only to that segment of personal data over which individuals can claim factual exclusivity (i.e., personal data that is held by the individual in a personal data cloud).", "Generally speaking, personal ownership rights should not be conferred if factual exclusivity over an object/asset can not be established.", "Conferring property rights is important from the perspective of transaction costs and available remedies. As the owner of an asset, a person or entity can determine how to generate the most value from the asset. Property law also grants the owner the strongest legal protection: the owner can seek protection against any third party that threatens to meddle with the object. (This does not apply in cases of contractual obligations where legal remedies are usually available only among the contracting parties).", "Hence, property rights lead to greater protection of the rightful owner while also contributing to greater legal certainty in a society.", "In this post, we examined only one narrow segment of personal data ownership: the ownership of data held by the individual in her personal data cloud. Further debate is clearly needed with regard to uses of data that is not user-held, such as contact tracing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.", "We can further advance the debate on data by looking at specific segments of data and determine whether they could be assigned to one of the following categories of ownership:", "Your home for data science.
