Living in the era of readily available information and instantaneous communication, it is not surprising that data architectures have been shifting to be stream-oriented. Real value for companies doesn\u2019t just come from sitting on a gargantuan amount of collected data points, but also from their ability to extract actionable insights as quickly as possible (even in real-time). Processing data at faster rates allows a company to react to changing business conditions in real-time.", "It goes without saying that over the last decade, there has been a constant growth for applications (aka message-broker software) capable of capturing, retain and process this overwhelmingly rapid flow of information. As of 2020, Apache Kafka is one of the most widely adopted message-broker software (used by the likes of Netflix, Uber, Airbnb and LinkedIn) to accomplish these tasks. This blog will give a very brief overview of the concept of stream-processing, streaming data architecture and why Apache Kafka has gained so much momentum.", "Stream-processing is best visualised as a river. In the same way that water flows through a river, so do packages of information in the endless flow of stream-processing.", "According to AWS, the general definition of streaming data would be \u201cdata that is generated continuously by thousands of data sources, which typically send in the data records simultaneously, and in small sizes (order of Kilobytes)\u201d.", "Data streaming works particularly well in time-series in order to find underlying patterns over time. It also really shines in the IoT space where different data signals can be constantly collected. Other common uses are found on web interactions, e-commerce, transaction logs, geolocation points and much much more.", "There is a subtle difference between real-time processing and stream-processing:", "The canonic streaming data architecture is composed of 3 fundamental blocks:", "Two very famous new-generations message-broker software are Apache Kafka and Amazon Kinesis as opposed to older types such as RabbitMQ and Active MQ.", "The raw data is then transformed, cleaned and aggregated so that it can be then used by SQL-based systems in order to be analysed later on.", "Some of the most used platform to perform these tasks would be stream processors such as Spark Streaming, Kafka Streaming and others. The outcome of this stage could be an API call, an action, an alert etc.", "After the data is prepared by our data stream processors we have to store it analyse it in order to provide valuable insights. Such a vast amount of data can be either stored in cheap data-lakes like Amazon S3 at the expense of latency and SQL operations. Or in data warehouses like Cassandra and Amazon Redshift which are harder to manage compared to data-lakes but also more structured. Alternatively, they can also be stored on the memory of the message-broker itself (for example Kafka) but this is 10x more expensive than the data-lakes counterpart.", "To understand better how stream-processing came to be let\u2019s have a brief look at how the data processing looked like before Apache Kafka. All data was previously stored in a database or a distributed file system which would be periodically (1 hour, 1 day etc) be analysed and operated on.", "Even though this model has worked for a long time and it still has many applications, it has also a fundamental flaw. It simply cannot analyse data on the fly in a world where data value quickly decreases over time.", "Stream processing is all about ingesting and analysing a flow of events and, as we saw earlier, the backbone responsible for the fetching is made up of our message-broker software which are able to take in all these data signals and made them (almost) immediately available. However, creating a super-efficient system many-to-many producer to consumer was no easy task and it was exactly what Linkedin had to face in 2008 when they started working on Kafka. One of the main issues was how the producer should pass the information directly to each consumer in private sessions and how could consumers read this data while it was being written by producers.", "Linkedin\u2019s project (which will become later on Apache Kafka) solved for this issue and provided a distributed platform that was able to process stream records as they occurred.", "It basically became the backbone of modern stream processing and it was so successful that other companies created their counterpart such as Amazon Kinesis and Azure Event Hubs.", "The heart of its popularity came from the introduction of a system that it\u2019s log-oriented as opposed to the batch structures previously adopted. The log is time-ordered and append-only series of events from which consumers can extract information at any time. Example of data events in the logs coming from a shopping cart could be add item, delete item, checkout etc. In Kafka, messages are written on topics which maintains its log and from which consumers can extract the data.", "Even though message-broker software such as Rabbit MQ and ActiveMQ have been around for years even before Kafka, the log-append structure has allowed for the processing of an insane amount of transactions. In Kafka, each consumer is responsible to keep track of their activity whereas in software like RabbitMQ, they had to behave like a queue and the message-broker itself keeps track of the consumer activity.", "It has to be said that Kafka did not make previous systems obsolete and they are still applicable to other architectures where they are simply a better fit. Kafka provides a much higher throughput which currently enables a company like Netflix to process a mind-boggling amount of data in the order of 8 million events per second at peak times.", "Your home for data science.
