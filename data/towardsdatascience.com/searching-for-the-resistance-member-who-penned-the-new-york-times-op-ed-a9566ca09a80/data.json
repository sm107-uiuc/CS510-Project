The column, whose author was described only as an unnamed \u201cSenior Official in the Trump Administration,\u201d was written under the guise of anonymity likely to avoid the author instantly being fired, but also so the readers could focus on the story\u2019s important message rather than on the messenger. Within minutes, the piece went viral, and, being 2018 as it is, Twitter and political pundits around the country instantly went searching for the author. A slew of theories quickly filled the interwebs, and within hours multiple bookies had betting odds posted. While the internet detectives zoned in on some odd phrases that hinted at the identity of the author (for anyone claiming they knew what \u2018lodestar\u2019 meant prior to reading the article \u2014 Google Trends keeps receipts), I, having been fully immersed in data science over the past 3 months, instantly thought about whether it was possible to use Natural Language Processing to uncover the author\u2019s identity. Here is my initial attempt at cracking the case.", "First, I needed to make some assumptions about the column. While a NYT tweet originally referred to the author as \u2018he\u2019 (a Times spokesperson later clarified that as a mistake), I disregarded the notion of the author\u2019s gender being revealed so innocuously. Instead, I assumed that they were referred to as male because the lack of high-ranking females in the administration would make it easy for the public to uncover their identity if the author was revealed as a woman. I also had to make the assumption that the opinion piece was written in the author\u2019s own voice, as opposed to being crafted by a speechwriter or so heavily edited that it would be impossible to match it to the author\u2019s unique style. A prior report from Axios\u2019 Johnathan Swan had a White House official detailing how they \u201cpay attention to other staffers\u2019 idioms and use that in [their] background quotes\u201d in order to cover their tracks.", "My final assumption was that a public denial by an administration official does not rule out that person from having written the article \u2014 knowing the dire consequences of being outed, it is of their best interest to lie about their participation. Without these assumptions, it would be impossible to accurately predict the author, and I must stress that this exercise as it currently stands is a highly inexact study.", "Once my assumptions were settled, I had to get a list of potential authors. Unfortunately, for both myself and for the country, there was a shockingly long list of potential candidates spanning the full breadth of the Executive Branch.", "In the interest of time, I narrowed my list to three people, each of whom was a plausible candidate that also had publicly available speeches and op-eds published online. The three individuals I chose to look at initially were Vice President Mike Pence, Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, and Kevin Hassett, the current Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Pence was included because of the odd usage of the word \u2018lodestar,\u2019 which within minutes of the article\u2019s release was discovered by Twitter user @danbl00m to be one of the Vice President\u2019s (and apparently nobody else\u2019s) commonly used words. The article provided an in-depth glance at both foreign policy mishaps and boasts of economic and deregulatory successes, so I felt it necessary to include officials from each discipline. I chose Haley and Hassett because in my view they are both high ranking officials that for the most part have steered clear of the reality TV spotlight currently encapsulating the White House.", "Once I had the list of three candidates I wanted to look at, I scrounged the internet for opinion pieces or other articles and speeches attributed to those individuals. The first method I used was Cosine Similarity, which uses the cosine angle between the two vectorized corpora to measure similarity, with an output closer to 1 deemed more similar. Using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to convert each corpus into vectors, I was able to calculate the similarity between the potential authors and the anonymous resistance member.", "The good news was that each of the author\u2019s had a cosine similarity close to 1, signifying a good match. The bad news was that all three numbers were grouped so closely together that it was impossible to determine which, if any, were most similar to the author. I reasoned that the lack of variation between the three cosine similarities was due to a small target set, which in this case was the mere 881 words penned in the op-ed column.", "The next method I tried was to reduce the dimensionality of each candidate\u2019s TF-IDF vector matrix to three dimensions using t-SNE and then plot each candidate to see if any were significantly closer to the op-ed writer than the others. To my dismay, the 4 points were about as evenly spread out as I could imagine, leaving zero insight as to who the author might be.", "My final attempt used an authorship attribution code developed by Neil Yager, which analyzes four different features to predict which author was most likely to have written a text. The four features were: Lexical features, such as the average number of words per sentence and the size of the author\u2019s vocabulary; Punctuation features, which includes the average number of commas, semicolons, and colons per sentence; Bag of Words features, a representation of how frequently certain words appear in a document; and Syntactic features, which classifies each word to a certain part of speech (noun, verb, etc.). In most NLP instances, it is common to remove words such as \u2018the\u2019 and \u2018are\u2019 that frequently appear across all documents; however, author attribution operates differently than normal text classification, and there is the belief that authors use these common words in a distinct, yet consistent, manner.", "After creating the feature vectors, I proceeded to find three clusters in the feature space, with the hope that at least some, if not all of the op-ed features would share a cluster with those of a candidate. I decided to test it out with three clusters, under the assumption that each of the three known authors would have their features be part of unique clusters, and the op-ed features will fall into one of those.", "Each row in the array represents a different feature, while the columns represent the four different authors (the final column is the op-ed). The numbers represent which cluster each feature is part of. Again, the results are inconclusive, although they provide a bit more information than the previous two approaches. The op-ed\u2019s punctuation and bag of words features share a cluster with Nikki Haley\u2019s same features, while neither of its other features are part of the same cluster as the matching feature from the other two authors. It\u2019s a step in the right direction, yet still does not provide a clear answer.", "In the next few days, I hope to gather speeches and articles from additional members of the administration and see if there is an official that sticks out. This initial attempt gave me a solid sense of the techniques I will need to use to make an accurate prediction. I look forward to improving on this model and coming up with a confident guess about the author\u2019s true identity.", "Update: WikiLeaks *narrows* the search down to an older conservative male.", "Your home for data science.
