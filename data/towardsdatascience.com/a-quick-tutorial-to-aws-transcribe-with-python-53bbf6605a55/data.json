For this post, I want to share my little experience working with these APIs with those who want to try out these wonderful technologies. Hope you guys find it helpful :)", "Oh! And here is the quick content I will cover:- Setting Up: General packages and initializes essential functions- Single Speaker Files- Multiple Speakers Files- Accessing and Uploading files through Colab and Google Drive to S3 Storage- Creating a vocabulary to enhance transcription accuracy", "Link to the code: Google Colab (here), Gist (here), or Github(here).", "Speech-to-text is a promising technology, not by itself as a product, but more on its underlying applications to many other products. As our reading speed is much faster than listening speed, reading the transcription saves more time than listening to audio with similar content. Google\u2019s new flagship phone: Pixel 4, introduces the Recording app that performs real-time transcription! Promising products could be transcribing meetings (Zoom already offers this feature), lectures (text transcripts), and many more.", "Over the year, Speech-to-text has been a quite mature field. As this challenge is more horizontal than vertical, companies with massive amounts of data from various input sources win. Without surprise, big corporations like Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft are leaders in providing transcription services on their cloud.", "Each product has its pros and cons and might suit your purpose differently. I strongly recommend trying out all these services and select the one best perform on your desired use case. For this post, I focus on Amazon Transcription Service because of its rich output: a JSON file with all the timestamps and other information, which is super useful!", "(Small hype for my (hopefully) next post: Google Cloud (when performing single speaker transcription): the output does not have any punctuations. I am hoping to write an RNN model to add punctuation to enrich the output. But this is in the future. Let\u2019s go back to AWS for now!)", "I will go through the steps using Google Colab. The link to the full code is here. Let\u2019s do this!", "Boto is the AWS software development kit for Python. More info on Boto 3 documentation can be found here.", "And we also need the access key to our account on AWS. If you haven\u2019t created an account yet, please do so (it\u2019s free to create and have Free Tier is you don\u2019t use too much)! When you have your account, here\u2019s how to get your personal access key (if you already have your access key, then feel free to use it):", "Also, we need to create/connect our Amazon S3 Storage.AWS Transcribe will transcribe files from your S3 Storage. This is very handy because you can store files into Amazon S3 and directly process them from the cloud. Read how to create your S3 Bucket here.", "Try to upload a random audio/video file to S3 Storage, and let\u2019s try the transcription service! These are the values we", "For easy cases, I created a function call check_job_name to handle duplicate job names.", "Because the transcription might take time, we created a while loop to wait until it is done (rerun every 15 seconds).The last \u201cif\u201d statement is extracting the specific transcript from the JSON file. I will discuss how to extract timestamp at the end of the post.", "For AWS Transcribe for multiple speakers, the maximum speakers it can detect is 10. I will take 2 arguments as input this time: audio_file_name and the max_speakers. I strongly recommend having the max_speakers value already to enhance the accuracy for AWS, possibly. However, you can also leave it blank.", "This time, the output is not the transcript anymore but will be a file result (in Python, it\u2019s a dictionary data type).", "This code will give you the raw transcription (without speakers label): the result will be similar to inputting these files to the single speaker model.", "Now, we will read the JSON file in the \u201cTranscriptFileUri.\u201d As we are using Google Colab, I will also demonstrate how to access files inside specific folders.Assuming we already have it in a Folder: Colab Notebooks/AWS Transcribe reader: here\u2019s how to access it.", "Now, we need to process the JSON output from AWS Transcribe. The code below will provide a .txt file with [timestamp, speaker label, content].When inputting the \u201cfilename.json\u201d file, expect the \u201cfilename.txt\u201d file for the full transcript.", "Then, in the same folder, the file \u201cfilename.txt\u201d will appear, which contains all the transcripts.", "Bonus 1: Accessing and uploading files directly to S3 storage", "Uploading files to AWS S3 Storage will definitely automate a lot of processes.", "Bonus 2: Why don\u2019t we create a vocabulary to enhance accuracy?", "We can manually upload the vocabulary into the AWS Transcribe service through the console management. The accepted files are .csv or .txt.However, if we want to automate this process with Python, it will be a bit trickier. Here is one way I found: AWS accepts a specific type of input through Python, which is a DataFrame with 4 columns: [\u2018Phrases\u2019, \u2018IPA,\u2019 \u2018SoundsLike,\u2019 \u2018DisplayAs\u2019] convert into .txt file. For more information on the columns' meaning and custom vocabulary, read here.", "The uploading and adding the vocabulary took quite a bit of time. This might not be the optimal approach, but it works (among trying a list of string, lists of lists, but none work so far).If you found a way to automate this even further, please comment! I would love to discuss and learn more.", "Here is a quick tutorial on AWS Transcribe. I hope you found it useful! Also, I would love to hear your thoughts and discuss them even further.
