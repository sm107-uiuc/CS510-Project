Elaborated with examples | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Markov and Hidden Markov Model", "description": "Hidden Markov Model and most common three questions are discussed with examples."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["A stochastic process is a collection of random variables that are indexed by some mathematical sets. That is, each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set that is used to index the random variables is called the index set and the set of random variables forms the state space. A stochastic process can be classified in many ways based on state space, index set, etc.", "When the stochastic process is interpreted as time, if the process has a finite number of elements such as integers, numbers, and natural numbers then it is Discrete Time.", "It is a discrete-time process indexed at time 1,2,3,\u2026that takes values called states which are observed.", "For an example if the states (S) ={hot , cold }", "State series over time => z\u2208 S_T", "Markov and Hidden Markov models are engineered to handle data which can be represented as \u2018sequence\u2019 of observations over time. Hidden Markov models are probabilistic frameworks where the observed data are modeled as a series of outputs generated by one of several (hidden) internal states.", "Markov models are developed based on mainly two assumptions.", "That means state at time t represents enough summary of the past reasonably to predict the future. This assumption is an Order-1 Markov process. An order-k Markov process assumes conditional independence of state z_t from the states that are k + 1-time steps before it.", "2. Stationary Process Assumption: Conditional (probability) distribution over the next state, given the current state, doesn't change over time.", "That means states keep on changing over time but the underlying process is stationary.", "\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc22,\ud835\udc23= probability of transitioning from state i to state j at any time t. Following is a State Transition Matrix of four states including the initial state.", "Consider the state transition matrix above(Fig.2.) and lets find out the probability of sequence \u2014 > {z1 = s_hot , z2 = s_cold , z3 = s_rain , z4 = s_rain , z5 = s_cold}", "When we can not observe the state themselves but only the result of some probability function(observation) of the states we utilize HMM. HMM is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states.", "HMM too is built upon several assumptions and the following is vital.", "Consider the example given below in Fig.3. which elaborates how a person feels on different climates.", "Set of hidden states (Q) = {Sunny , Rainy}", "State series over time = z\u2208 S_T", "In the above example, feelings (Happy or Grumpy) can be only observed. A person can observe that a person has an 80% chance to be Happy given that the climate at the particular point of observation( or rather day in this case) is Sunny. Similarly the 60% chance of a person being Grumpy given that the climate is Rainy. Here mentioned 80% and 60% are Emission probabilities since they deal with observations.", "When we consider the climates (hidden states) that influence the observations there are correlations between consecutive days being Sunny or alternate days being Rainy. There is 80% for the Sunny climate to be in successive days whereas 60% chance for consecutive days being Rainy. The probabilities that explain the transition to/from hidden states are Transition probabilities.", "We have to add up the likelihood of the data x given every possible series of hidden states. This will lead to a complexity of O(|S|)^T. Hence two alternate procedures were introduced to find the probability of an observed sequence.", "Calculate the total probability of all the observations (from t_1 ) up to time t.", "Similarly calculate total probability of all the observations from final time (T) to t.", "v = {v1=1 ice cream ,v2=2 ice cream,v3=3 ice cream} where V is the Number of ice creams consumed on a day.", "We first need to calculate the prior probabilities (that is, the probability of being hot or cold previous to any actual observation). This can be obtained from S_0 or \u03c0. From Fig.4. S_0 is provided as 0.6 and 0.4 which are the prior probabilities. Then based on Markov and HMM assumptions we follow the steps in figures Fig.6, Fig.7. and Fig.8. below to calculate the probability of a given sequence.", "3. for observed output x3 and x4", "Similarly for x3=v1 and x4=v2, we have to simply multiply the paths that lead to v1 and v2.", "For a given observed sequence of outputs \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udf16 \ud835\udc49_\ud835\udc47, we intend to find the most likely series of states \ud835\udc67 \ud835\udf16 \ud835\udc46_\ud835\udc47. We can understand this with an example found below.", "The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm similar to the forward procedure which is often used to find maximum likelihood. Instead of tracking the total probability of generating the observations, it tracks the maximum probability and the corresponding state sequence.", "Consider the sequence of emotions : H,H,G,G,G,H for 6 consecutive days. Using the Viterbi algorithm we will find out the more likelihood of the series.", "There will be several paths that will lead to sunny for Saturday and many paths that lead to Rainy Saturday. Here we intend to identify the best path up-to Sunny or Rainy Saturday and multiply with the transition emission probability of Happy (since Saturday makes the person feels Happy).", "Let's consider A sunny Saturday. The previous day(Friday) can be sunny or rainy. Then we need to know the best path up-to Friday and then multiply with emission probabilities that lead to grumpy feeling. Iteratively we need to figure out the best path at each day ending up in more likelihood of the series of days.", "The algorithm leaves you with maximum likelihood values and we now can produce the sequence with a maximum likelihood for a given output sequence.", "3. Learn the values for the HMMs parameters A and B", "Learning in HMMs involves estimating the state transition probabilities A and the output emission probabilities B that make an observed sequence most likely. Expectation-Maximization algorithms are used for this purpose. An algorithm is known as Baum-Welch algorithm, that falls under this category and uses the forward algorithm, is widely used.", "The blog comprehensively describes Markov and HMM. The blog is mainly intended to provide an explanation with an example to find the probability of a given sequence and maximum likelihood for HMM which is often questionable in examinations too.
