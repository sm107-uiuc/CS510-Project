visualization", "As part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, we get to have a go at our very own Data Science Capstone, where we get a taste of what is like to solve problems and answer questions like a data scientist. For my assignment, I decided to do yet another project that looks into the relationship between Airbnb prices and its determinants. Yes, there are several very cool ones like Laura Lewis\u2019s here. I would not have been able to do mine without reading and understanding hers (and her code), so kudos! However, being that I\u2019m all about transportation research, I added a little touch of geospatial analysis by looking into locational features as possible predictors. This post explains a bit of the project background, data collection, cleaning and pre-processing, modeling, and a quick wrap up.", "For the complete notebook with all the code, you can check out the repo on my Github.", "If for some reason you don\u2019t already know, Airbnb is a internet marketplace for short-term home and apartment rentals. It allows you to, for example, rent (list) out your home for a week while you\u2019re away, or rent out your empty bedroom. One challenge that Airbnb hosts face is determining the optimal nightly rent price. In many areas, renters (hosts) are presented with a good selection of listings and can filter by criteria like price, number of bedrooms, room type, and more. Since Airbnb is a market, the amount a host can charge is ultimately tied to market prices. The search experience on Airbnb looks like this:", "Although Airbnb provides hosts with general guidance, there are no easy to access methods to determine the best price to rent out a space. There is third-party software available, but for a hefty price (for an example on available software, click here).", "One method could be to find a few listings that are similar to the place that will be up for rent, average the listed prices and set our price to this calculated average price. But the market is dynamic, so we would want to update the price frequently and this method can become tedious.", "Another issue? We\u2019re probably going to miss the competitive advantages that our listing has over the surrounding listings, like how near it is to a grocery store, a pub and other extra services, or maybe even how awesome my photos are compared.", "So, this project uses several listing features to try and predict price, with the added bonus of a predictor based on space: the property\u2019s proximity to certain venues. This allows the model to put an implicit price on things such as living close to a bar, pub or a supermarket.", "Airbnb doesn\u2019t release any data to the public but a separate group named Inside Airbnb scrapes and compiles publicly available information about many cities listings from the Airbnb website. For this project, I used their data set scraped on July 21, 2019, on the city of Edinburgh, Scotland. It contains information on all Edinburgh Airbnb listings that were live on the site on that date (over 14,000).", "The data has certain limitations. The most noticeable one is that it scrapes the advertised price rather than the actual price paid by previous customers. More accurate data is available for a fee in sites like AirDNA.", "Each row in the data set is a listing available for rental in Airbnb\u2019s site for the specific city (observations). The columns describe different characteristics of each listing (features).", "Some of the more important features this project will look into are the following:", "To model the spatial relationship between Airbnb rental prices and property proximity to certain venues, I used the Foursquare API to access the city\u2019s venues and the street network is available through OpenStreepMap (OSM).", "In short, the original dataset contained 14,014 Airbnb listings and 106 features but I dropped a bunch. For example, some of those are free text variables, like the host description of the property and all the written reviews. To include that data, I would\u2019ve had to do some Natural Language processing, but unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t. So those features were dropped. Also, several columns only contained one category, so they were dropped too. Most listings don\u2019t offer the experiences feature, so that was also gonner.", "A complete step by step of this section, how and why I cleaned the data the way I did is on the notebook on my github or on this report without all the code.", "An interesting exploratory data analysis is there too. One of the \u2018no sh*t Sherlock\u2019 findings is that there\u2019s clear seasonality when it comes to listings entering the market.", "Every year, there is a peak towards hosts joining around the middle of the year (summer), and the lowest points are the beginning and the end of each year. In August, during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, room rental price rises considerably. It is an extremely popular event and much of the rented property available will have been taken up due to the number of people who attend each year. Edinburgh has lots of other events throughout the year, mainly focused between April and December. There are word-class artists performing throughout these months.", "For the rest of the year, Edinburgh is uniquely placed as the cultural capital of, not just Scotland, but the UK. There\u2019s stable demand for accommodation and as well as tourism, because Edinburgh serves as a business capital after London.", "In terms of changes in prices over time, the average price per night for Airbnb listings in Edinburgh has increased slightly over the last 10 years. But the top end of property prices has increased a lot, resulting in a larger increase in the mean price compared to the median. The mean price in 2010 was \u00a3107.33 and the median \u00a3115.0, whereas the mean price in 2018 (the last complete year of data) was \u00a3104.55 and the median \u00a379.0. Basically, expensive accommodation owners rapidly discovered the benefits of using Airbnb (mainly less tax and less responsibilities, but that\u2019s a story for another day).", "Now for the cool stuff (for me). When looking for accommodation, being near to certain touristic areas is important. But also, knowing that you will have a grocery store or a supermarket at a walkable distance can be a plus. A lot of renters like the fact that you can cook your own meals (and save some \u00a3\u00a3) when you get an Airbnb vs a hotel room.", "So, proximity to certain venues, such as restaurants, cafes and shops could help us predict price.", "Much of Airbnb listings are centred around Edinburgh\u2019s Old Town area, which is consistent with the huge draw for tourists, especially during the annual Fringe festival.", "The distribution of prices also reflects that the most expensive listings are on the Old Town area.", "To get information on specific venues, I used latitude and longitude of Edinburgh\u2019s neighbourhoods to download a list of venues per neighbourhood via Foursquare\u2019s API.", "The latitude and longitude came from a publicly available list of neighbourhoods in the form of a geojson file. I could have retrieved the latitude and longitude from the original Airbnb listings dataset, but I was already working with this file, so I decided to just use that. Afterwards, I merged them by neighbourhood.", "First, I had to load the geodata:", "map_df is a GeoDataFrame. To retrieve the venues per neighbourhood, I extracted the latitude and longitude or x and y from the point object in the GeoSeries. The following code returns x and y as separate GeoDataFrame columns within the original map_df.", "Then we create the API request url, make the GET request and extract the information for each venue that is nearby our neighbourhoods. This very useful function below was provided to us during the Data Science course. It loops through all neighbourhoods to retrieve the data we want:", "Now we run the above function on each neighborhood and create a new dataframe called edinburgh_venues.", "Once we have this, we can look at the different venues around each neighbourhood. To begin with, there were 182 unique venue categories. There were pretty messy though. So I cleaned the retrieved data, grouped the rows by neighbourhood and took the mean and the frequency of occurrence of each category.", "This helped me find the 5 most common venues per neighbourhood:", "And save it to a pandas dataframe to have a look and decide which venues are of interest:", "Looking closely to the data, it was clear that the most common venues were Hotel, Pub, Grocery Store/Supermarket, and Cafe/Coffee Shop, with Bar, Bus Stop and Indian Restaurant coming behind. Restaurants were divided into subcategories. So I aggregated them into one big Restaurant category. I thought it unlikely that having a hotel nearby affects price, because Airbnb listings are supposed to be on a different category of short-term rental. They offer quite different benefits compared to hotels. So I didn\u2019t consider that category of venues.", "Armed with this data, I began the process of measuring that proximity to venues thing we have been talking about. We do this by analysing accessibility.", "Accessibility is the ease of reaching destinations. Is a very important concept in transportation with a wide body of literature available. Accessibility shapes people\u2019s ability to access opportunities and reach their full potential as human beings. That is why accessibility measures are used a lot as proxies for spatial and transport inequality.", "To keep it simple, for this project, I measured accessibility by measuring access to venues or Points of Interest (POIs) downloaded from Foursquare. Pubs, Restaurants, Cafes and Supermarkets/Grocery Stores are our POIs (dataset of 441 POIs).", "To help with the accessibility analysis, Pandana is the Python library of choice. Pandana is a handy graph library that allows for Pandas dataframes to be passed through into a network graph that maps graph-level analyses to underlying C operations. All of this is to say, it\u2019s much faster than traditional Python-based graphs.", "To start the analysis, we have to get the street network data from the OSM API using the location data of Edinburgh (the bounding box).", "A Network with 51,553 nodes is then downloaded from OSM after running the code. When we save it to HDF5, you\u2019ll note that certain nodes are excluded. This can be useful when refining a network so that it includes only validated nodes. I used the low_connectivity_nodes() method to identify those nodes that may not be connected to the larger network and exclude them.", "Finally, we calculate accessibility to the POIs:", "The resulting data frame looks like this:", "And what a better way to understand what all these numbers are about than with some nice visualisations (what is geospatial analysis without them really?). First, let\u2019s look at the distance to the nearest POI of any type, since I\u2019m not interested in accessibility differences between venues:", "We can see that there are some zones where people have to walk more than 500 meters to reach the nearest amenity, whereas Edinburgh\u2019s Old Town has walking distances of less than 100 meters on average.", "The map shows the walking distance in meters from each network node to the nearest restaurant, bar, cafe, pub and Grocery shop. But, a better indicator of accessibility might be having access to a large number of amenities. So instead of the nearest, I plotted accessibility to the fifth-nearest amenity:", "This time is even more noticeable that Old Town and the city center area of Edinburgh have better accessibility.", "For this project, I\u2019m hypothesizing that access to restaurants, shops, cafes, bars and pubs are important for Airbnb users. So I\u2019m weighting all POIs equally and using distance to the fifth nearest venues as a compound measure of accessibility. This gives a clearer picture of which neighbourhoods are most walkable, compared with plotting just the distance to the single nearest venue.", "Here\u2019s the code to set the distance to the fifth nearest amenity as a compound measure of accessibility:", "So there it is. A location feature has been created and then added to the dataset for modelling.", "A lot of data preparation happened here, which of course is on the repo. I won\u2019t go into any details but in summary, I cleaned the data, checked for multicollinearity and dealt with problematic features, log-transformed the data which helped make price more normally distributed, hot-encoded categorical features and standardised it with StandardScaler(). Lastly, I split the data into train-test.", "The evaluation metrics used were mean squared error (for loss) and r-squared (for accuracy).", "I chose to run a Hedonic Model Regression because they are commonly used in real estate appraisal and real estate economics. Ideally, Lagrange multiplier tests should be conducted to verify if there is spatial lag in the dependent variable and therefore a spatial lag model is preferred for estimating a Spatial HPM (see this post for spatial regression using Pysal). However, for the purposes of this project, I\u2019m only using a conventional OLS model for hedonic price estimation that includes spatial and locational features, but not a spatial lag that accounts for spatial dependence.", "So, the first explanatory variables are the listings characteristics (accommodates, bathrooms, etc) and the second group of explanatory variables based on spatial and locational features are Score, which is the network distance to 5th nearest venue we computed with Pandana; and Neighbourhood belonging, 1 if the listing belongs to the specified neighbourhood, 0 otherwise.", "Here\u2019s my code for the Spatial Hedonic Price Model:", "So the features explain approximately 51% of the variance in the target variable. Interpreting the mean_squared_errorvalue is somewhat more intuitive that the r-squared value. As the square root of a variance, RMSE can be interpreted as the standard deviation of the unexplained variance, and has the useful property of being in the same units as the response variable. In this case though, the response variable is log-transformed, so the interpretation is not in the original unit, but more like a percentage deviation. Lower values of RMSE indicate better fit. RMSE is a good measure of how accurately the model predicts the response. We can see this relationship graphically with a scatter plot:", "I also tried using Ridge Regularization to decrease the influence of less important features. Ridge Regularization is a process which shrinks the regression coefficients of less important features. It takes a parameter alpha, which controls the strength of the regularization.", "I experimented by looping through a few different values of alpha, and see how this changes results.", "Yeah\u2026 not much happened. The RMSE and r\u00b2 values are almost identical as the alpha value increases, which means the model prediction doesn\u2019t improve substantially with the ridge regression model.", "Moving on to the Gradient boosted decision trees model.", "XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance. Is a very popular algorithm that has recently been dominating applied machine learning for structured data.", "It was expected that this model was going to provide the best achievable accuracy and a measure of feature importance compared to the Hedonic regression. And it did.", "Here\u2019s the code for the XGBoost model:", "With this model, the features explain approximately 65% of the variance in the target variable and has a smaller RMSE than the SHP regression model.", "Apart from its superior performance, a benefit of using ensembles of decision tree methods like gradient boosting is that they can automatically provide estimates of feature importance from a trained predictive model. For more detailed information on how feature importance is calculated in boosted decision trees, have a look at this answer in StackOverflow.", "As you can see, a good number of features have a feature importance of 0 in this XGBoost regression model.", "The top 10 most important features are:", "The most important feature to predict price is if the rental is the entire flat. Like by a lot. It makes sense. Asking price is higher if the offer is for the entire flat/house. The second is how many people the property accommodates, which also makes sense. It\u2019s the first thing you would look for when you search for a place.", "The funny thing though is that location features are not in the top ten. Belonging to a certain neighbourhood and Score (accessibility measure) are of relatively low importance compared to the top 3 features. However, Review_Scores_Location_9/10 almost made it to the top ten. Pretty interesting.", "Seems price is affected by previous renters positive rating of location instead of the actual accessibility of the property with respect to main points of interest.", "This could also be because Edinburgh is a small and walkable city with good transportation services. So maybe location is not a major problem in reaching main tourist attractions and amenities.", "The feature importances graph produced by the XGBoost model showed that a lot of the review columns are of relatively low importance. So, I dropped them. Then I ran the models again, just without those columns.", "And like with the Ridge Regression attempt, not much happened here either. Both Spatial Hedonic Regression and XGBoost perform almost exactly the same without the additional review columns.", "If we are to choose a model to predict price, it would be the XGBoost without the review columns. It performs better than both Spatial Hedonic Regression Models and just as good as the first XGBoost model but is less computationally expensive. Still, it only predicts about 66% of the variation in price. Which means we still have a remaining 34.44% unexplained.", "A bunch of different variables that are not included could explain the rest of the variance.", "For example, given the importance of customer reviews of the listing in determining price, a better understanding of the reviews could very likely improve the prediction. One could use Sentiment Analysis. A score between -1 (very negative sentiment) and 1 (very positive sentiment) can be assigned to each review per listing property. The scores are then averaged across all the reviews associated with that listing and the final scores can be included as a new feature in the model (see here for an example).", "We could also include image quality as a feature. Using Difference-in-Difference with deep learning and supervised learning analyses on an Airbnb panel dataset, researchers found that units with verified photos (taken by Airbnb\u2019s photographers) generate additional revenue per year on average (see here).", "I still think accessibility plays an important role, even though it wasn\u2019t so clear this time. I used the OSM pedestrian network for the accessibility analysis, but using a multi-modal graph network would have been the ideal thing to do. This way I would\u2019ve measured accessibility in terms of the whole transport network and not only in terms of walkability. Maybe the feature importance would have been higher on the list.", "And that\u2019s that. This was a very fun project to work with.", "If you somehow managed to go through the whole thing and are reading this, thank you for your time!
