France recently fined Google 50 million euros for misleading people on how it uses people\u2019s data. In the United States, the New York Times published a major series of articles highlighting the privacy issues. In Canada, the government recently updated its Elections Modernization Act to regulate foreign election interference using social media.", "And even Facebook is making a compelling case for much more expansive and stronger data privacy and protection regulation based up a recent article by Facebook\u2019s chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg.", "While the social media giants have been at the forefront of data privacy concerns, highly publicized data breaches by large corporations have also captured the headlines. Equifax has spent over $240 million in IT and security improvements as a result of a data breach that impacted about almost 148 million consumers. JP Morgan issued an SEC filing highlighting a data breach in 2014 that compromised data for 76 million customers. Yahoo exposed data from 3 billion user accounts in 2013 resulting in a market capitalization loss in the hundreds of millions while it was in negotiations to be purchased by Verizon. And there are many more examples.", "But the bottom line is this: lax data management capabilities have a tangible and material cost \u2014 to companies, but more importantly to people \u2014 causing a rapid change in the regulatory environment governing user data and privacy which are, in time, sure to propagate to many more jurisdictions. These changes will have a material impact to how enterprise manage their data. As a prime consumer of data, this is sure to impact how to AI/ML operates in the enterprise.", "There are several trends in AI/ML that are making data management a critical challenge.", "First, AI/ML in the enterprise has been pulled into the gravity well of cloud computing. Recognizing that models are trained on vast amounts of data, they require a computational footprint that is typically much different and larger than what is available in most enterprises.", "Unfortunately, establishing the necessary infrastructure within the enterprise has proven to be difficult, costly, time consuming and has become an impediment to AI/ML delivery. To address this, many enterprises are migrating model development and training to the cloud but the downside to this is that it also drives the migration of sensitive data outside of the safe confines of the enterprise data center.", "However, managing data in the cloud imposes a new set of challenges, some of which are industry specific, some privacy related, and some enterprise security policy imposed.", "Second, data scientists require access to increasingly vast quantities of un-obfuscated data (\u201cdata in the clear\u201d) creating new tensions in resolving access rights to sensitive data. At its most basic level, a data scientist should only be able to view and consume the minimal set of data required to perform their work.", "However much of their work is exploratory and they may not know what data they need. Hence, they will inevitably ask for more data than expected and, to complicate matters, they will ask for it to be \u201cin the clear\u201d \u2014 with no obfuscation or masking of data.", "Third, data duplication at a massive scale between enterprise transactional systems and analytics and AI/ML systems on the cloud is, at the best of times, a difficult proposition. Synchronization of data between systems is challenging but it is made harder as enterprise processes are extended into the cloud.", "In addition, AI/ML requires a new set of capabilities to address requirements for reproducibility and traceability, requiring the management and archiving of point-in-time training data, and, in regulated environments, also requiring the capturing of data lineage, data transformation, and enrichment scripts that were used to provide data to and train models.", "Lastly, the regulatory considerations imposed upon several industries that care for sensitive data \u2014 financial services and health care to name a few \u2014 require corporations to attest to their models\u2019 effectiveness.", "Consider financial services in the EU as a representative case: investment managers have to comply with specific requirements in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) the Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferrable Securities (UCITS) Directive, and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD).", "And more broadly, the recently published Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI regulations are clarion calls for all industries as it clearly highlights the emerging sentiment of governments to strictly govern bias and ethicality of model outputs. Clearly understanding and curating data that is consumed by models becomes a core competency recognizing that models are only as good as the data they were trained with.", "Strict regulatory environment for some are already in place but new and emerging regulatory considerations \u2014 especially related to model bias and ethics \u2014 will very soon place a new emphasis on data management and governance and all enterprises. Enterprises must prepare now for the new and stricter regulatory environment that will shortly be imposed upon them.", "The key question for enterprise is this: What capabilities does an enterprise need to invest in \u2014 today \u2014 to prepare for the data privacy tsunami about to wash over them? Here are a few things to consider:", "The road to AI/ML-centric data management is taken one step at a time. It requires an evolved data governance posture, new levels of automation, and new architectures. Whether regulations impose change, customer needs force change, or competitive pressures identify new opportunities, there is no doubt that an enterprise\u2019s data management capabilities will need to evolve to reap the benefits of AI/ML.", "Your home for data science.
