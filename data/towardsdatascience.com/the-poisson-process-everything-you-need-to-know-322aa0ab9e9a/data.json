So hop on board!", "The word \u2018variable\u2019 in random variable is a misnomer. A random variable, usually denoted by X, Y, Z, X1, X2, Z3, etc., is actually a function! And like all well behaved functions, X has a domain and a range.", "Domain( X ): The domain of X is the sample space of random outcomes. These outcomes arise when some stochastic experiment is performed (such as tossing a pair of coins). The outcomes may or may not be numeric. For example (Heads, Heads) or (Tails, Heads) are two possible outcomes of the coin toss experiment.", "Range( X ): The range of X is the set of real numbers.", "Why is X called a random variable?

A real world example of a discrete X is the number of cars passing through an intersection during some interval of time. The probability distribution of a discrete random variable is called the Probability Mass Function (PMF).", "A continuous random variable\u2019s range is the set of real numbers, i.e. an uncountably infinite set.

The probability distribution of a continuous random variable is called the Probability Density Function (PDF).", "Real world examples of a purely continuous random variable are not easy to find.", "Now let\u2019s go over what a random process is.", "A random process is a sequence of random variables X1, X2, X3,\u2026 etc. usually indexed by time.

The corresponding formula for the PMF for k occurrences in time t looks like this:", "The following set of probability distributions have all been generated using the above Poisson distribution formula by scaling the rate \u03bb by a different time interval t:", "The Poisson process has a remarkable substructure.
