This post is about Adjusted R Squared, Predicted R Squared, Residual Plots, P values for variables, Regression coefficients, F-Statistic.", "In the previous post, R Squared is explained as the amount of variation explained by the model or how much better a regression model is compared to the mean model. While this metric quantifies how well the model performs, there is a limitation that it always increases as the number of input parameters to the model are increased. Even by adding a bunch of totally unrelated features that happens to randomly reduce the error(Sum of Squared Errors by Regression Line), one can keep increasing the R-squared this way which is basically lying with statistics.", "To address this limitation, the Adjusted R-Squared metric can be used, where the adjustment is based on degrees of freedom.", "In R-Squared formula, if SSresiduals per unit degree of freedom and SStotal per unit degree of freedom is used instead of SSresiduals & SStotal, Adjusted R-Squared metric is computed. If extra features are added to a regression model with the same n, then n-K(K is the number of parameters to be estimated)will go down SSresidual goes up, overall decreasing Adjusted R-squared. For that extra variable to bring some value by not hurting Adjusted R-squared, it should reduce SSresidual in the numerator to some extent. The denominator is a Sum of Squared error for the mean model and hence it has only 1 parameter to estimate. n-K is n-1 here.", "When to use this? If you are comparing two models with a different number of parameters, Adjusted R-squared can be used to make an apples-to-apples comparison. Or, if you are iterating a model by adding more features, this metric can be used to see if the new features added are bringing in some value.", "If you already know what Degrees of freedom is? Please Skip.", "In really simple terms, it can be considered as the extra information one has about the data. If one has three unknowns and three equations, using linear algebra it can be calculated what these three unknowns are. But, if more than three equations are present for three unknowns, it might not be possible to find three unknowns that satisfy all the equations perfectly. So, the best imperfect solution is aimed for.", "If this was the case, the values for x, y, z can never take other values except what is obtained here. For these three values, there is no freedom to vary and hence degrees of freedom is 0.If we introduce another observation or equation with the same number of variables, we are introducing variation. Now, x,y,z have some freedom to vary, How much freedom to vary? n-K units. Three equations are needed to get x, y, z values but any data more than that is Degrees of Freedom.", "This is a great metric to see if your model is overfitting or in other words, how well your model fits for a new observation. If you heard about the Cross-Validation evaluation technique, you can see how this metric share similarity with that method.", "Initially, the Residual Error Sum of Squared(PRESS) need to be calculated as follows", "Once we get PRESS, use that instead of Sum of Squared Errors by Regression in R-squared formula to obtain", "For more information on R-squared, Check this", "Typically, a scatter plot with Predicted values on x-axis and error or residual on the y-axis is called the residual plot(X-axis in residual value can be any other independent variable as well). The scatter you observe should look random as below", "(Values on X-axis and Y-axis can be standardized instead of actual values)", "If the plot seems to have a defined shape, like a cone or a curve, we can say that the model error is increasing as the value of input increases. The model\u2019s main objective is to capture Signal out of Signal + Noise and show Noise in residual plots. Noise is supposed to be noisy. If it has a pattern, that means we are not modeling capturing the signal fully.", "I guess it is safe to assume that you have come across the following in a Regression output.", "Here each coefficient has a P-value associated with it. In hypothesis testing, P-value is basically used to reject/not reject a null hypothesis. But what is it doing here?", "This is something not very explicitly mentioned usually, but Hypothesis testing happens here too. Each coefficient in the regression equation has a certain effect, varying from none to maximum effect, on the output/prediction. So, null & alternative hypothesis can be formulated as below", "H0 : Null Hypothesis: Coefficient(x) has no effect on the output", "Ha: Alternate Hypothesis: Coefficient(x) has some effect on the output", "If the p-value is less than some threshold(0.05. 0.01. 0.1), it means that we can reject the null hypothesis and say that the coefficient/feature/predictor has some effect on the output. If the p-value is greater than a threshold, the features are not significant, statistically and hence not contributing to the prediction. (It might be another mini-post to actually get into how this p-value is calculated)", "When you see an regression equation like this", "Regression coefficients a0, a1, a2.. contribute to prediction y in various magnitudes. Each of these coefficients represents the change in prediction or predicted value when there is a unit change in one of the predictor variables (x0, x1, x2\u2026)when the rest of the predictor variables are kept unchanged.", "Here, If you have the above equation to estimate house prices, Two homes with same square footage & same number of bedrooms but a different number of bathrooms will have only different x3 value and the difference in house price will be 1251 * (x3(Home1) \u2014 x3(Home2)). If this 1251 * (Difference in a predictor variable is 1, then its a unit change and 1251 will represent a change in predicted value or home price.", "I have gone over commonly used metrics but there are many more that can be discussed. If there is anything that would make a good addition to this post, please comment.", "Also, Here is another blog post by neptune.ai that I recommend going through : https://neptune.ai/blog/performance-metrics-in-machine-learning-complete-guide", "Your home for data science.
