This can be a movie that you are forced to watch for class, a speech made by someone important, or even just an audio recording of your pet. In this article you will learn exactly how to do that.", "In this project I explored some more fascinating areas of machine learning and applied them to two different videos (Harry Potter, and The Boarded Window).The project is avaiable on my GitHub as usual.", "Starting with a movie/audio.mp3, I first converted the file to .wav extension to improve the quality of the file. There are many resources to do it online and I believe you can also do it in Python (I did it online just because it was faster).", "Next, I tried several speech-to-text engines to see which one will provide the best accuracy.The first one I tried was Pocketsphinx, which is completely free and fairly easy to use:", "However, the accuracy for several videos was quite terrible and so I went on and looked for another recognition engine. Consider trying Sphinx first (since it\u2019s a lot easier to use than other engines) with your project and see if the accuracy is in fact bad.", "Next, I wanted to try Google Cloud Speech-to-Text since there are lot of good reviews on it. Apparently you also get $300 to spend on Google Cloud Platform over the next 12 months if you sign up. However, Google asks for a credit card number in order to register. At this point I started looking for another program (I didn\u2019t want to give my credit card info). Note, Google Cloud suppose to be one of the best engines to convert speech to text. If you\u2019re willing to give up your info you should definitely consider using it.", "Lastly, I found IBM\u2019s Watson- a highly accurate speech engine which easily converts audio and voice into written text for quick understanding of content. IBM registration was surprisingly easy.Once you register up you can use Watson.", "Using Watson in Python is quite complex at first, but once you know what to do it\u2019s easy (like most things). I tried to make it simple to follow:", "Write your password from the IBM website in Python.Write the name of your audio file instead of \u201cnew_story\u201dChoose a file name for the json file (you can leave it as \u201cnew_story\u201d if you wish).", "In order to read the lines from the audio follow this code (don\u2019t forget to change the file\u2019s name):", "Once you have the file as a string you can begin with NLP", "I used a simple algorithm this time (there are many more complex ones that you can use if you need better accuracy. e.g word embedding)", "The original text (from the speech-to-text engine):", "After preprocessing, tokenizing, and finding the weighted frequency of occurrence for each word. You should get a score for every sentence:", "For the sake of time, I will leave my code (which is self explanatory from here) on my GitHub, and provide you with the results. I chose to summarize the story in 4 sentences:", "IBM gives you 100 free minutes when you register- and I was running out of mine. Hence, I chose a short scene from one of the movies of Harry Potter. If you listen to the original scence you\u2019d notice that it\u2019s quite hard to hear the audio sometimes- hence the misinterpretation of some words.", "Following the same steps as above we get the weighted frequency for the words (these are just some of them):", "Looks pretty good considering the fact that I was struggling to understand some of the words myself (you should really look at the scene).", "If you\u2019re interested in more of my work you can check out my Github, my scholar page, or my website", "My sights are set on using the intersection of artificial intelligence and
