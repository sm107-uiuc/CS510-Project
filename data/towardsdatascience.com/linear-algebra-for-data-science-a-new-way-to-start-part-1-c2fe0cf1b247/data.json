I believe, understanding fundamentals is the first thing anyone should do before going after advanced topics. Why? Because we don\u2019t want to get stuck in a loop going back and forth in advanced topics and fundamentals!", "In this series, I am going to cover topics covered by Prof. Gilbert Strang in his latest lecture series, \u201cA 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra\u201d. It is an excellent lecture series in which he takes a top-down approach in teaching applied linear algebra. My aim here is to share with you my understanding of the topics with relevant details which I believe will aid in understanding the lectures in a better and nuanced way.", "To understand column space and row space we first need to understand the \u201cSpan\u201d which is nothing but the set of all the possible linear combinations of a set of vectors. So, the column space and the row space of a matrix A is defined as the span of the columns and rows of the matrix A.", "The column space of A = C(A) = all vectors Ax. In other words, it is the space spanned by the linearly independent columns in matrix A. Here, as we can see that column 3 (c3) can be expressed as the sum of column 1 (c1) and column 2 (c2), we only have two linearly independent columns (c1 and c2). Here c1 and c2 are called the \u201cBasis\u201d of the columns space. Formally, the basis of a space is defined as a set of vectors that are linearly independent and spans the space.", "The same concept stands true for the row space. Just replace columns with rows in this case. Also, the dimension of column space is always the same as the dimensions of row space. It\u2019s just an alternate way to arrive at the same point. We will revisit both row space and column space in detail when looking into the four fundamental spaces of linear algebra.", "Rank is defined as the dimension of vector space spanned by its columns which is equal to the number of linearly independent columns (column rank) and in turn the number of linearly independent rows (row rank). Please note, the row rank is always equal to column rank, the mathematician proof is beyond scope of this article but intuitively as both column and row space span the same vector space their dimensions have to be the same. A common way to compute the Rank of a matrix is to reduce the matrix in row echelon form by Gaussian elimination and counting the number of pivots (first non zero elements in each row in its row echelon form).", "Here, the rank of the matrix equals to 2 as there are two pivot elements in its row echelon form.", "As we have been talking about different kinds of spaces, let\u2019s not forget about the origin. After all, no space can be defined without defining origin. We define Null Space as the space of all vectors which become null (land at origin) after getting multiplied to a matrix A, i.e. Ax = 0.", "Nullity is defined as the dimension of the Null Space. It brings us to a very special result Rank(A) + Nullity(A) = Dimension(A). This is the Rank-Nullity Theorem.", "Rank 1 matrices are essentially the building blocks of matrix algebra. As you must have guessed by now, the matrix has rank 1 if it has only one independent column and only one independent row. Weird? You must be wondering what information will that matrix contain? It contains much less information than it seems it contains. We will come back to them a bit later.", "Rank one matrix can be visualized as the outer product of two vectors. This is a very special result, as it can be seen as the matrix A has a large dimension but it spans only a 1D space! Also, any matrix transformation can be seen as a sum of n rank 1 matrices (a small homework for you!).", "Now after going through the basic concepts, let\u2019s dive into a unique decomposition technique that is highly used in many Data Science, Statistics, and Data Analysis problems, CR decomposition.", "In CR decomposition, like any other matrix decomposition, we express a matrix A as the product of two matrices C and R. The matrix C and R are described as:", "Let\u2019s see this by an example:", "In the upcoming parts of this series, I\u2019ll be covering topics including but not limited to:", "Hope this was helpful.
