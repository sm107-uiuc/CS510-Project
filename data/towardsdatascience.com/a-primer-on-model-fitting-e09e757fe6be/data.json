To do that, we develop models based on our existing data sets then use the models to predict what will occur in fairly similar situations. This is essentially a mathematical way of learning from what has already occurred and using that learning to make intelligent choices.", "The obvious here is that the predictions of the model are only as good as the model itself. In order for a model to return accurate predictions it must accurately match the data set available. If it doesn\u2019t match the available data set, then you can be sure that it won\u2019t return an accurate prediction of different circumstances.", "There are generally two terms used to describe how models can fail to match an existing data set. They are:", "Figure 1 provides a visual representation of these concepts. The series, represented as circles, called \u201cAvailable Data\u201d shows theoretical income tax receipts with a progressive tax structure. The assumed progressive tax structure is pretty simple. The first $10k is taxed at 10%, the second $10k at 20%, the third $10k at 30%, and so on. A bit of randomness is added, replicating the fact that different homes are able to take different amounts of deductions (In the US tax code). The second series, represented with the blue line, called \u201cUnderfit\u201d is a model assuming a flat tax structure. The third data series, called\u201d Overfit\u201d, is a 20th order model assuming an extremely complex progressive tax structure.", "The blue line, representing the underfit model, clearly fits the data very poorly. There are only 3 points where it\u2019s close to matching the data, either overpredicting or underpredicting all the others. It also doesn\u2019t capture the shape of the data, failing to capture the fact that tax rates increase as income increases, yielded a somewhat parabolic data set.", "The red line, representing the overfit model, matches the available data nearly perfectly. Every single data point is matched with a very high degree of accuracy. And it captured the shape of the data nicely as well\u2026until incomes exceed $40,000 per year. From $40,000 to $44,000 per year the model predicts essentially no change in tax due, then it suddenly increases dramatically from $44,000 to $45,000 per year. The model would obviously underpredict in this range. But the real issue arises in the $45,000 to $50,000 range. The model predicts an increase of $22,000 per year in taxes when income rises from $45,000 to $49,000 with no data whatsoever to indicate that this is accurate. Then, from $49,000 to $50,000 per year the anticipated taxes decrease by $20,000 to return to matching the data. The model is predicting trends in the data that do not exist, and cannot predict tax values in between the available data points.", "The key points to look for when trying to identify underfit and overfit models are the items mentioned in the description of Figure 1. To call them out explicitly, these different types of model problems can be identified in the following ways.", "Underfit models can be identified because they:", "Overfit models can be identified because they:", "A well fit model should match the available data closely (Perfectly would be wonderful, but highly unlikely), while also closely matching the general shape of the data. Figure 2 provides an example of this kind of model. It presents the same general plot as Figure 1, and the black circles still represent the tax receipts available in our made up data set. The green line represents a 3rd order model fit to the data.", "Note how the green line, representing the 3rd order regression, doesn\u2019t perfectly match the available data. This is unfortunate, but a realistic expectation especially since there is a bit of randomness included in the data set. However, it does match every single data point pretty closely. Additionally, the exponential growth in the curve also matches the shape of the available data. It\u2019s neither entirely too simple for the available data, like the underfit model in Figure 1 was, or entirely too complex for the available data, as the overfit model was. Instead each prediction from the model falls between the high and low points in the data set. Because it closely matches the shape of the data and doesn\u2019t add inaccurate trends, this model can be trusted to provide reasonable predictions when interpolating.", "Model fit, and the challenges of overfitting and underfitting, is a core concept in data science. There are a number of different sources where you can learn more. My current favorite source for additional discussion of these issues is Data Science from Scratch by Joel Grus. I\u2019ve also provided a much more detailed description of model development and validation in one of my previous Medium posts. For those dedicated to investing a lot of time to learn as much as possible, Coursera offers an excellent course on machine learning.", "Model development and validation is a core concept in data science. In order to do any data science of value we must have models that accurately represent the available data set, and that we trust to do a good job of predicting what happens in similar conditions.", "Two common problems that cause models to return poor predictions are underfitting and overfitting. Underfitting means that the model is not complex enough for the data set. This results in model that poorly matches the measured data, and doesn\u2019t mimic the general shape of the data set. Overfitting means that the model is too complex for the data set. It yields a model that matches the model extremely closely, but adds trends to the data set that aren\u2019t actually there. It will look very good because of how well it matches the data, but will yield wildly inaccurate results when interpolating.", "A well fit model probably won\u2019t match the available data perfectly. There\u2019s likely to be some error in every single prediction. However, it should closely predict all of them. Additionally, it should capture the shape of the data set indicating that interpolated predictions will also be close.", "Your home for data science.
