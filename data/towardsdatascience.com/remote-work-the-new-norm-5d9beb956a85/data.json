And probably will for many more months. I thought I would hate it. But it was \u2026different! Google announced its work from home policy for the rest of 2020. Facebook adopted a similar policy. Twitter told its employees they could indefinitely continue working remote. We live at times when the only way to keep the virus at bay is to embed social distancing into our lives. Majority of the workforce has started working remotely to some extent recently. Working from home could make workers happier and save employees and employers money. Is remote work the new norm?", "One might have pressing questions regarding working remote and what better way to answer these than uncovering what the data tells us. So I found publicly available data from Annual Developers Survey conducted by Stack Overflow for the year 2019 which consists of responses of roughly 88K developers. So essentially the context here would be relevant for people working in the Software/IT/Data Science industry. Here are some interesting facts I\u2019ve discovered in the data.", "To me this is the most important question, to understand how satisfied are people who work remote with their job.", "Indeed, majority of the full-time remote workers are very/slightly satisfied with their job! A clear increasing trend of very satisfied employees can be noted from not remote to full-time remote workers. Further I converted the responses to a 5-point Likert scale, to arrive at an average job satisfaction score. A strong positive correlation can be noted with the remote-working culture to the job satisfaction.", "So with the flexibility of working anywhere, developers seem to be more satisfied with their job! Do we really need to go to the office?", "With pay-cuts handed down to employees in most parts of the world due to the global pandemic, it is important to understand the earnings before arriving at any decisions. Let us compare the pay scales of the developers who work remote with the rest.", "The interesting finding is that employees who gets to choose between going to the office and working remote, earn the most on average. Remote workers earn significantly higher than their counterparts.", "Our findings tell us remote working jobs are actually better \u2014 but surely there should be some challenges associated with it. I definitely have had some in the few months that I\u2019ve worked remote, but as always let\u2019s not assume anything but see what our data tells us.", "The most common 3 challenges faced when working remote are the meetings, distracting work environment and non-work commitments. Non-work commitments include having to look after children and house-hold work. I certainly have preferred the in-person meetings and have felt distracted at home. However with the rising popularity of various video-conference meeting tools and its capabilities, it would be interesting to analyze the next years annual survey.", "By now, if you had made up your mind to find a remote working job, let\u2019s ask the data which type of organizations you should look for.", "As we analyze the data, we realize that remote-working culture is prevalent among smaller organizations. A remarkable percentage (read ~70%) of remote-workers work in organizations with lesser than 100 employees. So your best bet to work remote would be to join a small organization or start something on your own!", "The findings here are observational, and are my findings from the data, not the result of a formal study. So the real question remains:", "Remote work \u2014 the new norm?", "If you have come this far, thank you for reading. What I did above was to subtly apply CRISP-DM, a popular methodology for tackling data science problems. Let\u2019s reveal how this simple methodology was applied to this project. By the end of it, you can start applying it too!", "This blog intentionally omitted the complex and detailed analysis including the codes and left them for the GitHub repository, should you need further understanding. Did you find any other interesting insights from the data around remote work? Or did this already convince you to try remote-working jobs? I\u2019d love to hear all sorts of feedback!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Senior Data Scientist & Top 1000 Writer.
