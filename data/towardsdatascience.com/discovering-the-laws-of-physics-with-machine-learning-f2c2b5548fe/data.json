It can help scientists predict the result of certain phenomena and in some cases even reveal the underlying laws themselves.", "We will take a look at a fairly simple example: the force of gravity on a falling object. If you took an introductory physics or calculus class you will have seen the formula. But even if you have only taken high school algebra you can handle the math behind it.", "The formula for the location of a falling object is:", "X\u2080 = the initial location of the object, i.e. its initial height.", "V\u2080 = the initial velocity (or speed) of the object when it is at this initial position.", "t = time after the object was dropped.", "g = the force of gravity, which is an acceleration of approximately 9.8 meters/second\u00b2. This is actually a constant not a variable like all of the others (unless we are dropping an object on different planets, which are not). It is negative because the force of gravity is downward, from a positive location value toward zero.", "This equation is a second degree polynomial (due the the t\u00b2), the same which you may remember from algebra. Machine learning libraries like scikit-learn can handle this very easily using linear regression. This data will not actually be linear but scitkit-learn gives us the ability modify the data so that it can be trained as a LinearRegression model, while taking into account that it is actually a polynomial.", "In order to proceed we need some data. We could drop a number of different objects 10,000 times and record their locations at different times, but that is pretty time consuming. Instead, we will create our dataset from the above equation. Fortunately, due to the work of Isaac Newton and experiments repeated over hundreds of years, we can be certain that our data will mirror what happens in the real world.", "First, we will create a Python function to calculate the location of a falling object:", "This is simply the previous equation in Python form. Next, we use this function to create a dataset and save it in a CSV file:", "What we are doing here is creating 10,000 examples, using randomized values for all of our variables, then calculating the location at a certain (randomly selected) time. There are a couple of things to note about this.", "First, some of the location values will be negative. This should not bother you, it just means that the object has fallen below some height we have defined as zero. Imagine standing at the edge of a cliff, holding an object at eye level, and dropping it off the cliff. In this case, zero is the location of your feet, -100 is 100 meters below your feet, and 1.85 meters is the initial location where you dropped it from (i.e. your own height, if you are 6 feet tall).", "Second, note that we are including the mass of the object in the data. This is actually entirely irrelevant to calculating the fall time or location of the object. This fact may be counterintuitive to people who did not taken physics in high school or college. In fact, Aristotle believed this, as did many people for hundreds of years until Galileo famously dropped two spheres of different weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa and demonstrated that they hit the ground at the same time.", "Look at the original equation. Mass is nowhere to be found, because objects of different masses fall with the same acceleration, assuming we can ignore air resistance (which we often can).", "So why include mass in this data set? Because we want to try to trick the machine learning algorithm into using it! We will see whether our machine learning experiment can outsmart Aristotle.", "Now that we have our data in a CSV file, we import it:", "As usual with machine learning, we will need to split our data into a training set (for training the model) and a testing set (for evaluating the trained model). This function will do the trick.", "In order to train and evaluate our model, we will use the following function:", "Note that this is just LinearRegression, except that we use the PolynomialFeatures function to transform the data so that LinearRegression can correctly model a second degree polynomial, which we happen to know in this case is exactly what we are looking for. We will see a bit more about how the data is transformed below.", "After we train the model, we will get the feature names, which will tell us how the resulting coefficients are assigned.", "Now we train the model with this code:", "When I ran the above code, I got the following output (which will differ slightly on different attempts because of the randomized values):", "Note that the r\u00b2 value is 1.0 \u2014 I have never seen that before! Also, the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are tiny \u2014 the e-09 means to multiply the preceding number by .000000001. So the root mean squared error is actually .00000000285\u2026 At this scale that is minuscule, essentially zero.", "Also note the initial list of 15 items in the above results. This is the result of the PolynomialFeatures method. It transformed the initial set of four features (\u2018initial_position\u2019, \u2018initial_velocity\u2019, \u2018mass\u2019, \u2018time') and changed them into combinations of these features, such as \u2018initial_position ^ 2\u2019 and \u2018initial_position time\u2019, whose values are initial_position multiplied by time. This expanded set of features was then fed into plain old LinearRegression. This is a bit of a trick which allows us to perform polynomial regression not with a different algorithm but with transformed data.", "Now let\u2019s look at the exponents on our model, which are the exponents on the polynomial equation the model is using to make predictions:", "This gives us the following, which correspond to each of the fifteen features from above:", "The first value (0.00000000e+00, or 0) is the coefficient for the value 1. That would be hanging constant with no variable, a constant value always added to the equation, except that the coefficient is zero so there is no constant value added to our result. The second value from our array ( 1.00000000e+00, or 1) is the coefficient on \u201cinitial_position.\u201d And in fact, in our original equation, we have the initial velocity (X\u2080) with a coefficient of one.", "Most of our other coefficients are essentially zero, and tell us that these factors are irrelevant to predicting the location, but we do have a few that are not. The twelfth in our list is also a coefficient of 1, which corresponds to \u2018initial_velocity time,\u2019 or initial velocity multiplied by time. Again, we have this factor in our original equation, which appears as V\u2080*t.", "Finally, the very last value is -4.9, which is the coefficient corresponding to \u2018time ^ 2.\u2019 Note that this also appears in our original equation as -1/2 gt\u00b2. But we said earlier that g is approximately 9.8, and -1/2 * 9.8 = -4.9. So this also corresponds with our original equation.", "If you matched these coefficients with the variable combinations in the feature name list, and added them together, and ignored the cases where the coefficient is essentially zero, you would end up with an equation that is very close to the one we started with at the top of this post.", "There are two very interesting final points to be made here. First, the resulting model found the mass to be irrelevant to making the prediction, which is correct.", "Second, the machine learning algorithm was able to derive the gravitational acceleration constant g, or at least determine the value of the entire coefficient (-1/2 * 9.8) which includes g.", "In other words, some of the work of Isaac Newton and Galileo can be discovered in seconds with Python and scikit-learn. This is pretty exciting.", "Of course, analyzing and understanding these results still requires significant human intervention, but this at least gives us a glimpse of how insights into fundamental laws of the universe can be extracted from data.", "Your home for data science.
