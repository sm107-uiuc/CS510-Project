But with as many as 85% of big data projects failing, it is clear that many companies struggle to achieve the promised benefits of data and AI. In my experience as a data science consultant, this often leads firms to ask questions like:", "While these are important considerations, I would argue that they are all versions of the same fundamental question:", "How does data science create value for a firm?", "I recently investigated this question for my MBA dissertation at the University of Warwick and in this post, I\u2019ll give a summary of that research. Along the way, I\u2019ll describe some lessons and recommendations based on my work as a practicing data scientist and consultant. Additional notes and references can be found at the end.", "A fundamental goal of a firm is to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the market.\u00b9 To understand the potential contribution of data science to this objective, it\u2019s worth reviewing two key concepts from the strategic management literature: the resource-based view of the firm and dynamic capabilities.", "The resource-based theory (RBT) of strategic advantage is \u201cone of the most prominent and powerful theories for understanding organizations\u201d (Barney, Ketchen and Wright, 2011: 1299). In brief, the theory holds that firms are comprised of:", "While the RBT can be powerful for explaining why firms currently have a competitive advantage, it is less effective at explaining how these positions are created and maintained in a dynamic competitive environment. For this, we turn to dynamic capabilities, \u201cthe firm\u2019s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments\u201d, e.g. by sensing market opportunities and threats, seizing these opportunities, and transforming the firm\u2019s assets to maintain competitiveness (Teece, 2007).", "The literature on managing information systems in general, and data analytics in particular, highlights two notable dynamic capabilities. The first argues that the benefit of an IT system is dependent on its alignment with the firm\u2019s strategic goals, as well as its daily operations and culture (e.g. Venkatraman, 1993; Krishnamoorthi & Matthew, 2018). Traditionally this alignment might have been achieved through process standardization and waterfall-style project management; in contrast, data science activities are often exploratory, which implies that alignment is more likely to be achieved through Agile development methods.", "The second is that IT systems can improve the agility of an organization, i.e. its ability \u201cto identify and effectively respond to threats and opportunities with speed\u201d (Ghasemaghaei, Hassanein and Turel, 2017: 95). A survey of more than 3,500 business executives on the challenges of digital technology suggested that such flexibility is essential for firms to respond to a rapidly changing environment in the long term. As one respondent said, a firm can actively promote a specific capability in the near term but over a ten-year time frame, \u201cwe are being pulled by our customers, technology, and globalization\u201d (Buckley and Natasha, 2017: 5).", "In the analysis below, I use the ideas of market alignment and internal agility as elements of a firm\u2019s \u201ccore competency\u201d; that is, the strategic capabilities that are fundamental to the firm\u2019s performance and underpin multiple sources of value creation (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990). The extent to which data science could be such a core competency has recently been raised within the literature on \u201cBig Data Analytics Capabilities\u201d (e.g. Mikalef et al., 2018) and my hypothesis is that data science creates value for a firm by underpinning multiple organizational capabilities; this proposed relationship is shown in Figure 1.", "Most of the previous literature on this topic has used confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to test hypotheses, and I took the same approach here. To collect the required data, I designed a closed-format survey which asked respondents about:", "After piloting and revising the survey, it was distributed in May 2019 via data science groups on LinkedIn, social media, and professional and alumni networks. Figure 2 gives a summary of the main features of the 50 valid respondents.", "Please see the technical note for details on how the validity of the survey instruments was checked, and the study limitations.", "To create value from a data science capability, it is not enough to simply hire data scientists and get them to run your data through some machine learning algorithms. As shown in Figure 2, value is created primarily when that data science capability is a core competency of the firm; that is, it enables the organization to compete in multiple markets, it coordinates skills across the organization, and it is perceived as being integral to the creation of customer value.", "In practice this result might be most important for organizations at the start of their data science journey. At DAIN Studios, we have worked with clients who had previously conducted data science pilot studies but were disappointed that these projects had not had a transformative impact on their business. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with small projects \u2014 they are a great way to build capabilities and trust within the organization \u2014 but they need to contribute to a sustainable core competency. Our top tips include:", "How does the relationship above change for different firm types? Previous research has suggested that firm characteristics have a minor or even non-existent influence on the agility of a firm (see refs in Figure 1 caption); however the present results highlight two important features: the overall industry of a firm and its individual history (Figure 4 and Figure 5).", "Let\u2019s start with the industry. Relative to all other industries, firms in the ICT and Service\u00b2 industries were found to have the strongest core competencies in data science. The idea of environmental velocity helps to explain why this might be the case (McCarthy et al., 2010). The pace of change in a firm\u2019s competitive environment \u2014 for example, the underlying technologies that it uses, its product offerings, the demands of its customers, and so on \u2014 play a significant role in shaping the resources and capabilities that a firm must possess in order to stay competitive. Modern markets are sufficiently open and dynamic that firms need at least some level of dynamic capabilities to survive, but in high velocity environments, the duration of competitive advantage is uncertain, the time available for decision-making is limited, and dynamic capabilities are themselves unstable (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). For this reason, Schilke (2014) argues that dynamic capabilities contribute most to competitive advantage when the direction and magnitude of environmental changes are roughly predictable and the costs of developing such capabilities can be reclaimed with some certainty. This \u201cmoderate\u201d environment velocity appears to apply to data science and analytics, as the industry matures and the required resources and capabilities become more widely available and standardised (Ransbotham et al., 2016).", "For most companies, data science is only part of the firm\u2019s overall capabilities and hence the velocity of the parent industry is still important. The ICT sector, for example, is driven by rapid exogenous technological developments and so we would expect such firms to have the experience and ability to integrate data science capabilities, irrespective of whether data science represents another wave of major innovation or simply \u201cold wine in new bottles\u201d. Similarly service firms arguably have shorter innovation cycles, making it easier to experiment and adapt to new technologies. In contrast, firms in healthcare, manufacturing or other industries may be more used to slower environmental velocities driven by, for example, changes in regulation or limited competition.", "Firms should therefore pay close attention to the environmental velocity of their industries. If the pace of change is slow, then there may be more time available to develop a data science capability. However, if the pace of change is quicker, then firms need to be more proactive. This highlights a particular risk for companies that are used to slower rates of change but now face disruption from new entrants; indeed many healthcare firms have begun recognised the strategic threat posed by the introduction of data science and artificial intelligence into their value chains (1, 2).", "The regression results above also include attributes of a firm\u2019s history, namely whether it is an established firm (more than 25 years old or more than 1000 employees) and whether its data science capability is more or less than two years old. However, given the limited data in this study, the story remains unclear.", "Firms with a younger data science capability appear to have a stronger core competency. This may be because these firms are essentially late adopters of data science and have been able to learn from the experience of others. For example, recent reports (1, 2) suggest that German companies lag behind their international counterparts in adopting data science and digital technology more generally. As a company with joint German-Finnish heritage, DAIN Studios has helped customers overcome some of these barriers by arranging \u201cexperience tours\u201d that demonstrate what it means to have a core competency in data and AI.", "Larger, more established organizations also appear to have stronger core competencies, whereas one might expect that such firms would have difficulty adapting new data science technologies into existing processes. One possible interpretation is that these firms have simply renamed existing capabilities as \u201cdata science\u201d, for example, by rebranding \u201cbusiness intelligence\u201d functions or embedding data science with business units. Alternatively, the enduring success of established firms could be built upon agility competencies that allow almost any new capability to be adopted quickly once it is perceived as having strong alignment with the company\u2019s overall direction.", "More research needs to be done to better understand these effects. However, in practice, one would do well to be aware of the potential conflicts within a firm that might prevent a data science capability becoming a core competency. These can be described at three scales:", "There is no easy solution to these obstacles. But careful consideration of an organization\u2019s history and the identification of potential sources of conflict can help to smooth the adoption of data science.", "Finding 1 showed that a firm\u2019s data science capability affects its ability to produce value from data science, indirectly via a data science core competency. But what do we mean by a data science capability?", "Following the literature (e.g. Gupta and George, 2016), a data science capability can be divided into three components:", "The current questionnaire adopted this same model, but the confirmatory factor analysis found that not all of these components are of equal importance (Figure 6).", "Tangible data science resources, like data and technology, had comparatively low loadings in this analysis. This is consistent with previous literature on the strategic management of information technologies, which contends that such assets offer very little competitive advantage when they can be acquired easily on the open market (e.g., Powell and Dent\u2010Micallef, 1997). Arguably many data science technologies are being similarly commoditized; for example, the survey items used in this survey were originally written in 2016 and refer to Hadoop and NoSQL, technologies which many data scientists would now consider to be standard (or even outdated).", "This implies that the strategic advantage of a data science capability derives primarily from those factors that are difficult to copy between firms: namely, human skills and intangible resources. Although one might have hoped to see higher loadings for the data-driven decision-making culture items in this survey, technical and managerial skills were confirmed as the best reflections of overall data science capability. How this might change over time is uncertain. Some commentators believe that many of the tasks currently done by data scientists will be automated in the near future, meaning that technical skills may become less unique between organisations.", "What do these findings mean in practice?", "\u201cIn our view, too many companies have unwittingly surrendered core competencies when they cut internal investment in what they mistakenly thought were just \u2018cost centers\u2019 in favor of outside suppliers.\u201d (p. 7)", "Data science is maturing as a profession and it has become established as a vital function in many modern organizations. Yet firms still face real challenges extracting value from data science capabilities. This research confirms that it is not simply enough to buy \u201ca kilo of AI\u201d; organizations must also try to make that capability a core competency of the firm, with impact on multiple resources and capabilities, multiple products and services. The scale of this challenge appears to depend on attributes of the firm and its industry. While there are concrete steps that can be taken to promote this relationship, there are no easy fixes. It takes time and effort to develop data science capabilities that create value for your firm.", "The theoretical model (Figure 1) describes a relationship between three latent constructs: data science capability (CAP), data science core competency (CORE), and data science value (VALUE). Since these constructs cannot be measured directly, respondents were asked a series of questions about specific elements of the overall construct. Rather than being formed by a combination of these item scores, the latent constructs were instead designed to be reflected in the measured items. For example, the overall level of data science capability is reflected in the answers to specific questions about the use of data science technologies, the level of technical and managerial skills, and aspects of a data-driven culture.", "Each latent construct was based on previously published survey instruments (CAP and CORE) or evaluated during the pilot study (VALUE). Before fitting the overall model, each construct was checked with a confirmatory factor analysis. Some constructs had to be simplified because there were insufficient data to support the fitting of a more complex model (e.g. CAP). For other constructs, internal validity and consistency checks indicated that the available data did not support the proposed theoretical model, and items were either assigned to other constructs or dropped from the model entirely.", "The study has two primary limitations. The first is the relatively small sample size, a common problem in SEM studies, and one that had the practical effect of limiting the complexity of the models that could be evaluated. But additionally, the sample was heterogeneous and contained respondents from a range of countries, industries, and professional experiences; a future study would be better advised to focus on a specific sector within the data science community or invest substantial more in data collection.", "Buckley, D.
