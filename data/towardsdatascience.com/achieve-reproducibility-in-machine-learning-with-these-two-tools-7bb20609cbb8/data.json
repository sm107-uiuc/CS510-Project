In machine learning, reproducibility is being able to recreate a machine learning workflow to reach the same outputs as to the original work. That is when we need some tools to efficiently log the inputs and outputs as well as save our models.", "Would it be nice if you could have a log of all your experiments, the dates, the information about the data, parameters, results, and model in one place like this?", "My favorite tools to achieve this goal are Hydra and MLflow. Let\u2019s discover how to:", "First of all, what is a configuration file and why do we need it? The configuration file contains plain text parameters that define settings or preferences for building or running a program. In data science, config file could be used to define the data and the parameters for our data.", "For example, we could use config file to log the data, hyperparameters, model, and metrics for the experiments.", "To read the config file, we will use Hydra. Why Hydra? With Hydra, we can compose your configuration dynamically, enabling us to easily get the perfect configuration for each run. To install Hydra, simply run", "Add Hydra as the decorator before our main function with the parameter is the path to our configuration file.
