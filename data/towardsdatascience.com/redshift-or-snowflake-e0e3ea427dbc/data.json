In this article, I have tried to present my learning while working on these leading cloud databases.", "Redshift has a cluster as its core component. The cluster can have one or more compute nodes where data persists. A leader node splits the task to multiple task nodes and each task node works in parallel. Each task node has its own storage and compute unit.", "On the other hand, Snowflake keeps the storage and compute independently and store the data centrally, which is accessible to all compute units. Each compute cluster stores some portion of the data locally for processing. The advantage of keeping storage separately from the compute is that during performance bottleneck, more compute can be added without impacting existing workloads.", "One of the key architectural differentiators which makes Snowflake stand out is that Snowflake stores its data as the micro-partitioned files (16 MB in size) on the AWS S3 (if chosen AWS cloud) managed by Snowflake. Its metadata keeps track of all the micro-partitioned files and enables Snowflake to offer features like time-travel, a clone of TB size table within a few seconds. All this is possible because underlying data (i.e. files) doesn\u2019t get impacted but it's all controlled by the metadata containing a mapping of the logical schemas with the physical storage.", "a. Columnar data storage reduces the amount of data to be read from the table and reduces disk I/O significantly", "b. MPP (Massive parallel processing) architecture", "c. Stores compressed data to reduce disk I/O, which gets uncompressed during query execution", "d. Query results get cached at the leader node in case of Redshift and Snowflake cache the query results at the compute node (local disk). This avoid execution of the repeated queries against the data", "e. Redshift offers a variety of techniques to optimize database performance like distribution/sort keys, partitioning, and data distribution style. However, Snowflake doesn\u2019t offer any optimization techniques. It may be good for the people, who find it complex but also takes away the opportunity from the experts.", "Redshift can be scaled up and down by adding or removing nodes in the existing cluster. During the resizing operation, the cluster will be available in the read-only mode. However, the auto-scaling feature is not available in Redshift", "Snowflake can seamlessly auto-scale its compute units without any impact on the existing workloads. This is possible because data storage is outside of the compute clusters. Therefore, data is not required to be shuffled across clusters and scaling is quick without any write outage.", "Snowflake keeps the \u201cstorage\u201d and \u201ccompute\u201d separately for the cost calculation. It uses \u201ccredit\u201d as a unit to measure compute cost. $ Value of credit varies on the compute size and usage.", "Below table explains how cost is calculated.", "e.g. 1 hour usage for a Medium size virtual warehouse (enterprise edition) will cost 4 credits * $3.30= $13.2", "Storage cost has two variations i.e. on-demand and pre-purchased capacity. Pre-purchased capacity is cost-effective as it required a committed usage in advance. Below figure show that monthly cost of 1 TB storage on-demand storage is nearly double than the pre-purchased storage", "Redshift also offers on-demand and reserved instance pricing, where a 1-year term can get 20%-40% discount and the 3-year term can get 50%-75% off discount, depending on the instance type and size", "Redshift cluster nodes have a maximum limit for storage, which means a node should be added to accommodate more storage requirements.", "It is difficult to compare the cost between Redshift and Snowflake as Snowflake doesn\u2019t expose the configuration of its server. In the below table, indicative cost comparison has been done between Snowflake medium size DW with Redshift dc2.8xlarge. However, the actual cost depends on the usage and the plan. Redshift offers reserved instance which can save significant cost, whereas Snowflake auto-suspend feature optimizes the server usage and very cost-effective.", "*Reserve instance price is available for Redshift", "Both Redshift and Snowflake reflects the cloud-build architecture and offers cloud data platform. If you are planning to adopt one, there are few parameters you need to consider based on the short term or long term usage.", "If the Eco-System is AWS heavy and you want to take advantage of seamless integration with other AWS services like CloudWatch, Cloud Trail, Glue Catalog, etc, then Redshift gains extra points. Redshift Spectrum is an added feature that can assist in querying the S3 data, without loading into Redshift. Though Snowflake offers the same via \u201cexternal tables\u201d, it has some limitations to refresh the metadata.", "If you are a large organization having multiple departments and need to read data on ad-hoc-basis, then Snowflake can offer more flexible and cost-effective workload management. Due to its architecture, different user communities can have a separate compute unit, where performance issues with one compute unit will not affect others. Also, the auto-suspend feature can put the cluster to sleep, which is not in use.", "If your organization often experiences unexpected spikes and requires frequent scale-up/down, then Snowflake suits best as you can resize your cluster or add/remove clusters in seconds, without impact on any running process.", "When it comes to maintenance, Redshift requires some housekeeping activities like \u201cAnalyze\u201d to update statistics and \u201cVacuum\u201d to re-sort rows and reclaim space, to keep the performance intact. However, Snowflake doesn\u2019t require such maintenance tasks.", "Your home for data science.
