There\u2019s a lot of hype and expectation around what data science can deliver, but these hopes can falter when the day-to-day reality of dealing with data problems, bugs, and computation limits sinks in. This blog is a guide to some of the common problems a data scientist, or data science team, can encounter with some suggestions on how to go about dealing with them.", "This is one of the most common issues, and is a sign that the data scientist(s) have been hired without enough thought as to the environment and setup they need to be successful. Managing data is a constant challenge for most organizations and the ability to reliably ensure the right data is in the right place at the right time is crucial for effective data science. Therefore, to fix this we usually need to be looking at our data engineering setup. Are there enough of them, and do they have the time to focus on your needs?", "A commonly quoted ratio of data engineers to data scientists is 1:2, but really it\u2019s a function of how messy the data you need is. If everything is already well organized into easily query-able and reliable data stores then you may need only 1 data engineer for a few data scientists. If your data is spread all over the place in assorted prem and cloud stores, with a few excel spreadsheets and SQL server instances mixed in for good measure, you may need more of a 1:1 ratio.", "This can be one of the most frustrating problems, as weeks or even months of work go up in smoke when an influential stakeholder turns round and says: \u201cnope\u201d. This tends to happen when crucial points or requirements get missed in the scoping process, or got lost when the algorithm is being built out.", "Looking closely at your product management processes is therefore key to understanding why these issues happen and preventing them recurring. I say product management processes as whilst it can be that product management dropped the ball, it may also be that data science or engineering teams aren\u2019t adhering to the product requirements, or aren\u2019t listening enough to the stakeholders. It can also happen that stakeholders invent new requirements towards the end of a project, or forget to mention crucial points at project initiation.", "A couple of ways of avoiding these issues are:", "Bugs, unfortunately, are a fact of life and whilst I\u2019d love to be able to give a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d style tip to avoid them, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to leave you disappointed. However, bugs shouldn\u2019t be all a data scientist deals with and if you find that you\u2019re slowing down on delivery as you\u2019re always bug-hunting then it may be time to take a look at the engineering setup.", "Deploying ML algorithms can be done in a number of ways, from the data scientist\u2019s building the entire pipeline themselves, using off the shelf or in-house AI platforms, to the engineering teams re-writing a data scientist\u2019s specification directly into the software itself. The nature of bugs can also vary hugely from sporadic weirdness to full blown system failures. That said, some common themes around buggy data science are still worth discussing.", "Now this isn\u2019t to say that data scientists shouldn\u2019t write production code, many can and do just fine. But whilst data science training does involve a lot of coding, it tends not to focus on creating great software engineers. So if your algorithm is constantly acting out, it may need someone with more relevant training and experience to re-write it.", "You can build the best product recommendation algorithm in the world but if it takes 20 seconds to render on the page then customers will abandon the site in droves. Ensuring an algorithm works well in the context it will operate in, and not just in the training environment, is crucial and the reason the role of Machine Learning Engineer has risen to prominence over the last few years. Fixes here can be as simple as removing features that are reliant on buggy data stores, or as complex as re-visiting the algorithm type and training/scoring approach.", "Algorithms and data products generate questions. How well is it working? How does it behave in certain circumstances? Should we be exploring different features or datasets? These can come from both stakeholders but also team members as they seek to grow and improve the algorithm/product. Here the skills of an analytics are best employed: rapid querying, data visualization, and storytelling.", "A common problem can arise when an algorithm is attracting a number of pertinent questions, but there\u2019s too little (or no) analytics resource on hand to answer them. This tends to push the analytics work onto the other team members such as product, data science and engineering which slows down delivery (and usually isn\u2019t their core expertise). This can lead to the paradoxical situation where a known issue doesn\u2019t get fixed because the team are too busy answering questions about it!", "Any algorithm or product requires a few iterations to work out the kinks and really hit its stride, but this should be a question of refining a broadly good solution, rather than continually getting things way off and having to regularly go back to the drawing board. Customers and stakeholders only have so much patience.", "It can be tempting to blame these kinds of issue solely on product management, and though that can be part of the problem, merely focusing there can miss a broader issue. Whilst product management are indeed in charge of picking the right tools and approach to solve a given problem, for that solution to really work the data scientists and engineers who build it also need to have detailed knowledge of the problem and context, and thoroughly understand why a particular solution has been chosen.", "Things go wrong when there\u2019s too much of a gap between the data scientist/engineer, and the business or problem area they\u2019re building for. There can a few causes here:", "None of these are conceptually difficult to fix, but making the changes in processes and setups can take time and persuasion. It will be worth it though, great products and algorithms are built by people who are experienced and knowledgeable about what they\u2019re working on. Conversely data scientists and engineers who just \u201cdo what they\u2019re told\u201d are a recipe for disengagement and mediocre software.", "When deploying machine learning into an organization it can be a constant challenge to ensure you\u2019re always in a position to work effectively, and aren\u2019t side-tracked by tasks that aren\u2019t part of a key data scientist\u2019s skill set. I\u2019ve sketched out how one can think about some of these issues, but the actual solutions will be dependent on the context of the organization you\u2019re working in. In essence, whenever you\u2019re persistently hitting issues that prevent you from getting the job done, don\u2019t just bash your head against them but step back and look at the broader set up, and where you may need more help or a different approach.
