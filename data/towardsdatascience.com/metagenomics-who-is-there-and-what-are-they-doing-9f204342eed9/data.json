Estimates show that a human has approximately a pound or two of bacteria living in his/her gut (stomach) [1] (Now don\u2019t go and drink all the antibiotics you know, to kill those bacteria. In fact, these bacteria play an important role in our metabolism and immune system). The same goes for the backyard of your house. There can be many species of bacteria living in the soil and they help to enrich the soil (e.g.: nitrifying bacteria produce nitrates which are essential for plants). These microscopic communities have very diverse ecosystems and studying their composition and behaviour can provide us with valuable insights. In this article, I will provide a basic introduction to metagenomics, which is the study of genetic material obtained from microbial communities.", "Metagenomics is the application of modern genomic techniques to the study of communities of microbial organisms directly in their natural environments, bypassing the need for isolation and lab cultivation of individual species [2].", "Different communities of microorganisms can be found in soil, sea, mud, forests, space and even in the human body. Microorganisms that can be found in these environments can include bacteria, viruses/phages, microbial eukaryotes (e.g.: yeast) and worms (e.g.: helminths and nematodes).", "Now you must be wondering how can we study these tiny organisms which we cannot even see. The old school way to study them would be to obtain samples, plate them in Petri dishes, see if anything grows, isolate the culture, and sequence. However, the majority of the bacterial species cannot be cultured using this traditional way. So in metagenomics, what we do is we obtain samples from the microbial communities directly and sequence them [3].", "Metagenomics helps in the discovery of novel natural products, antibiotics and enzymes with new functions in many areas such as medicine, agriculture, energy, food and nutrition, etc.", "Every metagenomics study comes across two main questions [4];", "When we consider the question \u201cwho is there\u201d, we want to identify what species of micro-organisms are present in the sample. The question \u201cwhat are they doing\u201d implies that we have to determine their functions and behaviours.", "Once you have obtained samples from the environment, you have to prepare libraries so that it becomes easy to analyse. The two current methods of creating your libraries for analysis are", "There are three main approaches when dealing with metagenomic datasets [4] as shown in Figure 1.", "In order to perform targeted metagenomics, the genetic material from samples is extracted and the genes of interest are PCR amplified based on regions of interest [5]. The most commonly used gene for this purpose is the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. This gene is called the \u201cuniversal phylogenetic marker\u201d. It is present in all living microorganisms and contains a single copy.", "Let\u2019s consider the basic workflow of 16S rRNA gene-based analysis (Figure 2) of the human skin [6]. Firstly, samples are collected and the DNA is extracted. Next, PCR amplification is done for bacterial 16S rRNA genes and the amplified samples are sequenced. Finally, the resulting data is processed and analysed using various tools. We can determine operational taxonomic units (OTUs), aspects of community structure and functional roles of microbial communities.", "Two famous 16S rRNA analysis pipelines include QIIME and Mothur.", "Currently, I\u2019m doing research related to metagenomics. The articles I have read and what I have done so far inspired me to write this article. Metagenomics is a fairly new area and considered as a hot topic these days. I have found metagenomics to be very fascinating, full of research problems and new things to discover. For those of you who are interested in pursuing higher studies in the fields of bioinformatics and computational genomics, I hope you found my article as a useful stepping point.", "If you have missed my \u201cStarting off in Bioinformatics\u201d series, you can read the articles from the links listed below to understand the basics of bioinformatics.", "Thank you for reading.
