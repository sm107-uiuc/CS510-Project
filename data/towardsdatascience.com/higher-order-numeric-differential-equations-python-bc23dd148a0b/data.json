That is they are errors from approximate an infinite sum, as partial sums.", "In terms of a computer, there is a term called machine epsilon or double precision. This is the accuracy beyond which a computer cannot tell the difference between two numbers. That is a truncation error of machine epsilon, while in mathematics is not considered an accurate result and still an approximation, in scientific computing it is considered accurate.", "In the above equation, h or dx is the time step. The equation has a truncation error of ~O(h), which means to decreases the error from e-8 to e-10, the new time step would have to e-2 smaller than the old-time step. Which makes the increase in accuracy for Euler\u2019s Method extremely slow.", "Now one might ask the question, why does the speed of converge matter. Well apart from the fact that higher speed of converge will decrease the wait time of large computations, there is another reason. The reason is another error we face called the round-off error.", "A round off error,[1] also called rounding error,[2] is the difference between the result produced by a given algorithm using exact arithmetic and the result produced by the same algorithm using finite-precision, rounded arithmetic.", "This essentially means there is a slight error in every computation we do, in every time step. And the more time steps or, the more computation we perform, the more the round-off error adds up. There is a point where the round-off error will exceed the truncation error, and performing more computations will make the resulting value inaccurate.", "The above example highlights the truncation error and round-off errors of two different approximations, one with a truncation error ~h\u00b2 represented in purple and one with truncation error ~h\u2074 represented in yellow.", "Notice in the above graph, that the purple graph with a truncation error of order 2 ~h\u00b2, which would be similar to Euler\u2019s method reaches a much lower accurate(higher truncation error) than the higher-order method in yellow.", "This is because the error only scales in a quadratic manner, that is if you reduce the time step by half, the error reduces by a fourth. While the higher-order method of order 4, for the same reduction of time step by half the resulting error would reduce by a sixteenth.", "This method works for any order; however, in this post, we will focus on 4th order methods, specifically RK4.", "If we expand the Taylor expansion to the order we desire, we will get the higher-order methods.", "However, it is normally difficult to differentiate the differential equations to get d/dx(f(x)), but different mathematician have found different 4th order methods, the one that this post will focus on, was discovered by Runge, it is called RK4.", "This function has truncation error ~O(h\u2074), which means to move from e-8 to e-10, the difference in time step would be \u221c(e-2) which would make the number of computations much lower.", "In this post, I am not going too deeply into the mathematics, as I believe there are a lot of practical applications in computer science that can be achieved without a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics. I have linked to resources below to help understand the math better.", "Finally, the fun part begins, so we have to choose which system of differential equations we going to solve. I\u2019m showing an example of a more complex system of differential equations, as this will cover the skills required to solve simpler systems.", "The system we are solving for today is the Lorenz System, more commonly known as the butterfly effect.", "The above snippet performs the operation of a single time step, that is the dt move in [dx,dy,dz] as a vector. Looking at this as a vector operation makes it much easier to understand, here is where NumPy shines, allowing you to solve this time step as a vector function.", "The above function is a general rk4, time step which is essential to solving higher order differential equations efficiently, however, to solve the Lorenz System, we need to set up some other functions to use this formula.", "First, let\u2019s set up the functions dx, dy, dz with the constants of the Lorenz System", "Now to make a function to calculate the points of the lorenz system", "Finally, we can start with the exiting part, graphing and visualizing the data.", "Here we will be using the Axes3D module we imported earlier.", "This highlights the phenomenon of chaos inherent to the Lorenz System, of how slightly different starting values create vastly different endpoints. Again this post is not a resource about the Lorenz system, which you can learn more about here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system", "Once again, I would highly encourage you to play around with the code for yourself, which you can do at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14KT0sLGFphRF_QeL8e3by7tfNY0xkzq5", "Your home for data science.
