Churn prediction, spam email detection, image classification are just some common examples.", "There are many different algorithms that can perform classification tasks. These algorithms can be grouped under two broad categories which are generative and discriminative.", "In this post, I will try to explain the difference between generative and discriminative classifiers and how they do the classification.", "Consider a case where we have a feature x and a target variable y. We are trying to predict y based on the values of x.", "Generative classifiers learn the joint probability distribution P(x,y). The focus is on how features and target variable occur together. The goal is to be able to explain how the data is generated.", "Once the model captures the process that generated the data, it can make predictions on the new examples (i.e. data points). Thus, the key factor for generative classifiers is to be able to learn the underlying data distribution.", "In order to make predictions, generative classifiers transform the joint probability ( P(x,y) ) to a conditional probability ( P(y|x) ) by using the Bayes rule. If you are not familiar with the notation, P(y|x) means probability of y given the values of x.", "Naive bayes classifiers and hidden markov models are examples of generative classifiers.", "Let\u2019s say we have some points that belong to either blue or orange class. These points are plotted in the figure below. The joint probability distributions based on the known values of x and y (training data) are also shown in the figure.", "The labels of new data points are decided based on the joint probability distributions. For instance, the green point in the figure above is labelled as orange.", "Since generative models learn the data distribution, they can also be used to generate new data.", "Discriminative classifiers try to find boundaries that separate classes. All possible threshold values for boundaries are checked and the one that gives the lowest error is selected.", "These boundaries can be hard or soft depending on the algorithm. Soft boundary means allowing some examples to be misclassified. For instance, soft margin support vector machine (SVM), as the name suggests, creates a soft boundary.", "Logistic regression, SVM, and tree based classifiers (e.g. decision tree) are examples of discriminative classifiers.", "A discriminative model directly learns the conditional probability distribution P(y|x). Recall that generative model learns the joint probability P(x,y) and then transform it to P(y|x) by using the Bayes rule.", "Consider the case below. The data points belong to either class 0 and class 1. The logistic regression model draws a boundary that indicates the probability that a data point belongs to class 1 (i.e. P(y=1 | x)).", "Generative models are more sensitive to outliers because the outliers have the potential to affect the distribution greatly.", "In case of discriminative models, an outlier is just a misclassified example.", "Consider the following case where we have 2 outliers in the orange class.", "Due to these outliers, the orange distribution dominates a range of values that are much more likely to be in blue class.", "We do not have how many outliers may exist or how extreme the values are. Thus, in case of the existence of outliers, discriminative approach is more suitable.", "Both generative and discriminative models have advantages and disadvantages. Otherwise, we would not be talking about both.", "For instance, generative models are more data hungry. They need enough data to be able to represent the distributions accurately. Generative models are also more computationally expensive than discriminative models.", "Discriminative models are more robust against outliers whereas the outliers might have a great impact on the data distribution which negatively affects the accuracy of generative models.", "Both generative and discriminative models are quite useful in machine learning. The optimal choice depends on the characteristics of the task and data.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
