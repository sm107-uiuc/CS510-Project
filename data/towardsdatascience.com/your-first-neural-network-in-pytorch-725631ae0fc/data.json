It will be simpler then you expect, trust me.", "The article is structured as follows:", "It seems like a lot, but I promise \u2014 you\u2019ll read it in 10 minutes tops, 15 if you decide to follow along with the code, provided you have necessary libraries installed.", "After reading the article you\u2019ll have a basic idea on how to implement an Artificial Neural Network algorithm in the PyTorch library to make predictions on previously unseen data.", "Keep in mind that the article doesn\u2019t cover advanced stuff \u2014 as those will come in the following articles. So without much ado, let\u2019s get started.", "For this simple example we\u2019ll use only a couple of libraries:", "Here are the imports if you just want to copy/paste:", "As for the dataset, the Iris dataset, it can be found on this URL. Here\u2019s how to import it in Pandas directly:", "The first couple of rows look like this:", "What we want to do now is to change, or remap, values from the Name column to something numeric \u2014 let\u2019s say 0, 1, 2. Here\u2019s how to do so:", "Executing the code from above results in the following DataFrame:", "Which means we\u2019re good to proceed!", "In this section, we\u2019ll use the Scikit-Learn library to do a train/test split. Afterward, we\u2019ll convert split data from Numpy arrays to PyTorch tensors.", "To start out, we need to split the Iris dataset into features and target \u2014 or X and y. The column Name will be the target variable and everything else will be a feature (or predictor).", "I will also be using a random seed, so you are able to reproduce my results. Here\u2019s the code:", "If you were now to check the first 3 rows from X_train you\u2019d get this:", "We now have everything needed to create a Neural Networks \u2014 let\u2019s do so in the next section.", "As for the architecture of the model, it will be very simple. Let\u2019s see how the network will be structured:", "And that\u2019s pretty much it. Besides that, we\u2019ll use ReLU for our activation function. Let\u2019s see how to implement this in code:", "PyTorch uses this object-orientated way of declaring models, and it\u2019s fairly intuitive. In the constructor, you will define all the layers and their architecture, and in the forward() method you will define a forward pass.", "Let\u2019s now make an instance of the model and verify that its architecture matches the one we specified above:", "Great. Before we can train the model, there\u2019s a couple of more things we need to declare:", "Here\u2019s how to implement it in code:", "And now the part we\u2019ve been waiting for \u2014 model training!", "This part will also be extremely simple. We\u2019ll train the model for 100 epochs, keeping track of time and loss. Every 10 epochs we\u2019ll output to the console the current status \u2014 indicating on which epoch are we and what\u2019s the current loss.", "If you\u2019re wondering what these last 3 lines are doing, the answer is simple \u2014 backpropagation \u2014 ergo updating of weights and biases so the model can actually \u201clearn\u201d.", "Here\u2019s the result of the above code:", "That was fast \u2014 please don\u2019t get used to that feeling.", "If plain numbers mean absolutely nothing to you, here\u2019s a visualization of our loss (epoch number on the x-axis and loss on the y-axis):", "So, we\u2019ve trained the model, but what now? We need to evaluate it on the previously unseen data somehow. Stay here for a minute more and you\u2019ll find out how.", "In the evaluation process, we want to somehow keep track of predictions made by the model. We\u2019ll need to iterate over the X_test and make a prediction, and then later compare it to the actual value.", "We will use torch.no_grad() here because we\u2019re just evaluating \u2014 there\u2019s no need to update weights and biases.", "The predictions are now stored in the preds array. We can now make a Pandas DataFrame with the following 3 attributes:", "The first 5 rows of the df will look like this:", "That\u2019s all great, but how to actually calculate accuracy?", "Well it\u2019s simple \u2014 we only need to sum up the Correct column and divide it with the length of df:", "The accuracy of our model on previously unseen data is 100%. Keep in mind that this is only because the Iris dataset is utterly simple to classify, it is by no means a claim that Neural networks are the best algorithm for this dataset. I\u2019d say NN is an overkill for this type of problem, but that\u2019s a discussion for another time.", "And there you have it \u2014 the most simple Neural network you\u2019ll ever write \u2014 with a perfect and clean dataset, no missing values, fewest layers, and neurons \u2014 admit it, it was easy.", "The next time it won\u2019t be \u2014 as some more advanced concepts will be introduced.", "Loved the article?
