It has been a mainstay concept in direct response marketing for many years, and has been increasingly considered in the field of marketing. Here, we will experiment with a implementable CLTV model that is useful for market segmentation and the allocation of marketing resources for acquisition, retention, and cross-selling. The selection of the model is based on a systematic theoretical taxonomy and on assumptions embedded in customer behavior.", "Relevant data is always a basis on any prediction and CLTV is no exception to that. Here are some of the examples / questions we may want to answer:", "The goals of this article lies in the studying of the business problems as mentioned below. I will demonstrate, as how to build a prediction model using Linear Regression for CLTV.", "There are few approaches available to compute CLTV.", "Let\u2019s get the data and jump into the insights to explore what we have in the data.", "The bar chart clearly shows that we have maximum number of business coming from the UK. From descriptive statistics, we can see that, the some of the order in a negative quantity. This is practically not possible. This could be the order cancellation or return materials. So, we need to filter Quantity greater than zero. More so, we also will filter the required columns for the CLTV analysis. We need CustomerID, InvoiceDate, InvoiceNo, Quantity, and UnitPrice from the data set.", "Now, we shall compute (a) the number of days between the present date and the date of last purchase from each customer, (b) the number of orders for each customer, (c) the sum of purchase price for each customer. Also do further data purification by renaming the columns.", "Now, we shall compute CLTV using the formulas mentioned earlier.", "Let\u2019s assume that business making 25% profit.", "Now we are going to predict CLTV using Linear Regression Model. We need some data preparation here before pushing the data to regression model.", "Now, let\u2019s build a regression model for existing customers. We need a set of dependent (y) and independent variables (X). So, we shall take last six-months data as independent variables and total revenue over three years as a dependent variable followed by usual ML process of splitting training & test data.", "Let\u2019s print R-squared which is the proportion of variance explained by the model, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).", "When the model is deployed, the ML algorithm helps to understand the patterns; it will also categorize the customers according to their CLTV predictions. The marketing strategy is important here considering that CLTV can figure out most profitable customers, but how we are going to make profit from them, will depend on the adopted marketing strategy. Moreover loyalty programs can be formulated based on the insights.", "It is not clear how a regression model can be used to forecast the dynamics of buyer behavior well into the future and then tie it all back into a present value for each customer.", "Two periods of purchasing behavior are required \u2014 (a) to define the RFM variables 1 and (b) to arrive at values of the dependent variable(s). It would be better if we were able to create predictions of future purchasing behavior simply using period 1 data alone. Moreover, it would be of best interest to leverage all of the available data for model calibration purposes without using any of it to create a dependent variable for a regression-type analysis.", "The RFM variables are only imperfect indicators of underlying behavioral traits. Different \u201cslices\u201d of the data will yield different values of the RFM variables and therefore different scoring model parameters. This has important implications when we utilize the observed data from one period to make predictions of future behavior (2) (3).", "The LR was close to perfect here predicting what an average customer will spend during their lifetime. CLTV helps to design an effective business plan and also provide a chance to scale the business. However, as already discussed, a lot will depend on marketing strategy to extract profit. In general, marketing automation platform manages the customer lifecycle. Marketing platforms orchestrate the marketing campaigns while also automating the movement of leads and customers through the pipeline. Marketing departments use these software applications to plan, coordinate, execute, manage, and measure their campaigns across multiple channels and automate repetitive tasks.", "I can be connected here .", "Your home for data science.
