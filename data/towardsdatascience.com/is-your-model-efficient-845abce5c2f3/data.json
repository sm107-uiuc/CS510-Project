To do this, you decide to flip your coin n times and record a one or a zero depending on whether you get heads or tails.", "The most straightforward way to estimate the probability would be to compute the proportion of heads that you obtained in your n throws, which we\u2019ll call p\u0302. The bigger n gets, the more certain you are that p\u0302 accurately estimates p, the true probability of getting heads. In statistics, we say that p\u0302 is an estimator of p. Intuitively speaking, an estimator is just a way of estimating an unknown parameter in a statistical model, given some data.", "Estimators are fundamental in statistics. In the above example, our estimator was unbiased, meaning that its expected value is the parameter that we\u2019re attempting to estimate. Besides having our estimator be unbiased, it is also very important that our estimates are as close as possible to their expected value, i.e. that the variance is minimized.", "When working with unbiased estimators, the variance is the same as the mean squared error (MSE), which should be familiar to those of you who have previous experience in machine learning.", "Here\u2019s a very visual example that\u2019s commonly used to explain estimators. Suppose that you\u2019re shooting darts. The goal is to hit the bull\u2019s eye (the parameter). The individual darts stuck on the board are the estimates made by your estimator (you, throwing the darts). Being unbiased just means that the expected position of your darts is the bull\u2019s eye, which doesn\u2019t actually say much about how close to it you\u2019ll be on average. This is why we look at the MSE. In this case, high MSE just means that the average distance from the individual darts to the bull\u2019s-eye is quite high. Being a good player (estimator) would imply that your darts are clustered around the center \u2014 i.e. that your MSE is very small.", "Now that we understand why we need our estimators to have minimal MSE, the question becomes: given an estimator, how do we know if it\u2019s the most efficient one, i.e. the one with the smallest MSE? This is where the Cramer-Rao bound comes in handy.", "Derived in the 1940s, the Cramer-Rao bound gives us a lower bound for the variance/MSE of unbiased estimators. This means that the best possible estimator for a given parameter will have an MSE dictated by the bound.", "Suppose that we want to estimate \u03b8 from n samples. The Cramer-Rao theorem states the following (under iid assumption and other regularity conditions):", "If we have equality in the bound, then we know that the estimator is efficient! This does not mean that there always exists such an estimator; however, it does state that the best possible estimator\u2019s MSE will be bigger than or equal to the one given by the bound.", "Now, you might be wondering exactly what the I(\u03b8) in the equation represents. It is called the Fisher Information and, intuitively, it is a measure of how much information we have as to which data distribution our sample was from.", "Under iid assumptions, the Fisher Information in a sample of size n is the information in a single sample multiplied by n. We expect that, as we obtain more data and n grows bigger, we should have more \u201cinformation\u201d about what distribution the data was sampled from and, thus, we should be able to better estimate \u03b8.\u00b9", "Let\u2019s now work towards understanding the formula for the Fisher information. We first need to define what\u2019s called the score function. If we consider a random variable X \u223c f(x ; \u03b8), then the score is given by", "The Fisher Information is then defined to be the expected value of the score squared.", "Alternately, with some simple manipulations, we could obtain the alternative expression for the Fisher Information:", "From these expressions, computing the Fisher Information is relatively simple.", "I hope you now have a better idea as to what the Cramer-Rao bound actually represents for estimators. Furthermore, I hope that you\u2019ll now be prepared to compute and evaluate the efficiency of your own estimators.", "Your home for data science.
