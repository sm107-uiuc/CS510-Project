A statistical hypothesis test is a method of statistical inference. Commonly, two statistical data sets are compared, or a data set obtained by sampling is compared against a synthetic data set from an idealized model. An alternative hypothesis is proposed for the statistical-relationship between the two data-sets, and is compared to an idealized null hypothesis that proposes no relationship between these two data-sets. This comparison is deemed statistically significant if the relationship between the data-sets would be an unlikely realization of the null hypothesis according to a threshold probability \u2014 the significance level. Hypothesis tests are used when determining what outcomes of a study would lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis for a pre-specified level of significance.", "Reading this one might think that someone has written it like this so that very few could understand it. The real challenge is most tutorials rely on the use of a lot of terminology and language that statisticians enjoy to employ.", "In this post, I would try to explain Hypothesis Testing along with Type I and Type II error in a simple manner without using too much mathematics.", "I would recommend reading this article beforehand as the concepts of Confidence Interval and Margin of Error would be beneficial in understanding Hypothesis Testing.", "Let\u2019s say an online education company wants to improve the Engagement ratio of its students with the help of a new feature. Engagement ratio is defined as the number of minutes spent watching lessons divided by the total minutes of content available. Let\u2019s assume the value of the Engagement ratio is between 1 to 10. As the company is not sure whether the new feature would improve the engagement ratio they would like to test it out on a sample of students.", "Now if we randomly take samples of n students from a population(with mean \u03bc_p and standard deviation \u03c3_p), the Central limit theorem tells us the following:", "We now have a distribution of sample means for all samples of size n=20 from the entire population. Let\u2019s now introduce the new feature to a random sample of 20 students and then calculate the new engagement ratio. Let\u2019s say the new mean engagement ratio for these 20 students is X\u2091.", "We want to know where the new mean, X\u2091 falls in the sampling distribution? In other words, we want to find the z score?", "z score is basically the number of standard deviations(\u03c3_x) by which the value X\u2091 is above or below the mean value \u03bc_s.", "Now let\u2019s ask the question \u201cWhat is the probability of randomly selecting a sample of size 20 and getting a mean of at least 8.94?\u201d The probability would be equal to \u201c1-area of the region shaded in blue\u201d. We can use the z table to get the value. We find that the z-score of 10.06 is so huge it\u2019s off the chart! This simply means the probability is so less that it\u2019s almost impossible to get the mean of 8.94 by chance or in other words, the new feature seems to have an effect on the engagement of the students.", "Here we need to define some threshold below which if the probability falls we can safely assume that the result obtained is too unlikely to obtain by chance and the result was due to some intervention(introduction of a new feature in our example). Statisticians have determined three conventional levels known as \u03b1 levels also called the significance level.", "If the probability of getting a particular sample mean is less than \u03b1, it\u2019s unlikely to occur.", "Here, we have assumed after the introduction of the new feature the mean engagement ratio would increase. In real life, we cannot make such an assumption as the opposite is also possible. To solve this uncertainty we use a two-tailed test where we split the \u03b1 symmetrically into two parts. Splitting the \u03b1 would result in two asymmetric z-critical values.", "Note: For a two-tailed test, the z-critical values are the same used to calculate the confidence intervals. Refer this article to learn more about Confidence Interval.", "At a particular \u03b1 level, we have two possible outcomes in either situation(one-tailed or two-tailed). Either the sample mean(X\u2091) would lie outside of the critical region or inside the critical region. We denote these two outcomes as the null hypothesis(H\u2092) or alternative hypotheses(H\u2090).", "The null hypothesis(H\u2092) assumes there is no significant difference between the current population and the new population after some sort of intervention.", "We choose a one-tailed test when we are sure about the direction of the change. A two-tailed test is a conservative choice as we might be wrong about the direction.", "Given a sample mean we can either reject a null hypothesis(H\u2092) or fail to reject it. Rejecting a null hypothesis(H\u2092) can be interpreted in the following ways:", "This type of statistical analysis is prone to errors. In the above example, it might be the case that the 20 students chosen are already very engaged and we wrongly decided the high mean engagement ratio is because of the new feature. The diagram below represents the four different scenarios that can happen.", "Those who are familiar with Machine Learning might observe that Type I error is basically False Positive and Type II error is False Negative.", "I hope the term Hypothesis Testing will no longer be a foreign concept.
