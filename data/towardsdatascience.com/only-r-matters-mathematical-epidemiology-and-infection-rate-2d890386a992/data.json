Everything really. Not much has changed except how we graphically represent it \u2014 namely with Graph \u2014 and its capacity to handle larger, world-reaching datasets. Hopefully, this piece will give you a primer to help you begin to understand the struggle we\u2019re in today as we try to solve a mathematical problem like COVID-19.", "Mathematical modelling of epidemics dates back as far as the 18th-century Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli, who, apparently not content with fundamental work in mechanics, statistics and economics, also created the first known mathematical model of the spread of an epidemic. His model gave a life expectancy in terms of the infection rate and the mortality rate, applied to the outbreaks of smallpox that were then prevalent throughout Europe.", "It was another disease which inspired what many consider the foundation of the science of epidemiology, namely cholera. Cholera outbreaks were a quite frequent phenomena in the 1800s in London, due to inadequate infrastructure, overcrowding, and a lack of an accurate medical model of germs and infection. It seems remarkable now, but there were two competing theories at the time: germ theory, and miasma theory. Miasma theory held that cholera, and other diseases, was due to decaying organic matter transmitted in the air \u2014 perhaps not as odd a theory as it might seem today, given the pollution then prevalent in central London, and the lack of a sewage system throughout many parts of the capital.", "John Snow was, in many ways, the first data scientist. He created a map of infections of an outbreak in Soho, around Broad Street, in 1854. He rejected the prevailing miasma theory, and concentrated instead on tracing the spread of cholera through the water system. He traced infections using what would now be called a Voronoi diagram. Eventually, he posited a particular water pump as the likely source of the cholera outbreak. His work provided empirical evidence for the germ theory, and established water supplies as the primary transmission agent for cholera. His work also led to major revisions in public health legislation concerning the provision of clean water and safe waste disposal. There is a pub in Soho, close to the water pump which was ground zero for the Broad Street infection, which bears his name.", "Many epidemiological models have been developed since this seminal work, including systems of differential equations, stochastic processes, and those based on graphs. We will look at how graph theory can be applied as a model of the spread of disease.", "Graph theory as an object of mathematical inquiry dates back to a problem known as the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg. It is a problem which sounds quite simple to state, but its solution led Leonhard Euler to develop a wholly new mathematical theory in order to arrive at a definitive answer. While solving this problem, Euler invented graph theory; this is the sort of thing Euler did rather a lot of, making fundamental contributions to physics, astronomy, geography, logistics, topology, number theory, calculus, and an eye-watering number of other fields.", "Two rivers ran through the city of K\u00f6nigsberg, and seven bridges crossed them. The problem which preoccupied Euler, and led to the discovery of graph theory, was to create a walk which crossed the each of the bridges once, but only once. A map of K\u00f6nigsberg is given below, with the rivers given in blue and the bridges in red.", "Having created/discovered the theory of graphs, Euler showed that it was not possible to create a tour of K\u00f6nigsberg by crossing each bridge once.", "Graphs consist of two different objects, vertices and edges. A vertex can be drawn as a point or circle on a piece of paper. An edge is a line which can be drawn between two vertices, joining them up. The graph representing the bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg is given below.", "Graph theory has proved a fertile source of mathematical problems, has contributed to many areas of pure and applied mathematics, and has diffused out into many other areas of science and technology.", "In 1959, Paul Erd\u0151s and Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi published a model for creating random graphs, aptly known as Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi or ER graphs. Erd\u0151s and R\u00e9nyi studied a couple of ways of generating random graphs.", "In the G(n, p) model, a graph is constructed by connecting vertices randomly. An edge is drawn between two vertices with a probability p. This probability, as it increases from 0 to 1, gives the likelihood that any two edges in the graph will be connected.", "The effect of different p values can be seen in the diagrams below. Both have n=50 vertices, but the probability of an edge connecting them differs. For the top diagram, we have p=0.05, and for the diagram below, we have p=0.2.", "One of the many applications of graph theory concerns the spread of epidemics.", "Let\u2019s see how we could use a graph to build a primitive epidemiological model. (Real models used by mathematical biologists and epidemiologists are much more complicated than a simple ER random graph; however, it is still the basis of many such models).", "Let\u2019s consider a population of n individuals.", "A random individual \u2014 an edge, in graph theory \u2014 is infected with a contagious agent, which could be a virus, for example.", "If we assume that this network of interactions could be described by an ER graph, then the probability p represents the likelihood that infection from one person to another (one vertex to another) has occurred.", "This would represent an SI model, from susceptible-infected. When a person is infected, they can pass on that infection, virus, bacteria, with a certain probability.", "We create an ER graph, with random connections (edges) between the vertices in the graph. We also select a vertex at random \u2014 a single infected person in our population. We assume that the random individual can only pass on the infection to another individual if they have a connection, and use the same p value to determine whether or not they pass on the infection.", "We then allow this model to run for a number of timesteps, T=20. The infection runs through the population, moving from person to person, and outputs the fraction of the population who have been infected.", "We run the model for a number of iterations (N=1000 trials), and then average the output (the fraction of infected population).", "This is analogous to the rate of infection being quoted in the media recently, R, in relation to the Corana virus Covid-19. R is the rate of infection, the probability that one person will pass their infection on to another person.", "As can be seen from the figure, and as is intuitively obvious, the higher the infection rate, the higher proportion of the population become infected.", "Given such a simple model, what can we say about the relationship between an infection rate R and a probability p?", "Let\u2019s revisit the model with a slightly different emphasis. We once again have a population of size N. Each person in the population is represented by a vertex in the graph. The graph can be built by placing an edge between two vertices i and j if the infection is transmitted between them. The number of infected people in the graph can be considered the connected component of the graph. A reasonable question to ask would be: how big will that component get?", "The bad news, from the point of view of epidemics (or, indeed, global pandemics), is that the ER random graph model often exhibits what is known as a giant component, where a connected component contains a large, finite fraction of the entire graph!", "If we have p \u2264 (1 \u2014 \u03f5)/N, where \u03f5 >0, then it is very likely that all the connected components will have size of the order of O(log N), and we don\u2019t have a giant component. However, if we have p \u2265(1 +\u03f5)/N, then it is likely, with high probability, that we will have a single, giant component.", "From the perspective of our (admittedly simple) ER model of infection, a very large proportion of our population will be infected. This would be, in effect, an epidemic with most of the population infected.", "As we are only beginning to examine and understand our current pandemic, this mathematical, epidemiological tour through history underlines the crucial fact that all we really have control over is the rate of infection. Without any measures that reduce the probability of infection, infectious diseases will spread at an exponential rate throughout the population.", "Your home for data science.
