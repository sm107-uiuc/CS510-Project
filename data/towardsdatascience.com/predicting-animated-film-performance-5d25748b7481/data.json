This post builds on Part 1: Client Presentation.", "The purpose of this project was to use newly acquired Data Science tools to address a fictional client\u2019s problem area. I chose to look at animated films due to a personal interest in the media and saw this project as a way to help animated Film Producers and film-makers increase their return on investment. I sought to tease apart commonly known characteristics that would make animated films more lucrative, and therefore help the industry on a whole. The technical explanation in the post may be overly detailed, but I have not seen anything of this level of detail on a typical post that goes from end to end of a data science project, so I thought it would be a good contribution to the world wide web.", "This is the order I used the technical tools in, however, the emphasis of the project is identified in bold text.", "Using Beautiful Soup, I scraped the list of the top 423 animated films of all-time from \u201cthe-numbers.com\u201d. From the main page, I pulled each film\u2019s Box Office Revenue, in Domestic, International, and Total intake, release year, and the URL of each film page. Below is the head of the initial DataFrame, as well as the code that generated it.", "I then pulled each film\u2019s data and pre-processed information, for example when scraping dollar amounts, I removed the commas and dollar signs to get a pure number. The process was quite similar to the one above but I pulled information from the-numbers.com HTML based on keywords rather than from a table. Below is the resulting data-frame of the individual movie page scrape.", "I wanted to give the project a wider point of view, so I incorporated GDP Data, as well as IMDB Meta-score Data, pulled from an existing dataset. Consistent with using US GDP Data, I decided to use the Domestic Box Office performance rather than International. In retrospect, I think it would have been more useful for the fictional client to use the International Box Office Revenue since money is money and as you can see in the top 5 films above, the Domestic Share is less than 50%. Additionally, by merging in the limited existing dataset, which did not have many of the animated films in it, I had to cut my dataset to 166 films. Time permitting, a better model may have been generated had I not had to cut my dataset down so far. The meta-score was influential in my model but it may have been a good experiment to check if having more data to train or having the meta-score would have yielded a better model.", "I cleaned the dataset a bit to merge it with the others, and have numeric data in a numeric data type.", "I did similar cleaning and reformatting to the datasets I was merging, and then merged.", "I also generated some numeric data from the information I had gathered to provide the model with the most meaningful numeric data I could. For instance, when I transformed distribution languages into the number of languages, title into the length of the title, and sequel into 0\u2019s and 1's.", "I ended up with the following dataset to do my EDA and model training which was composed of 15 numeric and 7 categorical features.", "I did a quick summary to see if everything was behaving as expected, and there were no unlikely outliers.", "Everything did seem in order, and I did decide to keep the outliers on the high end of Box Office Performance to understand them better. In retrospect, it may have been wise to cut them out to produce a more accurate model.", "After I scraped all my data, I isolated my numeric data and examined it first using a correlation matrix. Code and output below:", "From the heatmap, I could glean that the top features that were highly correlated with Box Office Performance, and would influence my model heavily were:", "Interestingly, as the years increased, the revenue decreased. This also may have to do with having to cut down the dataset to include an accurate Meta-score. To explore the mathematical relationships of the features and the Box Office Performance, I looked further at a pair-plot. Code and result below:", "From the pair plot (after a lot of zooming in on the pdf), I could understand the relationships further, as well as see a few more influential features:", "This feature had a direct relationship with the Box Office, with a shallow slope, and an intercept greater than zero.", "This feature seemed to level out as it reached the maximum, suggesting a more complex relationship with the Box Office Performance.", "This feature had the most direct relationship with Box office, with an intercept at zero. As the production budget grew, the Box Office Performance grew larger proportionally.", "This feature was consistent among the outliers, which were the highest performing films.", "This feature did have a direct relationship with the Box Office Performance, but many films that did have higher meta-scores did not fare that well in the Box Office.", "6. Title Length (number of letters in the title)", "This curve had a directly inverse relationship with the Box Office Performance. High return films consistently had shorter titles.", "This data was mostly clustered around a straight line at 90 minutes, with high return films closer to this length. I don\u2019t think this feature is very significant.", "This feature is also not very significant.", "This feature is important when looking at the graph we can see that early summer and end of the year release dates are more successful. However, seasons do not follow a linear relationship, so it may not model very well in the linear regression model.", "After this EDA, I could build a model and test relationships between my features, as well as the target variable, Domestic Box Office Performance.", "I used the SKlearn python package to setup my simple train-test split, and obtain my R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Squared Error on a few iterations of the variables, inclusion of some dummy variables, as well as hyper-parameters. I made a loop to test the combinations, code and results below for my first iteration with only the numeric data straight out of the box, is below:", "I printed my coefficients as well as my scores for each iteration. I started at roughly 0.64 R-squared, which was not terrible. I went on a few iterations and concluded with the model below.", "These scores were as good as I could get with my dataset, with R-squared coming in at .815, and Mean Absolute Error coming in at $48,934,141. Time permitting, I would have liked to add more data about the historical performance of actors and directors, more information about the studios, as well as the public interest of the start power in the films.", "I also tested Ridge and Lasso to see if these would yield better results, but they did not as over-fitting was not a problem with this particular model. Code and outputs below:", "To evaluate my model, I plotted residuals and found them to be randomly dispersed.", "I also plotted the Expected vs Predicted Box Office Performance, seen below.", "Overall, it was super satisfying running the process end to end. It was surprising to see how much EDA and iterations the process involves, but also comforting to know that the human input to the model is just as important as the model itself. I look forward to applying linear regression to a myriad of problems.", "Your home for data science.
