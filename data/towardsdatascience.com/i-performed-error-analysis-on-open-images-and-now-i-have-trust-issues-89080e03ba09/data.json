We\u2019ve come a long way as a community from the times where MNIST \u2014 a dataset with only 70,000 28x28 pixel images \u2014 was the de facto standard. New, larger datasets have arisen out of a desire to train more complex models to solve more challenging tasks: ImageNet, COCO and Google\u2019s Open Images are among the most popular.", "But even on these huge datasets the differences in performance of top models is becoming narrow. The 2019 Open Images Detection Challenge shows the top five teams fighting for less than a 0.06 margin in mean average precision (mAP). It\u2019s even less for COCO.", "There\u2019s no doubt that our research community is delivering when it comes to developing innovative new techniques to improve model performance, but the model is only half of the picture. Recent findings have made it increasingly clear that the other half \u2014 the data \u2014 plays at least as critical of a role, perhaps even greater.", "And here\u2019s what two leaders of the field are saying about this:", "How many times have you found yourself spending hours, days, weeks pouring over samples in your data? Have you been surprised by how much manual inspection was necessary? Or can you think of a time when you trusted macro statistics perhaps more than you should?", "The computer vision community is starting to wake up to the idea that we need to be close to the data. If we want accurate models that behave as expected, it\u2019s not enough to have a large dataset; it needs to have the right data and it needs to be accurately labeled.", "Every year, researchers are battling it out to climb to the top of a leaderboard with razor thin margins determining fates. But do we really know what\u2019s going on with these datasets? Is a 0.01 margin in mAP even meaningful?", "With another Open Images Challenge just wrapping up, it seemed only appropriate to investigate this popular benchmark dataset and try to better understand what it means to have an object detection model with high mAP. So, I took it upon myself to do some basic error analysis of a pre-trained model with the goal being to observe patterns in errors in the context of the dataset, not the model. To my surprise, I found that a significant portion of these errors were in fact not errors; instead, the dataset annotations were incorrect!", "Error analysis is the process of manually inspecting a model\u2019s prediction errors, identified during evaluation, and making note of the causes of the errors. You don\u2019t need to look at the whole dataset, but at least enough examples to know that you are correctly approximating a trend; let\u2019s say 100 samples as a bare minimum. Open up a spreadsheet, or grab a piece of paper, and start jotting down notes.", "Why do this? Perhaps the majority of images your model is struggling on are low resolution or have poor lighting. If this is the case, adding more high resolution well-lit images to the training set is unlikely to manifest as significant improvement in model accuracy. Any number of other qualitative characteristics of your dataset may be at play; the only way to find out is to analyze your data!", "I generated predictions on the Open Images V4 test set using this FasterRCNN+InceptionResNetV2 network. This network seemed like an ideal choice as it is trained and evaluated on Open Images V4, has a relatively high-mAP of 0.58, and it is readily available to the public via Tensorflow Hub. I then needed to evaluate each image individually.", "Open Images uses a sophisticated evaluation protocol that considers hierarchy, groups and even specifies known-present and known-absent classes. Despite the availability of the Tensorflow Object Detection API, specifically supporting evaluation on Open Images, it took some non-trivial code to get per-image evaluation results. Why isn\u2019t this supported natively? At any rate, I was eventually able to determine exactly which detection was a true positive or false positive for each image.", "I decided to filter the detections, only looking at those with confidence > 0.4. This threshold turned out to be roughly the point where the number of true positives surpasses the number of false positives.", "The structure of this analysis is inspired by a 2012 study which took two state-of-the-art (at the time) detectors and performed manual error analysis. Hoiem\u2019s group created categories such as localization error, confusion with semantically similar objects and false positives on background, but interestingly not anything related to ground truth error!", "I broke down the cause of error into three groups: model errors, ground truth errors and other errors, each subsisting of a few specific causes of error. The next sections define these specific errors and provide examples, in order to provide context before we look at the aggregate results of the error analysis.", "Model errors are the familiar set of errors that Hoiem\u2019s paper established and many researchers have subsequently used in their own publications. A small modification I made here was to omit \u201cother\u201d errors and to add \u201cduplicate\u201d errors which is a split of the \u201clocalization\u201d errors.", "Ground truth errors are causes of false positives whose \u201cfault\u201d is in the annotation, not the model prediction. Were these to be corrected, they would be reassigned as true positives.", "Lastly we have unclear errors, meaning edge cases where it isn\u2019t apparent whether the prediction is correct or not.", "Fortunately this category only accounted for roughly 6.5% of error, but it is still important to note that when trying to create a label hierarchy that can categorize everything in the world there are always going to be edge cases like this circuit lady which the model predicted as a Toy.", "The following table shows the results of analyzing a subset of 178 of the total 125,436 test images.", "This is crazy! 36% of the false positives should actually be true positives! It\u2019s not immediately clear what impact this would have on mAP, given that it is a rather complex metric, however it\u2019s safe to say that the officially reported mAP of 0.58 is underestimating the true performance of the model.", "The single most common cause of error was missing ground truth annotation, accounting for over \u00bc of all errors. This is a challenging problem. It\u2019s unrealistic to ask for a dataset that is not missing boxes. Many of these missing annotations are peripheral objects, not the central focus of the image. But this only emphasizes the need for easy, possibly automated, identification of annotations that will go through an additional round of review. There are other implications as well. Peripheral objects are generally smaller; how do these missing annotations affect accuracy metrics when split into small/medium/large bounding box sizes?", "A few of these other causes of error \u2014 duplicate bounding boxes, incorrect ground truth labels and group errors, in particular \u2014 signal the importance of labeling ontology and annotation protocols. Complex label hierarchies can lead to incorrect ground truth labels, though this study indicates that this is not the case for Open Images. Handling groups is another complication that needs to be carefully defined and reviewed; while not as prevalent as other causes of error, 7.6% being due to boxes that should have been flagged as a group is certainly not insignificant. Finally, duplicate bounding boxes could be, at least in part, a byproduct of expanded hierarchy. In the Open Images object detection challenge a model is tasked with generating a bounding box for each label in the hierarchy. For example, for an image containing a jaguar, the Open Images challenge expects boxes to be generated for not just Jaguar, but also Carnivore, Mammal and Animal. Could this unintentionally lead to a model generating multiple Jaguar boxes for the same animal? Faster RCNN applies classification as a post-processing step after region proposal. So if the model is trained to generate four boxes for every jaguar it sees, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that these four boxes sometimes get the same classification label.", "What would happen to the Open Images Leaderboard if these ground truth errors were corrected? How could this affect our understanding of what strategies work best?", "It should be noted that these errors aren\u2019t just statistical noise. Similar to the findings of the DeepMind team that analyzed ImageNet, there are patterns to the annotation errors in Open Images. For example, missing face-annotations are a very common cause for false positives and bounding boxes around trees should often be labeled as groups but are not.", "The purpose of this article is not to criticize the creators of Open Images \u2014 to the contrary, this dataset and its corresponding challenges have instigated great achievements \u2014 but rather to shed light on a blind spot that could be holding back progress. The impact of these popular open datasets is far-reaching, as they are often used as the starting point for fine-tuning/transfer learning. Furthermore, if popular datasets are suffering from annotation correctness, then most likely while inspecting our own datasets we will be encountering the same. But I\u2019m certainly not speaking from experience\u2026*ahem*", "We\u2019re at the forefront of a shift in focus, where the data itself is being rightfully acknowledged as every bit as important as the model trained on it, if not more! Perhaps we will see smaller, more carefully curated datasets rising in popularity, or more demand for methods like active or semi-supervised learning, that allow us to automate and scale annotation work. Either way, a key challenge will be creating the infrastructure to manage dynamic datasets that grow in size and evolve based on feedback from humans and machine learning models. There\u2019s a lot of potential in this nascent topic!", "To perform this error analysis study, I used Voxel51\u2019s data visualization tool, FiftyOne, a Python package that makes it really easy to load your datasets and interactively search and explore them both through code and a visualization app. Here\u2019s the FiftyOne code I ran to perform the error analysis in this study:", "Want to explore this data for yourself?
