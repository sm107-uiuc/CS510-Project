This is the topic of a future blog. Let\u2019s dive into statistical distributions now.", "One of the basic concepts in statistics is probability distributions. In a probability distribution, we describe the likelihood of obtaining the possible values that a random variable can assume. We can draw probability distributions for both discrete and continuous variables.", "A binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution. It can be thought of as simply the probability of success (1) or failure (0) outcome in an experiment that is repeated multiple times. For example, a coin toss has only two possible outcomes: heads or tails", "The normal distribution is a continuous probability function that describes how the values of a variable are distributed. It is also known as \u201cbell curve\u201d because of the bell-like shape of the curve. In a normal distribution, extreme values in both tails of the distribution are similarly unlikely.", "Normal distributions can be observed from quantum physics to biometrics, from stock market returns to quality control, telephone calls coming into a system, heights, weights, IQs of a population, speeds of gas molecules in a container, examination results of students.", "The Central Limit Theorem in statistics states that given a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution \u2014 no matter what the shape of the population distribution", "The de Moivre-Laplace theorem is a special case of the central limit theorem. It states that with a sufficient sample size, the binomial distribution approximates to a normal distribution.", "Let\u2019s clarify this with a coin flip example: When we do a coin toss we have two possible options: heads and tails. The probability of flipping a coin and choosing heads is 1 out of 2.(1/2). It starts to get complicated when we toss many coins but all probability cames back to the idea of desired outcomes / all possible outcomes", "We can understand the most complex probability concepts by thought experiments or virtual experiments. You can try some virtual coin flip experiments HERE", "What about real probability experiments that make links between abstract statistical concepts and real-world examples? How can we do a real probability experiment? Are we going to flip a coin millions of times? To find the real probabilities, we really need to do the same experiment too many times. (Not hundreds or thousands, millions ).", "Because computers were not invented in the 19th century, statisticians developed creative devices to do statistics experiments faster.", "Sir Francis Galton was an English statistician who created the concepts of correlation, regression toward the mean, surveys for data collection, and lexical hypothesis.", "I want to introduce you to one of the most famous statistics devices developed by Sir Francis Galton: Galton Board, Hextat Probability Demonstrator, Bean Machine, Probability Machine, or quincunx. These are the names of one smart device that provides us to do thousands of coin flip equivalent experiments in a few seconds.", "It is an excellent visual example for the central limit theorem. Small balls randomly fall through levels of branching paths and always end up normal distribution. Randomness is chaos when looked in detail but always follows a universal order.", "The Galton Board consists of a vertical board with interleaved rows of pegs. Beads are dropped from the top and, when the device is level, bounce either left or right as they hit the pegs.", "Why Galton Board is analogous to coin flip? Because in both experiments\u2019 probabilities are equal. In Galton Board, like in coin flip, balls are choosing either left or right path through several rows of pegs.", "The Galton board is an excellent demonstration of the binomial distribution which proves the central limit theorem; When you add independent random variables, their sum tends toward a normal distribution. In particular, it demonstrates De Moivre\u2013Laplace theorem which is a special case of the central limit theorem.", "Any suggestions to seymatas@gmail.com will be very appreciated!", "Your home for data science.
