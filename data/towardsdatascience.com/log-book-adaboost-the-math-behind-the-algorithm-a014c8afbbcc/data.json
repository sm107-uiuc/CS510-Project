To create such a program, he asks a highly successful expert gambler to explain his betting strategy. Not surprisingly, the expert is unable to articulate a grand set of rules for selecting a horse. On the other hand, when presented with the data for a specific set of races, the expert has no trouble coming up with a \u201crule of thumb\u201d for that set of races (such as, \u201cBet on the horse that has recently won the most races\u201d or \u201cBet on the horse with the most favored odds\u201d). Although such a rule of thumb, by itself, is obviously very rough and inaccurate, it is not unreasonable to expect it to provide predictions that are at least a little bit better than random guessing. Furthermore, by repeatedly asking the expert\u2019s opinion on different collections of races, the gambler is able to extract many rules of thumb.", "In order to use these rules of thumb to maximum advantage, there are two problems faced by the gambler:", "First, how should he choose the collections of races presented to the expert so as to extract rules of thumb from the expert that will be the most useful?", "Second, once he has collected many rules of thumb, how can they be combined into a single, highly accurate prediction rule?", "Boosting refers to a general and provably effective method of producing a very accurate prediction rule by combining rough and moderately inaccurate rules of thumb in a manner similar to that suggested above.", "The above excerpt was taken from the famous paper: Intro to Boosting, and I couldn\u2019t have done a better job at introducing boosting to the uninitiated.", "However, this article assumes familiarity with boosting and will just try to explain the math behind AdaBoost, hopefully, in simple steps. The concepts, often simple and beautiful gets lost in mathematical jargon. I had faced the same challenges while understanding the math and this is an attempt to consolidate my understanding while helping others on a similar journey.", "Going back to the same paper, the steps of the AdaBoost Algorithm are stated as follows:", "Let\u2019s walk through this step by step:", "The first line is pretty simple to understand, still, for the sake of completeness, I will describe it. It tells that assume there are m observations like x\u2081, x\u2082, x\u2083 .. x\u2098 these set of observations is called X , while the target variable is given by y\u2081, y\u2082, y\u2083 .. y\u2098 belonging to Y, where the targets are called {-1,+1} depending on the class of the target {Win/Loss}, {Positive/Negative}, etc.", "In short, it describes the structure of the data set that we are feeding to the model.", "Next, we will assign a weight to each of the observation, the idea is that there are few observations which are easy to classify while there are others which are difficult to classify for the classifier algorithm. We will adjust the weights after every iteration such that the the algorithm is forced to take a harder look at these difficult to classify observations.", "But before going into all these, at the first iteration we have no clue as to which observations are difficult to classify and which ones are easy to classify so we will assign equal weight to each algorithm.", "This is literally the iterative part of the algorithm, it states that you will run the algorithm T times, you can specify this value while running AdaBoost.", "We know that we will run the loop T times, so what will we do in each loop?", "Let\u2019s take the first loop: we had X, we had D\u2081 and after training, we got our first weak learner h\u2081", "h\u2081 is used to predict the values of X, it will obviously make some mistakes. We will calculate the error terms from the prediction as below:", "Great, we now have the error term for h\u2081, this will be used for 2 things:", "What is \u03b1\u209c? It is nothing but the weight of the individual model/learner, in this case, h\u2081. In each of the T iterations we will have a learner h\u2081, h\u2082, h\u2083 .. h\u209c each of which will be combined to make the final model, the weight of each of these individual learners in the final output is given by \u03b1\u209c.", "Great now that we understand \u03b1\u209c we will calculate \u03b1\u2081.", "Notice that models with low error rate will have higher values of \u03b1\u209c and hence higher weight in the final output.", "Next, we will update the weights of individual observations, as stated earlier, points which were classified correctly will have lower weights compared to those which were not classified correctly:", "In case you are wondering what is Z\u209c, is is nothing but a way to ensure that D\u209c still adds up to 1", "This entire process is repeated T times resulting in the final model given by:", "As you can see the final model is a combination of T models each with its own weight combining together to give the final output. The weight of each individual model will be given by its corresponding \u03b1\u209c resulting in models with higher accuracy getting higher weights.", "To summarize what the model does:", "Hope this helped clear things up.
