(Source)", "One could argue that data science and machine learning projects are only of a research nature and it is therefore obvious that most of them will fail.", "Of course this is true, but how to structure the process of use case definition and validation to cut time and costs and increase the success rate? Building a prototype is usually a significant investment, requires effort and time and some of them are built for months\u2026 with an army of ML engineers onboard.", "Also, with COVID-19 restrictions in place some organizations struggle with remote collaboration and productivity (although some are proving to be even more effective than before!).", "Definitely there is no golden rule here and the process will differ between companies. However, this article aims to provide data science and ML professionals guidance and techniques that can help them to navigate between obstacles and enable them to launch a production solution that meets users\u2019 expectations and generates benefits for the company (revenue, effectiveness, agility).", "Regardless of how the process of use case validation is structured it will embed the following two main phases:", "\u25cf Ideation \u2014 use case definition and preparation for prototyping", "\u25cf Validation \u2014 building a prototype and measuring results", "Use case is a description/ an opportunity of how AI/ML may be applied to solve a particular problem.", "Everything starts with an idea and such ideas may come from various sources, sometimes even unusual ones. Perhaps a VP saw a post on LinkedIn and became inspired, a data scientist may have read an interesting paper or an ML engineer came across a new algorithm and wants to explore its potential.", "Oftentimes, use cases originate from product management, UX team or HW teams, who just prototyped a new sensor or who would like to bring an awesome new feature to a product.", "Each of the above examples may generate interesting use cases but at the same time may also only lead to spectacular and costly failure. For example, a frequent mistake is applying cool, complex deep learning algorithms (that require large amounts of data that is not available) to every problem, even those that could be successfully solved with heuristics or simple \u2018traditional\u2019 models.", "The best way to start is to organize a cross-team brainstorm session that includes not only your data science/ machine learning team but also other stakeholders from such teams as product management, user experience, hardware as well as any others who may contribute to use case definition and later validation.", "This mixture of different perspectives + creativity is the key to success!", "Data science is all about creativity and building meaningful solutions from bytes of data that make our world a better place!", "Creativity can be boosted by sending interesting examples of use cases (papers, videos etc.) to involved parties prior to the session.", "Foster research by studying the competition and their products, use cases from other industries and also applicable research papers.", "The current pandemic and need to collaborate remotely can also be a challenge. Be sure to focus on proper facilitation and provide ample opportunity for all participants to share their ideas and provide feedback.", "List all ideas that come up during the session. Select the 10 or so most interesting ones and have the team go over each one using the following list of questions to prioritize use cases and choose the most promising for prototyping:", "At this point, it is not necessary to be concerned with the absolute accuracy of the answers, as they are only rough estimates that support prioritization of use cases. The above list is only an example of important questions which can, of course, be adjusted/expanded to your specific needs.", "Nevertheless, keep it short and simple. Apply predefined answers where possible. Such answers can be used further to apply weights and implement a scoring algorithm.", "The final output from the above exercise should be three use cases shortlisted for the next phase.", "Select the most promising one (that will be prototyped first) in terms of tangible business benefits, impact on users and time to market to conduct a simplified feasibility study.", "The outcome should be a short summary outlining the scope of work for the next phase (validation) and cover at least the following 6 areas: 1) Goal, 2) Business opportunity, 3) Technology, 4) Validation approach, 5) Data, 6) Team, 7) Schedule, 8) Risks.", "Do not spend time on Proof of Concept since your main goal should not be to verify if it is feasible to build a solution from a technological perspective. The answer is always yes (ok, almost always\u2026). In most reasonable cases it comes down to a matter of data availability and choosing the right algorithms.", "However, your goal for validation is not only technical feasibility, but foremost building a prototype to assess potential impact, usefulness and benefits of the solution aimed for productization. Additionally, assess effort, resources, timeframe and risk associated with developing the ultimate solution.", "A few of my personal hints for rapid prototyping:", "Collaboration in case of distributed teams, especially in light of the current pandemic restrictions may be difficult since rapid prototyping is performed most efficiently in collocated teams. Nevertheless, there are many different technologies and techniques that you can apply, ranging from task management tools, Kanban boards, to catch ups via video and ad hoc messaging. I will not promote any specific tools here since each company uses their own suite of tools that may be applied effectively for the intended purpose.", "Obviously, our goal here is not to validate the model (this is still important) but to ensure that the prototype/demo built corresponds to the use case that we defined, has the potential to make an impact for users and is able to generate tangible business value.", "During this phase you should validate the prototype against quantitative and qualitative success criteria that you defined with the team & stakeholders prior to starting the project.", "Quantitative criteria can be an error threshold (MSE, recall or any other relevant ones) that the model has to achieve. It could also be a combination of different metrics related to performance of the model or prototype.", "The most challenging part is qualitative, where you cannot measure aspects such as value for users and benefits that the prototype may generate. Of course, you could run a focus group or usability study, however, such techniques require time and significant cost investment. Therefore, leave them for further phases and for the time being rely on your SMEs \u2014 UX and Product management\u2019s expert knowledge. Also engage other teams in your company, share the prototype and gather feedback.", "However, remember \u2014 in the end it is all about money\u2026", "If you want to convince your business stakeholders that your demo is valuable and may deliver financial profits you should perform a cost benefit analysis. List all direct, indirect and also intangible costs and benefits first, including those associated with performance increase and customer satisfaction. Apply monetary measurement to all positions, aggregate and compare. If you struggle to show benefits, work with your team to identify and quantify them.", "When should I start with the validation?", "The answer is \u2014 as soon as you start rapid prototyping. This should be a continual process that aims to validate usefulness of the use case.", "During rapid prototyping, communicate results to your stakeholders for buy-in and agreement of the next steps. This can be in the form of a short weekly meeting and/or daily update.", "Regardless of the output of validation \u2014 summarize findings.", "The summary can be a document or presentation and should include not only results but also aspects related to productization, such as identified issues and risks that need to be considered when moving to the next phase and developing the solution.", "A summary doc is also useful when the project is put on hold due to lack of capacity or other company priorities at that particular time. Such a summary may serve as a good starting point even for other similar use cases that are considered for development.", "If particular use case after validation is not planned for further development review your backlog and pick up the next one and kick off the prototyping again.", "In the end, you will never get to the point that all your use cases pass validation and are scheduled for productization.", "And frankly speaking, you should not expect them to. Why?", "Because prototyping and validation are part of research and are intended to ensure that only the most promising use cases are converted into solutions and to avoid failure.", "Hopefully, this article will provide you with some tried and proven tips and guidance on how to structure your use case definition, prototyping and validation process to maximize your success ratio. But as always, it is up to you, how you organize and apply these suggested guidelines within your own company and embed them within processes and tools already set in place.", "Thanks for reading.
