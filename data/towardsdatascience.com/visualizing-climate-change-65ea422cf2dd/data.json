In the last couple of weeks I\u2019ve updated the project to include more cities (nearly all of the top 100 US cities by population) and an interactive dashboard to illustrate the results. I\u2019m happy to announce that the results are now up at isclimatechangeabigdeal.com.", "In this post I\u2019ll walk through what the data is and what it means for climate change and go into a little bit of detail about how to create a dashboard. First, what is this data showing us?", "As I detailed in the first post, I pulled my data from NOAA which has detailed historical weather and climate data going back numerous years. I focused on two metrics, daily maximum temperature and daily minimum for a couple of reasons. For starters, given how many API requests are required to pull data for so many cities, it quickly becomes cumbersome to pull more than a few different measurements. Another issue is that not every metric is available for every city for the entire period observed. An arguably better temperature metric would be daily average temperature (given how temperature can change over the course of the day, this figure will not necessarily be the average of the day\u2019s maximum and minimum temperatures), but many cities don\u2019t have that figure aggregated on daily basis going back to the fifties.", "The current list of cities is almost identical to Wikipedia\u2019s List of United States Cities by Population with a handful of exceptions. Some cities on Wikipedia don\u2019t have NOAA ids, I suspect because they are too close to larger metropolitan areas. Aurora, Colorado, for instance, is part of the larger Denver statistical area, which may explain why it doesn\u2019t appear to have separately stored metrics. Ditto for Chula Vista and San Diego, and possibly for Henderson and Las Vegas. Omaha, Nebraska, is unfortunately also missing \u2014 it seems that one or both of the metrics I looked at is incomplete in the NOAA database and some of my api requests returned empty results. My apologies to the good people of Omaha! I\u2019m looking for a good alternate source of data.", "I currently have the data aggregated in three ways: by taking year by year averages for the daily maximum and daily minimum, and also by counting the number of days each year where the daily maximum was over 90 degrees. These are in some ways blunt tools to use; for one thing, in some areas climate change may manifest in more complicated ways than simply all the temperatures going up or down. Still, I think larger trends are likely to be reasonably well represented with the average metrics.", "Another issue I came across is how sensitive to make the number of days above 90 degrees metric. NOAA provides numbers for each measuring station and many of the cities surveyed have multiple stations. The different stations don\u2019t always have the same daily max and min values \u2014 which makes sense given how large a footprint some of the cities have. I needed to make a decision on how to aggregate up the numbers for each city that had multiple measuring stations and I opted for simply averaging the values for each station together. As a result, if some stations have maximum values above 90 one day, but others don\u2019t and the average between all the stations doesn\u2019t quite breach 90, that day won\u2019t be counted towards the number of days above 90 for that city. As a result, my numbers might not match other sources for this value elsewhere exactly \u2014 other people could make the metric more or less sensitive by counting every day where at least one station was over 90 or requiring that all stations register above 90.", "The last piece of the dashboard on the right hand side compares the metric you\u2019ve selected over the last 10 years compared to the average over the last half of the 20th century. On the default page you\u2019ll see for instance that the average daily maximum temperature in New York was 1.25 degrees higher over the last ten years compared to the period 1950\u20132000. Of course, as you\u2019ll clearly see in the graph, these metrics tend to bounce around a bit year to year, so differences between samples of years might very well be attributable to the randomness of the sample. To account for this, I also perform a statistical test comparing the two averages and show the results as odds. These odds are all rounded down to a sensible whole number.", "What does the data say about climate change?", "I encourage you to simply play around with the dashboard yourself to see if your hometown (or the nearest large city to your hometown) has seen a significant change in temperature. In my exploration, a couple of trends are definitely visible:", "1. Effects of climate change vary significantly from place to place.", "Between different cities or different areas of the country, trends look very different. In some cities, the trend looks clear and significant. Consider Santa Ana, contending with average daily maximum temperatures that are 2.5 degrees hotter now than in the 20th century (and daily minimums that are more than 4 degrees higher):", "By contrast, Toledo doesn\u2019t seem to have much of a trend. The average daily maximum temperature is up about 0.6 degrees, but that difference is very small compared to the year to year variance.", "A handful of cities even saw average daily maximum temperatures come down a little bit, but\u2026", "2. The overall trend tilts towards warming", "If the only differences we observed were due to random sampling, then you would expect about half the cities to appear to have warmed and the other half to look cooler. This isn\u2019t the case. Most cities saw some sort of warming. Out of the 86 cities visualized here, only 5 saw their average daily maximum temperatures lower in the last decade than during the last half of the 20th century. If you live in a city like Denver, you haven\u2019t had to worry so much about extreme heat, what with the average daily maximum temperature being about 1 degree lower in the last decade than during the previous period:", "Does this mean the residents of Denver can rest easy knowing that climate change poses no threat to them? Not quite\u2026", "3. Different metrics reveal different trends", "If you compare the different metrics available, you\u2019ll sometimes notice very different sorts of effects. Denver saw average daily maximums coming down recently, but if you look at the daily minimums you see the opposite effect. Daily minimum temperatures were more than 1.5 degrees higher in the last decade than before:", "What is going on here? Well, daily minimum temperatures have risen more than daily maximum temperatures. Weather and climate are complicated systems and different aspects of the climate change in different ways. Perhaps the maximum temperature in a given area is more directly dependent on total solar irradiance and is more affected by things like local cloud cover, while the daily minimum is driven by atmospheric effects and may go up relative to prior periods even if clouds prevent the daily highs from going up that much.", "All this is to say is to say that Denver isn\u2019t quite off the hook yet. Denver is likely experiencing the effects of a changing climate in a way that isn\u2019t as simple as daily highs going up, but no less significant.", "Building an interactive dashboard like this is not so complicated in python with tools like Plotly and Dash. Plotly is a pretty powerful graphing tool that makes interactive and pretty attractive graphs with minimal extra coding. All of the above temperature plots were made with only a couple of lines of code like this:", "The basic thing to understand about how Plotly works is that it takes in data and layout information in two separate objects. In my above example, data is a list of plotly graph objects, one graph object for each element in the chart being graphed. I had two lines (the metric and the rolling average), so I need a list with two graph objects. These are made with series or lists for x and y data plus a specified type of graph \u2014 in this case line. Other layout information live in the layout object (in this case I only have a chart title included). Plotly creates an interactive html object for, but will conveniently save down a static .png if you need one.", "The code for the overall app is a little more complicated. Dash does, however let you adjust the html layout of a page in python and put in interactive elements. A simple version of the app, with just one city and only one drop down to choose metric could be achieved with this code:", "Dash lets you add in elements to the page and control the underlying html from python, using lists and dictionaries. Dash also conveniently has it\u2019s own set of objects for interactive features, things like the drop-down menu I use, or sliders or text input boxes. The key thing is to properly link the input with the element you want it to effect. In a more complicated page this might mean juggling multiple callbacks and element ids.", "Hopefully this inspires to build your interactive dashboard and, possibly, stop the coming climate apocalypse.", "Your home for data science.
