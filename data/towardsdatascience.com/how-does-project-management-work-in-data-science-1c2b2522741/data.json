Why is this?", "Data science projects traditionally involve a long exploration phase and many unknowns even quite late into a project. This is different from traditional software development, where it is possible to enumerate and quantify tasks at the outset. A software project manager may often define the duration and final result of the project before a line of code has been written.", "The best known traditional project management approaches are", "I believe the major problem of all of these approaches is that data science projects are highly unpredictable and subject to change. Unfortunately, it is often not even possible to predict what can be achieved in a data science project until considerable effort has already been invested.", "I would recommend not to decide on a project structure at all until after the initial exploration phase of a week.", "Then I would suggest to decide what the business needs:", "The key is flexibility, that these requirements may change later on.", "Let\u2019s take an example: a project to deploy a predictive model. Let\u2019s assume that the commercials and buy-in from the stakeholder are already in place.Imagine that a hypothetical business wants a predictive model to predict which products its customers will buy.", "The project might proceed with the following approximate phases:", "Apart from the final deployment phase, I would suggest that all stages of the project should be quite flexibly defined.", "In particular, if you think a task should take 1 month when you first try to quantify it, in practice it will often take 2 months because of all the unknown snags that are likely to appear. Surprises can occur at any point in the project and all have the effect of lengthening rather than shortening the total duration.", "The flip side of this flexibility is that regular meetings, emails and communication with the stakeholder are essential to ensure both that the business is kept up to date on the project progress, and the data scientists receive everything they need (data, access through security, co-operation from the relevant departments of the business, etc).", "The key is in the name: data science. Science involves defining a hypothesis and testing it, and data science involves an iterative process of trying, failing, and improving. Attempts to shoehorn it into project management techniques of other disciplines end in frustration and increase the probability of the project failing or being abandoned.", "I do not want to suggest not to use Agile or Waterfall methodologies at all. In fact, they may be essential especially when you have to scale a data science team. However, any project management approach that is taken should be used only as a guideline but not strictly adhered to.", "Your home for data science.
