Because what\u2019s a better way to spend your time than adding another personal project to your GitHub repo ;)", "And so, I give you 12 data science projects for 12 days of Christmas! Each one can be finished in a day and each will guarantee to teach you valuable and applicable skills.", "With that said, let\u2019s dive into it:", "Building simulations are not only really cool, but quite relevant with the pandemic! Not only are Python simulations very beneficial to your coding fluency and your understanding of data science, but they are also fun and addictive to play around with.", "There are a myriad of scenarios and factors you can simulate, often with less than a couple hundred lines of code. For example, I have an article about simulating a basic pandemic and predicting population control, both of which have code which you\u2019re free to see!", "Difficulty: Anywhere from trivial to super complex!", "Although it is interesting to simulate the spread of disease or social dynamics, we can find uses of data science and programming in business, too.", "Forecasting sales for holidays, like Christmas, is incredibly important for determining how much to produce. Too much and there\u2019s stale inventory. Too little and you\u2019ve lost out on potential revenue.", "Below are several resources for you to learn and practice retail sales forecasting.", "In a similar vein, let\u2019s bring together science and business to improve our data science skills with a crucial, real life scenario. In the past nine months, Covid-19 has hugely changed the way we live our lives \u2014 particularly it has had a massive impact on worldwide travel. With the dataset below, explore the data, create visualizations, and even see if you can create a prediction model for airport traffic.", "If you already use Tweetdeck, this project is for you! Tweetdeck is a tool for Twitter that allows you to track your Twitter engagement and a variety of insights in real time. Using the Twitter API and a visualization tool like Dash or Streamlit, you can create a simple web application to create your own analytics platform for Twitter!", "Arguably one of the most practical data science concepts in the workplace is A/B Testing. And yet, it is a concept that is quite misunderstood because there are a lot of intricacies to it.", "More specifically, determining click-through rates is an extremely metric for any company with a marketing team. By properly measuring click-through rates, you can optimize the appearance, the messaging, and anything else related to your online advertisements.", "The recommendation algorithms used by modern social media platforms and content aggregators are extremely complex and constantly developing. What\u2019s a better way to understand how they work and improve themselves by building one yourself?", "Learning how to webscrape data is simple to learn and extremely useful! Scraping a customer review website, like Trustpilot, is valuable for a company as it allows them to understand review trends (getting better or worse) and see what customers are saying via NLP.", "What do you know, we\u2019ve come full circle back to our challenge on retail analytics! But in this problem, however, the goal is to use statistics to cluster customers into similar groups so that you can identified desired customer segments that you want to market your business to!", "This dataset is composed of power consumption data from PJM\u2019s website. PJM is a regional transmission organization in the United States. Using this dataset, see if you can build a time series model to predict energy consumption. In addition to that, see if you can find trends around hours of the day, holiday energy usage, and long term trends!", "What if you want to predict whether Tesla stocks will shoot to the mooooon. With time series forecasting, you can try to predict the trajectory of a stock. To make it easier, you can use Facebook\u2019s time-series library called Prophet, which does a lot of the heavy lifting for you.", "Do you have some pictures you want to post to Instagram, but you are not sure which one will get you the most likes or comments? Well, data science can help you with that! You can create a predictive model based around various factors, such as the hashtags you use, the length of your post description, the number of pictures in a carousel, and throw it all together. From there you can test your ideas against this model, observe the outputs, and find the image format that is most likely to get you the most likes! This is a great project to work on if you are interested in machine learning, too.", "The last topic that I wanted to leave a little more open-ended is creating a resume-job description matcher. By using NLP techniques like latent semantic analysis, see if you can determine how close a resume matches a job description.", "Well, I hope you enjoyed this article about the twelve best data science projects that you can complete in a day or less, to keep you occupied over the winter holidays! If you were inspired by any of these, I strongly recommend that you attempt at least one.", "Not sure what to read next? I\u2019ve picked another article for you:", "Your home for data science.
