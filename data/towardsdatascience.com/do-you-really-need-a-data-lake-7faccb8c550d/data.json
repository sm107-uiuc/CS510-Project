This buzz around data lakes has misled organisations into designing ones that created no real value to the business. Furthermore, the horror stories about data swamps have only encouraged scepticism over the years. If you are debating over the necessity of a data lake to strengthen your data strategy, this article will shed some light so you can make the call.", "It is a common problem with most organisations dealing with a wide variety of data sources. Lack of a centralised data store for analytical workloads force data consumers to create localised systems, often restricted to a few users for reporting and analysis. Several non-standardised processes eventually lead to the creation of data silos which potentially snowball into major concerns with data access, consistency and accuracy.", "A data lake architecture can centralise data over distributed storage providing a scalable, fast, secure and economical solution. This, coupled with robust data governance can eventually resolve issues with data silos and democratize data within an organisation. These solutions can be deployed on-premise, in the cloud and even on hybrid infrastructures.", "Database Management systems need more computing power with data growth, which lead to many design decisions like partitioning and scaling-out that further inflate expenses. When costs keep rising, IT start archiving the data either as compressed database backups into cheaper storage or flat files or in most cases end up deleting them. Archiving data or deleting them to keep expenses down might prove detrimental to data monetization opportunities.", "A data lake architecture can be designed to enforce data retention policies that can ease out the pressure of keeping data growth at check. With cheap, tiered storage, you can comfortably apply well-planned retention policies and store huge amount of data without bleeding your budget and greatly reducing the overhead of orchestration.", "If you are using relational databases and the schema of your source data keeps changing, you are either overlooking the ongoing changes and potentially missing valuable information, or you are spending resources in adjusting your databases to the source schema. Either way, you are not winning.", "A data lake allows storage of raw data (structured/unstructured/semi-structured) without running any upfront ETL processes. You don\u2019t lose ongoing changes in the data and also save expenses in adjusting your database table structure, ETL pipeline, etc. Rather than defining the structure of the data while storing it, you (or consumers) can define the structure while reading it (check schema-on-read) making it possible for authorized consumers to read the data whichever way they prefer. Win-win.", "Not everyone in your organisation would like to consume the data in one particular shape or cut. Some consumers need the cleaned, structured and necessary data in relational form aligned to their departmental needs, some would need the raw data to run machine learning experiments, some consumers would fall in restricted categories and consume masked data. It becomes cumbersome (and expensive) to address these requirements in the traditional platforms.", "Once you store the raw data in the data lake, you can create logical views into the data so users consume the data in the form they want. You could even create processes to store a structured form of the data into a data warehouse and push data to external consumers applying anonymisation rules.", "There are many myths about the data lake and it is important you understand some facts before making a decision.", "Data lakes do have huge benefits and can be an attractive proposition for many organisations keen on laying out a data strategy. You have to scrutinize whether it will solve your business problems, integrate well with other technology platforms in your organisation, and actually create real value for the business. It is crucial to make good design decisions and ensure data governance rules are established across the organisation for the use of data lakes. Above all, it is the people who can make this successful, you will have to support and develop the right skills and encourage a data-driven culture.", "Your home for data science.
