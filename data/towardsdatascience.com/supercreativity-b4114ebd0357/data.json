Our experience of art \u2014 painting, music, sculpture, poetry \u2014 taps into multiple senses, associations, memories and emotions, and involves what one may call a conscious component. Artificial Intelligence (AI) today lacks subjective experience and multimodality but is starting to acquire artistic creativity. Does creativity require the capacity of conscious experience? We assert that the answer is no. Specialized AI may soon become more creative than humans and better at capturing and representing collective experiences, as multimodality, supervised learning and collaboration with humans will significantly enhance today\u2019s creative bots. Much of art is about recognizing and manipulating complex sensory patterns and associations, a task in which AI excels; thus, supercreativity \u2014 creative processes and outcomes that far surpass human abilities \u2014 may be around the corner.", "\u201cOh, there\u2019s no question about it. Yes, yes, a million times yes. Creativity is simple; consciousness, intelligence, those are hard.\u201d David Cope", "Our experience of art encompasses multiple senses, associations, memories and emotions. It taps into conscious as well as other-than-conscious processes. Imagine for a moment listening to your favorite music: every melodic motif, harmonic succession and rhythm has subtle associations with distinct emotions such as excitement, serenity, nostalgia, playfulness and so on. Images, scenes, or streams of thoughts inspired by the music jump into and out of your mind. Relations to historical events and cultural references may spring to mind. Music is highly suggestive and alters the emotional interpretation of an accompanying experience. Filmmakers know this well and use suitable soundtracks to manipulate your emotional reaction to each scene. Similarly, paintings, sculptures, stories and poems elicit emotions, memories and other-sensory associations. It is fair to say that art incapable of eliciting multi-sensory emotional experiences and rich associations is not good art.", "What is not clear is the degree to which human-level ability to experience art is required to create art. Can AI create art on par with human composers or painters despite lacking the ability to experience art, and reality, like humans do? Growing empirical evidence, especially in painting and music, suggest that artistic creativity may not require the capacity for subjective experience but instead be learnable by AI from human-created art and feedback. We believe that as AI becomes better at patterns and associations learning, and as it receives more feedback from people, it will create art capable of eliciting increasingly rich multi-sensory and emotional human experiences with increasingly complex associations: namely, increasingly better art, possibly moving beyond art created by humans.", "Artistic creativity may not require the capacity of subjective experience", "Technology has always enabled human creativity: compare paintings made with primitive tools in prehistoric caves with those made with brushes and rich colors centuries later, or consider the invention of the piano or the development of cinema, known as \u201cthe seventh art\u201d. Emerging collaborations between humans and machines are poised to become the next technological leap in art and produce artwork that we never experienced before.", "Application of deep learning has produced paintings of undeniable artistic quality either as imitations of style of human painters \u2014 whereby style transfer through convolutional neural networks encodes patterns associated with the style of masters in terms of low-level brush strokes all the way to space perception and composition \u2014 or original work \u2014 where generative adversarial networks (GANs) generate realistic paintings such as portraits or abstract nudes. The first AI painting to be auctioned, generated using a GAN originally developed by 19 year old Stanford researcher Robbie Barrat, sold for $432,500 at Christie\u2019s. Artists like Barrat and Mario Klingemann still make most of the creative choices such as curating inputs, training the AI and selecting best resulting art. However, AI-based art is often hard to tell from human art and increasingly independent AI painters are likely around the corner.", "In music, the pioneering work of David Cope, composer and professor of music at UCSC, far predates modern deep learning. Since 1981, Cope has been working on distilling the essence of musical composition in algorithms that are fed music of a given composer, deconstruct it, identify patterns, and recombine the patterns in new compositions in the same style. His first major success, Emmy (or EMI, Experiments in Musical Intelligence, as discussed in Yuval Harari\u2019s \u201cHomo Deus\u201d) generates convincing music in the styles of Bach, Vivaldi, Chopin and others, and fooled a live audience as early as 1997. More recently, Sony\u2019s Flow Machines generate highly listenable songs (listen for example to Daddy\u2019s Car, Mr Shadow, or A Mon Sujet \u2014 would you be able to tell they are generated by AI?), while startups Aiva and Amper develop deep learning methods for generating music on demand and may soon enable personalized music. In the near future, even if a human musician composes the main musical theme and song progression around certain lyrics, the entire orchestration and composition of accompaniment is a challenging and laborious process likely to be taken over by AI. As we learn how to better design such human-computer collaborations we are likely to enhance both human and AI creativity.", "Even poetry may be possible without human-level experience: already, bots that generate artful haikus have emerged, and because the quality of the poem partly derives from the beauty and rhythm of the language \u2014 which may be learnable \u2014 and partly from the meaning that the reader ascribes to it, poetry bots have fooled literary journals as early as 2010. If you think you can tell human from bot poetry, you are welcome to challenge yourself in Bot or Not.", "Beyond music, painting, and poetry, applications of AI in many other art forms and creative tasks and AI tools for generating art are starting to emerge. An innovative team out of MIT is set to demonstrate that collaboration between humans and AI can generate new art and crafts that humans alone could not conceive of: music, products and product designs, fashion, perfumes, chocolate truffles, jewelry, cocktails and theater plays. Stanford lecturer and Volvo Group artist-in-residence Pamela Davis Kivelson innovatively combines art forms including photography, AI painting with style transfer, portrait videos and even AI poetry in performances and projects with technological themes from events unfolding in Silicon Valley. According to her, \u201cAI art has allowed me to [[\u2026]] create a novel visual language based on NLI or the \u2018Non Linear Identity\u2019. [[\u2026]] a physicist could literally be represented morphing into a group of electrons in a Fermi Liquid or quantum tunneling or being a qubit. I want to re-envision the portrait \u2014 to challenge our collective unconscious biases and inferences. These hidden biases influence our behavior.\u201d", "In Stanislav Lem\u2019s 1965 sci-fi novel Cyberiad, the \u201cconstructor\u201d Trurl sets to develop a poetry machine and realizes that a poet\u2019s mind encompasses all the experience of the poet\u2019s civilization and culture. To program all that into the machine, Trurl builds a supercomputer that can simulate the entire universe\u2019s evolution all the way up to the birth and cultural upbringing of poets. His resulting AI poet is genius; human poets first dismiss it, but ultimately commit mass suicide having lost their main purpose in life. Trurl\u2019s engineering path to artificial creativity is somewhat unrealistic; the emerging practical paths sidestep rather than replicate the human creative process.", "So, how creative can specialized AI become, assuming that Artificial General Intelligence is still in the distant future? There is a lot of room for improvement of specialized AI along three underexplored paths: training, multimodality and human-AI collaboration.", "Continuous feedback and training. To date, AI advances in painting and music have not leveraged much human feedback. By contrast, as a human artist experiences art, she is an instant \u2014 albeit biased \u2014 critic of her work. Machines may not have their own subjective experience to guide them, but they can leverage human experience through human-generated training data and feedback \u2014 for example through rating or clicking \u201chearts\u201d (in Periscope style) as a musical score or painting sketch progresses. Feedback from many artists \u2014 or art critics, or the general public \u2014 may be better than the subjective experience of one artist. Moreover, such a feedback process may enable the emergence of new art styles, communities, and avant-garde work.", "Multimodality and associations learning. It is the complex multimodal feelings and associations we experience when we listen to our favorite tunes, or are immersed in a painting, which elevate us in a mental world of images, memories, interpretations, analytical thoughts, historical and cultural connections, and sensory-motor experiences that we attribute to the highest forms of art.", "\u201cPainting is poetry that is seen rather than felt, and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen.\u201d Leonardo da Vinci", "Can AI create music of \u201cscale and intimacy, heightened [\u2026] colors, and sensuous objectivity\u201d? Can it create music, paintings, poems, and literature in ways that may influence each other much like Lera Auerbach, a musician, painter, sculptor, librettist, poet and writer? How can we teach AI associations across modalities, art forms, events and social trends?", "Vast amounts of training data exist already: movies with soundtracks, songs with lyrics, reviews of paintings, music albums, movies and performances. Supplementing these, crowdsourcing activities can be designed for large-scale multimodal association labeling. Picking soundtracks while reading a book, navigating wordnets while listening to music, selecting images that best match a given tune, recalling events when listening to music or viewing a painting, linking current or past events or news articles to specific artworks. The resulting conceptual networks can be highly personalizable and reflect cultural and generational associations with important historic value \u2014 much like artists\u2019 works. Such networks will also have enormous business value \u2014 for example, music producers may develop music based on trending Netflix series, and product designers can develop innovations inspired by topical trends and cultures.", "With large-scale training and multimodal association maps, AI may also learn to accurately predict human sensual and emotional reactions to art and far surpass human capacity in creating immersive works of music, painting, poetry, and multimodal experiences.", "Human-AI collaboration. The pioneering work to date on human-AI art collaboration will be expanded when large-scale training and multimodal associations learning are deployed. Crowdsourced music may involve an artist composing a basic tune and AI improving and orchestrating it with online feedback. Simultaneously, a learned multimodal map may be traversed across art forms and experiences by, for instance, people recommending accompanying images and those images in turn influencing development of a musical score. Similar feedback loops can enable collaboration of groups of people with AI in almost any art form \u2014 even literature as AI is quickly acquiring the ability to produce human-like text.", "New collaboration processes between humans and machines are poised to catalyze the development of new AI capabilities and eventually boost the creativity of both humans and machines. Kivelson envisions \u201ca future where collective creative AI expands our global connections and redefines the nature of the studio practice while challenging identity politics and expanding our free and open access to new ideas\u201d.", "AI-generate art may become the most effective mirror of society, potentially redefining our concept of identity", "Moreover, much like human art often derives value from its historical and societal context, AI-generated art can combine input from groups of people, other artworks and contextual information and potentially become the most effective mirror of society, capturing our collective experiences and potentially redefining our concept of identity.", "Finally, AI can surpass limitations that human nature imposes on creativity. Consider a fugue. The six-voice ricercare from \u201cThe Musical Offering\u201d by Johannn Sebastian Bach has claim to the title of being the finest composition ever and is an exceedingly complex piece. Why is it challenging to compose a musically effective fugue with more than six voices? Human composers are physically limited to only ten fingers with which to play the keyboard and a working memory incapable of holding more than four to seven independent items (at best). Human painters, sculptors and poets are similarly limited. Machines do not have such limitations, and as a result may push the boundaries of art far beyond where humans can reach.", "When we enjoy art we engage neural machinery absent in today\u2019s AI: a complex emotional system linking our brain and neuroendocrine systems that release hormones controlling how we feel and act; physical sensory bindings such as goosebumps, euphoria, changes in heartbeat and breathing; memories of personal experiences or historical events that bridge sensory and conceptual associations. Many agree that art requires embodiment. Kivelson says \u201cA dancer feels the movement in a specific set of places in their body. When we watch them dance we feel their emotions expressed viscerally [[\u2026]] New forms of creativity will emerge using AI art as our collective embodied creative intelligence develops.\u201d", "Leaving the hard problem of consciousness for a future discussion, without this embodiment machinery today\u2019s AI entirely lacks our subjective experience of art even as it acquires creativity. Essentially, creativity is being decoupled from the consciousness required to give feedback to the creative process: Trurl\u2019s AI poet is outsourcing conscious experience to humans by ingesting their works of art and feedback. It taps into the collective consciousness of humanity.", "Furthermore, the computational artists of the near future will create art in order to optimize a prespecified function such as the level of immersion of the experiencer, and not in order to fulfill a (non-existent) desire to express its inner world. The creative drive of AI will be entirely different from that of a human artist. Which points to a clear distinction between conscious experience-driven creativity and mimicry. Much like animal mimicry, AI will learn patterns that elicit a desired sensory-emotional response in humans, without acquiring embodiment and conscious subjective experience.", "Could we devise a test \u2014 adversarial process \u2014 that distinguishes between human-generated and computer-generated art? If the AI fully passes such a Turing-like test, then perfect mimicry of the human artist by non-conscious AI is possible and creativity does not require the ability to experience and feel.", "Creative AI will be a powerful tool \u2014 a new microscope \u2014 for making quantitative measurements on human creativity and immersive experience", "Creative AI will be a powerful tool \u2014 a new microscope -for making quantitative measurements on human creativity and immersive experience. It can help us answer elusive questions such as what affects human creativity, what affects our experience of art, and how aspects of a creative piece modify the levels of mental and psychological responses of the experiencer. As we better understand these questions, we may also make progress in what today appears to be a distant goal: can the future AI+crowd supercreative entity possess a conscious experience of its own, and how can we engineer it and in the process possibly understand what human consciousness is?", "Specifically, what human neural processes need to be replicated so that computers, despite their different physical composition, attain the human ability to experience art? After all, subjective experience of art is precisely the goal of art. We do not yet understand the physical processes or sets of computations that result in conscious experience: theories range from \u201cconsciousness is an illusion\u201d to \u201ceverything is conscious\u201d to everything in-between, such as physics-based theories (\u201cconsciousness is a state of matter\u201d, \u201cconsciousness arises from the collapse of the quantum wave function\u201d) that make a distinction between the computational I/O and the subjective experience, and also postulate the potential importance of the physical substrate of computation. This makes sense: there is more to conscious experience than computational I/O as the example of a capable AI artist with no machinery for conscious experience demonstrates; and there is no evidence that computation can be conscious independent of the physical substrate just like there is no evidence that a soul exists independent of matter.", "Creative AI may be a next milestone towards Artificial General Intelligence that fuels engineering of multimodality and associations learning and development of effective human-AI collaboration processes", "Much like chess, Go, and image recognition proved important challenges leading to advances in specialized AI, creative AI may be a next milestone towards Artificial General Intelligence that fuels engineering of multimodality and associations learning as well as development of effective human-AI collaboration processes. As Sebastian Thrun puts it, \u201cwe have not even begun to understand how creative AI will become. If you take all the world\u2019s knowledge and creativity and put it into a bottle, you will be amazed by what will come out of it\u201d.", "We thank Kate Batz, Lilia Evgeniou, Volodymyr Kuleshov, Patrick Siegler Lathrop, Nick Nassuphis and Sebastian Thrun for feedback and edits, and Mario Klingemann for permission to display his work.
