That is, if a global pandemic is not ravaging outside, you don\u2019t have children to homeschool, elderly people do look after, and you\u2019re not facing an economic downturn that is leaving millions of people jobless \u2014 including you, possibly.", "If this is making you feel like you\u2019re looking down the barrel, you\u2019re not alone. In order to survive the crisis, hundreds of tech companies are doing mass layoffs, including dozens of startups in Silicon Valley alone.", "And that\u2019s a golden opportunity for you.", "As most companies are laying off their beloved employees, others are starting to binge-hire. Think Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Google.", "The theory is simple: Thousands of talented Data Scientists who previously worked elsewhere are suddenly available. That means high supply and low competition on the job market.", "So from the point of view of a big tech company, they can hire lots of people with low acquisition costs \u2014 plus, those people might even be okay with a lower salary and a smaller benefits package than they\u2019d usually be offered. Because it\u2019s still better than being jobless.", "If you want to land a Data Science job at your dream company, the time is now. But you can\u2019t sit back and let it happen on its own. You\u2019ll have to put in some work to get yourself noticed. To show that you\u2019re talented, willing and able to take the opportunity. Here\u2019s how.", "It\u2019s the one platform for job search. Sure, you can pimp your other social media, too \u2014 and you should. But your first priority is to get a killer deck on LinkedIn.", "Even though the platform is designed quite intuitively, I recommend following LinkedIn\u2019s guide to get everything right.", "Try to fill in every profile section. Add a background photo, add some skills and follow notable people in your industry. Join some relevant groups as well.", "Also, there\u2019s no way around adding a profile photo. Yes, you always look stupid on photos. And seeing your own image in the corner feels awkward. I get it. But do it anyway. A bad photo on which you look ugly is still better than no photo at all. And you can always replace the photo once you have a better one.", "Try to tell a story with your profile. Think about a cool headline: \u201cData Scientist at company XYZ\u201d is boring. How about this: \u201cUnlocking the secrets of data for company XYZ\u201d. Much better! Try to come up with headlines and descriptions that don\u2019t reflect what you do, but who you are.", "The average recruiter spends seven seconds on your CV. Yup, you heard me right. Seven.", "So make those seven seconds count. What will another person see in seven seconds? What message can your CV convey in that time?", "I make mine stand out with lots of visual elements, color contrasts and a clear message. I want a recruiter to know that I put some thought into this, that I\u2019m bold and that I know who I am. This is a recent CV of mine:", "Note that I\u2019ve used some visual language with stars, other symbols and timelines. I\u2019ve also added the same profile photo that I use everywhere \u2014 that\u2019s personal branding 101. Feel free to copy any of my tricks.", "Granted, you\u2019ll hardly manage to get such a design with a standard word file. I used Adobe Illustrator to make this CV. You could also use Figma, which works great and costs less. You\u2019ll be fiddling around with graphic details for a few hours, but it\u2019s worth it. Really.", "Sending out applications is time-consuming at best and anxiety-provoking at worst. But now that you\u2019ve made a kick-ass CV, it\u2019s time to show the world what you got!", "Whether you\u2019re fearing that you\u2019ll lose your job, or you\u2019ve lost it already \u2014 it\u2019s horrible when you\u2019ve just sent of two dozen applications and then fear that you won\u2019t get a single answer for two weeks. I\u2019ve been there.", "But the best way to master an uncomfortable activity is doing it regularly. There\u2019s no harm in sending out applications even if you have a secure job. You can always withdraw it. And even in that case, you can make valuable connections for years to come.", "And if your job is not so secure, what do you have to lose? For the time being, plan to send out five applications each week. Or however many you might need. Focus on quality, though. And also apply for jobs that you don\u2019t feel one hundred percent qualified for. The worst answer you can get is no.", "Your network is your net worth.", "Think about how you got your last job. Was it a cold application and a few interviews? Or did you know someone who knew someone else who gave you a nice intro to your now-employer?", "If it\u2019s the latter, welcome to the way most people get their jobs. Especially the good jobs. It\u2019s about networking, man!", "If you want a great job, you need to get to know people. How do you find them? Through events, meetups, conferences and all that stuff.", "But right now we\u2019re all stuck at home with no real-life events in sight. Bad news? That\u2019s great news, because it means you can save bigly on travel costs! Link up on virtual meetups instead.", "Of course, the inperson-postconference-buffet-chitchat with the speaker and the other participants won\u2019t be possible. But you can make yourself noticed by posing smart questions or doing a contribution yourself.", "Send private messages \u2014 as you can do on Zoom or Skype \u2014 to the speaker or any participant whose profile you find interesting. Tell them how much you value their talk or their profile.", "It may seem awkward at first and you\u2019ll wonder what they think of you. So don\u2019t spam, and be respectful. If you follow that, more people will respond to you than you imagined.", "Whether you have a job or not, whether you have enough cash in the bank or not \u2014 do gigs!", "Even if they\u2019re badly paid or bring no money at all. Even if you only landed them by chance on Upwork or Fiverr. Even if your mom or your neighbor was just asking you for a favor.", "The goal of this is not to load yourself up with work and hustle yourself to the ground. Instead, gigs are an excellent opportunity to connect with new people and showcase your work.", "Before I landed my current position, I worked for free for two full years. Then I interned for another whole year with a pay that didn\u2019t cover half my expenses. I did other gigs here and there to make ends meet. It wasn\u2019t easy, but it landed me where I am today.", "And even now that I have a pretty safe position, I carry on doing gigs. Paid or unpaid doesn\u2019t matter much. Each time I view it as an opportunity to add people to a network that at some point will be bullet-proof.", "The point in gigs is to get to know people. The more people you know, the higher the chance that someone will give you a paycheck. And recommend you to other people who will give you a bigger one.", "Don\u2019t wait for people to ask you for your opinion. Give it to them.", "Writing stuff is perhaps the greatest opportunity to build your personal brand. People will learn how you express yourself, how you think and what\u2019s important to you.", "Also, a nice heap of writing will allow people to browse your portfolio and take a plunge into your world. Remember the seven seconds that people spend on your CV? Try to write so much \u2014 and so good \u2014 content that a recruiter will want to spend seven hours on your profile.", "I chose Medium as a platform not only because it\u2019s paid, but also because I like the community. Every time I hit publish, something great happens. Someone leaves a really inspiring comment. A stranger with an amazing profile connects with me on LinkedIn. A celebrity joins my small but growing following on Twitter. Every time I hit publish, I grow my network.", "Your network is your net worth. Every word you write grows it a little more.", "Maybe you\u2019re not impressed with your writing skills. I wasn\u2019t impressed with mine when I started on Medium. That\u2019s okay!", "You can start with small steps. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with full-length writing, maybe you enjoy tweeting. Aim to make two tweets a day about whatever is interesting to you.", "Your aim is consistency, not perfection. You won\u2019t write a glittery novel or a viral tweet in one day. You won\u2019t connect with Bill Gates or LeBron James in one day either. You probably won\u2019t in your lifetime.", "But if you keep at it, you\u2019ll make connections and produce work that you\u2019re truly proud of. And, best of all, that lands you a job.", "The world is falling apart, but it\u2019s not the end of the world.", "Nobody said that this was going to be easy. But despite all the misery and the tragedy, in this unprecedented crisis lie unprecedented opportunities.", "The Big Four are binge-hiring, just like every other firm that can afford it.", "Whether you\u2019ve lost your job, or you think you might lose it, or you have a safe job but think you could need an upgrade \u2014 these firms are searching for you. So get yourself noticed!", "Your home for data science.
