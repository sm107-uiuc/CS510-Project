In this article, I am going to share my first ever software development/programming encounter. This was the project that we had to complete during the first semester in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at my undergrad university (University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka).", "This was indeed a very challenging exercise given that I very poor knowledge of JAVA (which I did the project in). Choice of programming language was free, however, JAVA was my go-to-choice since it seemed easy compared to C/C++. Moreover, NetBeans being was an easy to use GUI development tool. I believe these naive choices may have helped apprentice myself to master programming with much less effort. I must thank Dr. (Mrs.) Surangika Ranathunga (sole course convenor/lecturer) for injecting such a huge amount of knowledge to many new students in just 4 months (1 Semester). It was difficult but the outcome was amazing. Anything that comes helpful out of this article must reflect her capability of lecturing and mentoring newbies. Let\u2019s go through the project!", "The objective is to develop a spreadsheet program with basic data types, cell referencing and ability to tokenize cell content into datatypes. The complete implementation must follow OOP concepts (Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation and Polymorphism) whereas applicable.", "One of the best ways to learn a programming language is by using the syntax in practice. Also, being a programmer one must know how to use REGEX (Regular Expressions) and Algorithms (though that is a completely different course in university) one must do a good project. I believe implementing a simple tokenizer and an algorithm to simplify mathematical strings could be one such way of learning them at once.", "Switching between the above cases can be done using the prefix = in the string. The regexes I used for case 1 are as follows.", "I have my naive implementation here. However, in simple terms, one can have a static class to hold functions that could parse the string and return parsed sections (type, formatted/evaluated content, original content). Note that after parsing we must retain original content similar to excel.", "For case 2, one must implement the algorithm; Shunting-yard. This simply pushes open brackets into a stack and solve by backtracking when a closing bracket is met. If you have an equation like 12*(5+6) you push to stack until you find the second closing bracket. Then pop until the first open bracket is out, then simplify 5+6 and push again into the stack. Finally, the stack will be brackets free and you can use BODMAS to simplify the final stack. You can have a look at my implementation here.", "Now the two classes are complete. The first class will parse items, the second class will be used by the first if the input string is an expression.", "Being an apprentice my cell implementation was not perfect or appropriate. However, the ideal method is to do the implementation of a proper generics. If you\u2019re new (like me back then) you can use strings with datatype in separate classes. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d organise the classes now;", "Here E could be the datatype of the cell found by the parser (Parser could return Class of the proper datatype in generics). We use inheritance to share the common attributes that any cell should have (user input string, cell colour if any and more that\u2019ll discuss later). The AbstractDataType class demonstrates the abstraction. You will never create classes of AbstractDataType since it makes no sense.", "In our operations, we will be using AbstractDatatype dataT = new DataType() which is polymorphism. This will enable us to add and subtract cells when cell referencing comes into play. All fields in the cells are Encapsulated and are only mutated using getters and setters.", "Now we have covered all the primary OOP concepts and on how to implement an Algorithm!", "This wasn\u2019t a simple task for any of the students who were quite new to programming, let alone JAVA.", "This is something that\u2019s quite difficult to explain over a text. Hence I\u2019ll share the look and feel of my implementation. However, NetBeans was a simple tool that enabled proper GUI implementation. I believe it is no longer used in practice since we have Electron/Qt like frameworks.", "JAVA has inbuilt GUI components and they are quite straightforward once you read the docs. Reading docs was an important skill which I believe I gathered from the very same course.", "Following was my GUI implementation. Note that I have used a theme (Apparently the only good theme that has proper rendering on non-windows platforms).", "This was a feature I grabbed from the MS Excel program. Pretty neat feature!", "JAVA has many libraries that motivated us to go above and beyond for this particular project. I have added a few such screenshots to motivate my beloved readers and future engineers!", "JFreeChart library provides a wide array of graphing capabilities. I have used a few to make the program a bit elegant.", "One of the most common ways of exporting spreadsheet data is using the CSV format. In this program, I used OpenCSV library to handle CSV file parsing.", "This can be implemented in multiple ways.", "Special Notes \u2014 It is essential to look for cyclic dependencies. Otherwise, the program might hit with StackOverflows due to never-ending reference cycles.", "Though I did not implement this in my program, this can be achieved by using the Memento Design pattern. This could either be implemented as chained object references or as a stack of actions.", "This project was carried out before 6 years in 2014!. Since the times have made us move on from desktop GUIs, a web-based project would make more sense. Let me share a few projects that might help a budding software engineer to build confidence in programming.", "Hope you enjoyed reading this. My sole thought of showing this project is to motivate young fellows to do a project through to its completion. Give it a go and share your project with me as well.
