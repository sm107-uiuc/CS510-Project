Some examples of common technologies employed in autonomous vehicles are: Computer Vision, LIDAR, GPS, etc\u2026", "Thanks to these technologies, autonomous vehicles don\u2019t necessitate a driver to complete even complex journeys. Additionally, multiple autonomous vehicles can communicate with each other to improve traffic and obstacle avoidance.", "The evolution in automation levels of cars is summarised in Figure 1. Many companies such as Waymo and Tesla are now hugely investing in a future lead by Autonomous vehicles (self-driving cars).", "\u201cDoT researchers estimate that fully autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars, could reduce traffic fatalities by up to 94% by eliminating these accidents that are due to human errors\u201d", "A research carried out by Charlie Miller and Chris Volosek recently showed that a Jeep Cherokee can be hacked just through an internet connection (making the car stop on a highway!). Also, other types of vehicles have been demonstrated to be sensitive to either wired or wireless attacks (eg. Toyota Prius, Ford Escape). In these cases Hackers have been able to: activate/disable vehicles brakes, steering wheels and increase the vehicle speed.", "Hackers can try to take advantage of self-driving cars vulnerabilities in many possible ways [4]:", "There are two main risks associated with hacking self-driving cars:", "Countries like the USA and UK already enforced legislation in order to ensure car manufacturers maintains a minimum required cybersecurity standard.", "Ensuring high security in autonomous vehicles can also increase trust in the public to invest in this new technology.", "If you are interested in finding out more about cybersecurity in autonomous vehicles, this research paper is a great place where to start.", "As mentioned before, vehicles always produce and store large amounts of data, it then comes to us to decide how to make the most out of this data.", "Machine Learning can potentially be used to identify and prevent unusual behaviour (eg. make the car go in parking mode while driving at high speed on a highway) [5]. In this way, Hacker attacks could be stopped from happening.", "Researchers are still now taking place in order to increase prediction accuracy. In fact, in order to create models able to distinguish between usual and unusual driving behaviours, many factors relating the car and it\u2019s surroundings have to be taken into account.", "Additionally, it could be possible to add a feature to make the driver allow for \u201cunusual\u201d behaviours if considered as necessary depending on his judgment.", "As Autonomous Vehicles are now becoming more popular, institutions are now getting concerned if it is necessary to create new laws to regulate their use.", "For example, in 2018 in Arizona (USA) the first case of an autonomous car killing a pedestrian has been registered. According to the police report, the pedestrian might have been at fault. In this case, who should be considered to be at fault?", "Most of these questions are still without an answer and different approaches might be taken to solve them (depending on the regulatory country and cultural relativism).", "If you want to keep updated with my latest articles and projects follow me on Medium and subscribe to my mailing list.
