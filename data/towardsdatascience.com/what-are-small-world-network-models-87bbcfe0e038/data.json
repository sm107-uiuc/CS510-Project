Their topological structures are too complex and they are too large for researchers to analyze them.", "Researchers thus turn to generative models of networks. The idea is that If we could design models that generate graphs and guarantee that the simulated graphs are closely similar to real-world networks in terms of network properties, we can perform analysis on the synthetic networks instead of real-world networks in an easier way. Moreover, with the generative models of networks, we can not only better understand the mathematical basis of real-world networks but perform controlled experiments that may not be available to real-world networks.", "Based on the aforementioned reasons, researchers have come up with several network models that generate small-world networks. In this post, we are going to list 3 most commonly heard network models in the social network analysis field.", "The Erdos-Renyi Model is often called the Random Graph Model; it generates networks randomly depending on probability distributions. There are two variants of the Erdos-Renyi Model, G(n,p) and G(n,m), and they are closely similar to each other.", "Using the G(n,p) model, we generate an undirected network with n nodes and each possible edge in the network is generated independently and identically distributed with probability p.", "Using the G(n,m) model, we generate an undirected network with n nodes and m edges selected uniformly at random.", "Since the Erdos-Renyi Model has a small clustering coefficient, which is quite different from real-world networks, the idea of the Watts-Strogatz model is to have high clustering coefficients with short average path lengths in generated models.", "We can have high clustering coefficients if we generate Regular Lattices, but they are fixed in the shape. We want to add randomness to the network and it can be done by random rewiring. The random rewiring process can create long-distance connections and add randomness to the generated network.", "The two random network models mentioned above are limited to two conditions, which are different from real-world networks.", "To resolve the limitations, researchers tried to model how real-world networks came into being. As a result, they observed the following characteristics and developed the Barabasi-Albert model.", "The above two characteristics are the reasons that give real-world networks scale-free property, which is the property that makes the degree distribution follow power-law. The Barabasi-Albert model is designed to capture the mechanisms responsible for the emergence of the scale-free property of real-world networks.", "To build a Barabasi-Albert network, we start with m0 nodes, and the links between which are chosen arbitrarily, as long as each node has at least one link. The network develops the following two steps,", "[1] Duncan J. Watts & Steven H.
