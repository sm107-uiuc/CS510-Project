I wanted this interview process to remediate any problems that I had experienced as a candidate. Furthermore, I wanted to test the skillset that I felt were the best indicators of success in the position.", "To hire a good data engineer we should first understand what a data engineer is.", "Unless you are new to the field, I do not believe that interviews should need to be studied for. The goal of a technical interview should be to assess if the candidate currently has the technical skills to complete the job. Data engineers primary responsibility is to build and operate the systems that process and store data. This means that a data engineer should be able to judiciously navigate data, restructure and process it, all while building the cloud infrastructure needed as they go. This requires similar programming skills as a backend engineer with a DevOps mindset. Building the infrastructure that the programs run on is part of the job.", "How do you screen for this?", "The final process consisted of a resume screen, 30 minute phone screen and 1.5 hour technical interview.", "I look for candidates that have worked with large codebases. Application development experience on their resume can be an easy sign for this. Building a website or an API professionally or as a side-project demonstrates that the candidate understands how a standard application works and can work with large code bases. I came across a lot of analyst or data scientist resumes during this resume screen. In my opinion, failed data scientists make good data engineers, an impatient data scientist that focuses on product will quickly become a data engineer because it is the limiting reagent in the productization lifecycle. Highlighting your experience with data transformations could convince the interviewer to move a candidate onto the next round.", "I screen for to know 3 main things.", "Data Engineering is at the cross section of a lot of other software engineering disciplines. I want to know that candidates have their own personal motivation for getting involved in data. They need to have an answer to \u201cWhy data eng?\u201d.", "Being attached in some way to the companies mission is important.", "Lastly, I ask an easy technical question with a long description. I use 4\u20136 sentences to set up a scenario in which they have data that I want to know something from. Getting insights from data is one of the core functions of a data engineer. This question shows me how candidates process new information and navigate their uncertainties. Some candidates will get confused by the scenario, often over-complicating the question, but seeing how a candidate resolves their confusion is very telling of how they will perform on the job. A candidates inability to resolve their confusion with me on the phone may be an indicator for their inability to do this independently on the job.", "Our technical interviews aimed to test candidates in three main capacities.", "Software in practice is rarely documented line by line. If you\u2019re lucky the architecture and function of a piece of software will be documented. A large part of any software job will not only be coding but reading other people\u2019s code. They need to be able to digest new code and gain a comprehensive understanding of it. To test this I lifted a short piece of code from one of my projects (~30 lines) that is working with some data. I ask them two things, tell me what it is doing line by line and give me a short 2 sentence functional summary of the software.", "The first part tells me if they understand code and basic data structures. The second part helps me understand if they can build mental maps of the big picture. On the job, the candidate will have to read and functionally summarize much larger code bases. If they struggle to do that for 30 lines of code, they will likely have trouble understanding how existing projects work.", "The next question is an application question where they have to write a small program. An easy to medium algorithm question could be useful but I said I wasn\u2019t doing that. I gave candidates a database and asked them to answer a few questions from it by writing code. Similar to the phone screen question I am looking for their understanding of the business context. If they can understand how data can be used to answer questions. This is where I assess their ability to write functions, follow basic syntax and debug errors.", "Finally, I ask them to design a data intensive application. Seeing where people go is very interesting.", "Some candidates go for sexy technologies. Building their application using Spark, Cassandra or some other technology that would be overkill. I\u2019m much more interested to know if they can identify the main components of a production system and make sound decisions that they can defend. Where is your software running, how is it being scheduled, what data are they collecting, what does your database model look like, etc.", "This is the first time I have developed a data engineer interview. Like anything, there is much room for improvement. While researching more I was thinking of implementing the following changes in the next round of interviews.", "A 30 minute take home where they have to build a small application that analyzes some data.", "Write a memo giving the basis for a technical decision. Perhaps a build vs buy scenario", "Let me know in the comments below what you think of the process and how it could be improved!", "Your home for data science.
