It is suitable for regression tasks as well.", "Supervised learning algorithms try to predict a target (dependent variable) using features (independent variables). Depending on the characteristics of target variable, it can be a classification (discrete target variable) or a regression (continuous target variable) task. Prediction is done with a mapping function which maps independent variables to dependent variable. The mapping function for SVM is a decision boundary which makes the distinction between two or more classes. How to draw or determine the decision boundary is the most critical part in SVM algorithms.", "Before creating the decision boundary, each observation (or data point) is plotted in n-dimensional space. \u201cn\u201d is the number of features used. For instance, if we use \u201clength\u201d and \u201cwidth\u201d to classify different \u201ccells\u201d, observations are plotted in a 2-dimensional space and decision boundary is a line.", "This is a very simple case just to illustrate the idea of SVM. It is highly unlikely that you will encounter a task like this one in real life. Decision boundary is a line in this case. If we use 3 features, decision boundary is a plane in 3-dimensional space. If we use more than 3 features, decision boundary becomes a hyperplane which is really hard to visualize.", "The main motivation is to draw a decision boundary that maximizes the distance to support vectors. Decision boundary is drawn in a way that the distance to support vectors are maximized. If the decision boundary is too close to a support vector, it will be highly sensitive to noises and not generalize well. Even very small changes in independent variables may cause a misclassification.", "The data points are not always linearly separable like in the figure above. In these cases, SVM uses kernel trick which measures the similarity (or closeness) of data points in a higher dimensional space in order to make them linearly separable. It is easier to understand with the figures below. As you can see, two different classes in 2-dimensional space cannot be separated with a line. Using a kernel trick makes them linearly separable:", "Before I go in detail about kernel trick, I would like to mention c parameter and a concept called \u201csoft margin\u201d.", "Real data is noisy and not linearly separable in most cases. A standard SVM tries to separate all positive and negative examples (i.e. two different classes) and does not allow any points to be misclassified. This results in an overfit model or, in some cases, a decision boundary cannot be found with a standard SVM. An overfit SVM achieves a high accuracy with training set but will not perform well on new, previously unseen examples. To overcome this issue, in 1995, Cortes and Vapnik, came up with the idea of \u201csoft margin\u201d SVM which allows some examples to be misclassified or be on the wrong side of decision boundary. Soft margin SVM often result in a better generalized model. When determining the decision boundary, a soft margin SVM tries to solve an optimization problem with following goals:", "There is obviously a trade-off between these two goals. Decision boundary might have to be very close to one particular class to correctly label all data points in training set. However, in this case, accuracy on test dataset might be lower because decision boundary is too sensitive to noise and to small changes in the independent variables. On the other hand, a decision boundary might be placed as far as possible to each class with the expense of some misclassified exceptions. This trade-off is controlled by c parameter.", "C parameter adds a penalty for each misclassified data point. If c is small, penalty for misclassified points is low so a decision boundary with a large margin is chosen at the expense of a greater number of misclassifications. If c is large, SVM tries to minimize the number of misclassified examples due to high penalty which results in a decision boundary with a smaller margin. Penalty is not same for all misclassified examples. It is directly proportional to the distance to decision boundary.", "Kernel function is kind of a similarity measure. The inputs are original features and the output is a similarity measure in the new feature space. Similarity here means a degree of closeness. It is a costly operation to actually transform data points to a high-dimensional feature space. The algorithm does not actually transform the data points to a new, high dimensional feature space. Kernelized SVM compute decision boundaries in terms of similarity measures in a high-dimensional feature space without actually doing a transformation. I think this is why it is also called kernel trick.", "Kernel functions available in scikit-learn are linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid.", "RBF (or Gaussian RBF) is a widely-used kernel function. It is defined by gamma parameter which basically controls the distance of influence of a single training point. Low values of gamma indicates a large similarity radius which results in more points being grouped together. For high values of gamma, the points need to be very close to each other in order to be considered in the same group (or class). Therefore, models with very large gamma values tend to overfit. Following visualizations explain the concept better:", "As the gamma decreases, the regions separating different classes get more generalized. Very large gamma values result in too specific class regions (overfitting).", "For a linear kernel, we just need to optimize the c parameter. However, if we want to use an RBF kernel, both c and gamma parameter need to optimized simultaneously. If gamma is large, effect of c becomes negligible. If gamma is small, c effects the model just like how it effects a linear model. Typical values for c and gamma are as follows. However, specific optimal values may exist depending on the application:", "It is very significant to remember for SVM that the input data need to be normalized so that features are on the same scale and compatible.", "I want to go over a simple case just to show the syntax and steps to follow. Let\u2019s start with importing the libraries we need:", "Scikit-learn also provides datasets for practice. Breast cancer dataset is suitable for our task:", "We need to split the dataset for trainin and testing using train_test_split function of scikit-learn. Then I create a support vector machine object for classification with linear kernel and train it using train dataset:", "Using our trained model, we can predict target variable in the test dataset and measure the accuracy of the model:", "95% is a pretty good accuracy but, for classification tasks, there are two other measures: precision and recall. These terms are so important that they can be a topic of whole another post. In fact, they are clearly explained in Google\u2019s machine learning crash course.", "This was a simple linearly separable task. For cases that are not linearly separable, we can use kernels using the kernel parameter of SVC (i.e. kernel = \u2018rbf\u2019 ). I did not specify the c parameter so default value (c=1) was used. In order to find best parameters, we can use GridSearchCV() function of scikit-learn.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
