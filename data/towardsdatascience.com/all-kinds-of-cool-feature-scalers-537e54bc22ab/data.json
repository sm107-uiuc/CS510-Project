Some objective functions rely heavily on, and in fact, won\u2019t work properly without the proper scaling. In data processing, feature scaling is also called \u201c data normalization\u201d and this normalization is usually performed during the processing and cleaning steps.", "Scalers are exclusively used for continuous features, as the intention of a scaler is to lower the variance of the data in order to make most of the predictions lay in the area with the most data. And besides that, using scalers can definitely boost your accuracy.", "What a lot of people don\u2019t realize is how many scalers there actually are. This is because typically z-score normalization scalers are the most effective. In the past, I have used a Rescaler to less accuracy, and a Unit Length scaler to more accuracy. This further illustrates that sometimes in Data Science,", "Rescaling, or min-max normalization uses the minimum and maximum values to scale an array. Though this is pretty cool, I haven\u2019t really found it to be all that useful for machine-learning. I would say check it out only for the information and learning because this scalar typically throws estimations off and destroys accuracy in my experience. In one situation, I was able to use a rescaler as a min-max filter for bad data outputs on an endpoint. Though this certainly doesn\u2019t cover the lost ground, I think that it was definitely a cool use for it. If you\u2019d like to try this scaler out, it\u2019s in Lathe!", "In order to scale your features, you need to first get the minimum and maximum of x, and then x will be subtracted by the minimum on the numerator, maximum minus minimum for the denominator. And for those who would rather see it in code,", "Mean Normalization is exactly what it sounds like, normalizing the data based on the mean. This one certainly could be useful, the only issue is that typically a z-score scalar does a lot better at normalizing the data than a mean normalizer. Fortunately, Lathe has this one, too! The formula is very simple, x subtracted by the mean on the numerator, max minus min on the denominator. I haven\u2019t used this one particularly that much, just as typically it returns a lower accuracy score than a standard scaler. Regardless of whether or not this particular one is useful,", "So maybe you know all about Rescalers, Mean Normalization, and Standard Scalers, but you might not have heard about the Arbitrary Rescaler. Contrary to the ones before it, I have found this to be quite useful. Arbitrary Rescale is particularly useful when you have a small quartile gap, meaning that the median isn\u2019t far from the minimum or the maximum values. And guess what? Here\u2019s the code for this one, as well!", "Ah yes \u2014 the good ole\u2019 Standard Scaler. A Standard Scaler, also known as z-score normalizer, is likely the best go-to for scaling continuous features. If you ever need an accuracy boost, this is the way to do it. I\u2019ve used Standard Scalers a lot, probably everyday I use one at some point. For me, Standard Scaling has been the most useful out of all of the scalars, as it is for most people.", "The linear formula for a Standard Scaler is also really really simple. It\u2019s as simple as subtracting the average from the iteration of x, and then dividing the remainder by the standard deviation. And as for the code to do so, it\u2019s pretty simple as well! :", "Another option we have on the machine-learning front is scaling to unit length. Scaling to unit length can offer a similar result to z-score normalization, and I have certainly found it pretty useful. The formula is rather simple, though right now in Lathe there is no code-base to support it\u2026 This is because Unit Length Scalars use Euclidean distance on the denominator of the x iteration. Overall Unit Length Scaling can be very useful towards boosting your model\u2019s accuracy.", "Scalars are awesome. It can be really rewarding to get an accuracy boost of five to ten percent when you are just running a function to modify your feature. Another big plus is that the math behind most scalers is incredibly easy, making them all the more versatile given that you could even do them with a calculator.", "Your home for data science.
