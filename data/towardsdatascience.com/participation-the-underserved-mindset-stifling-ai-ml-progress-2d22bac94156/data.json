Plugging away at some data-related business problem \u2026 and likely frustrated with the unfair amount of time spent cleaning data.", "And then, there is the analyst firm Gartner. They\u2019ve surveyed that up to 80% of AI/ML projects fail. That makes us feel less alone since our failure rate seems to be in the same ballpark!", "What insights are being produced that aren\u2019t good enough? Does it happen more with projects that are saving costs rather than generating revenue? How different is it across industry verticals e.g. finance, utilities, media?", "Take telecommunications for example. Today, there are 800 or so mobile networks around the world connecting the 6,000,000,000 people who can afford it. 3G, 4G and 5G technology lets us Whatsapp, Instagram or Zoom no matter where we are \u2026 and how we\u2019re physically moving.", "These networks takes years of R&D and huge amounts of capital to bring to life. New systems might give us lower latency and higher bandwidth but they\u2019ve also made networks more complex, expensive and hard to manage. And no one can predict how consumers will behave with their mobile devices, what kind of bandwidth they\u2019d demand.", "But despite a steady stream of AI/ML-powered products trying automate operational tasks and produce predictive insights, most wireless networks still need a lot of manual intervention.", "First, the business promise. Fix a pain point, reduce costs, increase revenue. And after that, there might be a human promise. Make life easier, save time, improve skills.", "It\u2019s this second promise that\u2019s less tangible \u2026 less black and white \u2026 less definitive.", "The overall aim of zero-touch networks is for machines to learn how to become more autonomous so that we can delegate complex, mundane tasks to them. Why? It frees up more time for humans to do what we\u2019re good at \u2014 performing more complex tasks that require deeper understanding \u2014 Elena Fersman, Ericsson (2019)", "We find this sentiment in most AI/ML pitch decks but that last sentence rang a few alarm bells. And brought back unpleasant memories of a mantra we\u2019d heard in engineering outsourcing years ago.", "But having spent 8 years in technology outsourcing, we\u2019re not sure whether #2 ever delivered.", "No doubt expensive Digital Transformation programs have been the all the rage, trying to equip users with coping skills for a changing environment.", "But what happens when evaluating uncertainty is a key part of the change? i.e. is the prediction trustworthy? Never mind that we were gut-feeling decisions before. Are the results truly better given that 100 data points are now being considered? Never mind that we only used 2\u20133 data points before.", "Imagine coming from an environment where custom tooling, spreadsheets and experience had been baked into decision-making for years. And now being asked to decide based on outputs from a black box, one that comes with WTFs like model accuracy, correlation scores, confusion matrices\u2026", "The premise was that if designed correctly, the new post-outsourcing world would be more innovative, efficient, cost-effective \u2026 simply better.", "Once work had been transitioned, there were usually two options for remaining staff:", "Yet, failures were plenty and usually around managing scope and service levels. Because for the most part, we expect the outsourced team to do the work as we would have done it.", "And if they did it some other way, we simply couldn\u2019t bring ourselves to trust the outcomes.", "With AI/ML, it felt like history repeating itself.", "Most end-users in our sphere weren\u2019t data scientists although they may have data science experience. They were neither statisticians nor analysts, but are familiar with the concepts. They\u2019re people who perform highly technical work and are now seeing that work automated to a degree, with an outcome they\u2019re expected to trust \u2026 and supplement.", "From a data science perspective, we were frequently guilty of results first, adoption second. How the user might have felt wasn\u2019t something we spent lots of time thinking about.", "But a chance meeting with the inimitable Ge Wang in the Bay Area gave us some food for thought.", "What if, instead of thinking of automation as the removal of human involvement from a task, we imagined it as the selective inclusion of human participation? In turn, we\u2019ve broadened the question of \u201chow do we build a smarter system?\u201d to \u201chow do we incorporate useful, meaningful human interaction into the system?\u201d", "In hindsight, we were blinded by a lack of awareness for a long time. And what we missed out was consideration for the end user and how they could gradually but meaningfully interact.", "So we did two things but now through the lens of participation.", "For us, there was often similar patterns of questions from clients, even from those with data science familiarity. From \u201cHow did you get these results?\u201d to \u201cCan we see the raw data used?\u201d and then \u201cCan you explain the trade-offs\u201d? \u2026 but always ending with a variant of \u201cCan we really believe these results?\u201d.", "So we tried to break down that feedback into the following:", "After multiple attempts at re-engineering our UI, it became clear that we were struggling to provide simple and flexible visualisation of post-processed data to support those questions. The datascape was simply changing much too fast.", "So we ended up with a hybrid UI that could incorporate a BI tool such as Tableau for data interpretation and analysis \u2026 just to give users the ability to ask questions without a steep learning curve. It did mean a lot more careful post-ML data design to work with BI limitations but the trade-offs appear justified so far.", "But despite all the attempts at layering the analytics and building storyboards, we struggled to explain AI/ML outcomes. And that pushed us towards systemisation.", "Once we had the user journey down somewhat, we started looking at how to coherently piece together different data components.", "Loraine Lawson spoke about Foundational Analytics and the importance of knowing your data starting point. Surprisingly, this was the hardest part \u2026 where to start given the numerous data inputs with overlapping information. It was no wonder that users struggled to correlate outputs against now barely recognisable input data after journeying through multiple pipelines.", "What we did see though was how a high-level system made the the process from data to outcome less intimidating \u2026 and somewhat more assured i.e. if we follow these \u201csteps\u201d, this is what it means and we\u2019re likely to get somewhere!", "Companies like Digital Data Divide and Samasource (the late Leila Janah was their CEO) pioneered the outsourcing of AI training data preparation to low-cost countries many years ago.", "One might question underlying motives but whatever said, it did enable an underserved demographic with previously limited means of accessing AI/ML-type technology.", "For highly technical work that\u2019s being automated or heading down the AI/ML path, we\u2019ve seen how hard it is for technically proficient people to adapt. Most of our project failures were because users weren\u2019t vested in the journey, in the results and what it could mean for them. Why? We simply didn\u2019t do a good enough job enabling them.", "Is Data Science and AI/ML going to change the world because it can solve difficult problems, increase efficiencies and reduce costs? Or because it figured out that having those on the periphery be part of the process was important?", "And similarly, maybe those 800+ mobile networks we talked about earlier aren\u2019t just about connecting people, but rather, giving 6 billion people a chance to participate.", "Your home for data science.
