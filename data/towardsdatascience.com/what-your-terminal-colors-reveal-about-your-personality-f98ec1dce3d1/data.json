So colors are invariably part of the deal!", "When used right, colors increase speed and readability. But above all, they\u2019re a mirror of the personality of a programmer.", "Some people express themselves more through colors than others \u2014 which already says a lot about their egos. Some people choose to customize their background, others prefer to let the text look like a heap of M&M\u2019s. Others do both.", "And every aspect tells a story about who you are as a programmer, and how you feel in daily life.", "How you color your background unveils your comfort zone. Your terminal background is what you look at every day, whether you\u2019re coding or not. Therefore, how you keep your background says a lot about how you feel on a daily basis.", "Elegance comes in black. You\u2019re laid-back, stylish, and you have that certain je-ne-sais-quoi, whether you\u2019re coding or not.", "Your colleagues think that you\u2019re an over-achiever. They think of you almost as a celebrity, despite your measly 30 followers on Twitter. You\u2019re neither a celebrity nor an over-achiever, but you know how to market yourself.", "When you talk, you talk loudly. After all, why talk if nobody hears you?", "You\u2019re someone who enjoys life to the full.", "You live. You love. You indulge. But never to a decadent extent.", "You\u2019re an artist on the tightrope between discipline and indulgence. Your terminal reflects just that.", "You don\u2019t think of yourself as disorganized. You just admire the level of organization that others have.", "When you wake up, you have no idea what the day ahead is going to bring. You hate planning because that throws you out of your rhythm.", "Every surface in your office is cluttered with folders, notes, and a few gifts from last Christmas. You\u2019ve forgotten where your favorite coffee cup went; it\u2019s probably hidden somewhere behind a few books.", "Speaking of coffee \u2014 ah, caffeine! Your holy grail and the one and only secret to your productivity. No matter that it makes you even more jittery than you are already. Come grab a coffee and start coding!", "This is for the users of every shade of gray. You can\u2019t decide between black and white. You wouldn\u2019t want a color because that would be too much distraction.", "You like to keep things functional: You chose a light gray because white is too bright for you. Or you chose a dark grey because black is \u2014 well \u2014 too black for you.", "You\u2019re indecisive but not inefficient. You get your work done, but don\u2019t speak loudly about it. In meetings, you usually sit in the corner and never speak unless you\u2019re asked to.", "You like to keep private things private and business things professional. You don\u2019t like to speak loudly because that would be a waste of energy. You don\u2019t have any political views because that would be controversial. And, above all, you don\u2019t like to have people\u2019s attention.", "You have a gray terminal? You\u2019re a gray mouse in every sense.", "You\u2019re bored with black, white and gray. You want your terminal in your favorite color, or at least a color that stimulates your attention.", "You like to express yourself in every sense. Your variable names in your code are one of a kind, your style of clothing is unmistakably you. You have an affinity for art, music and comedy.", "You\u2019re a rarity among programmers. You always stand out in a crowd. And you enjoy that.", "You use your terminal color to express who you are.", "Your terminal is red? You\u2019re an amazing lover.", "Yellow? You\u2019re like a ray of sunshine.", "Blue? You love technical things, and the sky, and the sea\u2026", "Purple? You\u2019re a weirdo in disguise. People aren\u2019t even aware of all the crazy thoughts in your head!", "You\u2019ve tried monochrome backgrounds but you have gotten bored rather quickly. You prefer to use a picture of your favorite galaxy, or of your first teddybear, or of your mom\u2026", "People call you eccentric, but in reality you\u2019re just a big kid. Curiosity is what drives you. Programming is your vocation because it\u2019s about learning new things all the time.", "You have a huge and uncontrollable affinity to everything that\u2019s sweet and colorful. Your concentration span is that of a three-year-old; you get waylead by every distraction.", "Still, you deliver consistently at work. Your never-ending supply of ideas compensates for your shortness of attention.", "Text inspires action. It is the thing that comes and goes on your screen. Which text colors you use reflects what you\u2019re driven by.", "Which, in turn, says a lot about who you are.", "You don\u2019t like your text looking like a bag of M&M\u2019s. You\u2019d rather stick to a good old-fashioned black, white or gray. That\u2019s just how much you love your craft.", "You\u2019re committed in everything. That person who\u2019s always on time, always gives 150%, and always has something useful to say \u2014 that\u2019s you. Your output is consistent and at a high level. When you say yes, you mean it.", "Some people might call you uppity. You always come in the office with a beaming smile and have some comment about what somebody is doing. More often than not, that can be insulting \u2014 because your ideas are wrong and out of context. You have a strong tendency to show everyone you know better.", "But you don\u2019t know better. You just love your work.", "Most systems come with a default color scheme. Despite having coded for the last ten years or so, you haven\u2019t changed that scheme. Never touch a running system!", "You can work with everything and anything. Flexibility is your second name.", "Got a spontaneous meeting in ten minutes? Quickly jam up some slides. Got to work with a totally different software? Oh yeah, you love changes! Your cat is sick? No problem, you\u2019ll do home office today.", "The downside is that people perceive you as a bit unreliable. You\u2019re not that person that shows up to the office at the same time each day \u2014 on some days, your cat is sick. And people never know what expect when you deliver results \u2014 it depends what environment it\u2019s written in, right?", "You\u2019ve tried to get on with the default color scheme, but you just found it clunky and inefficient. So you invested a half-day or so to find the perfect colors for your text.", "People who walk past your laptop find your scheme quite eye-catching. But they have no idea what each color really means. Only you know that.", "Your colors are for you and only you. In the same way, your life belongs only to you. You\u2019re extremely reserved and keep things to yourself. You learn a lot, but you can\u2019t be bothered to share your knowledge with others. You don\u2019t like to talk in meetings \u2014 but when you do, your input is brilliant.", "You\u2019re extremely smart, but sometimes you\u2019d be better off sharing your wisdom. Yup, even your color scheme!", "Of course you\u2019ve customized the colors in your terminal. After all, how should anyone deal with those crappy default colors?", "The capacity of your brain is your most precious resource. You don\u2019t like to waste any thoughts on the use of different colors in different environments. Which is why you haven\u2019t only customized your shell \u2014 you\u2019ve customized your text editor in the same way!", "You\u2019re consistent at work and always deliver high-level results. You attribute that to the fact that you don\u2019t lose time on little things like colors.", "That\u2019s your approach to efficiency: Remove the clutter, and the rest will go by itself. And obviously it works!", "Consistency is key, also in personalities \u2014 but contradictions are much more interesting!", "In this story, we have reviewed five types of background colors and four types of text. If we allow every combination, we arrive at twenty different types of terminal colors.", "Some of the personality traits that are revealed in the background might also be reflected in the text. Others may be downright contradictory.", "And aren\u2019t all humans walking contradictions? While the consistent types do occur a lot more often, it\u2019s the contradictory ones that are intriguing.", "Elaborating on each contradictory type would blast the scope of this story. But maybe you\u2019re a contradictory type yourself? How do you explain your consistencies and your contradictions?", "Your home for data science.
