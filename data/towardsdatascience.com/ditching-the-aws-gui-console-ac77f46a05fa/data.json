You\u2019d go to \u201cis the bryant park lawn open dot com\u201d and see this:", "In the malaise of the COVID pandemic, my humble site has fallen into disrepair, offering the opportunity to make some retrofits. The last time I worked on this, I relied heavily upon the clicking around in the AWS GUI console method, in a web browser\u2014a behavior I\u2019d like to get away from.", "Today, I\u2019m setting out to re-engineer this (whimsical, arguably \u201cdumb\u201d or \u201cnobody-asked-for-this\u201d) service as an AWS-based serverless infrastructure\u2014leveraging the SAM CLI, provisioning with CloudFormation, and leaning on a variety of other code and infra tools. I want to do this without touching the GUI AWS console to the extent that I can: CLI and scripting all the way!", "Here\u2019s a little map of the services I think I\u2019ll need: It\u2019s all centered around a little database, an s3 bucket website, and some AWS Lambda functions.", "Buckets are object storage containers.

You can just let AWS manage the server infra, and get billed only for when your code actually runs, as triggered by some event or schedule. Here are the functions I\u2019ll need:", "Time to start building our CloudFormation stack .yml! This is the document we submit over the CloudFormation CLI to stand up all of the resources we will need, all at once, in perfect orchestrated harmony. I\u2019ve been poring over the CloudFormation docs on AWS to figure out what this should look like:", "I haven\u2019t had a chance to test and debug today, but I\u2019ve gotten the ball rolling declaring my cloud infrastructure (network config, security rules, database instance) for this app. A crucial resource in setting up my network was this blog post about keeping your RDS instances private while still giving Lambda RDS access, without sacrificing web access for the Lambdas.", "The hard part of this (private subnet RDS + Lambdas with web access) is setting up a cheap NAT instance (the hard, manual way via ec2 AMI\u2019s) rather than simply provisioning an expensive pre-baked NAT Gateway in CloudFormation. Going the easy way has cost me in the past, in dollars.", "I\u2019m iteratively building this CloudFormation .yml template with (for now) just a fresh VPC, some subnets, security groups / subnet groups, and an RDS DB\u2014no Lambda functions or S3 bucket site yet.", "Initial attempts to deploy this stack .yml result in errors, because there\u2019s no way I was going to do this right the first time:", "Ok, so we get some reasonable errors, e.g. for the \u201clawnDB\u201d resource (my RDS database), it didn\u2019t launch because I got Value of property VPCSecurityGroups must be of type List of String. Initially, I just gave it one string, not a list of strings, my error. I\u2019ll recursively correct these errors and keep attempting to validate/deploy. I\u2019m curious about the !ref function in CloudFormation now too\u2026", "It turns out that the !ref function is essential in CloudFormation. For example, if you provision a VPC and a subnet to go inside it, the subnet probably needs to !Ref the VPC\u2019s logical name (the name you give it in the YAML) in order to belong to that VPC. Here\u2019s what I mean:", "After getting the hang of CloudFormation templates, it seems like I have the beginnings of an infrastructure in place, just some network organization crap and a DB:", "This .yml is already getting to be a long file! Is there a way I can break it up? Evidently, yes. We can nest CF stacks or import/export values between stacks with Outputs. I\u2019ll do that:", "It feels good to modularize the CloudFormation templates, in the same way that we would break up ominously large Python modules into several.", "Next, I\u2019ll attempt to assemble the Lambda functions mentioned above. This is where I get to try debugging Lambda functions locally via the SAM CLI (and docker) for the first time!", "How exactly does Lambda fit into this CloudFormation infrastructure-as-code model? I\u2019ll just launch them into their own \u201cstacks\u201d and assign them IAM roles that give them permission to do things like write to RDS and call each other. In retrospect, maybe nested stacks would have been a better approach because now I\u2019m cluttering up the exported variable namespace in this CloudFormation region.", "I found a handy repo that generates a lambda function that can scrape the web with a headless selenium browser. Thanks, Christopher! Now to adapt it into my own scraper function, to collect info about the park lawn:", "Using the SAM (Serverless Application Model) CLI from AWS, I was able to quickly re-use and debug this code to scrape for the text fields I wanted from the .org website. $ sam build -u && sam local invoke is my new jam.", "This is the bit that translates the scraped string from the .org website into a binary variable. I have a feeling this is the least durable part of my \u201capp,\u201d since I don\u2019t know the range of possible values that might exist for this scraped text field. So far all I\u2019ve seen is \u201clawn is open\u201d and \u201clawn is closed.\u201d I will continually update this function when new possible values arise. The nice thing is that it is its own lambda function, with its own logs and failure rates. Maybe I\u2019ll set up text message failure notifications later with AWS SNS.", "By the way, all of the original code for this is public on GitHub, if you missed that earlier!", "Ultimately, I decided that the RDS writer function will be one to run on a schedule, and call child functions I (scraper) and II (parser) synchronously via boto3:", "This Lambda function has permission to call other lambda functions and modify the RDS database we provisioned in the CloudFormation templates. It is ultimately responsible for getting new data and writing it to the database. I read somewhere that it\u2019s a good idea to make sure the parent Lambda function doesn\u2019t time out before its child functions complete their work.", "This is the function that reads from the DB, spits out one of two possible HTML documents (based on the binary \u201copen\u201d or \u201cclosed\u201d lawn status), and pushes that document to the s3 bucket serving our humble site:", "Now that we\u2019re scraping data, squirreling it away into a database, and referencing that DB to write HTML to a static S3 bucket site\u2026we have a living, breathing web service!", "A friend brought TerraForm to my attention, which I did not know existed since I\u2019ve been stuck in my AWS fanboy bubble. TerraForm seems like the next natural thing to learn (after e.g. AWS CloudFormation or Google Cloud Deployment Manager) for anybody curious about infrastructure-as-code.", "The idea is to build a little Plotly dashboard page showing aggregate historical data on lawn open-ness by day-of-week and hour-of-day.", "Before I can build a summary stats page, I\u2019ll let my lambda functions scrape about a week\u2019s worth of data to the RDS database while I apply for jobs, cook lasagna and various hearty soups, and play through Breath of the Wild.", "The simple stats page is working! For now, it\u2019s just one Plotly heatmap showing the Bryant Park Lawn\u2019s historical average open-ness at different times of day and days of the week, based on my 2x/hour sampling.", "To add this page, first I wrote a lambda function to exfiltrate the entirety of my RDS SQL DB/table to a .csv in an S3 bucket, so I could download it and experiment with throwing it at Plotly in a Jupyter notebook. Sometimes it\u2019s really helpful to be able to debug locally as much as possible, thus the experimentation with SAM in this small project.", "Then I adapted the resulting working viz generator code from Jupyter to go back into the Lambda function (V), which updates the new \u201cstats\u201d page every 12 hours.", "Something that bugged me was that adding another .HTML page to my s3 bucket site did not automatically make that page \u201cloadable\u201d in the browser. When I was debugging, my browser kept trying to download the .HTML document to my local drive instead of just rendering it. Annoying!", "At first, I thought this was happening because S3 bucket sites don\u2019t support server-side scripting, and maybe I had accidentally included some server-responsible code..? But no. A web search made me realize that I just needed to make sure to include the \u201ccontent-type\u201d of the s3 object on upload (put) in order for it to be served properly:", "With that, I\u2019m feeling ready to move on to perhaps a less hello-worldy project! In the future, I\u2019d like to investigate: Nested CloudFormation stacks, getting away from the \u201cstock\u201d web stack of HTML/CSS/ES6 (TypeScript? Node? React?), and leveraging some machine learning (regression/classification) in more of my future projects, which is something I\u2019m already pretty familiar with. I\u2019m also curious about Kafka/SQS, DynamoDB, and managing user credentials and sessions; I know very little of those things, as of this writing.", "What I\u2019m most excited about is the chance to solve some real-world problems! Look me up if you think I might be able to develop some software that would make (repetitive, annoying parts of) your life easier, or if you\u2019re building something yourself (a developer team?) and you think I could be of assistance.", "Your home for data science.
