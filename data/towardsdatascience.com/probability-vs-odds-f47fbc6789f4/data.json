It is very easy to confuse these two terms.", "In this post, we will quickly clarify what each of them is, their differences, and their relationship.", "We use probability in our every day language all the time when we say things like \u2018I don\u2019t think so\u2019 or \u2018That is very unlikely\u2019. Probability, in a non-rigorous description, can be defined as a measurement of how strongly we believe things about the world.", "We can calculate probabilities by counting the outcomes of events. For example, if we consider a coin tossing game where we choose heads, and therefore want to calculate the probability of a favourable outcome, as the number of times that a desired outcome can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes.", "For our example, this can be described in the following terms.", "Counting the outcomes of events is useful and simple in certain occasions, like the previous example. However, it is easy to see that when there are many multiple combinations and possible outcomes, this technique becomes unfeasible, as it does not hold for a wide range of real life problems.", "For example, could you viably answer the following questions using the previous approach?", "As you can see, if go past binary options (yes or no, or 0 and 1), and try to pick something in between (a probability), precisely answering these questions is not so easy. We can do it, however, by using odds and expressing probabilities as a ratio of beliefs.", "As we just saw, we need an effective way to calculate probabilities in more general situations. To show how we can do this with odds, consider the following example:", "Imagine you, and a friend are discussing which one is a better runner. You\u2019ve been training a lot lately, you\u2019ve always beaten him in the past, and lets be honest, he is not in a very good shape since he started going out so much.", "How do you quantify your belief that you will surely beat him in a race? Many times we do this through bets: \u2018I\u2019ll bet you 5 bucks that I will beat you in a race in a week. If you win, I\u2019ll give you 10.\u2019 you say.", "What does this mean, probabilistically speaking? As this is a race with only two possible outcomes, you can either win it or lose it, and the probabilities of winning plus losing must always sum up to 1, like shown in the following figure:", "Also, your statement saying that you will get 5 dollars if you win and give 10 if you lose expresses odds of the bet.", "Odds are a way to express a belief about an event as a ratio of how much you would be willing to pay if you were wrong, versus how much you\u2019d get if you were right. They can be quantified in the following manner:", "Now, how do we translate this into a probability? Easy. As all probabilities must sum 1, we use the equation in the figure just above the previous one and get:", "Lastly, if we substitute in the odds we get:", "As we can see, our belief that we will win is of 0.66 or 66%. Seemed like more when we decided to bet the double of what we would get right?", "The process of calculating probabilities from odds can be generalised by the following equation, where H is a certain hypothesis and O(H) are the odds in favour of that hypothesis (the ratio of the bet of winning vs losing):", "That is it! Probability is awesome. As always, I hope you enjoyed the post, and that you have learned what the differences between probabilities and odds are with this easy, everyday example.", "If you did then take a look at my other posts on Probability, Data Science and Machine Learning here. Have a good read!", "If you want to dig deeper into the topic, check out the following video by StatQuest:", "Also, you can check out other of my Probability Learning articles here:", "I deeply encourage you to read them, as they are fun and full of useful information about probabilistic Machine Learning.", "If you want to learn more about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence follow me on Medium, and stay tuned for my next posts!
