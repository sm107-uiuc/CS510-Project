Click here to read this story using my friend link!", "Generative models have been used in a myriad of applications across different domains \u2014 starting from quantitative finance to model and minimize tail risk to hydro-climate research to study the joint effects of extreme weather. The power of generative models lies in its ability to encapsulate the entire dependence structure and the underlying probability distribution of the datasets. This is very useful because, using generative models we can not only create future representations of datasets, but also sample new realistic data points that preserves the cross correlation across the original training dataset.", "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a new class of generative models that was first introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014). Since then, GANs have found widespread adoption within the machine learning community to solve unsupervised machine learning problems including image/text generation and translation. In this article, let us explore how we can use GANs to model discrete-time stochastic processes, and on-demand create plausible samples to construct synthetic time series of weather data.", "GANs architecture comprise of two sub-modes called Generator (G) and Discriminator (D), that compete with each other with the goal of achieving Nash equilibrium through the training process. The Generator learns to map the latent space (e.g. Noise ~ N(0,1)) to the data space over which the given data samples are distributed, and the Discriminator evaluates the mapping done by the Generator. The principle role of the Generator is to generate synthetic data that mimics the training dataset to an extent where the Discriminator cannot distinguish the synthetic data from the real data.", "The input to the Generator is a random noise vector x\u2019 (usually a uniform or normal distribution). The noise vector is mapped to a new data space via Generator to obtain a fake sample, G(x\u2019), which is a multi-dimensional vector. The Discriminator is a binary classifier that takes in both the synthetic G(x\u2019) and the training (x) dataset and learn to classify them as fake and real. Optimal state of the GAN model is reached when the Discriminator cannot determine whether the data comes from the real dataset or the Generator.", "Several variations of GANs have been developed over time to address specific needs of the problem in hand, but all these variants employ Adversarial training that happens in two phases:", "Phase I: Train the Discriminator and freeze the Generator. This is done by passing samples of both the real and fake data to the model and evaluate if the Discriminator can predict them correctly. During Phase I of the training process, the network will only do the forward pass and no back-propagation of error will be applied.", "Phase II: In this phase we train the Generator, and freeze the Discriminator. This is done by optimizing the Generator to create realistic samples that would fool the the trained Discriminator from Phase I.", "Once trained, the GANs model is optimized to produce synthetic time series that\u2019s realistic enough to mimic the real time series data. After training, the Generative model can be used to create new plausible samples, on demand.", "A stochastic weather generator is a statistical model that aims to produce synthetic time series of weather data of unlimited length for a location or a region based on analysing the statistical characteristics of weather in that region. Most stochastic weather generators use a combination of Markov procedure and frequency distribution of different weather variables.", "In climate modeling, multivariate distributions have been traditionally modeled using Copulas. A copula function is a multivariate distribution with standard uniform marginals. Any multivariate distribution can be written as a composition of its marginal distributions and its copula. For example, in a bivariate case, given two continuous random variables \u201cx\u201d and \u201cy\u201d, with marginal distributions \u201cF\u201d and \u201cG\u201d, and a joint distribution \u201cQ\u201d, there exists a copula \u201cC\u201d such that Q(x,y) = C[F(x),G(y)]", "GANs offer a completely different framework to model multivariate distributions. Using a combination of Generative and Discriminative models, along with adversarial training, we would be able to transform noise into realistic weather data.", "For this study, we will use the total monthly precipitation from five weather stations located in the Bay Area, CA. For training the GAN model, we will use the monthly precipitation data from year 1893 to 2012 obtained from the NOAA\u2019s USHCN database. The precipitation values are in hundredths of inches. We will focus on GANs ability to capture the spatial correlation across five weather stations by modeling the total monthly precipitation.", "For both the Generator and Discriminator components of the GAN, we will employ a three layer Sequential model. The latent vector would comprise of 20 values sampled from a normal distribution. We will use the popular ReLU activation function in the hidden layers, and train the model using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) loss and the Adam version of stochastic gradient descent. To prevent model from overfitting, we will adopt Dropout regularization technique. Schematic of the the GANs architecture used in this study is shown below", "Our model output will have 10,000 synthetic data samples with 5 output features corresponding to total monthly precipitation across Livermore, Berkeley, Napa, Petaluma and Santa Cruz locations. The model was implemented using Keras library in Python, and code snippets are provided below.", "As mentioned in the introductory part of the article, one of the greatest strengths of GANs is its ability to generate data on demand. Using the trained GANs model, 10,000 new synthetic data points were generated for each of the five weather stations. The plots and table below compares the descriptive statistics of the actual data used for training the model and the synthetic data generated by the GANs model.", "A quick review of the model results show that the GAN model was able to learn the distribution of data at each of the weather stations relatively well, while simultaneously preserving the cross correlation across the stations. For Santa Cruz station, the modeled estimates are slightly higher than the observed values. But in general, the sample minium, lower quartile (25%), median (50%), upper quartile (75%), and sample maximum of the synthetic data are matching well with the corresponding statistics from the actual data. The performance of the GAN model can be further improved by optimizing the size of latent vector, number of layers, cost functions, training algorithm and activation functions.", "For most of real world applications, data scarcity is one of the biggest bottlenecks to address. This is particularly true in the insurance and risk analytics domain where the problem of data scarcity is further compounded by the quality of data. GANs offer a powerful pre-trained modeling framework that can artificially synthesize new labeled data that can be used to develop better models and risk analytics. This study just scratches the surface of potential application of GANs for risk modeling. Stay tuned for more.", "Thanks for reading this article! All feedbacks are appreciated.
