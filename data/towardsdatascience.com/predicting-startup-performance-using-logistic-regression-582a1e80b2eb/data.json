Unfortunately, most of the ones I came across ended up shutting down for all kinds of reasons. So I became intrigued by how startups survive. Can I tell if a startup will survive or fail? Although the nature of startups is somewhat meant to be unpredictable, I wanted to see what insights I could dig up through some data.", "This article features data scraped from angelist.co, a startup database, framing the ML as a classification problem of whether startups can raise a certain threshold to predict performance. Comparisons of P-value, Chi-square, F-value, and Mutual Information as variable selection methods are presented and evaluated. Finally, the chosen model finds the most important predictors: size, years established, San Francisco, Austin, Seattle, and Mobile Gaming. Most of these are intuitive as they all confirm the geographical advantages and market competitiveness effects on startups.", "Here are my jupyter notebooks from scraping to modeling in case you are interested :)", "After researching a few different startup databases, I chose angelist.co for its decently detailed data and its freely accessible nature. Below is an appearance of the site to give you a sense of the data we are dealing with.", "The above page features a huge amount of startup companies, and for each startup, the following data is presented:", "I wrote a web scraper to acquire the above data, randomly sampling 4260 unique startups from Angelist. Below is a snippet of the data I scraped.", "It bugged me whether to frame this as a regression problem to predict some dollar value or as a classification between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cnot good\u201d startups. If it is a classification problem, then we need some measure of good and not good. I was inspired by a study by TechCrunch regarding the fundraising impact of one round on the next.", "We see in the below chart, the probability of raising Series A is highest when companies raised 2 to 2.5 million in pre-series A. Therefore a seed-stage company that raised $2M should have a higher chance of survival than one that raised less than $2M. Hence, our seed-stage model will use $2M as a threshold to evaluate which goodness of companies.", "Between $0 raised and somewhere in the $2.00-$2.50 million range, each half-million dollar chunk of pre-Series A financing raised resulted in a marginal increase in the likelihood of raising a Series A round, at least for those companies that raised pre-Series A funding between 2003 and 2012. After that $2.5 million mark, there was no marginal benefit to raising more money from Seed, angel and other pre-Series A investors, at least in terms of companies\u2019 chances of raising a B round.", "The probability of raising Series B is a lot flatter among different Series A funding. The fundraising amount has less of an impact on advancing to the next stage. Yet, we still see a spike near $12M, so we would follow the same logic previously and use $12M as a threshold to evaluate the goodness of startups.", "we find that the rate of Series B fundraising success remains relatively flat with only slight variations from the average. This indicates that, for one reason or another, the amount of money raised prior to Series B doesn\u2019t have a significant impact, most of the time, on a company\u2019s ability to raise a Series B round.", "After correcting the data types and cleaning repeated rows/special characters, the following processing logic is applied to create a table ready for training.", "A screenshot of the seed-stage companies dataframe is included below. All variables except size_numeric and years are binary 1/0 to represent whether that startup meets the location/market criterion.", "Our dataset contained a total of 4260 companies from all different stages. Here are two interesting charts that show the most-raised(famous) startups as well as the distribution of stages.", "Now, going into specifically seed and series A. let\u2019s see how seed-stage companies and series A companies compare in terms of their distribution in employee size, location, and market.", "Seed-stage companies tend to have employees clustered over 1\u201310 and 11\u201350. Series A companies tend to have employees between 11\u201350 and 51\u2013200. This is very intuitive as startups generally grow bigger in size when moving from one stage to another.", "The hottest markets seem to be consistent between seed and series A. Mobile commerce, b2b, and Saas are the top of the leaderboard.", "Locations also overlap between seed and series A. San Francisco, NYC, London, Los Angelas, and Austin are popular homes for both these stages.", "The distributions do not yield much insight regarding the factors that affect the survival of a startup. In the next section, machine learning is applied to analyze the above markets, locations, and their impact on startups.", "If we inspect the nature of the input features, we find most of them are binary ones that are generated by one-hot encoding. Our input data has high dimensionality (and most are binary), hence not very suitable for tree-based models. Given the sparse distribution and low complexity of the data, I chose to use logistic regression to model it.", "** Two datasets to model: seed and series A, with different \u201cy\u201d (\u201craised_2mil\u201d and \u201craised_12mil\u201d). This shall provide us insights in comparison.", "The binary features can be very skewed towards 0. (E.g. one company has a location of \u201cIthaca\u201d, then a column called \u201cIthaca\u201d where exactly one row has a value of 1 where the rest are all 0s.) So certain variables would be much less important than others. In this step, feature selection will be used to select only the features that are important.", "I decided to try a few different feature selection methods and see how they influence the result. Namely, I will use Chi-squared, mutual information, ANOVA f-value, and p-value.", "For the p-value selection, I performed a backward elimination using an alpha of .05, and the rest are utilizing built-in functions from sklearn.feature_selection.", "A shorthand is as follows. A logistic fit is run on the training data, if the feature with the max p-value exceeds my desired significant level (Meaning the coef is not significant), I remove that feature and repeat the process until all features left have p-values under the threshold.", "The p-value backward elimination returns a non-fixed number of variables, in this case, 9 for Seed and 6 for SeriesA. The sci-kit learn selections are implemented using SelectKBest, where K is set to 10. This number is picked by finding the best validation set AUC performance. (Explained in the next part). Chi-squared and F-value tests yielded the exact same variables for both Seed and SeriesA so they are combined into one. Below are the choices of variables selected using the different processes.", "One interesting observation is that for the p-value selection method, the seed variables consist of size, year, locations, and markets. Whereas the series A variables do not include markets. One way to interpret this might be that early-stage startups depend more heavily on the market, as they grow/enter they are less influenced by market performances/competitiveness.", "For each of the feature selection methods, logistic regression is trained on that set of features, and a ROC curve is plotted using validation sets. Each ROC curve has a metric AUC (Area Under the Curve). The more this value leans to 1, the better the model at predicting the outcome correctly..", "Cross-validation is used in this step to yield a smooth and rounded \u201cMean\u201d ROC curve. Each faint curve in the 4x-grid is a single ROC from a train/validation set, the bolded curve represents the mean ROC, with a shaded region in grey representing one standard deviation. The large plot on the left-hand side is simply the mean ROC plotted together.", "For Seed companies, the Chi-squared/F-value selection method performs the best on the validation set with an AUC of 0.761.", "And for SeriesA companies, the Chi-squared/F-value selection methods perform the best on the validation set with an AUC of 0.717.", "From the comparisons of variable selection, Chi-squared/F-value had the highest AUC for both stages, let\u2019s see the performance on the test set now.", "For Seed stages, indeed the Chi2/F selection gave us the best test accuracy of 0.764. This means we can correctly predict the ability to raise 2M 76.4% of the time. The TPR and TNR also are reasonable. Although raising 2M does not infer a definite success, it has the most probability of raising the next round. So it can definitely help us identify \u201cstrong\u201d startups.", "Let us visit again the variables identified by the Chi2/F selection and their corresponding coefficients and p-values. This will provide us insights on what factors are strong influencers of the survival of a startup.", "We will go over the variables with a p-value smaller than 0.05 because they are statistically significant at differentiating good and bad startups. size_numeric, years, Austin, San Francisco, Seattle, and Mobile Games will be discussed in detail below.", "Unlike the seed stage models, models for the SeriesA stage had disastrous performances. The TPRs are extremely low, meaning they are terrible at predicting \u201cgood\u201d startups. The reason that caused this might have been the size of the sample dataset being too small. We had 529 observations for SeriesA companies when Seed companies had 1882. A potential next step is to re-run the model on more data.", "Overall, the quality of the data is certainly limited, but our seed-stage model performed well with an accuracy of 0.764. The predictors of a successful startup are far more than just the market, location, size, and years established. Factors like company culture and founders\u2019 background may be more deterministic in a real-life situation.", "Nevertheless, we got significant insights from the seed stage model that is very applicable to real-life knowledge. So as a takeaway, try not to invest in mobile gaming, and put your money in a San Fran, Seattle, or Austin based startup! (Maybe!)", "Taking a step back, this project looks at a very simplified problem based on the Crunchbase article\u2019s percentages. The insights drawn from it are just for our mere interpretation. There are so much more mystery, science, and techniques in the VC realm that simply might not be learnable by logistic regression.", "Please feel free to spark a discussion/reach out if you have any questions or comments!", "Your home for data science.
