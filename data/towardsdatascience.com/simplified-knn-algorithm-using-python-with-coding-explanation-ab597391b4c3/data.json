Patterns are usually created by the machine and it uses various techniques and algorithms for it. K nearest neighbor is one the simplest and yet effective algorithm for a classification problem in machine learning. It can be used for both classification and regression problems i.e. it can classify any particular event/attribute and can even predict its value. This method is followed because of its simplicity over other complex algorithms. It works on measuring the distance between the data points. Measuring the distance makes a pattern to create a relationship between two points. This is how it decides in which group the new data point should be placed.", "If we need to calculate the distance between two points mentioned in the above image say (XA,YA)and (XB,YB) then it can be done by using a simple formula", "Above is the Euclidean way of measuring the distance between two points. There can be other ways too for this distance measurement. The above mentioned method is followed to calculate the distance between various data points. KNN has two distinct properties", "KNN algorithm has its own pros and cons because of such carefree classification", "In K nearest neighbors, the value of K denotes the number of nearest neighbors which have a minimum distance from our new data point. If we say k=3, it means we have to find out 3 nearest neighbors for our new data point. If there are 3 neighbors and one is from the red dataset and the other two are from blue then the new data point will be marked for blue. More neighbors mean more clarity in classification but it increases the complexity and timeframe for classification. There is one more important aspect of the value of k, it should be an odd number always for better classification otherwise if the number of neighbors is equal for both colors then it would be a tie.", "Let\u2019s take an example to show how the algorithm works in python language. For working in python, we need to call certain libraries", "here datasets is a repository for some basic sample datasets on the python framework. These datasets can be fetched for doing some simple practical modeling. Iris is a very famous dataset in that storage.", "sklearn is the most famous package of python for data science and has almost 70% of functions required in machine learning. here we are importing a function for data splitting into testing and training (train_test_split) and KNeighborsClassifier for KNN classification. For checking the accuracy of our model we are using accuracy_score again from the same famous library package.", "We have called the iris dataset and separated the target variable from the rest of the data frame. here y is having the target variable and x is the dataset which will be used for modeling.", "To have some insight into our dataset. It gives a decent amount of insight into the data frame being treated. here is the output for this", "Now we split our data into a 70\u201330 ratio in training and testing data. The ratio can be chosen by the programmer as per his own wish but it is wiser to have a decent volume for training data and there should be justifiable testing volume too.", "Now, we are ready to make a KNN model by using the following command. You can see in the code we are using the Minkowski distance metric with a value of p as 2 i.e. KNN classifier is going to use Euclidean Distance Metric formula.", "Now we will train the model using KNeighborClassifier and here the value of k is 6. (yes its even number, to see the complexity)", "after training the model, testing will be done on the test data using the same trained model by using the following command", "on the basis of distance calculated for all data points we find out how many neighbors are indicating for which side. Once the top nearest neighbors are selected, we check the most voted class in neighbors", "by using this command we can check the accuracy for our designed model. Good value suggests better modeling done. The accuracy for both test data and training data has to be checked, in order to identify the overfitting model characteristics.", "The model is ready for its next assignment and does not require to be trained again. If we feed more data the model will evolve better and so will its results. We have to be sure that the data provided is cleaned and missing values have been treated as machines don\u2019t work properly with missing value datasets.", "Your home for data science.
