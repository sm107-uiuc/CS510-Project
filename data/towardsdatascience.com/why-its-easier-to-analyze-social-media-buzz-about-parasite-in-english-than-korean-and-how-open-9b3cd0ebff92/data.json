Movie critics say that Parasite could not have been a critical hit in America if it weren\u2019t for the quality of the subtitles that reflect the semantics and cultures on this side of the Pacific.", "Darcy Paquet, an American movie critic who translated the script into English subtitles, said the translation process involved many emails and even more hours dedicated to writing and revising with Bong Joon-Ho and the team. He and Bong Joon-Ho had to make difficult translation decisions on everything from the delivery of punchlines to the translation \u201cjjapaguri,\u201d the addictive combination of Jjapaghetti instant black bean noodles and Neoguri instant spicy noodle soup, for an English-speaking audience.", "How do you translate \u201cjjapaguri\u201d to English? Ram-don = Ramen and udon. A clever solution to a novel challenge. If it\u2019s this difficult for two experts to capture the nuance of humor in Parasite, imagine how far we would still have to go in order for algorithms to capture that same nuance.", "In data science and natural language processing (NLP), we\u2019re also faced with continual grey choices; there is little black and white. For example, how do you create a predictive analysis using historical police arrest data knowing potential biases exist in the data? How do you balance short project timelines with precision when creating a training dataset for topic classification? Even when you get started on your first data science project, you\u2019re already weighing the pros and cons of which libraries to use, and in the process, are delving into deep examinations of the subjective choices their authors made when creating the library.", "To fully explore these nuances and decisions as a beginner data scientist, courses and training can help, but in the end, they cannot replace the solitary exploration of the sea of open source libraries that exist online. Open source libraries are libraries of code that are free for anyone to reuse, modify and publish without permission. Authors of the code can publish their work under different licenses, which determine how their code can be reused (e.g. for commercial projects). Many of these libraries are also critical building blocks for experienced data scientists and allow them to quickly prototype and build minimum viable products as well as serve as the foundation of larger, more complex projects.", "When Hyunjae and I first started reworking City78\u2019s code to analyze Korean text, we expected to build a modular set of scripts to serve as a prototype and plug into our existing processes. We planned to use open source Korean NLP libraries to analyze Naver, a platform whose search engine accounts for roughly three-quarters of all web searches in Korea, leveraging the platform\u2019s geolocated retail and public reviews to create place identity snapshots of neighborhoods. However, instead of the quick plug-and-play we were expecting, we found that a number of the open source text analysis tools (e.g. sentiment analysis, tokenizers) \u2014 tools we take for granted in English \u2014 exist in adolescence as open source libraries in Korean.", "While large companies like Naver most certainly have a set of incredible NLP resources internally and do contribute to the open source community, including NLP libraries, the accessibility and ease-of-use of these libraries are critical in encouraging their implementation in traditionally non data science-focused sectors as well as their usage by students.", "To put it another way, it is easier for a beginner data scientist to find and use open source libraries to analyze text-based social media buzz around Parasite, a Korean movie, in English than it is to analyze it in Korean.", "In our attempt to build a quick prototype that can analyze Korean text, we learned that there is not a straightforward path for many individuals just entering the Korean natural language processing field. Nevertheless, as the amount of user-generated text data continues to grow at an exponential rate, NLP technologies will be critical in understanding consumer/public/group opinions, trends and more. We have responsibilities as individuals, societies and institutions to promote the development of open source tools that enable students and professionals alike to learn and innovate.", "This article is meant to function as a conversation starter in exploring the role of institutions and private sector in fostering open source cultures around Natural Language Processing, as the implications of this evolving subject will shape a generation of data scientists, business models and the scalability of startups who work with text data around the world.", "We hope you join us in beginning this conversation and share your own experiences with open source and NLP in non-English languages.", "Your home for data science.
