Now that it is ready, what you will most often observe is:", "And this is a really big problem. If you remember, we said the key is to keep top of mind that a dashboard is meant to help people taking decisions. So we actually need to empower them to do so.", "Implementing a dashboard requires to actually present the dashboard to end-users. And to be done well, this requires to cover 3 areas:", "This simple framework comes from my decade of experience in the education field in the medical device industry. Most of the time education is restricted to showing the features of the product. The problem with that is that if people do not understand why they should even know about those features, they won\u2019t listen.", "Establishing the why is key to get your audience to listen. And it requires you to know what are the issues your audience is facing.", "If you read the previous episode you will remember I insisted on the fact you need to be curious about end-users and their needs? Well, here again it will be very useful. If not, you won\u2019t connect with them, they won\u2019t listen to you, and you won\u2019t reach your goal.", "The best way to convey this in my experience is through story telling. And the funnier the better. It will serve as an ice-breaker and get people to actually listen to what you\u2019re saying.", "Finding that example should be one of the things you think about when you have discussions with end-users while building the tool for them. Actually during those discussion you should hear dozens of them. So if none come to mind, you probably didn\u2019t talk to your end-users enough! Ot you did but you didn\u2019t listen well enough.", "Covering the why shouldn\u2019t take more than a few minutes \u2014 and it sets the stage for the rest of the presentation.", "Once you have covered the why, you can move on to the what. What data point does your dashboard show?", "This is an amazing opportunity to run a data literacy session without it being called as such! Once again knowing your audience is key as you will need to tailor the content to the data literacy level of the group.", "Three key pieces of advice I was given in earlier stages of my career and that really served me well are", "Finally, you are ready to put everything together and show them how to actually use the tool to make a decision.", "Here it means you have worked before-hand with a key stakeholder (ideally the team lead of the team you are presenting to), to identify a few example of decisions end-users need to take, and guide them through the process. Even better if the team lead wants to do it him/herself.", "If you have the possibility, get a few attendees to do role plays based on scenarii you worked out with the team lead. Then you are really sure they can actually use the dashboard for what it is meant for.", "Quantitative and qualitative tracking are fundamental.", "With most BI tools available you will be able to pull utilisation data and know who connects, how often and how long. That\u2019s great to track adoption of the tool, and is a good representation of the belief the team has this is going to help them reach their goal.", "But that doesn\u2019t really tell you whether it helps them take decisions. What is REALLY interesting to track is utilisation versus desired outcome. For example for a sales team, is there a correlation between frequence of usage and revenue generated (assuming the main goal is to generate revenue, of course)? Or between frequence of usage and achievement of target? If you work in data, you see where I\u2019m going!", "This data should be communicated and made available to managers of the end-users. Again, this aims to help them make better decisions. For example increase coaching with a specific sales representative, or ensure the best one shares his/her best practices with others.", "Besides quantitative tracking, it is key to track qualitative aspects as well, and get feedback to improve the dashboard along the way.", "Are there any data point people are never using? Suppress them.", "Are there data point missing? Add them.", "Do you get the same questions all the time about a specific graph? Change it.", "This can be done through group debriefs (online or offline), through questionnaires, or through 1\u20131 discussions. The last option is my favorite. get out of the office, go observe how people actually use the tool in-situ, connect and have proper conversations. Be curious.", "Besides improvements made based on the above tracking, don\u2019t forget we leave in a fast paced environment. Things that are relevant today might not be tomorrow. Products change, commercial offers change, teams change, strategies change. Keep up with what happens in the business to ensure your work stays relevant.", "As I said in the previous episode, it\u2019s not a linear process, but a circular one.", "You can also follow my journey on my medium Series.", "Your home for data science.
