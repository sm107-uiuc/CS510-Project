The difference is that analytics is about expanding the decision-maker\u2019s perspective while marketing is about narrowing it.", "Similarly, data journalism is about capturing the interest of many people in a small way, while analytics is about serving the needs of a few people in a big way. The analyst serves their decision-maker(s) first and foremost.", "If I\u2019m your analyst, I\u2019m not here to choose for you (even though I might have more domain expertise than you). You\u2019d have to promote me to decision-maker for that to be an ethical thing to do.", "If you want someone to work as an analyst-decision-maker hybrid, understand that you\u2019re asking for two roles rolled into one and assign that responsibility explicitly.", "To learn more about misconceptions #2 and #3, scoot back to Part 1. In this article, we\u2019ll pick up where we left off and talk about analytical excellence.", "In Data Science\u2019s Most Misunderstood Hero, I describe the 3 excellences in data science. An analyst\u2019s excellence is speed.", "Analysts look up facts and produce inspiration for you, while trying to waste as little of their own time (and yours!) in the process. To get the best time-to-inspiration payoff, they must master many different forms of speed, including:", "That last point is plenty nuanced (and also the most important one on the list), so let me spell it out for you.", "Beautifully visualized and effectively communicated trivia are a waste of your time. Exciting findings which turn out to be misinterpretations are a waste of your time. Meticulous forays into garbage data sources are a waste of your time. Irrelevant anecdotes are a waste of your time. Anything an analyst brings you that you don\u2019t find worth your time\u2026 is a waste of your time.", "The analytics game is all about optimizing inspiration-per-minute.", "Analysts will waste your time \u2014 that\u2019s part of exploration \u2014 so the analytics game is all about wasting as little of it as possible. In other words, optimizing inspiration-per-minute (of their time and yours, subject to some exchange rate related to how valuable each of you is to your organization).", "Don\u2019t be fooled by a simplistic interpretation of speed.

But you could assess their skills (not job performance) by letting them loose on a benchmark dataset whose contents you are already well-acquainted with.", "As an analogy, if you ask two analysts to extract inspiration from a foreign language textbook, the better (faster) analyst for the job might be the native speaker of that language. You could assess their relative skill by measuring the speed with which they comprehend a passage you wrote in that language.", "If you\u2019re not keen to create a standardized analytics obstacle course yourself, you might like to look into byteboard.dev. Byteboard is a startup revolutionizing tech interviews and they\u2019ve recently launched a skills assessment for data analytics. It uses real-world scenarios plus a nifty interface to measure competence at tasks like data exploration, data extraction, quantitative communication, and business analysis. Sure, they intended it as a way to help you interview new candidates, but there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t also use it to speed-test your incumbent analysts.", "Skill doesn\u2019t guarantee impact. That\u2019s up to your data.", "But once you\u2019ve assessed skills, remember that skill doesn\u2019t guarantee impact. That\u2019s up to your data. To go back to the earlier analogy, if you point both analysts at a mysterious textbook you\u2019ve never opened, you can\u2019t hold them accountable for inspiration-per-minute they find because the book might be filled with rubbish. If that\u2019s the case \u2014 no matter their level of fluency! \u2014 neither one will find any inspiration to bring back to you\u2026 and that\u2019s not their fault. Having a textbook doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll learn something useful. The same goes for datasets; their quality and relevance matters just as much.", "Textbooks are a great analogy for datasets, so a couple of additional things to bear in mind about both datasets and textbooks are:", "Decision-makers, think of your analyst as a new sensory organ you\u2019ve just evolved: a new kind of eye that allows you to perceive information that you would otherwise have been blind to.", "If you direct your new eyes at something that wasn\u2019t worth seeing, you wouldn\u2019t gouge them out for it, right?", "Similarly, if analysts find nothing valuable in a dataset you asked them to examine for you, don\u2019t punish them. Keeping them around is an investment in being able to see in new ways. If you don\u2019t like what they\u2019re looking at, direct them towards a scene with more potential.", "Analytics is the difference between seeing where you\u2019re going and flying blind.
