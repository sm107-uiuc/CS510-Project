Always has. When I decided to switch my career from neuroscience to data science, interviewing was the part I dreaded the most.", "I had some insight into the process from watching my boyfriend interview with several tech companies. So I knew a little about what to expect, but wasn\u2019t sure if it would be different for data scientists.", "Mostly I was just scared of making a fool of myself. Especially if it was in front of an interviewer that I respected. However, this fear was mitigated slightly by the fact that I was interviewing remotely. Somehow it seemed slightly less stressful. If I ever had to escape an interview quickly, all I had to do was shut my laptop \ud83d\ude1c", "In this story I will detail the strategy I used when interviewing for data science positions in Silicon Valley. I was doing these interviews whilst living back in Adelaide, Australia. The strategy was based on advice from people I knew in the tech industry, data scientists and my experience as a post doc.", "Ultimately, I was successful in gaining a job I loved. Some of my strategies may also be useful for you if you plan to apply for data science jobs.", "I allowed myself 6 months to retrain as a data scientist. That way, if data science wasn\u2019t right for me, then I only wasted 6 months. I was comfortable with the idea of wasting 6 months for the possibility of getting a job in tech.", "Having a time limit meant that I couldn\u2019t get stuck in my comfort zone. I knew I would have to move fast to get a data science job in just 6 months. So there was no time for self-sabotage or procrastination. I just had to get stuck into it and ignore the fear.", "Since I had given myself the 6 month time limit I knew that I would need to start interviewing early. Even before I thought I was ready. That had a freeing effect on me.", "Knowing that I would be moving fast, I didn\u2019t have the option to wait until I felt comfortable with my new skills to start applying for jobs. It gave me the push I needed to get moving. I didn\u2019t want to stand in my own way.", "Women often wait to apply for jobs until they have every single quality they think they need. We wait until we can tick off every item described in the job add. I know I am certainly inclined that way. The time limit I gave myself was at least in part to make sure that I didn\u2019t fall into that trap.", "So I started applying for data science jobs when I still felt like a fraud.", "The first 10 jobs I applied to, all I got were impersonal rejection letters. That was discouraging but I had expected it. Then I got a couple of more encouraging rejections that were tailored to me.", "It is such a weird experience to be happy about getting a \u201cgood\u201d rejection letter. Getting a valid reason, at least I knew that they had paid enough attention to know that I was not quite right for their job opening.", "A little while longer and I was getting actual interviews. I thought it would take nearly the full 6 months before I would get an interview, but I actually got a couple of my earliest ones only 3 months in. At that stage I was still working my way through some of my first courses and so did not perform particularly well.", "However, I think part of what made me ready for the interview I got hired in was all of the practice in the unsuccessful interviews. Looking back on some of the first data science interviews that I did, I made some really silly mistakes.", "For example, in some of my earliest interviews I made beginner programming errors that showed how green I was. I also misinterpreted the data in a couple of my first take home programming assignments. The good thing is that I learned from them and realised that I had not answered questions as well as I could have. Without making those early mistakes, I may not have figured out the right way to approach the take home assignments and data problems.", "So I think it is good to get started practicing as soon as possible. That way when the right job comes along you can be ready to perform at your best and smash the interview.", "Part of what led me to early success in getting interviews was being very targeted in my job search. I focused almost exclusively on companies in the health science sector.", "My health research domain expertise is a valuable addition for these types of companies. I guess it is easier to teach a neuroscientist to code than to teach a programmer to do brain surgery \ud83d\ude09", "I think my previous experience in neuroscience got my applications noticed by hiring managers. It likely set me apart from other candidates vying for the same data science positions. Anything that can legitimately give you a leg up in a job search is worth taking advantage of.", "Thankfully the bay area has a high concentration of biotech and healthcare startups. So I still had many companies to choose from.", "One of the most helpful tools in finding the right jobs to apply for was the Rock Health job board. Rock Health is a venture capital fund that invests in digital health companies. I would literally go through every company they invest in and check for job openings in the San Francisco bay area.", "I am sure that this type of strategy would also work for other areas of domain expertise. There are lots of venture funds and angel investors who like to invest in sectors they know. This is a good way to find companies that have been through someone else\u2019s due diligence. You also know they have enough money to keep the lights on.", "I created a shortlist of all the healthcare startups I could find that were looking for a data scientist. I needed to narrow down my list and apply.", "I narrowed the list down based on which companies I would be most excited to work for. The criteria most important to me was that the company\u2019s mission resonated with my values and was at the core of their business. Additionally, I wanted to work on interesting problems with interesting people.", "These are the things that were my priorities. By looking for jobs that I could get excited about, I could convey my excitement to the hiring manager through my cover letter and in the interview. It is easier to sound enthusiastic if you actually are. No overacting required.", "I was more interested in finding a job that I could be passionate about than getting one where I could make the most money possible.", "I researched each company as thoroughly as I could before applying for the position.", "Most startups have pages on their websites that describe their mission and goals. I think this is the bare minimum that you should look at before deciding if that business is worth applying for. Even if you don\u2019t know every single thing about their business, you should at least know what is at its core. It is not worth wasting your time or that of the hiring committee with blasts of non-specific email applications. Quality over quantity.", "I researched startups on Linkedin. I wanted to see if any of the employees where friends of friends because sometimes knowing someone can help get your foot in the door.", "For each application I wrote tailored covered letter. There is nothing worse than getting a generic rejection letter. I think that the same must be true for hiring managers who get piles of generic cover letters.", "In the cover letters, I detailed why I wanted to work at that company. You may think that the reasons that you want to work there would be obvious. It is always a good idea to state things plainly, so that there is no way that you can be misunderstood.", "This may go without saying, but I always try to be likeable in a job interview. Not because I want to flirt with the interviewer. Rather because it is a good idea to try to make the people you meet in interviews want to hang out with you.", "Everyone spends a large proportion of their day with people that they work with. Even more so with the people that work in the same team. So obviously you want the people interviewing you to be ok with the idea of spending more time with you in the future. They don\u2019t want to be hanging out with jerks at work. So I always try to make it clear that I am a nice person who is easy to get along with.", "It also goes both ways. I knew I would be spending a lot of my time at the office. So I wanted to choose a company with people that I would enjoy spending time with.", "Even better if you can make a connection with some of the people interviewing you on a personal level. Then hopefully you will make a strong impression and you will stay in the forefront of their mind.", "For example, in one interview I spoke with data scientist who was a former research scientist. We found common ground in our feelings about research and the skills that are transferrable to data science.", "Even if I do not always feel confident in interviews, I always try to project confidence. I don\u2019t mean to say that I act as though I have confidence in every single aspect of the job, but rather that I have self-confidence. There is a difference between self-confidence and having an inflated head. I try to go for the former.", "People can tell when you are feeling nervous and that can sometimes make them uncomfortable. The last thing I want to do in an interview is to make the interviewer feel uncomfortable, even if it is only in sympathy.", "Often in tech interviews, programming ability is tested by getting the candidate to write code or pseudocode on a whiteboard. This is done in front of the interview panel. I personally hate this practice and think it is a total waste of time. There has never been any scenario in my time as a data scientist where I have coded in front of people on a whiteboard as part of my job. If it is not part of the job, why would you get people to do it in an interview?", "Since I was interviewing remotely it was physically impossible for companies to ask me to do a white-boarding code test. Knowing that there was no chance of a white boarding test made me feel a little more confident. Rather companies got me to do pair programming in google docs, talk through problems with them or do a take home coding assignment.", "Another way that I tried to portray an air of confidence is by asking intelligent questions. I would always made sure to read through the take home coding assignment. Then I would come up with a list of questions to ask to make sure that I understood it correctly. In my view it is much better to ask a few questions, rather than be too shy to ask and then approach the questions all wrong. A misunderstanding like this might be a red flag to interviewers about how well you would fit with their team.", "Everyone has limitations. I am no different. So when I was interviewing I made sure to be very honest about them. I think that people have more confidence in your answers if you don\u2019t sugar coat everything that you say. If you provide a more balanced description of yourself and your skills then the interviewer will be more inclined to believe you.", "For example, I knew that I had only gained my data science skills very recently. So if I got hired, I would be a junior data scientist. I wanted to make this crystal clear to every company that I interviewed with. I like to underpromise and overdeliver.", "I told them that I would not necessarily be able to hit the ground running and be productive immediately upon starting. Instead that I was a very fast learner so it would not take me too long to get up to speed. This seemed to make a good impression in several of my interviews where the hiring manager responded positively to my honesty.", "After almost every interview that I did, I asked for feedback on my performance. Especially when the interviewer had marked my take home assignment.", "It was much easier to improve for the next interview when I knew what I did wrong in the last one. I was surprised at how helpful everyone was and how willing they were to take time out of their busy days to give me feedback on my work.", "Most of the time I already knew what they were going to say but it was nice to have confirmation that my instincts were correct. That way I knew I was moving in the right direction.", "As I have said throughout this story, these are the strategies I came up with when interviewing for my first data science position. I am sure there are many other great approaches that can improve interviewing skills, but these are just the ones that I used.", "Obviously, they did not work every single time, as I had at least 4 unsuccessful interviews before I finally had the one where I got the job. However, I feel like I took away many important learnings from those initial interviews. These learnings eventually helped me to land my first job as a data scientist.", "In addition to data, my other passion is painting.
