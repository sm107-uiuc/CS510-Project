Never unpack the whole image; never run the actual software again.]", "Every piece of software can be re-imagined as a single, massive image file. How? Each input to your software is a particular \u2018pixel coordinate\u2019 (this image exists in a many-dimensional space, equal to the number of different bits available for inputs and program state; still, it\u2019s a static representation mapping input-coordinates to output-values, an \u2018image\u2019 from here-on). Meanwhile, the \u2018colors\u2019 at that particular location are just the output bits of the software. Let\u2019s look at an example:", "We have a 3 by 3 array of \u2018pixels\u2019, and each pixel stores a bit-string \u2018value\u2019. If this array represents your software, then an input string to your software of (2,3) would select the \u2018pixel\u2019 at the second column, third row: the value there is \u20182\u2019, which would be the bit-string of your output. Similarly, input of (1,3) to your software provides an output of \u20187\u2019. Without needing to actually calculate the particulars of your program, you can use this \u2018image of inputs \u2192outputs\u2019 to emulate your code! Yet, most real-world programs are far too complex for this. You could never store the entire map of possible inputs and outputs.", "Until a sneaky trick using our new algorithm-monarch: the neural network! Jumping into details\u2026 That bulky software you\u2019ve got can be broken down into a few \u2018sorts\u2019 of operations:", "So, for the parts of your software which have been parsed as \u2018chaotic\u2019, the plan is to form an \u2018image file\u2019 of that segment of program operations. Each pixel\u2019s \u2018coordinates\u2019 are the bit-string of your possible inputs to that segment. Each pixel\u2019s stored \u2018colors\u2019 are its output bits for that segment you hope to emulate. Presuming you have formed an accurate image file for that chunk of code, you can now do a quick look-up instead of running the software again. That is why this is so important. Considering how many common apps and software packages are used by tens of millions of people, such a look-up table would be able to emulate billions of hours of software run-time per year.", "Yet, how do you go about finding all the relevant segments of that enormous software-input-output-image, and storing it efficiently? Neural networks take up those tasks, in three ways:", "Neural networks are amazing at performing approximations of almost anything. Recent work to emulate physics simulators running on supercomputers yielded a 2 billion-fold speed-up! Another use-case from a few weeks ago solves partial differential equations a thousand times faster\u2026 almost all of them, which were, um, almost all the stuff we still couldn\u2019t understand. Yet, as soon as you ask a neural network to follow an exact formula, it fumbles. Other teams are working on that; giving neural networks the \u2018building blocks\u2019 to assemble, where each block is an explicit and exact operator. There is one other fragment to this figment\u2019s inaccuracies, which we must focus on: it is a fuzzy covering of the space of outputs. What?", "Given various inputs, the generator from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) will emulate numerous portraits which are close to the distribution of real faces it has seen. It isn\u2019t exact, yet, it does \u2018cover\u2019 the entire distribution of faces, making all the sorts of things that it saw. We can wedge that crowbar of approximate-space-covering between a few \u2018correction bits\u2019 to fulcrum our fuzzy maps! Imagine you were passing messages, decoding them at each stage, and you can see how the fuzzy approximators make it all happen:", "First in line, Alice receives an encoded message. This is the \u2018hash\u2019 of the inputs to a program that happens often; a chunk of those input values go into figuring-out this particularly complex step in the software. Alice uses her \u2018decoder-ring\u2019 (our \u2018Parameter-Generator\u2019) to translate that \u2018hash\u2019 into a set of addresses. Some addresses tell her which heuristics and seed she\u2019ll be using, then the addresses following that are the bits she\u2019ll need to change, followed by the de-noiser\u2019s address, and finally any other final correction bits. That whole recipe will follow through the chain, now\u2026", "So, Bob receives the message and pulls-out the appropriate Heuristic-Decoder Alice advised, which is only one among many stored on the super-server, to convert the \u2018seed\u2019 into a more complex array of bits. The Heuristic is \u2018unpacking\u2019 the bits of output stored at that location of input-space. Yet, it is fuzzy. There are serious flaws. We\u2019ll be running it through another neural network, next \u2014 the De-Noiser.", "Carol receives Bob\u2019s grainy, nightmarish scribble, and squints at it, recognizes that it\u2019s a fish, and begins touching-up the edges and textures, to make it like it should be. Yet, some of Bob\u2019s mistakes are so erroneous that they actually manage to mess Carol up! She makes the wrong corrections. Darn. That\u2019s why, in-between Bob\u2019s Heuristic and Carol\u2019s De-Noiser, we\u2019ll insert a few \u2018correction bits\u2019. [We have to find these, for each thing we compress; not worth it for a file or program you only use once, but for common software, yes.] It\u2019s just a gradient across the errors that remain, after the De-Noising. Here:", "Suppose that Carol made a mistake when she was touching-up Bob\u2019s finger-paint version; we ask \u2018which parts of Bob\u2019s image would have needed to be different, for Carol to have corrected it correctly?\u2019 A few bits will stand-out as sources of numerous, cascading misinterpretations; correct them, and store which ones you flipped as a sparse vector. Now, the next time someone sends Bob that \u2018seed\u2019, he\u2019ll make his same mistakes, you\u2019ll correct the onerous bits, and then Carol\u2019s touch-ups will go smoothly! Perfect :)", "Well, almost. Because, some of Carol\u2019s inaccuracies won\u2019t go away unless numerous bits of Bob\u2019s blobs begin to flip. We don\u2019t want to store all those in some overly-elaborate Generator neural network, so, any error bits that are difficult to eliminate are simply recorded and corrected at the very end. Thus, two stages of \u2018correction bits\u2019 \u2014 the first, between Bob\u2019s contortions and Carol\u2019s improvements; second, after Carol, to ensure perfect accuracy.", "There is a fundamental problem being addressed by this method, and it can be visualized as a horrific network of plumbing beneath a large public building. Tapestries of pipes interlace restrooms across every floor, and the worst part is: the city, to save money, can only afford pipe fittings with bizarre, over-stocked angles! 24-degree bends, 87-degree joints, egad! The plumbing is such a mess, because each pipe had to be measured and cut into awkward forms, to fit around each other simultaneously. THAT is spaghetti-code, and all the finnicky nuisances of traditional software. What do \u2018fuzzy approximate coverings\u2019 and \u2018correction bits\u2019 let us do?", "The fuzzy neural network is like a pipe with some flexibility \u2014 it can start-out from a fitting at 34 degrees, and bend along the path to dodge some other protrusion, ending-up in a pipe joint at 78 degrees. It can bend back and forth across a wide arc, in fact. You have a lot of options, from that one approximator. It\u2019s just a matter of whittling-down to the specific spot that you want, because otherwise your pipe might be spewing in some random, wobbling splatter. That specification is what correction bits do! They affix your pipe\u2019s joint to the wall, and provide an adjustable-socket collar for an extra bit of wiggle-room.", "Those simplifications, easing the rigid bureaucracy of the machine, let us short-circuit complex processes. At their fundamental level, these wiggly pipes and hinged joints un-clench the complexity and constraint of our software\u2019s plumbing. It flows simply, streamlined, few branches necessary. [Both the neural networks and the correction bits serve to tilt those connections; each does so in a complimentary way, and you are unlikely to see the same level of precise compression using neural networks on their own.]", "Taking a huge swath of software and files, and compressing them all together, gives the highest chance of finding nuanced, niche heuristics for regenerating and de-noising properly \u2014 for waves on a beach, or the lilt of a question, or columns of accounts, etc. Those heuristics are the lexicon for building your compression codecs. That is the hard part, and it\u2019ll need to be re-done as the bundle of compressed stuff accrues, demands shift, new efficiencies are uncovered.", "Yet, once software has been mapped, then inputs can be parsed among segments of neural network approximators, with a sparse log of correction bits along the way. These software-instance emulations can be done on the super-server, with only an encoding of the changes to the device\u2019s display being sent over the network. Instances of files that you \u2018share\u2019 between devices are merely receiving additions to the dictionary of authorized data-viewers and locations of embeddings in other portals. No need to actually send the bits of a file over a network; the super-server has the file, and it just sends each person a code for regenerating a picture of that file whenever you each need it.", "The process for building the map of a program\u2019s input \u2192output would also reveal potential bugs, hacks, missteps, and unmet needs. Each path can reveal some of the problems; when neural networks flag chunks of code for human review, and attempt to map the flow of each part analytically; when neural networks scrape-across the input-space, testing for thresholds which cause various bits to flip, as \u2018emergent features\u2019 of the input \u2192output behavior; as well as when users stumble upon such instances; and finally, with feedback from users of the compressed emulator, where you can explicitly flip to correct the bits of output without needing to hunt-down and fix the mistakes in the lines of code themselves\u2014 only the emulation is cured! Those added layers of stability and certainty are worth something, to the extent that software developers may be glad to contract their software onto an emulator-cloud, so that it can get a thorough de-bugging and hyper-scale roll-out with a minimal capital budget.
