Where your data is sampled from can have a drastic effect on its interpretation and sometimes on its meaning. For instance, take the classic painting from Hans Holbein the Younger, the Ambassadors. If you look at it straight, there\u2019s one part that seems odd. Difficult to make out. Maybe a mistake? But then, looking at it from the side, the mystery unfolds: it\u2019s a skull, warning that unsuspected dangers might lurk in places we\u2019re not paying attention to.", "In data science we\u2019re always confronted with different perspectives, although often we\u2019re not aware of it, especially in large-scale projects. The data that we\u2019re working with has been collected in a certain way, which is sometimes duly described. This means that even though we have access to the full dataset, we might not know exactly how it came to be. Nonetheless, our job is to analyze it and extract insights.", "One such task \u2014found across industries and that is experiencing a renaissance thanks to modern machine learning\u2014 is root cause analysis. Which, in more urgent situations, often appears less prosaically as: WTF just happened?", "At first everything is smooth and clear. The multi-dimensional data analyses with t-SNE contains clearly separable cluster. However, it\u2019s not a static dataset, it\u2019s one that evolves in time. And suddenly you notice that something changes. From one moment to the next, the whole neat structure collapses and all classes are mixed up.", "Let\u2019s take a step back. To identify the root cause, it is first necessary to describe what happened and how the situation evolved.", "Looking at how the clusters change in time, it is clear that the collapse is rather sudden. There are no obvious signs of propagation from one specific source. The fact that everything collapsed at the same time indicates that, whatever the cause was, it affected all classes of objects.", "The first observation is clear and let\u2019s us dig deeper. Were there signs of impending collapse? By looking closer at the distributions in time, we can see that at certain points in time, some clusters separate in 2. This implies that the recognition accuracy of a subset of classes started to deteriorate before the collapse.", "This finding is interesting because when correlated with the collapse these effects could act as warning indicators. Moreover, these kinds of observations can provide the rationale for getting access to specific portions of raw data and determine what actually happened. The power of conducting the statistical analysis before looking at the data is to identify portions that might be relevant, prioritizing them and thus be possibly faster.", "Looking at the raw data at the key identified moments shows that there is a clear cause: the data has been distorted and this change in perspective affects all classes.", "The first and second group from the left is not distorted and the shapes provide the learner sufficient information to clearly cluster each digit. While the fourth one all the way to the right does not contain discernible information, it's the third one that is more interesting. That one is tricky for the human eye to make out. The 0s at the top are the less affected by the perspective, while the 4s, 7s, and 9s start losing segments. When asked to recognise these digits, the accuracy is lower than with the first two.", "Now, back to root cause analysis, by hypothesising where this data went wrong. This sort of homogeneous transformation is a typical indicator of a change in the data sensor. In this case it could be that the camera looking at the numbers slowly tilted away, changing the perspective. The cause could be mechanical action through weather or a distortion of the lens. In any case, this hypothesis provides grounds enough to inspect and possibly replace the camera.", "What we saw is a way of monitoring the health of a Deep Learning application by using unsupervised learning and visualisation. However, how could we automate this? Visualisation is a powerful technique, but requires an expert human eye.", "One way to do it is to establish statistical measures on the visualisation. In other words, first you find the appropriate visualisation and then you find an appropriate measure that characterises the desired state. This measure can then be monitored automatically. In our example, such a measure could be a distance metric based on the silhouette method.", "These methods facilitate the first 2 of the typical 4 steps of root cause analysis:", "When dealing with millions or billions of data points, even seemingly small wins like these can be significant in corrective and preventive maintenance. They can make the difference between finding the problem on time or not and being able to avoid outages that affect many users.", "Your home for data science.
