These are the preliminary steps that we need to perform on almost every dataset. After completing the above processing, we ended up reducing features from 153 to 93. In this part, I will go over each feature manually, process them and remove unnecessary features.", "In the last part, we stored all the data points into a single dataFrame \u201cdf\u201d. Let's begin examining the shape of the data.", "We see that we now have 93 features. Before we examine every feature, we need to make a plot function for visualization purpose. I borrowed the following function from this link.", "The above function accepts two parameters; the first one is the feature name and the second one is the boolean variable: whether the feature is continuous or categorical. If the feature is continuous then function plot two subplots: (1) the distribution of the feature and (2) the two boxplots based on loan_status class. On the other hand, if the feature is categorical, then the first subplot is count plot and the second subplot is based on the group_by loan_status classes.", "Following codes are mostly self-explanatory. I sometimes omit detail explanation.", "It looks like all loans are not unique. The certain amount appears several times. It may be the reason; the company has some range or a certain amount to lend.", "It looks like applicants who could not afford to pay back and eventually were charged off had to pay a higher interest rate.", "It seems that grade and sub_grade have same shape and relation with loan status. In this case, I would keep sub_grade, because it carries more information than the grade.", "From the right plot, It looks like emp_lenght is not a strong predictor and has a little relationship with the loan status. I keep this feature right now, based on the model performance we may delete it.", "The verification_status feature is somewhat discriminating in the sense that, among the applicants whose source was verified are more likely to be charged off which is a little bit wired.", "The \u2018issude_d\u2019 feature is the string. Since we are dealing with three years of data and keep our model independent of year, I only extract month and then convert them into categories.", "It looks like people who borrowed in December, are more likely to be charged off than those who borrowed in other months. Interesting indeed.", "Since URL has nothing to do with loan_status, I simply remove it.", "It looks like, purpose can be a good discriminatory. For example, people who borrowed loans for renewable energy are more likely to be charged off than the applicants who borrowed a loan for cars or educational purpose.", "Since the title and zip code has many unique values, I simply remove them from the feature space.", "\u201caddr_state\u201d feature has fifty unique values since there are fifty states. If we look at the plot below, we see that certain states applicants paid back more than others. Therefore, this feature can be discriminatory.", "After manually checking every feature, I ended up having 61 irrelevant. Let's see the features selected to drop.", "And finally I drop all of the above features:", "In the above code, we see that there are 36 final features ready for creating a loan prediction model. Let also examine if there are any missing values in any of the selected 36 features.", "If you run the above code, you see that \u2018dti\u2019 and \u2018revol_util\u2019 have 21 and 223 missing values. I use panda\u2019s dropna() method to remove those examples associated with missing values.", "It\u2019s time to encode some of the categorical features. In the following code, I encoded \u2018purpose\u2019, \u2018home_ownership\u2019, \u2018grade\u2019, \u2018sub_grade\u2019, \u2018addr_state\u2019:", "Alright, let's save the final dataset with the selected features.", "In the next part of the series, I will some exploratory analysis. If possible do some feature engineerings. In the meantime, if you have any question regarding this part, please feel free write a comment below or you can reach out to me:", "Your home for data science.
