Some of those skills include, but are not limited to: communication, statistics, organization, and lastly, programming. Programming can be quite vague, for example, some companies in an interview could ask for a data scientist to code in Python a common pandas\u2019 functions, while other companies can require a complete take on software engineering with classes.", "As I have been apart of several positions and a wide array of various companies, I have encountered data scientists and software engineers, and therefore have developed a good sense of what is required to become a successful data scientist. Below, I will outline software engineering and data science, and answer the question: \u201cIs Software Engineering a Prerequisite for Data Science?\u201d.", "Just like data science, this field within computer science can include several different skills. However, most of these roles will require you to be proficient in at least one programming language, as well as know the software development lifecycle. The programming and coding languages often used by software engineers are [2]:", "One of these main languages that stand out is Python. That is because this language is also commonly utilized by data scientists.", "Another set of skills are knowing how to practice Object-Oriented Design (OOD) with these specific concepts:", "Perhaps, these concepts are not as widely used in data science positions; however, they can provide a better model process with efficient automation and scalability. With machine learning models, comes a lot of data that needs to be either monitored constantly, changed, transformed, removed, and so on. Employing these concepts with Python programming language will not only impress your engineering department, but it will also allow you to work more independently. Similarly, when collaborating with not only data scientists, but software engineers as well, the process of building a model and its deployment will be much more robust and efficient.", "The example below shows how using a class can be helpful in accessing sklearn libraries for your machine learning model. This class can be accessed as well by referencing it in a pipeline that will transform your text and numeric features appropriately for your pandas dataframe. While this could be done without software engineering or OOD, it is much faster, easier, and scalable in this format below. Below, is the code and gist for the example (same code, different visuals):", "If you have not already been able to tell, I am pro-software engineering learning as a data scientist. Software engineering not only helps to improve on scalability with machine learning models, but it also aids in integrations as well. With Python functions, you can read in data, train your model, and deploy it to a new environment so that your suggestions or predictions will be outputted into the best place for the end-user. Perhaps the most important, yet most simple way of using software engineering or simply practicing OOD and Python functions, in general, is considerably shrinking the amount of time and code needed to perform a certain task. A lot of exploratory data analysis and model building can involve lines and lines of redundant code, yet with some simple functions, a data scientist can take in dataframes and manipulate them so that certain row values are used or certain columns are ingested as features.", "While some data scientists prefer to code in R, I believe Python is better for a number of reasons (see link below for more information). Below is an example of a simple way to perform some natural language processing (NLP) on a text column in a pandas dataframe using Python. In this code snippet, you can see data in \u2018text_field\u2019 is composed of strings, numbers, and special characters. To remove this unwanted dirty data from the column, you could use techniques where you perform a task line by line for each column, but rather, in this example, a cleaning function was developed so that all of the cleaning methods used can be accessed from one place. You can also further improve on this example by creating another function that would apply to a list of dataframe columns in a for loop. Additionally, you could add more cleaning steps that will ultimately satisfy your goal of cleaning messy text data. Below, is the code and gist for the example (same code, different visuals):", "Is Software Engineering a Prerequisite for Data Science?", "The answer is yes. Oftentimes, data scientists will struggle in their careers, especially right out of college, because they will have to work with software engineers and deploy their own models. While you can be a data scientist who focuses just on statistics and one-off tasks at a smaller company (also just as respectable and common), it is best to dive-in and learn OOD so that you can conclusively be the best, most successful data scientist. With software engineering, you will be able to converse with other engineers, deploy complex models, and scale your powerful and useful machine learning model to more and more of the business.", "If your focus in the past has been primiraly on data science, statistics, and programming on a smaller scale, it is never too late to improve upon your overall coding skillset to resemble that of a software engineer.", "I hope you found this article both interesting and useful.
