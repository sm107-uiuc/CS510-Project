We are not health professionals or epidemiologists, and the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice. To learn more about the coronavirus pandemic, you can click here.", "The San Francisco Bay Area was the first in the nation to initiate shelter-in-place. The counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Mateo, and Santa Clara and in the cities of San Francisco and Berkeley acted on March 17th, 2020 urging people to stay home. The state of California was not far behind, with Governor Gavin Newsom issuing the statewide shelter-in-place order March 19th 2020.", "So far, California has been one of the most prudent and responsible states in their approach to dealing with COVID-19. Personally, I am grateful to live in a state that takes this threat seriously. Over the past few months I have been frequently impressed with the swift and decisive steps Gov. Gavin Newsom has taken to curtail the spread of this virus.", "That said, I think the easing of lockdown restrictions may be cause for concern. To explain why, we\u2019ll need to look at the data.", "Above is a chart showing the daily new cases of COVID-19 over time. I\u2019ve highlighted the number of daily new cases from March 19th \u2014 the day Gov. Newsom initiated shelter-in-place. You can see that there were 177 new cases that day.", "Now look at this chart. This is the same chart but highlighting the number of new cases on Saturday May 23rd. There were 2,287 new cases that day.", "COVID-19 daily new cases 10 times higher now than they were when lockdown started", "177 versus 2,287. Even if I\u2019m generous and round the first number up to 200 and the second number down to 2,000, that\u2019s still a 10 fold increase. COVID-19 daily new cases are 10 times higher now than they were when lockdown started.", "Yes, that\u2019s an important consideration. After all, the state has been testing like crazy. According to the state\u2019s coronavirus data webpage they have now conducted 1.5 million tests total.", "But unfortunately, the chart providing that data does not show what we actually need to know to evaluate how much testing is affecting the rate of confirmed new cases. To understand that, we need the number of tests conducted per day. This chart shows the total number of tests conducted. That means that for each day this chart shows, the number associated with that day is the total number of lab tests conducted for all time. That means every data point is the number of tests conducted that day plus the sum of all tests conducted on previous days. A chart like this is not actually that useful beyond showing us the total number of tests \u2014 a figure which is already given at the top.", "I find it curious that they don\u2019t have a chart for the number of tests conducted each day on the page. If you have one of these sets of data, you almost certainly have the other.", "Luckily, the Coronavirus Data Hub does have a testing chart if you add a filter specifically for California.", "From this chart we see that on March 19th the state conducted around 1100 tests for COVID-19. Whereas on May 24th they conducted around 67,000 tests. That means the state is conducting 60 times more tests than they were when this all started.", "Well, yes and no. Yes that means that a smaller percentage of the tests are coming back positive than when California first started testing. But unfortunately it does not actually tell us anything about whether things are getting better. In order for that to give us actionable information, we would have had to have been doing random sampling from the start \u2014 and that\u2019s just not how you test during a pandemic.", "In the beginning we were only testing those people who were showing the worst and most obvious COVID-19 symptoms. Now as our testing capacity has increased, we\u2019ve been able to test more and more people, including many people who show no symptoms. So it is a natural consequence of our testing procedure that the percentage of positive tests would decrease as we test more and more people.", "The truth is, the number of new infections per day when we first started testing was likely orders of magnitude higher than 200 per day but because we weren\u2019t doing enough testing we didn\u2019t know how bad it really was.", "Making decisions in the absence data or with inconclusive data is gambling. That\u2019s what we are doing by easing the lockdown in California.", "The state of California has 39.51 million people. That means that even at our highest testing rate of 67,000 tests per day, we are only testing 0.2 percent of the population per day. Thus the numbers we are getting for the daily new cases are likely still quite far away from the true number of new cases.", "If 200 new cases per day was sufficient reason to initiate lockdown in March, 10x that number should be sufficient reason to continue it now", "We simply don\u2019t know enough to determine whether it\u2019s safe to open. Since it\u2019s people's lives that hang in the balance, it might be prudent to keep restrictions in place until we have real data showing it is safe. Not just that it\u2019s getting better, but that it\u2019s actually safe. Right now, none of the data out there can tell us that conclusively.", "Making decisions in the absence data or with inconclusive data, is gambling. And that\u2019s what we are doing by easing the lockdown in California.", "If 200 new cases per day was a sufficient reason to initiate lockdown in March, 10x that number should be sufficient reason to continue it now.", "Your home for data science.
