The expected cost of Quicksort is \u0398(nlgn), while the worst case that costs \u0398(n\u00b2) would materialize only at a probability of 2/n!. I will show later in the performance comparison that the constant hidden in \u0398 notation is lower in Quicksort thus the algorithm outperforms Merge-Sort whose cost is same \u0398(nlgn).", "Insertion-Sort is a brute-force algorithm that compares all the pairs in an array to sort it. This is how people commonly sort their hands in porker or other card games. The cost is \u0398(n\u00b2).", "We discussed Merge-Sort algorithm as one of the basic divide-conquer algorithms in the previous article. This time, we\u2019ll use a simpler version because we\u2019re dealing with just one-dimensional arrays.", "The Quicksort algorithm picks a pivot randomly from an array and divides the original array into two subarrays: a subarray that consists of numbers smaller than the pivot and the other with larger numbers. By doing that recursively, we will eventually obtain the sorted array.", "Here is a simple example, and you have an array of eight numbers. Randomly selected pivot turned to be six in this case. Then you assign numbers smaller than six into the left subarray and larger ones to the right.", "The next step is applying the algorithm recursively to the subarrays; random pivots are now two in the left (smaller) subarray and seven in the right (larger). By doing that recursively, you will end up with a sorted array.", "In the worst case, you may pick random pivots in ascending or descending order (e.g. one to eight, or eight to one in the example above) and the cost would be \u0398(n\u00b2). That is, however, ignorable as it takes place only at a probability of 2/n! (once in 21,600 times in the example). So we consider the expected cost of the algorithm instead.", "The cost of sorting algorithms depends on how many pairs they compare. Let\u2019s think about the probability at which two numbers in an array, Zi and Zj (i<j), are compared. Zi and Zj are directly compared only when either Zi or Zj is selected as a pivot, and are never directly compared if any number between Zi and Zj is picked as a pivot (Zi and Zj are assigned to separate subarrays). When a pivot is selected outside of Zi and Zj, it does not affect the probability because Zi and Zj stay in the same subarray. Thus, the probability that Zi and Zj are directly compared is 2/(j - i+1).", "The expected number of comparison is, therefore, the sum of 2/(j - i+1) for all pairs of numbers in the array.", "With a few deformations as shown on the left, we find that the number converges into familiar \u0398(nlgn). We can say the expected cost of Quicksort algorithm is \u0398(nlgn).", "We can write Quicksort algorithm in-place, which means that the algorithm stores only constant amount of data outside of the original array. In-place algorithms offer an advantage of less memory-usage. Here is the code of in-place Quicksort algorithm.", "Obviously Merge-Sort and Quicksort have an edge over Insertion-Sort, with their slopes flatter than that of Insertion-Sort. With a lower constant hidden in \u0398(nlgn) notation, Quicksort algorithm is faster than Merge-Sort, while Quicksort-in-place takes as much time as Merge-Sort (i.e. in-place advantage is cancelled out by some other costs).", "As Quicksort algorithm contains some randomness, it is useful to look at the distribution of costs over trials. Here is the histogram of costs for Quicksort and Merge-Sort algorithms processing 2\u00b9\u2070 numbers with 10,000 trials. It is noted that Merge-Sort is also prone to randomness as shown in the figure. Both of the distributions are tilted toward the cheapest end (left).", "One thing we learn from Quicksort algorithm is that randomness can be our friend. Quicksort processes a large set of numbers much more efficiently than other sorting algorithms. With proper knowledge of probability theory, we may be able to write less costly algorithms.", "Your home for data science.
