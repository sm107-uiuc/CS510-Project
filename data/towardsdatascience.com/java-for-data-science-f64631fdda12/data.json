Data scientists are expected to have good coding chops in Python (or R). I argue that Java should be added as a useful tool in the data science skillset.", "Since 1995, Java has been sipping espresso and writing killer apps, occasionally sending a wistful glance out the cafe window. It\u2019s probable there\u2019s already a Java app that could help you with your work as a data scientist.", "This article will help you get a sense of the essentials, understand how Java could be used to support machine learning, and check out some resources for further learning. This article does not intend to teach you the actual syntax of this versatile language. This article will not offer to buy your espresso, but Java might.", "Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed for interoperability. You could say Java has a devil-may care attitude when it comes to the deployment environment \u2014 an app written in Java can run on any operating system that can run the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This flexibility is why Java is a favorite of app developers seeking to create a tool that is operating system agnostic and will transfer well to mobile.", "A java program\u2019s source code (the .java file) is written in curly-brace heavy syntax. The program is compiled down to bytecode (a .class file) that can run on the JVM.", "A program is compiled from source code (e.g., pdfParsingApp.java) to bytecode (e.g., pdfParsingApp.class) by typing javac pdfParsingApp.java", "If you\u2019re familiar with the concept of machine code from computer science fundamentals, java bytecode is analogous \u2014 but instead of being written for the specific architecture of the host computer, the bytecode is written for the virtual machine.", "The JVM translates the Java bytecode into the platform\u2019s machine language \u2014 this is what gives Java its interoperability. The JVM is capable of translating from languages such as Clojure, Scala, and others that compile down to Java bytecode.", "While Python may be the lingua franca of the data science world (with R playing a role to a lesser extent), in terms of the broader developer community, Java is used by an estimated 40% programmers. Because of its widespread adoption, having at least a cursory understanding of how Java packages are structured, written, and implemented can help a data scientist communicate more effectively with their software engineering colleagues.", "Moreover, understanding Java is helpful for the data acquisition and deployment phases of the machine learning pipeline.", "At the data acquisition stage, Java is helpful because production code bases are often written in Java. As a data scientist, the ability to go upstream to fix bad data before it enters the machine learning pipeline is invaluable. Behind SQL (used by 55% of programmers), Java is probably the most helpful language for addressing backend data issues and for cleaning up data.", "For example, in natural language processing (NLP), we deal with a lot of unstructured text data that\u2019s designed to be readable to humans but not to computers. Apache PDFBox is a Java library designed to address the challenge of wrangling text from a PDF into a usable format. Not only does this tool support content extraction, it can also be used to modify existing documents and create new ones. That would be a really cool way to report the output of your machine learning model built on text analytics.", "Speaking of deployment, Java affords a simple introduction into Scala. This super-fast language runs on the JVM and is often used by DevOps engineers to put machine learning models into production.", "The most powerful argument for learning Java is that it provides a strong foundation for improving your object-oriented programming. Computer science 101 classes are often taught with Java as the base language to provide instruction on data structures & algorithms. Because Java doesn\u2019t offer as much abstraction as Python, it will improve your overall knowledge of computer science fundamentals.", "Bottom line: there is a net benefit for everyone \u2014 data scientists, software engineers, and the organization in which they operate \u2014 when data science is positioned squarely within the practice of computer science.", "Python is a dynamically typed, interpreted language. When writing Python code, the programmer doesn\u2019t have to declare the type of each variable \u2014 the type is dynamic and changeable. At runtime, the interpret executes a Python program by translating each statement into a sequence of subroutines, then into machine code.", "Java is a statically typed, compiled language. When creating a new variable in Java, the programmer is responsible for declaring the type. That type is then static \u2014 it cannot be changed. Static typing also means errors are caught in compilation, not at runtime. We\u2019ve already talked about the role of the JVM in translating from intermediate Java bytecode (i.e., the .class file created by compilation) into machine code that is specific to the underlying computer hardware.", "There are many more rules to working with Java than working with Python \u2014 both in terms of syntax (e.g. static typing) as well as package structure. For example, a Java source file can only contain one public class. The source file must be named for the public class it contains.", "For example, the program pdfParsingApp.java will look something like:", "The public static void main line must appear in every Java program (with the exception of programs that are part of a package library). This is the start of the main method that runs at execution and essentially tells the Java program what to do. Other classes within the program may provide information that is used by the main method.", "Learning Java is a good step toward getting comfortable with the idea that an enterprise machine learning pipeline is often composed of multiple languages. You might use technology related to Java and the JVM in order to gather data, clean data, and productionize your model. Plus, adding Java to your stack will improve your ability to write class-based, object-oriented programs.", "Hopefully, this article gave you a bit of an intuition for how Java could be useful to your DS work. Using your familiarity with Python (or R), you can quickly build toward better understanding of Java \u2014 and better apps and model deployments.", "If you enjoyed reading this article, follow me on Medium, LinkedIn, and Twitter for more ideas to advance your data science skills.", "Your home for data science.
