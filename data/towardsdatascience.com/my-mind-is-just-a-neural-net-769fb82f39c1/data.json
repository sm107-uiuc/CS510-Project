To be clear, data science should play more nicely with Philosophy too. When analyzing the ethical dilemmas that rise from big data, it\u2019s evident that moral philosophy is crucial for improving data science. That\u2019s a discussion for another day though. Today, it is time to discuss the converse; how data science can improve Philosophy.", "Questions that will be addressed in this article:", "Okay, maybe not that last one. But A+ to you for paying attention.", "In order to discuss the mind in relation to neural nets, I want to make sure everyone is on the same page here. There is no need to be a professional data scientist or a philosopher king to participate. I\u2019m going to explain both neural nets and the mind-body problem at a high level so the concepts don\u2019t obscure potential epiphanies. Buckle up, open your mind, and hold on to your predispositions; I present to you: the mind-body problem.", "There are two options. Either our body and our mind are two distinct entities [Dualism], or they are one in the same [Monism]. Philosophers have debated this issue since the foundation of religion. If the mind is separate from the body, it\u2019s possible that there exists an eternal soul capable of outliving a decaying earthly self. If the mind is the body though, our thoughts, beliefs, and memories will die simultaneously with our carbon-being.", "In order to turn neural nets from a buzzword into comprehensible vocabulary, consider this pancake metaphor. Let\u2019s say that I am a hypothetical pancake connoisseur. Every Sunday, I whip out the buttermilk and the frying pan in an attempt to create the perfect salivation-inducing, butter-melting, sensory-overloading flapjack. But, after years of practice I still can\u2019t seem to make anything greater than a Bisquick flopjack.", "I decide the only logical solution is to outsource my pancake creation abilities; I\u2019m going to train a neural net to do it for me. I\u2019ll need a few things:", "Don\u2019t focus too heavily on the hidden stuff just yet, we\u2019ll go over that. Notice the significance of the red lines. Each unit from one layer is connected to each unit in the next layer.", "Usually the simplest connection weights are numbers between -1 and 1, but for this example the connection weights were randomly chosen to be 8, 2, and 1. This is the first trial\u2019s input for the feature \u2018Minutes on Second Side\u2019.", "For example, say the activation function = f. Then f(x) would tell us what number to put in the \u2018hidden stuff\u2019 (remember x is the summation of all the incoming weights). Words are confusing so take a look at this visual for clarification:", "The way that the layers of a neural net work, this process would continue through all of the hidden layers. This is called forward propagation. Finally, the activation function of the output unit(s) would lead to the neural net spitting out \u2018Good Pancake\u2019.", "In order to make the visuals more understandable, I placed the \u2018Good Pancake\u2019 inside of the output unit. Really, the output unit would look something more like f(5.4). Then, based off of some algorithm (ReLU is common) f(5.4) = \u2018Good Pancake\u2019.", "Keep in mind that there could be many more output units. Maybe f(5.4), f(1.2), f(3), etc\u2026 Then the algorithm would take into account all of these output units and spit out \u2018Good Pancake\u2019. For simplicity, we\u2019ll stick with one output unit for now.", "So how do we fix this? By a process called back propagation, the neural net is able to modify the connection weights so that it will be more likely to guess the correct answer in the future. Theoretically, as I provide more training data, the neural net should learn from its mistakes until it gets as accurate as possible.", "Phew, that was a lot of technical jargon. Now we understand what our mind might be and how neural nets work\u2026 but how does my mind work?", "Think a little bit closer at the example from above. Based off of many trials, the neural net will eventually be able to pretty accurately determine what factors lead to a \u2018Good Pancake\u2019 and what factors create a \u2018Bad Pancake\u2019.", "Isn\u2019t that how humans learn? What if I decided to not outsource my culinary skills to a neural net? Here\u2019s what would happen:", "According to my first trial, I make a pancake with butter on the pan, leave it on the first side for a minute, flip it, and leave it on the other side for 30 seconds. I take a bite. That\u2019s a good pancake. Forward propagation.", "In the second trial, I\u2019m feeling a bit adventurous. I don\u2019t add any butter to the pan, leave the pancake on the first side for two minutes, flip it, leave it on the other side for one minute, flatten it with a spatula, and take a bite. It wouldn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that I\u2019ve taken a bite of a terrible pancake. It\u2019s burnt, flat, and dry.", "Now I know that at least one of the things I changed from trial one to trial two caused my pancake to go from good to bad. Maybe in my third trial I\u2019ll do the same thing I did in the first trial, but I\u2019ll only change one of those pancake-making attributes. Backward propagation. I make another good pancake.", "Eventually, if I do this enough, in theory I will become a pancake making expert. I\u2019ll have created an informal mental algorithm that understands which variability in heat, cooking time for each side, and spatula flattening leads to good pancakes; and which combination of those leads to bad pancakes. Maybe my friends will start to trust my cooking skills. It seems like my mind is working just like a neural net does. Or rather, my mind is working as a Connectionist Network.", "Outside of pancake concoction, there are a few other striking arguments in favor of Connectionism. One of the biggest arguments states that neural nets are good at what we are good at, and bad at what we are bad at. I\u2019m talking facial recognition, mental math, memorization, etc. Neural nets struggle with the same problems that our minds struggle with. They are also really great at identifying a familiar face from a crowd.", "At this point, the Connectionist argument looks to be a bit promising. But, if my mind can be deduced down to an algorithm\u2026 am I even in charge of my own decisions? Does free will exist?", "In order to answer the question about free will, we\u2019ll have to check back in with our good old friend Descartes. For proponents of Dualism, free will exists because our mind (soul) is separate from our brain (body). For proponents of pretty much everything else\u2026 our mind is just a behavior, a calculation, or a combination of weighted features.", "To a Connectionist, if I believe the sky is blue, my thought can be deduced to an input of features that led me to that belief. My knowledge of the color blue and the sky combined with my visual cortex is sent through my neurotransmitters (similar to the diagrams above) in parallel until I reach f(5.7). Or rather, f(5.7) = my belief that the sky is blue.", "There\u2019s two questions that still need to be addressed:", "In theory, as neural nets become increasingly efficient and scarily accurate, they become more and more like the human brain. Although Connectionism seems to be the most logically promising mind-body theory, the above questions have only been answered in relation to the Computational Theory of the Mind (CTM). Weak AI surrounds us everyday, but Strong AI has yet to be made.", "Remember that CTM is similar to a Turing Machine. It explains how the human mind can be narrowed down to a minute set of 0s and 1s. With CTM, the syntax of the world (like the amount of time a pancake is being cooked on one side) combines with our neurotransmitters to create semantics in the world (my burnt pancake tastes bad). Syntax is observable information, semantics are what that information actually means to us.", "In the past, humans have thought that strong AI and emotional understanding in AI would stem from semantical understanding. Right now, robots, chatbots, and AI agents can just process information. There isn\u2019t any indication that a higher level of understanding is emerging.", "To explain further, imagine this thought experiment (known as the Chinese Room). In this experiment, there is a person in a room filled with filing cabinets. Theoretically, these cabinets are infinitely filled with english-written instructions on how to respond to questions in Chinese. When the person in the room is given a phrase in Chinese slipped underneath the door, they look up instructions for how to respond to the given question, write down the new Chinese characters, and slip it back underneath the door.", "It would seem to a bystander that the person in the room is fluent in Chinese. They are able to see questions in Chinese and provide Chinese responses to them. This person would pass the Turing Test. But, does the person in the room actually understand Chinese? They have learned how to create responses from the syntax of written Chinese characters, but they wouldn\u2019t have any knowledge of the language outside of the room. There aren\u2019t any semantics involved.", "The same argument is said for AI. Even though robots will most likely get to a point where they can pass a Turing Test and seem as though they are understanding us, is there really any understanding going on in their bot-brain? If AI is created using an instruction-based solution, it follows that the robot would have as little understanding as the man in the Chinese room. Although an AI agent might tell me it \u201cfeels sad\u201d, is that statement just a coded response, or is it really feeling sad? True strong AI seems to be better suited for something like a neural net.", "The Eliminativist at this point would argue that semantics simply don\u2019t exist. Humans have been deceived by our own brains just as we see a mirage in the desert on a scorching day. We think that we understand the world at some higher level than syntax, but we don\u2019t. Our minds really are nothing but a set of instructions, or a Connectionist Network.", "Wow\u2026 so according to CTM and Connectionism, the mind is just some scientifically observable entity. There is no metaphysical, divine dimension that my thoughts live in. Life is meaningless. Philosophy and data science are finally playing together in the sandbox, but I don\u2019t know if I want them to anymore!", "Don\u2019t worry. It isn\u2019t quite time to deny the existence of free will and submit to a pessimistic, determinist outlook on life just yet. Yes, neural nets are getting better, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Connectionism is the one-stop-shop for strong AI.", "First, neural nets take much longer to learn than humans do. Length in this case doesn\u2019t necessarily mean time, it means trials. While networks usually take hundreds of thousands of samples to effectively learn, humans can learn similar tasks in significantly less trials; and usually with greater accuracy.", "Second, neural nets struggle with rationality, systematicity, and structure. Basically, this means that humans are better at logic and structure when it comes to language. Take this sentence as an example:", "\u201cIf Daniel cuts his hair, John will cry. Daniel cuts his hair.\u201d", "As humans, we can logically deduce that John will now cry. Interestingly though, neural nets struggle with this concept. Similarly, if Daniel doesn\u2019t cut his hair, neural nets are inclined to think that John will not cry. Which, as propositional logic has proved, isn\u2019t necessarily true.", "That\u2019s up to you. There\u2019s a reason that Philosophers have debated this issue for hundreds of years. Neural nets and weak AI are slowly filling some holes in promising theories. This doesn\u2019t mean they are the only answer.", "Dualism and determinism will always be at war with one another. Things that can\u2019t be observed (like: the mind) provide gaps in scientific knowledge (like: \u2018what is a thought?\u2019). In history, religion acted as a \u2018God of the Gaps\u2019. It filled the holes of scientific knowledge. As science got better, religion was needed to explain less and less. In AI, the scientific gaps have historically been filled with Philosophy. Just as the case has been with religion; it seems that as science gets better, certain Philosophical theories are in trouble.", "My advice? Try not to overthink it. Our semantics are what we make of them. Maybe my mind is an asomatous being that can make its own decisions and have its own beliefs. Maybe my mind is nothing but 0s and 1s. Whether my thoughts are real or mirages, I\u2019m going to keep living my life; and that\u2019s the best I can do.", "Your home for data science.
