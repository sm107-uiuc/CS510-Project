See the Chi-square test of independence if you need to study the relationship between two qualitative nominal variables.", "In this article, we use the mtcars dataset (loaded by default in R):", "The variables vs and am are categorical variables, so they are removed for this article:", "The correlation between 2 variables is found with the cor() function.

It gives us an indication on two things:", "Regarding the direction of the relationship: On the one hand, a negative correlation implies that the two variables under consideration vary in opposite directions, that is, if a variable increases the other decreases and vice versa. On the other hand, a positive correlation implies that the two variables under consideration vary in the same direction, i.e., if a variable increases the other one increases and if one decreases the other one decreases as well.", "Regarding the strength of the relationship: The more extreme the correlation coefficient (the closer to -1 or 1), the stronger the relationship. This also means that a correlation close to 0 indicates that the two variables are independent, that is, as one variable increases, there is no tendency in the other variable to either decrease or increase.", "As an illustration, the Pearson correlation between horsepower (hp) and miles per gallon (mpg) found above is -0.78, meaning that the 2 variables vary in opposite direction. This makes sense, cars with more horsepower tend to consume more fuel (and thus have a lower millage par gallon). On the contrary, from the correlation matrix we see that the correlation between miles per gallon (mpg) and the time to drive 1/4 of a mile (qsec) is 0.42, meaning that fast cars (low qsec) tend to have a worse millage per gallon (low mpg). This again make sense as fast cars tend to consume more fuel.", "The correlation matrix is however not easily interpretable, especially when the dataset is composed of many variables.

At the 5% significance level, we do not reject the null hypothesis of no correlation. We therefore conclude that we do not reject the hypothesis that there is no linear relationship between the 2 variables.1", "This test proves that even if the correlation coefficient is different from 0 (the correlation is 0.09 in the sample), it is actually not significantly different from 0 in the population.", "Note that the p-value of a correlation test is based on the correlation coefficient and the sample size. The larger the sample size and the more extreme the correlation (closer to -1 or 1), the more likely the null hypothesis of no correlation will be rejected. With a small sample size, it is thus possible to obtain a relatively large correlation in the sample (based on the correlation coefficient), but still find a correlation not significantly different from 0 in the population (based on the correlation test). For this reason, it is recommended to always perform a correlation test before interpreting a correlation coefficient to avoid flawed conclusions.", "A nice and easy way to report results of a correlation test in R is with the report() function from the {report} package:", "As you can see, the function interprets the test (together with the correlation coefficient and the p-value) for you.", "Note that the report() function can be used for other analyses.

An article about correlation would not be complete without discussing about causation.", "A non-zero correlation between two variables does not necessarily mean that there is a cause and effect relationship between these two variables!", "Indeed, a significant correlation between two variables means that changes in one variable are associated (positively or negatively) with changes in the other variable. Nonetheless, a significant correlation does not indicates that variations in one variable cause the variations in the other variable.", "A non-zero correlation between X and Y can appear in several cases:", "Sometimes it is quite clear that there is a causal relationship between two variables. Take for example the correlation between the price of a consumer product such as milk and its consumption. It is quite obvious that there is a causal link between the two: if the price of milk increases, it is expected that its consumption will decrease.", "However, this causal link is not always present even if the correlation is significant. Maurage, Heeren, and Pesenti (2013) showed that, although there is a positive and significant correlation between chocolate consumption and the number of Nobel laureates, this correlation comes from the fact that a third variable, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), causes chocolate consumption and the number of Nobel laureates. They found that countries with higher GDP tend to have a higher level of chocolate consumption and scientific research (leading to more Nobel laureates).", "This example shows that one must be very cautious when interpreting correlations and avoid over-interpreting a correlation as a causal relationship.", "Thanks for reading.
