There\u2019s no way for you to actually get what\u2019s going on if you don\u2019t do things manually, at least at the beginning.", "Okay, thus far we\u2019ve discussed what\u2019s wrong with most of the stuff available online. In the next section we\u2019ll make an introduction to the book and course that is a possible game-changer and I\u2019ll also give a couple of reasons why.", "Disclaimer: I\u2019m in no way, shape, or form affiliated with the owner of the course, I don\u2019t know him personally and everything you read will be based purely on personal experience.", "If you\u2019ve been studying any data science related topic from YouTube, you probably know for the channel sentdex. I loved to watch his videos back in the day for basic machine learning, and even for the Go programming language.", "Earlier this year (in January I think) he made an announcement about an upcoming book and course called Neural Networks From Scratch.", "He claimed that the purpose of the course was to code out neurons, layers, activation functions, optimizers, gradients, backpropagation \u2014 pretty much everything \u2014 completely from scratch, even without Numpy at first. Later the code would be \u201ctranslated\u201d to Numpy just because pure Python isn\u2019t that strong and convenient for mathematics.", "You can watch the full introduction video below, although I just gave you the two-sentence summary:", "So after some consideration, I went on the book\u2019s official website and bought the EBook format, which I\u2019m currently reading.", "And I must say, it delivers.", "If you don\u2019t want to spend $30 for the book, you can still watch the YouTube playlist completely for free. It follows the book, but the book goes in quite more detail \u2014 so keep that in mind.", "Right now the book is still in a draft format, and that\u2019s great if you ask me. As a reader, you are able to leave comments on any section you didn\u2019t find 100% clear, and you will either get a response to your comment or the whole section in the book will get explained better.", "Even in the draft format, there are still around 250 pages for you to read and as deep learning is a complex topic, it will require multiple sittings. So no, you won\u2019t be running out of materials any time soon.", "With all of the pros being stated I still have some things that concern me, and will probably concern you if you decide to with this route. Let\u2019s discuss them in the next section.", "Now this part is only me thinking out loud, and things listed below may not affect you, but you should be aware of them.", "Once again, those might not be a real drawback to you \u2014 maybe you don\u2019t care about Convolutional or Recurrent neural networks, or maybe you already know how to use PyTorch or TensorFlow, but the theory part is a pain in the bottom.", "Judge for yourself, but keep those two points in mind.", "Okay, we covered both the good and \u201cbad\u201d things about the book and course.", "The short answer is \u2014 absolutely yes. But don\u2019t pull out your wallet just yet. There\u2019s a probability that you won\u2019t like the course \u2014 as we are all different and have different learning methods \u2014 so before buying the book please check out the YouTube playlist to see if it is all you wished for.", "Who knows, maybe the YouTube videos are enough for you and you don\u2019 want to dive deeper \u2014 which is okay too.", "But if you want a deeper and from scratch dive, I warmly recommend the book.", "Loved the article?
