We restrict the data to only 6 months because we continuously deploy new automation and fix some regular expression issues, so to prevent wrong/old data to be used, the smaller interval should be enough.", "The raw data set that we retrieve from our data lake has 14 columns, but we will focus only on the necessary ones to create the model.", "In this particular case, as component and sub component are additional to summary information, we decided to concatenate these three fields creating a \u201cfeature\u201d field, this process will make the next steps easier, besides that, we set all content to lowercase.", "In some countries we have incidents with more than one language, English and Spanish for example, to solve that we used two libs, the langdetect to check the language of the incident, we adopted English as our main language, and googletrans to translate the incident to English if necessary. This process can take a few hours depending on your data set size, we tried to filter only the necessary text to translate to English.", "To finish this step, we separate the data into feature and class, the automation_name is the class we want to predict and the feature is the result of the processing we did above.", "Having the two fields ready, we can finally start the machine learning phase itself. To make it simple to run our model, we create a pipeline, the pipeline has three main components:", "One important step in this phase is to remove the stop words and punctuations, this two components can create a complexity not necessary for our case, so using the nltk library and the function below attached to CountVectorizer, we get rid of them.", "After the pipeline, it is business as usual, we separated the data into training and test and will evaluate the results of each classifier.", "In this particular case, we want a balanced metric of Precision and Recall, as at this point, none of them can cause more trouble than the other. Having this in mind, we chose to evaluate the F1-Score and Macro Average, we tried a few classifiers and you can check the results below:", "The model that best fit our data was XGBoost, but there a lot of more things you can do to improve these numbers, like hyperparameter optimization, upsampling the minority classes, and a few others, but I will let you try this by your own. :)", "To use this in production, we were required to have some guarantees that the classifier predicts the automation with a probability above a certain threshold, to do this we used the predict_proba from the sklearn lib, this function returns the probability that the classifier returned for each class, having this and the threshold, which we set as 97%, we were able to implement and monitor the classifier in production without worries. Here is the snippet that we used for that:", "Hope this article will help you to understand how to work with text data using Machine Learning and how we found an opportunity and applied this in our day to day job willing to improve our client's satisfaction.", "Your home for data science.
