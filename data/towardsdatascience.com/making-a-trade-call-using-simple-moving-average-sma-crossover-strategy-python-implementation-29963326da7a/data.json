For example, a moving average crossover often signals an upcoming trend change. Applying the moving average crossover strategy to a price chart allows traders to identify areas where the trend changes the direction creating a potential trading opportunity.", "Before we begin, you may consider going through below article to get yourself accustomed with some common finance jargons associated with stock market.", "A moving average, also called as rolling average or running average is a used to analyze the time-series data by calculating a series of averages of the different subsets of full dataset.", "Moving averages are the averages of a series of numeric values. They have a predefined length for the number of values to average and this set of values moves forward as more data is added with time. Given a series of numbers and a fixed subset size, the first element of the moving averages is obtained by taking the average of the initial fixed subset of the number series. Then to obtain subsequent moving averages the subset is \u2018shift forward\u2019 i.e. exclude the first element of the previous subset and add the element immediately after the previous subset to the new subset keeping the length fixed . Since it involves taking the average of the dataset over time, it is also called a moving mean (MM) or rolling mean.", "In the technical analysis of financial data, moving averages(MAs) are among the most widely used trend following indicators that demonstrate the direction of the market\u2019s trend.", "There are many different types of moving averages depending on how the averages are computed. In any time-series data analysis, the most commonly used types of moving averages are \u2014", "The only noteworthy difference between the various moving averages is the weight assigned to data points in the moving average period. Simple moving averages apply equal weight to all data points. Exponential and weighted averages apply more weight to recent data points.", "Among these, Simple Moving Averages(SMAs) and Exponential Moving Averages(EMAs) are arguably the most popular technical analysis tool used by the analysts and traders. In this article, we\u2019ll focus primarily on the strategies involving SMAs and EMAs.", "Simple Moving Average is one of the core technical indicators used by traders and investors for the technical analysis of a stock, index or securities. Simple moving average is calculated by adding the the closing price of last n number of days and then diving by the number of days(time-period). Before we dive deep, let\u2019s first understand the math behind simple averages.", "We have studied how to compute average in school and even in our daily life we often come across the notion of it. Let\u2019s say you are watching a game of cricket and a batsman comes for batting. By looking at his previous 5 match scores\u2014 60, 75, 55, 80, 50; you can expect him to score roughly around 60\u201370 runs in today\u2019s match.", "By calculating the average of a batsman from his last 5 matches, you were able to make a crude prediction that he\u2019ll score this much runs today. Although, this is a rough estimation and doesn\u2019t guarantee that he\u2019ll score exactly same runs, but still the chances are high. Likewise, SMA helps in predicting the future trend and determine whether an asset price will continue or reverse a bull or bear trend. The SMA is usually used to identify trend direction, but it can also be used to generate potential trading signals.", "Calculating Simple moving averages \u2014 The formula for calculating the SMA is straightforward:", "The simple moving average = (sum of the an asset price over the past n periods) / (number of periods)", "All elements in the SMA have the same weightage.

There are vast varieties of the moving average strategies that can be developed using different types of moving averages. In this article, I\u2019ve tried to demonstrate well-known simplistic yet effective momentum strategies \u2014 Simple Moving Average Crossover strategy and Exponential Moving Average Crossover strategy.", "In the statistics of time-series, and in particular the Stock market technical analysis, a moving-average crossover occurs when on plotting, the two moving averages each based on different time-periods tend to cross. This indicator uses two (or more) moving averages \u2014 a faster moving average(short-term) and a slower(long-term) moving average. The faster moving average may be 5-, 10- or 25-day period while the slower moving average can be 50-, 100- or 200-day period. A short term moving average is faster because it only considers prices over short period of time and is thus more reactive to daily price changes. On the other hand, a long-term moving average is deemed slower as it encapsulates prices over a longer period and is more lethargic.", "A moving average, as a line by itself, is often overlaid in price charts to indicate price trends. A crossover occurs when a faster moving average (i.e. a shorter period moving average) crosses a slower moving average (i.e. a longer period moving average). In stock trading, this meeting point can be used as a potential indicator to buy or sell an asset.", "Having equipped with the necessary theory, now let\u2019s continue our Python implementation wherein we\u2019ll try to incorporate this strategy.", "In our existing pandas dataframe, create a new column \u2018Signal\u2019 such that if 20-day SMA is greater than 50-day SMA then set Signal value as 1 else when 50-day SMA is greater than 20-day SMA then set it\u2019s value as 0.", "From these \u2018Signal\u2019 values, the position orders can be generated to represent trading signals. Crossover happens when the faster moving average and the slower moving average cross, or in other words the \u2018Signal\u2019 changes from 0 to 1 (or 1 to 0). So, to incorporate this information, create a new column \u2018Position\u2019 which nothing but a day-to-day difference of the \u2018Signal\u2019 column.", "Now let\u2019s visualize this using a plot to make it more clear.", "As you can see in the above plot, the blue line represents the faster moving average(20 day SMA), the green line represents the slower moving average(50 day SMA) and the black line represents the actual closing price. If you carefully observe, these moving averages are nothing but the smoothed versions of the actual price, but lagging by certain period of time. The short-term moving average closely resembles the actual price which perfectly makes sense as it takes into consideration more recent prices. In contrast, the long-term moving average has comparatively more lag and loosely resembles the actual price curve.", "A signal to buy (as represented by green up-triangle) is triggered when the fast moving average crosses above the slow moving average. This shows a shift in trend i.e. the average price over last 20 days has risen above the average price of past 50 days. Likewise, a signal to sell(as represented by red down-triangle) is triggered when the fast moving average crosses below the slow moving average indicating that the average price in last 20 days has fallen below the average price of the last 50 days.", "So far we have discussed the moving average crossover strategy using the simple moving averages(SMAs). It is straightforward to observe that SMA time-series are much less noisy than the original price. However, this comes at a cost \u2014 SMA lag the original price, which means that changes in the trend are only seen with a delay of L days. How much is this lag L? For a SMA moving average calculated using M days, the lag is roughly around M/2 days. Thus, if we are using a 50 days SMA, this means we may be late by almost 25 days, which can significantly affect our strategy.", "One way to reduce the lag induced by the use of the SMA is to use Exponential Moving Average(EMA). Exponential moving averages give more weight to the most recent periods. This makes them more reliable than SMAs as they are comparatively better representation of the recent performance of the asset. The EMA is calculated as:", "Where: \u03b1 = 2/(N + 1)N = the length of the window (moving average period)EMA [today] = the current EMA valuePrice [today] = the current closing priceEMA [yesterday] = the previous EMA value", "Although the calculation for an EMA looks bit daunting, in practice it\u2019s simple. In fact, it\u2019s easier to calculate than SMA, and besides, the Pandas ewm functionality will do it for you in a single-line of code!", "Having understood the basics, let\u2019s try to incorporate EMAs in place of SMAs in our moving average strategy. We\u2019re going to use the same code as above, with some minor changes.", "The following extract from John J. Murphy\u2019s work, \u201cTechnical Analysis of the Financial Markets\u201d published by the New York Institute of Finance, explains the advantage of the exponentially weighted moving average over the simple moving average\u2014", "\u201cThe exponentially smoothed moving average addresses both of the problems associated with the simple moving average. First, the exponentially smoothed average assigns a greater weight to the more recent data. Therefore, it is a weighted moving average. But while it assigns lesser importance to past price data, it does include in its calculation all the data in the life of the instrument. In addition, the user is able to adjust the weighting to give greater or lesser weight to the most recent day\u2019s price, which is added to a percentage of the previous day\u2019s value. The sum of both percentage values adds up to 100.\u201d", "The function \u2018MovingAverageCrossStrategy()\u2019 takes following inputs \u2014", "Now, let\u2019s test our script on last 4 years of HDFC bank stock.

Also, this time we won\u2019t be displaying the table.", "Due to the fundamental difference in the way they are calculated, EMA reacts quickly to the price changes while SMA is comparatively slow to react. But, one is not necessarily better than another. Each trader must decide which MA is better for his or her particular strategy. In general, shorter-term traders tend to use EMAs because they want to be alerted as soon as the price is moving the other way. On the other hand, longer-term traders tend to rely on SMAs since these investors aren\u2019t rushing to act and prefer to be less actively engaged in their trades.", "Beware! As a trend-following indicators, moving averages work in markets that have clear, long term trends. They don\u2019t work that well in markets that can be very choppy for long periods of time. Moral of the story \u2014 moving averages are not a one-size-fits-all holy grail. In fact, there is no perfect indicator or a strategy that will guarantee success on each investment in all circumstances. Quantitative traders often use a variety of technical indicators and their combinations to come up with different strategies. In my subsequent articles, I will try to introduce some of these technical indicators.", "In this article, I showed how to build a powerful tool to perform technical analysis and generate trade signals using moving average crossover strategy. This script can be used for investigating other company stocks by simply changing the argument to the function MovingAverageCrossStrategy().", "This is only the beginning, it is possible to create much more sophisticated strategies which I\u2019ll be looking forward to.", "You may also want to check my other article \u2014", "Your home for data science.
