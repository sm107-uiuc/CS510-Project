In the world of big data, they adopt AI/deep learning methods and discover invaluable business insights.", "For me, having that \u201cdata scientist\u201d job title for the past five years, I still haven\u2019t fully figured out which part of me is sexy. Except maybe my newly permed hair that makes me look like a Korean Oppa (usually used to refer to Korean drama male lead).", "Indeed, the emergence of cloud and movement of businesses to the internet has let to an explosion of data. This has driven the demand and shortage of data scientists in some sectors.", "But what does a data scientists job entail on a day-to-day basis?", "We can find our answer to this question by analyzing job postings on LinkedIn. Let me sum up the popular ones for you:", "Unless your job consists of working on Kaggle datasets, these job descriptions are just a small part of being a data scientist.", "The following survey results by CrowdFlower sum up a typical day for a data scientist:", "As you can see from the chart above, the majority of a data scientist\u2019s time is on collecting datasets and cleaning and organising data.", "Data lakes are centralised repositories that store all the company\u2019s data. They enable organisations to use that data to build machine learning models and dashboards. Unfortunately, some people assume that data lakes are data dumping grounds \u2014 or a super big hard drive.", "Many organisations started implementing data lakes without a clear idea of what to do with the data collected. \u201cLet\u2019s just collect everything\u201d, they said. While the point of a data lake is to have all the company\u2019s data in one place, it is still vital to design it with specific projects needs. Not planning is almost like creating a new \u201cUntitled Folder\u201d and then copying and pasting the entirety of the company\u2019s data in there.", "Historically, poor planning has resulted in little to no well-defined metadata, which has made it difficult for anyone to search for (and find) the data that they need. Data scientists often find themselves contacting different departments for data. They may need to seek information about the data from a variety of data owners. Merely storing data without cataloguing it is a big mistake. The key to having a useful data lake is to ensure that the metadata is well-defined.", "Due to data governance or busyness of data owners, who are often stakeholders from different departments, it can take weeks to obtain vital data. After the waiting game, data scientists might end up finding that the data is not relevant or it has serious quality issues.", "When data scientists finally do get their hands on the data, they need to spend a lot of time exploring it and getting familiar with it. They have to reorganise that messy chunk of data into new tables that align with their project needs.", "Everyone who deals with data should have heard of the term \u201cdirty data\u201d. Dirty data takes away the integrity of the dataset. Some characteristics of dirty data are incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent and duplicated data.", "Incomplete data is when some essential features are empty. For example, let\u2019s say your task is to predict house prices. Let us assume that the \u201carea of the house\u201d is critical to make a good prediction, but it\u2019s missing. That might be challenging for you and your model might not perform well.", "Inaccurate and inconsistent data is when the values are technically correct, but wrong based on the context. For example, when an employee changed his address, and it wasn\u2019t updated. Or when there are many copies of the data and the data scientist got an outdated version.", "Duplicate data is a common problem. Let me share with you a story that has happened to me while working in an e-commerce company. By design, when a visitor clicked on a \u201ccollect voucher\u201d button, the website sent a response to the server. This allowed us to measure the number of users who have collected vouchers.", "The site was running well, until one day something has changed and I didn\u2019t know about it. The frontend developer added another response for when someone collected vouchers successfully. The rationale was that some vouchers could be out of stock. They wanted to track visitors who clicked on the button and those who have collected the vouchers.", "At that point, two responses were sent to the same log table. Looking at my reporting tool, the number of vouchers collected seemed to have doubled overnight! As I had deployed a model the day before, I assumed that my new model was just that impressive. I remember giving a mental standing ovation to my little model, but later, I realised it was just double counting.", "Also, in the last five years as a data scientist, some of the data I\u2019ve received are manual entries by corporate staff. These data are in Excel spreadsheets; many are inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent.", "Whether the data comes from manual human input or machine logs, data wrangling is a large part of what happens in the real world. Data scientists have to deal with it. For supervised learning to work, we need reliable, labelled data. You can\u2019t build a predictive model unless the data are correctly labelled. But nobody likes labelling data.", "Many describe this as the 80/20 rule. Data scientists spend only 20 percent of their time on building models and the other 80 percent gathering, analysing, cleaning, and reorganising data. Dirty data is the most time-consuming aspect of the typical data scientist\u2019s work.", "It\u2019s necessary to point out that data cleaning is incredibly essential; messy data won\u2019t produce good results. You might have heard the phrase, \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d.", "Data scientists do make discoveries while swimming in data, but before data scientists can start training any models, they must first become data janitors. The data needs cleaning, the data needs labelling.", "I don\u2019t find my job sexy.I am 40% a vacuum, another 40% a janitor.And the last 20%\u2026 A fortune-teller.", "Your home for data science.
