The first passenger in the line has lost his boarding pass but was allowed in regardless. He takes a random seat. Each subsequent passenger takes their assigned seat if available, or a random unoccupied seat, otherwise.What is the probability that the last passenger to board the plane finds their seat unoccupied?", "If your first instinct is to map out the possibilities with a smaller number of people boarding the plane, I invite you to take a moment and try the puzzle out for yourself. This approach resulted in a great deal of suffering on my end, and I wouldn\u2019t want to deprive you of that experience.", "Alternatively, read on for a Monte Carlo simulation and an explanation of the analytic solution.", "Annoyed at my failure to manually solve the problem, I quickly typed out a messy Monte Carlo simulation in Python:", "By Monte Carlo, the probability of the last passenger finding his seat is about 50%. I found it surprising that the probability was this high, considering that it represents the last passenger sitting in one particular seat in a 100-person plane.", "This is yet another probability puzzle where our intuition fails us. It reminds me specifically of the Birthday Paradox, where most people also tend to vastly underestimate the probability of a certain outcome as a result of deeply-flawed mental calculations.", "The real probability is exactly 1/2. Here\u2019s why:", "From this point forward, I refer to passengers and their assigned seats in order of entry, such that the first passenger to board is Passenger 1 and the last to board is Passenger 100. Similarly, Seat 1 is the assigned seat of Passenger 1, and so forth.", "Fact: Passenger 100 will sit in either Seat 100 (his assigned seat) or Seat 1.", "I best understand this observation through the perspective of each passenger boarding in-between the first and last. There are two possibilities for Passengers 2\u201399.", "After each of these passengers takes a seat on the plane, it is necessarily true that their assigned seat is occupied. Either it was previously unoccupied (option 1 above) and they sit in it, or it was already occupied (option 2).", "Before the last passenger boards the plane, the assigned seats of Passengers 2\u201399 are occupied. At this point, 99 people (including Passenger 1) have taken a seat, meaning that only one seat remains vacant.", "Since there is one seat left and Seats 2\u201399 are guaranteed to be occupied, the vacant seat must be Seat 1 or Seat 100. It is impossible for both Seat 1 and Seat 100 to be occupied before the last passenger boards, because that would mean all 100 seats on the plane are occupied by only 99 passengers.", "Fact: there is an equal probability of the last passenger sitting in Seat 1 and Seat 100.", "By the time the last passenger boards, the outcome of the lost boarding pass problem is already determined, as there is only one seat for them to choose. We must therefore look at the decisions faced by Passengers 1\u201399.", "For Passenger 1, there is equal probability of choosing any of the 100 seats. By extension, the probability of him choosing his own assigned seat and the probability of him choosing the last passenger\u2019s assigned seat are equal.", "The only way Passengers 2\u201399 sit in Seat 1 or Seat 100 is if their assigned seat is occupied. In this case, there is also an equal probability of sitting in any available seat.", "While both Seat 1 and Seat 100 are unoccupied, it is equally probable that either seat will be chosen. After one of these two seats is occupied, the other seat is guaranteed to remain unoccupied until the last passenger boards. The probability that Seat 100 is occupied by a previous passenger is 1/2.", "Therefore, the probability that the last passenger finds his seat unoccupied is also 1/2.", "Though I\u2019m a very inexperienced coder, it was still much faster to solve the lost boarding pass problem using Monte Carlo via Python than it was to wrap my head around the analytic solution. I could say something here about the power of simulations in problem solving, but you\u2019ve probably heard it before.", "Instead, I will publicly thank whoever came up with the idea of airlines being able to print boarding passes at the gate.", "The lost boarding pass problem doesn\u2019t have a massive online presence, though I was able to find versions with slightly different wordings here, here, and here.", "Your home for data science.
