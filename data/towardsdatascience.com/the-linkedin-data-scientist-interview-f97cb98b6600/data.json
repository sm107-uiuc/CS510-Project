With over 500 million members around the world and a mix of B2B and B2C programs, the data science team has a huge impact in determining product direction. The data science job at LinkedIn is generally focused on the business side rather than engineering and the data science role functions more like a product analyst and analytics job at many other companies.", "If you\u2019re interested in more interview guides, check out the DoorDash data scientist interview and the Google data scientist interview.", "There are four levels within the data science team at LinkedIn.", "Each has its own leveling system which determines pay and compensation bands. Regular data scientists or associate data scientists at LinkedIn are generally candidates with less than two years of experience. Principal data scientists generally have almost 10+ years of experience.", "The LinkedIn data scientist interview process is relatively straight-forward. Recruiters at LinkedIn like to dog-food their own product so they will likely send you a message or Inmail through LinkedIn to contact you about the data science role. The recruiter will schedule a 30-minute phone screen to talk to you about LinkedIn to understand your interests in the company and see if the role is a good fit.", "Given how business facing the LinkedIn data science role is, it might so happen that after the phone call they may transfer you to another recruiter on the machine learning team. The data science team does have a more algorithmic and engineering heavy track but it\u2019s only a small subset of LinkedIn\u2019s total data science team.", "The initial technical screen consists of two separate phone interviews each lasting between 30 to 45 minutes long.", "One interview is more technical focused and specializes in testing concepts on SQL and data processing. The other is more of a business and product case study testing your critical thinking skills. Depending on how your interview is structured, either interview could be the first one of the two. However, you are not guaranteed both interviews if you do poorly on one of them. Both interviewers are also going to be employees on the LinkedIn data science team leaving ample time at the end to ask questions.", "Check out our ultimate SQL guide for more practice!", "For the LinkedIn phone screen with the product and business case study, the interviewer will gauge how you solve business questions and problems, as well as how creative and articulate you are at thinking through these problems while solving them. This technical screen portion of the interview involves product intuition and analytics based questions.", "It\u2019s helpful to spend time engaging with LinkedIn products as someone who is tasked with improving or developing the products as a data scientist.", "A good example is understanding what LinkedIn\u2019s business objectives are. How would you design features and analyze data to come to actionable conclusions? At its core, the interviewer will ask you how to design a feature for LinkedIn and how to then analyze its performance. Be ready to quantifiably measure the success of the feature.", "To prepare for this part of the interview, put yourself in the shoes of the product team who built the product or features and ask questions like:", "It\u2019s also important to layout structure on how to answer the question. Make sure to coalesce your thoughts all in one place and organize your answer to thoughtfully explain how you\u2019re investigating each problem.", "Practice this IQ Product Question on our website!", "In the SQL and data processing portion you\u2019ll be given a series of data processing questions that will be more and more complex. It is highly suggested to solve these questions in SQL.", "An example for the first question would be to write a simple select statement with a where condition (SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = value). Then each question begins to get more complex using the same tables given for the initial problem with sub-queries, complex joins, and conditional statements. Following the initial question, the interviewer will likely add three additional modifications into the initial one to make it more complex.", "Given a table representing users, write a query to get the count of users that signed up for LinkedIn in January 2020.", "Given two additional tables representing jobs and job applications, write a query to get the most applied to job position this year.", "It\u2019s important to brush up on these concepts in SQL and product before the interview! Here\u2019s an example solution by me tackling a LinkedIn\u2019s SQL interview question.", "The onsite interview at LinkedIn is a full day, five hour interview, meeting with five plus different employees across the company. Each interview may have more than one person on it as well. The interviews are around 45 minutes long and leave ample time for you to ask questions at the end.", "Expect advanced probability and statistical topics to come up in the first round. The product case round is where they give you a use case study with a general question to answer. You have to come up with different ways you would answer this question. The PM round is similar to more of an A/B testing question with a focus on metrics and how you would validate your metrics. The product case round is more extensive whereas the A/B testing round involves digging deeper into metrics like: how do you know if this metric is significant, etc.", "Your home for data science.
