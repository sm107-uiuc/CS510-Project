In fact model validation is an important part of the overall model development process. If a developer is spending X amount of time in developing the model, most of the time they spend X or even more than the X amount of time in validating the model and making sure of its robustness and accuracy.", "In this post, I\u2019ll emphasize the importance of the Model Validation process and how is it different from the Model monitoring processes.", "If the model has not been validated properly then it would not be able to perform well on the unseen data which is the ultimate purpose of a predictive model. There are various model validation techniques, the most important categories would be In time validation and Out of time validation.", "A part of the development dataset is kept aside and the model is then tested on it to see how it is performing on the unseen data from the similar time segment using which it was built in the first place (i.e. In Time validation).", "A dataset is pulled from a different time segment and the model is tested on this unseen chunk of data too to judge its response to unseen data (i.e. Out of time validation).", "These validations ensure that the developers can be confident of the model performance.", "As explained in the above point, if a model has been validated properly, the developers have confidence in its performance. A model which has completed the validation process is deemed fit to act robustly in the future scenarios. There are sensitivity analysis tests incorporated in the validation processes which ensure that by varying the independent model variables to a certain degree to account for economic ups and downs, the dependent variable is not affected to an extreme degree which might render the model unusable.", "In extreme scenarios like recession or this current pandemic situation, the predictive models have difficulty in adapting and predicting still-good-enough predictions despite the volatility. But if the model validation process included the stress testing measures as well then it helps in putting a version of a model into production that\u2019s already been well tested for stress scenarios and will not suddenly fail when any calamity strikes.", "If the model has not gone through basic out of time validation tests, then it might be possible that the model is an overfitted model which performed well on the development sample but fails on unseen data. To avoid such a scenario, always validate!", "To begin understanding this distinction, we\u2019ll cover three-pointers: The purpose, the metrics, and the time period.", "Model validation is carried out in tandem with the model development process. Many times, it\u2019s an iterative process. If a model fails to perform in the validation stage, it goes back to the development stage. This is immediately after the model development. It\u2019s a one-time process.", "Model Monitoring comes into effect after a model has gone into the PROD (production) stage. It\u2019s an ongoing process. A specific monitoring frequency is decided for every model and it\u2019s evaluated then to make sure that the model is performing up to the mark and its results are reliable. Also, we check that the population distribution should not be significantly different as compared to the development time period to ensure that the model is still relevant and okay to be used.", "The purpose of model validation is to check the accuracy and performance of the model basis on the past data for which we already have actuals.", "Once the model is deployed, the model monitoring processes ensure the relevance of the model by judging the population distribution and also recording back-dated error % comparisons between the model predictions and actuals data as soon as that starts coming in to make sure that the model performance is in the acceptable range.", "This is the most important distinction between the two stages. In the model validation stage, we focus majorly on the statistical metrics that can decode the model performance and response for us. Whereas in the model monitoring stage, we focus both on the statistical as well the business metrics to derive our conclusion of being confident in the relevance and the reliability of a particular model.", "This brings us to the end of this post. This is a question that\u2019s often asked in the interviews as well as: can you explain the difference between the model validation and the monitoring stages. The content we covered in this post can suffice as the answer.", "I\u2019ll be following up with more posts diving deep into the technical metrics/techniques used in both the model validation and model monitoring stages.", "Watch this space for more on Data Science, Machine Learning, and Statistics!", "Your home for data science.
