It is not your typical course of lectures, practicals and tutorials. Lectures are few and far between and it is more about the practice of data science than it is about book-learning. After a one-week data science bootcamp, where we work together on a sample project from start to finish, students are supported through a data science project of their own creation. It can be a shock to the system because they are more used to pre-defined projects, and following a precise specification, so the idea of defining their own from scratch is as daunting as it is exciting.", "In my experience the greatest challenge they confront is not the coding, but rather the definition of the research question(s) they wish to pursue. Getting this right helps to shape the entire project, and usually leads to a good outcome, but getting it wrong can leave the student in a never-ending struggle for clarity and purpose, which rarely results in a stand-out project.", "In this article, I try to capture some of the advice I give to my students early on: what to look for in a research topic; and how to think about their research objective; and how to translate this into an appropriate research question(s) that will serve them well during their project. Although I have my 3rd years in mind as I write the article, I don\u2019t think the advice is at all limited to them. Certainly, I frequently counsel my graduate students and other researchers on similar matters, as they confront many of the same challenges when establishing their research objectives. As such, I think that this article should be of interest to anyone working on data-driven projects or tasks.", "It\u2019s always nice to start with a catchy checklist. In marketing, they have The Four P\u2019s (Product, Price, Promotion, Place). The best I can come up with is the Four F\u2019s \u2013 Fascinating, Focused, Falsifiable, Feasible \u2013 okay so it doesn\u2019t exactly roll off the tongue, but it does a good job of capturing what is important to think about when defining your research and formulating a research question.", "Try to find a topic that fascinates you. If you don\u2019t care about your chosen topic then nobody else will. Plus, you won\u2019t find work satisfying, you won\u2019t enjoy doing it, and the result you produce will be mediocre at best. It doesn\u2019t have to be a topic that is so important and compelling that everyone agrees that it needs to be answered. Truth be told, such questions are few and far between anyway, and pursing the obvious candidates runs the risk of your work being considered derivative!", "I am forever encouraging my students to pursue their own niche interests. After all, these are the topics that excite them, and if they are excited then chances are others will be too. Pursuing your own interests also brings the added advantage of a topic in which you have some expertise, which can give you a valuable head-start. It usually also makes it easier for you to intuit an interesting research question too, and your intuitions may be good enough to evaluate whether your findings are reasonable at an earlier stage in the process than might otherwise be the case. This can provide you with time to adjust your research or replan as necessary.", "Whatever topic you choose, take the time early on to reflect on why it is interesting to you and who else might be interested in it. This will help you to better appreciate your own motivations and will enable you to better motivate your work for others. Rest assured, even if you chose a very niche topic you will find that there will be others who are interested in it, that\u2019s the nature of our connected world. Your passion for it will shine through, which can be a catalyst to capture the attention of others.", "As an example, a few years ago I became more interested in running and starting exploring marathon data collected online. It was something I was interested in for myself but I quickly found that the questions I was exploring were of interest to others too, and what started as a personal project outside of my core research has since emerged as one of main research themes in my current work, resulting in numerous blog posts, scientific articles and even a few media invitations. I pursue the work because it was of interest to me and I wanted to know the answer to the questions I was asking. But when I talked about this work, when I wrote about it, others became interested too, revealing new opportunities and more research questions.", "A good research question should focus on a single well-defined problem that is specific enough to be answerable in a thorough and rigorous way. But while a research question should be focused, it doesn\u2019t need to start out that way. Indeed, it can be a useful exercise to start by asking a big and bold question \u2013 perhaps one that will have wide appeal \u2013 but the time will come to sharpen your focus on a more precise and practical version of this initial question.", "A few of years ago I was interested in the question: Does Hollywood ruin good books? It\u2019s a familiar source of debate among friends, which makes it interesting and appealing \u2013 everyone understands books and movies, and everyone has a view on this topic \u2013 but what does this question mean exactly? I translated it into a narrower version: Are movie ratings usually better or worse than the ratings of the books they are adapted from? Now we are getting more focused, and in a way that facilitates the data science. We are talking about numbers (ratings) and comparing the (average) ratings of books and movies, and yet we can still capture the essence of the big, bold question that we started with.", "In another example, one of the first topics of interest to me in my marathon work was how I should pace my own races to maximise my performance. And so the big, bold question became: What is the best pacing strategy in the marathon? But this was far too broad and and far too vague to be useful, and I needed a more focused question on pacing. I was conscious of a common marathon recommendation, \u201cdon\u2019t start too fast\u201d and this led to the more practical question to ask of the data: Does starting too fast in the marathon impair your performance? This was much better, because it suggested a practical way forward, by comparing how runners paced themselves at the start of their race versus their overall finish-times.", "Once again, this brings us back to numbers, averages, and comparisons \u2013 the stuff of data science, concrete and actionable \u2013 and it means that we can start our journey with a specific destination in mind and, if not a precise set of directions, at least we have a map and a compass!", "Falsifiability or refutability is a key concept in the philosophy of science, first introduced by Karl Popper in his book Logik der Forschung (1934). Simply put a statement is falsifiable if it can be contradicted by evidence (or data). The classic example is, \u201call swans are white,\u201d which is falsifiable because we can observe that black swans exist. Falsifiability underpins the scientific method by providing a principled way to translate observations and data into robust scientific conclusions.", "\u201cThat (your hypothesis) is not only not right; it is not even wrong.\u201d \u2014 Wolfgang Pauli (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1945)", "In practice, this means you should frame your research question as a falsifiable hypothesis, by posing it as a statement that can be either true or false, and in a manner that can lead to an experiment or analysis that is capable of disproving it.", "This helps us to avoid vague research questions such as \u201cWhat is the best pacing strategy for the marathon?\u201d and forces us instead to formulate more meaningful ones, such as \u201cDoes starting too fast impair your marathon performance?\u201d or, better yet, as a falsifiable statement,\u201cRunners who start too fast have slower finish-times, compared with runners who don\u2019t start too fast.\u201d Now we can disprove this statement by using data about starting paces and finish-times; if the mean finish-time of fast-starters is no different from the mean finish-times of runners who start more slowly, then, all other things being equal, this statement will be false.", "In case you think that this is more about pandering to the philosophy of science than the practicalities of data science, then you would be mistaken. Framing your research question as a falsifiable hypothesis provides a more robust foundation for your work and this brings with it many important practical benefits. In particular, modern statistical techniques are based on this type of hypothesis testing and when the time comes to draw a conclusion from your work, you will find it is a better fit for the types of statistical tests that you will need to use to validate that your findings are not due to chance; a vital step when it comes interpreting the results of your experiments.", "Last but not least, you must determine whether your research question is feasible? Simply put, can it be answered with the data you have, in the time that is available, and using the skills you\u2019ve learned? Usually, if you have the right dataset then you will be able to frame a research question that fits your timeframe and skill set.", "All too often, however, I have seen students derailed during their project because they have realised too late that their dataset is missing some vital piece of information that needed to answer their research question. Usually this is because the question was not properly defined, duping them into thinking that their dataset was sufficient for their needs, until the time came to test it.", "When I was working on whether Hollywood had a tendency to ruin good books, I knew I needed movie ratings and book ratings. IMDB provided a large-scale data-dump of movie data, including ratings, and Goodreads provided a handy API to get book data and ratings. Howver, millions of movie and book ratings weren\u2019t enough on their own. I needed to be able to identify movies that were adapted from books, and I needed to align these movies with their corresponding books, so that ratings could be compared on a like-for-like basis. This was the most challenging aspect of that project. I needed to verify that the IMDB data included some indication that a movie was based on a book; it did in various ways via the writing credits. I also needed to test whether I could match movies and books reliably; I could, using the Goodreads search API using movie title, year, and author information.", "Remember, you can\u2019t create something from nothing so if you need a particular piece of data to answer your research question then you need to ensure that it is available in your dataset, or that it can be derived from the available data. Sometimes, even if data is not missing, precision can be an issue. In my fast-starters marathon work I needed to measure the starting pace of marathon runners, but my dataset only included 5km split times, which meant I could only calculate pace every 5kms. Would this be sufficient? Did it make sense to consider the first 5km as the start of the race? After running a few early tests I was able to conclude that 5km splits would be sufficient, which was an important confidence boost to allow me to continue; incidentally you can find the result of this marathon work here.", "I tell my students that this feasibility step is one of the most important aspects of their early work, because I have seen first-hand, and all too often, how they can fool themselves into believing that their data are sufficient, only to find out later that some vital piece of information is missing. Indeed, it has been a hard lesson for me to learn in my own work, but I have just about learned it at this stage.", "Identifying a suitable research question is one of the most important tasks in any data science project. Getting it wrong can lead to major problems down the line, while getting it right can not only help to guarantee a successful project, but also guide your work from the start. When it comes to starting a new research project my advice to my students can be summarised as follows:", "I believe that following these steps will make it more likely to produce a successful data science project, and it will be a lot more satisfying and enjoyable too.", "Your home for data science.
