We\u2019ve seen these algorithms surpass humans in their ability to classify retinal fundus images, chest X-rays, and melanomas. So why do we rarely see doctors using these models in the day-to-day practice of medicine?", "Often, the missing piece is interpretability, or the ability of a model to explain why it has given an output. \u201cBlack box\u201d models, or models that simply provide a prediction with no explanation, are likely to face challenges in building user trust, even if their performance is shown to exceed that of humans. People have difficulty trusting what they don\u2019t understand, and rightly so in machine learning, given that models are often not learning what their developers intended. This is especially important to address in medicine, where stakes are much higher and lives are literally on the line. We may continue to see breakthroughs in medical ML accuracy, but if the clinical decisions and diagnoses from these models can\u2019t be interpreted, it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll keep collecting dust.", "From the perspectives of clinicians and patients, a model\u2019s output is not very meaningful or accountable if it can\u2019t be explained. An algorithm that classifies pneumonia, but can\u2019t say why a patient has this diagnosis, is less likely to be trusted and valued than a model that can share some insight regarding its \u201creasoning\u201d.", "An interpretable model is far more useful as a second pair of eyes. Imagine being a radiologist and seeing that an ML model has predicted a patient has pneumonia. Looking at the x-ray, you might notice edema in the lower right lung, leading you to suspect pneumonia. You would be much more likely to trust the model if you could see that it was focusing on the same areas of the image, indicating that its \u201cthought process\u201d likely lined up with your own. In the event that you disagreed with the model output, you could still extract value from its interpretation, even if you end up disregarding the output.", "More and more, interpretability is becoming apparent as the missing building block to advances in health AI. For high stakes decisions like predicting if a patient has a disease or how long they will live, interpretability is critical to evaluating a model\u2019s fidelity and building user trust. Beyond that, medicine is a conservative field \u2014 physicians are unlikely to welcome an intrusion into their practices of technology that they don\u2019t understand.", "If interpretability is so crucial for applying machine learning models in the real world, why are interpretable models not the norm? Interpretability is a growing area of research, but not all machine learning architectures lend themselves well to interpretability, and interpretability can come at the cost of performance.", "Interpretability used to be hard to implement too, but new tools and libraries are making this much easier. Gradio is a Python library that automatically generates a model-agnostic interpretation for any input, along with an interface that can quickly be shared with domain experts to assess model fidelity. Using Gradio, the pneumonia model could be sent over to radiologists beforehand to evaluate how well the model picks up on the same pathological patterns that human doctors appreciate.", "The tool also lowers the technical barrier to interpretation of ML models, allowing users to write their own interpretability function, or just use the built-in interpretation model for a fast analysis.", "ML researchers need interpretability to unlock their algorithms\u2019 potential in medicine.
