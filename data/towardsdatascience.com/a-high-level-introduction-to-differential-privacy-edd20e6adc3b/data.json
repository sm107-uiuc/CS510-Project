From the brand of your toothpaste to the number of times you wave your hand, details that we often take for granted are crucial factors that can be used to infer our behavior and intentions. These insights, mined by multinational organizations, can be used to make aspects of our collective lives more convenient and interesting at the price of our private information being exposed or even exploited.", "Consider Target, the 2nd largest department store retailer in the US, that decided to implement a seemingly intuitive approach towards tailoring customers\u2019 shopping experience to their specific needs in 2012. The goal was to figure out which customers were most likely to be expecting a child, and consequently send these customers maternity-related advertisements based on the calculated likelihood. We can interpret Target\u2019s idea as a two-pronged approach: 1. Storing or amalgamating data to analyze pregnant buyers\u2019 trends. 2. Applying the technique or algorithm to correlate new customers\u2019 data points with buying patterns of previous customers to determine the likelihood of a person expecting a child. Target\u2019s initiative became the center of much discussion at the intersection of privacy and machine learning algorithms when Target sent maternity-related advertisements (mixed with advertisements from different departments) to a teen girl before her family knew she was expecting a child (Source: Forbes\u2019 article on \u201cHow Target Figured Out A Teen Girl Was Pregnant Before Her Father Did\u201d). These privacy concerns are not just applicable for data collection and storage for marketing purposes, but also for applications ranging from census data to social media.", "Consequently, it makes sense that the advent of big data, machine learning, and data science necessitates a reconsideration of privacy.", "Differential Privacy is considered to be one of the state-of-the-art concepts that can help us achieve this goal, and is already being used by Apple, Uber, the US Census Bureau, and other organizations.", "In this post, I\u2019ll cover a high-level overview of what is Differential Privacy, why it\u2019s relevant, how it\u2019s implemented, and how it\u2019s used.", "The primary premise of Differential Privacy (DP) involves making sure a data subject is not affected (e.g. not harmed) by their entry or participation in a database, while maximizing utility/data accuracy (as opposed to random/empty outputs) for the queries.", "Based on the outlined guarantees, this means that if a data analyst/adversary were relying on databases that differ by only one data entry, the probability of the end result changing would not be affected by the presence/absence/modification of that data entry (the outcome would change by at most a multiplicative factor). In other words, the analyst or adversary can not differentiate between the databases based on the output of the query when utilizing DP.", "However, the individual\u2019s harm or gain in relation to his/her perception of the conclusions mined from the data is not protected by the DP concept. The formal (mathematical) definition of DP is given below:", "Cynthia Dwork demonstrates DP with a simple example in the paper \u201cThe Promise of Differential Privacy A Tutorial on Algorithmic Techniques\u201d:", "Data is being collected from individuals for a study (Mary, who is a smoker, is one of the study participants). The study leads to the conclusion that smoking has an extremely high likelihood of causing cancer. Differential Privacy guarantees that:", "However, the utility of the study\u2019s conclusive analysis (\u201cSmoking can cause cancer\u201d) for harm/good is left to Mary\u2019s perception; Mary can choose to believe \u201cBased on this study\u2019s findings, I can stop smoking to prevent potential cancer\u201d, the exact opposite of this statement, or something else.", "\u201cData is the pollution problem of the information age, and protecting privacy is the environmental challenge.\u201d \u2014 Bruce Schneier", "Ensuring privacy is crucial for numerous applications, including maintaining the integrity of sensitive information, eliminating the opportunity for adversaries to track users based on personally identifiable information (PII), etc. DP is appealing for a variety of applications because it guarantees the following privacy \u201cneeds\u201d:", "DP eliminates any potential methods a data analyst might have to distinguish a particular individual from other participants, or associate particular behaviors with a previously identified individual in order to tailor content/services accordingly; consequently, DP makes sure that the privacy risk associated with participating in the study is not significantly increased (\u201cDifferential Privacy\u201d by Cynthia Dwork).", "This is due to the fact that the raw data cannot be accessed directly and using findings unique to an individual to specifically target or influence that particular individual violates the rule that the individual\u2019s presence in the dataset should not impact their chances of receiving a service. Furthermore, you do not need to be a privacy or DP expert (i.e. have a deep understanding of the inner mechanics of DP) to use DP and, as mentioned above, DP is resilient to post-processing. DP also extends to group privacy, although increasing the size of the group will weaken the DP bounds (\u201cDifferential Privacy: A Survey of Results\u201d by Cynthia Dwork).", "We can now see that the example of Target\u2019s prediction of maternity from buying behavior presented above may be a violation of the differential privacy concept. In the case of the prediction of a teen girl\u2019s pregnancy (as outlined here), Target supposedly correlated the individual\u2019s buying trends with other patterns of other customers expecting a child and began tailoring advertisements to her specifically based on her participation in the dataset. If she was removed from the dataset, Target would not have sent her maternity-related advertisements, which is against the concept of differential privacy.", "As an aside, it\u2019s important to note that thinking about ethical scenarios like these is not this simple. The goal of sales is to motivate a customer to buy a product by convincing the customer that he/she needs the item. By providing targeted advertisements to individuals who had bought items similar to others who were expecting, Target may have violated differential privacy using data collected from/by the organization in order to help customers become informed about potential benefits the company could offer and tailor the shopping experience to their personal needs.", "In addition, there are counterarguments to the stance I mentioned. One argument emphasizes that if Target did use the algorithm, it would not be completely accurate (no algorithm is completely accurate) and would thus make many mistakes (i.e. false positives). Another perspective (explained in The Financial Times\u2019 article \u201cBig data: are we making a big mistake?\u201d) states that everyone on Target\u2019s mailing list receives maternity-related and other types of advertisements. not just customers who are expecting.", "While DP is not an algorithm itself, it is helpful to think of an application of DP as a piece of software that lies in between the data analyst and the database to understand how it works:", "Queries are the inputs passed by the user to the DP guard; an example query might be \u201cCount the number of rows in the database\u201d. There are many variants of differential privacy \u2014 this section addresses \u03b5-differential privacy, which is distinct from (\u03b5, \u03b4)-differential privacy and other (weaker) versions of DP (please see \u201cOur Data, Ourselves: Privacy via Distributed Noise Generation\u201d if you would like to look into the other versions of DP).", "One of the primary goals of DP is to balance between privacy loss (measured by \u03b5, for which a value, such as 0.01, needs to be chosen) and maximizing utility (which can be measured through many parameters such as data accuracy). A value of \u03b5 = 0 leads to complete privacy but a lack of utility, whereas higher values of \u03b5 lead to a lack in privacy but good utility. (Taken from \u201cThe Promise of Differential Privacy: A Tutorial on Algorithmic Techniques\u201d).", "As described in Microsoft\u2019s white paper \u201cDifferential Privacy for Everyone\u201d, the DP technique takes as input the raw data, finds the answers from the original input data, and then introduces distortion based on a variety of factors (e.g. the size of the database, type of query, etc.)", "On query function f the privacy mechanism K responds with f(X) + (Lap(\u0394f/\u03b5))^k adding noise with distribution Lap(\u0394f/\u03b5) independently to each of the k components of f(X).", "\u2013 Taken from \u201cDi\ufb00erential Privacy: A Survey of Results\u201d by Cynthia Dwork", "In other words, the role of the DP \u201cguard\u201d is to add noise to the true answer (defined as f(X)) to a query (defined as function f) for each k output term in f(X) + (Lap(\u0394f/\u03b5))^k; the output of the DP guard or the end result is called the response.", "Let\u2019s break this down a bit.", "Noise is added through the Laplace distribution (represented as Lap in the above equation), which is similar to the normal distribution/bell-curve \u2014 both the normal and Laplace distribution are types of probability distributions that are uni-model (have one peak) and symmetrical (the left and right sides of the distributions are equally balanced). However, the primary difference is that the Laplace distribution has a sharper peak, as Statistics How To explains in their article.", "It is worth noting that other mechanisms can also be used in place of the Laplace distribution. For example, while the Laplacian Mechanism works for any function with a real number as an output, the Exponential Mechanism can be used in the opposite case (functions without real number as an output) and is situations where the addition of noise is not practical; the Exponential Mechanism functions similar to given a dataset, produce an output/object using a utility function that measures the quality of the output (Source: Taken from \u201cDi\ufb00erential Privacy: A Survey of Results\u201d and \u201cDifferential Privacy in the Wild A Tutorial on Current Practices and Open Challenges\u201d).", "When using DP, we need to calculate the sensitivity of the query (the sensitivity is represented as \u0394f, the query is represented as function f)", "The sensitivity of a query helps us understand how much an individual\u2019s data influences the calculations and consequently the amount of noise that needs to be added. The sensitivity of f is normally small and consequently, in most scenarios, the DP algorithm does not need to add much noise; large sensitivity when the value of \u03b5 (privacy loss) is fixed serves as a warning that more noise needs to be added to mask the data (Source: \u201cBuilding Blocks of Privacy: Differentially Private Mechanisms\u201d by Graham Cormode).", "An important point to note is that DP\u2019s privacy guarantee weakens as more questions are asked. This brings us to the formal definitions of sequential and parallel composition:", "\u201cSequential composition: If you perform two (or more) differentially private computations, they collectively provide differential privacy with parameter bounded by the sum of the parameters you used\u201d (\u201cDifferential privacy: An illustrated primer\u201d).", "Based on the definition of sequential composition, if you had two differentially private computations, this means the result would be \u03b51 + \u03b52 differentially private (taken from \u201cBuilding Blocks of Privacy: Differentially Private Mechanisms\u201d by Graham Cormode). Parallel composition involves \u201creleasing each cell with \u03b5-differential privacy\u201d, instead of the sum proposed by sequential composition (as stated in \u201cBuilding Blocks of Privacy: Differentially Private Mechanisms\u201d by Graham Cormode). As stated in \u201cDifferential Privacy: A Survey of Results,\u201d differential privacy can be ensured for any query sequence by running a differentially private algorithm with the Laplacian noise distribution on each query. Another point to add that is mentioned in the survey is that sensitivity and privacy loss (which are the parameters needed for the addition of noise) are independent from the size of the database and the database itself; a larger database leads to a good amount of accuracy for a differentially private algorithm on common queries. Further discussion of this point in addition to details on how to maximize DP\u2019s potential on insensitive queries and the mathematical proofs/theorems to yield differential privacy can be found in the survey.", "This section can be summarized with this theorem:", "This post only scratched the surface of differential privacy.
