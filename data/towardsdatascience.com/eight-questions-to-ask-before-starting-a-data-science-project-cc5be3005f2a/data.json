You wouldn\u2019t be too far off the mark, either. A quick search turns up projects on soft exoskeletons for soldiers, gigapixel camera technology, robot swarm tactics, and hundreds of other DARPA-sponsored research and development programs. One of the agency\u2019s overlooked contributions to data science, however, is its approach to decisionmaking.", "The agency\u2019s research is the stuff of science fiction and Tom Clancy novels. Still, it\u2019s easy to forget DARPA is also a (deep breath) bureaucracy, complete with hierarchy, standard operating procedures, and paperwork. Maybe that\u2019s not as fun to think about as self-repairing materials and mind-controlled machines, but it does beg the question: with all the brainpower at their disposal, how does the agency choose which projects to pursue?", "It\u2019s a question we face daily in data science and professional life. Our resources are limited, project failure is expensive, and opportunity costs are real, so which risks are worth taking?", "Heilmeier\u2019s Catechism helps separate interesting projects from important ones.", "Enter George Heilmeier: engineer, inventor, and DARPA director from 1975\u20131977. He crafted a set of eight questions, according to the agency, which \u201canyone proposing a research project or product development effort should be able to answer.\u201d Today, they\u2019re known as the Heilmeier Catechism, and DARPA still uses them for project proposals and the program manager application process. Data science projects benefit from asking the same questions.", "Answering Heilmeier\u2019s questions will save you and others time. Some offices undertaking larger technical projects might go so far as to make these questions mandatory of proposals. Even if not required, walking through Heilmeier\u2019s Catechism can help separate interesting projects from important ones. Below are some thoughts on how each component relates to the data science process.", "What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. The second sentence deserves special attention. Data scientists spend a good chunk of their professional lives translating technical language between parties, and when not speaking with fellow data nerds, jargon is inefficient at best. At worst, stakeholders might find you condescending and disconnected from the problem \u2014 and they could call you out on it. Jargon also presents an abundance of opportunities for misunderstanding.", "How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice? The scope of this question is worth some thought \u2014 how is it done here compared to other places? The question quickly answers whether a solution already exists \u2014 something stakeholders will want to know. Be aware of current best practices in data science and whether your organization uses them. Could the current approach be better? Be honest.", "What is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful? Once we\u2019ve identified how others approach the problem, consider why. Are we proposing something genuinely novel to our organization? Novel ideas are surprisingly rare, but even if our proposed solution exists elsewhere, applying it to our organization could still be valuable. A manager or client might not care at all whether a solution has been used elsewhere if it can solve the problem at hand.", "Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make? Is this project important or just academically interesting? If we\u2019re proposing a new method only to see how far something can bend and stretch, the project probably doesn\u2019t fall in the \u201cimportant\u201d category. In data science, a well-defined problem can help here. What problem is the project solving, and why is it important?", "Our resources are limited, project failure is expensive, and opportunity costs are real, so which risks are worth taking?", "What are the risks? How much will it cost? How long will it take? In short, a cautious success is preferable to unexpected failure. Consider the opportunity costs of pursuing the project and available mechanisms for mitigating risk, and know your contingencies. For data scientists, insight into these will probably require additional conversations with stakeholders. That\u2019s something at which we could probably all use more practice.", "What are the mid-term and final \u201cexams\u201d to check for success? We must hold ourselves accountable. Consider what real progress looks like and how it\u2019s measured. In data science, managing expectations for yourself and invested parties can be the difference between perceived success and failure. Use your understanding of potential risks to set clear expectations and communicate them to interested parties.", "There are plenty of other lessons on innovation to glean from DARPA. In a 2016 report, the agency attributed its success at innovation to, among other things, their employee\u2019s limited tenure and the urgency it provides (the annual turnover rate for DARPA\u2019s project managers is about 25% ), as well as risk-taking and tolerance of failure.
