It baffles me.", "Argument 2 (potential for misuse) is fair, but it\u2019s not the p-value\u2019s fault. It turns out that making decisions carefully using statistics takes effort, but people keep looking for the miraculous no-effort magic that gets them a crystal ball.

You\u2019re not trying to form mathematically-describable opinions (go Bayesian for that). You\u2019re willing to make a decision in a way that follows the logic in this blog post. If not, p-values are not for you. There\u2019s nothing to argue about. They\u2019re a good tool for some jobs, but if that\u2019s not the job you need done, then go get a better tool.

Why do we do that? No idea. I don\u2019t. If I\u2019m not willing to think about how I\u2019d like to make the decision and whether the stated assumptions are palatable to me (before I see the data or p-value), then all I\u2019ll ever see in a p-value is what an analyst sees: after some settings were twiddled, you saw a pattern. That\u2019s cute. Sometimes I see animals when I look at clouds too. If I\u2019m tempted to take it seriously, I\u2019ll follow the \u201cinsight\u201d up in other data.

The p-value is simply the probability that your null world coughs up data at least as damning as yours. When it\u2019s low, that means your data look weird in such a world, which makes you feel ridiculous about acting as if you live in that world. When it\u2019s low enough for your tastes \u2014 below a threshold you pick called a significance level \u2014 that means you\u2019re surprised enough to change your mind and switch your action away from your default.
