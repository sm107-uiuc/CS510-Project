And that Big Tech firms were fighting tooth and nail for the privilege to write huge checks to the best engineers.", "Back then I was just two years removed from getting my MBA from Rice University. I haven\u2019t checked the stats lately but back then, as an MBA grad from a decently ranked program (of course if you went to Harvard or Stanford, you would expect more), you were pretty happy with a $100,000 to $110,000 base salary plus a modest bonus. So when I moved back to the Bay Area, I was shocked to hear that fresh graduates of top computer science undergrad programs were getting that much and more on top of generous grants of company stock or options.", "In the years since, the compensation of software engineers has only risen driven by the massive profits earned by Big Tech (Facebook, Google, Apple, etc.), the massive influx of capital into startups from non-traditional venture firms like SoftBank, and the willingness of Wall Street (in most cases) to focus on the mission and the opportunity instead of the income statement.", "Today, we will explore just how high Silicon Valley software engineer base salaries are and what the trend has been over the past few years using H1B salary data. I will borrow much of the methodology and code from my previous 2 compensation related posts, which you can find here:", "How Much Do Data Scientists Make?", "How Much Do Data Scientists Make Part 2", "Hope you enjoy! And if you would like to use my code for your own analyses, you can find it here on my GitHub.", "Before we dive into the numbers, let\u2019s get some details out of the way:", "Let\u2019s get the basic numbers out of the way first. In 2019, I found that software engineers made a median base salary of $130,000. And those with the senior software engineer title made $148,000.", "Here are the 2019 base salary quartiles for those in the H1B data with the software engineer title:", "And here are the same values for the senior software engineer title:", "Those are some hefty numbers and I just want to remind you again that these numbers are before annual bonuses (if applicable) and equity (definitely applicable).", "Last time there was a fair amount of interest on which firms pay the highest salaries to data scientists, so let\u2019s take a look at a similar chart for software engineers. To remind everyone what we\u2019re looking at, the values on the following chart capture median H1B salaries by company for software and senior software engineers (I lump them all together) in Silicon Valley for the years 2018 and 2019. I only plotted the companies that hired at least 30 H1B software engineers during the period.", "A few things jump out to me:", "But the bigger picture is no matter where you choose to code, it looks like you will earn a pretty sweet paycheck,", "Now let\u2019s take a look at who hired the most H1B software engineers over the past 6 years (from 2014-19):", "Wow look at Google \u2014 they hired orders of magnitudes more than everyone else. Facebook and LinkedIn are a distant second and third place \u2014 they still hired a few thousand software engineers over the time period I studied.", "So it looks like Google dominates my dataset and software engineer hiring in general. That doesn\u2019t necessarily skew my data though. Remember that all of these companies are competing against each other to hire quality engineers \u2014 nobody hires in a vacuum. So Google\u2019s appetite for coders becomes the tide that lifts all boats (salaries) and its compensation package becomes the standard benchmark used in many a salary negotiation. Anecdotally this checks out, as I often hear engineers tell their fellows, \u201cif you don\u2019t think you are getting paid enough, go get a competing offer from Google.\u201d Easier said than done of course.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at how the median salary of software engineers (both software engineers and senior software engineers) has trended over the past few years. From 2014 to 2019 (a 5 year a period), salaries increased by 14.8% which works out to an annualized growth rate of 2.8%. That\u2019s not that much more than inflation (and a lot less than Silicon Valley inflation). As a benchmark for comparison, the median salary upon graduation for Stanford MBAs was $125,000 in 2014 and $142,000 in 2018 (that\u2019s a 13.6% growth rate over 4 years, or a 3.2% annual growth rate).", "So while the level is high, the growth rate over the past few years was less than I thought it would be. Then again, this is just the growth in base salaries \u2014 much of the growth in compensation could have occurred on the equity side both in terms of getting more equity and an increase in the valuation of the shares already received.", "In case you are curious about how the distribution of H1B software engineer salaries has trended, below is the box plot. Nothing too shocking here \u2014 the variance in salaries has remained relatively constant over time.", "Since Big Tech, especially Google and Facebook, are so dominant in the data, let\u2019s also examine the salaries of software engineers who don\u2019t work for those companies. The following chart shows Big Tech median software engineer salaries in orange (is_tech=True) and everyone else in blue (is_tech=False). I define Big Tech as engineers working for the following firms \u2014 Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Uber, AirBnB, Lyft, Apple, Netflix, and LinkedIn.", "Big Tech firms definitely pay significantly more (probably a function of not only their higher profitability but also less perceived upside in their stock). However, the growth rate of the two groups is roughly equal (both around 14% for the 5 year period).", "Finally, while I am not an expert on this, it seems like the software engineer title is used a lot more broadly at Big Tech firms \u2014 someone who would be considered a senior software engineer at a smaller, less well-known company would be a software engineer at Google or Facebook. This might explain some of the disparity between Big Tech software engineer salaries (which capture a wider range of experience levels) and everyone else.", "There are some senior software engineer salaries in the Big Tech category so we can check my hypothesis by comparing software engineer and senior software engineer salaries across the \u201ceveryone else\u201d (False on the X axis) and Big Tech (True on the X axis) categories:", "This seems to confirms my hypothesis \u2014 the distributions have much less overlap for the \u201ceveryone else\u201d category (the blue and orange box plots on the left) than it does for Big Tech (the blue and orange box plots on the right). So it does seem like \u201csoftware engineer\u201d is more or less a catch-all title for a wide range of experience levels and salary bands at the Big Tech firms.", "As software continues to \u201ceat the world\u201d, disrupting and transforming traditional industries, the skills of software engineers continue to be critical for any company that wants to compete on this playing field.", "The numbers back it up \u2014 while the growth rate is less than I thought, the level of the base salaries that coders are getting are very impressive (and don\u2019t even tell the whole story of just how much money software engineers are making year in and year out).", "Whether this is sustainable is a story for another time (yes for the Googles of the world, maybe not so much for the WeWorks and Ubers of the world).
