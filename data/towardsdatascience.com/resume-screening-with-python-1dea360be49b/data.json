People spend hours writing and formatting the perfect resume hoping it to be read by a talent acquisition professional and, eventually, help them land a job interview. Unfortunately, around 75% of resumes submitted are never seen by a human eye.", "Due to the high number of applicants and resumes submissions to job postings, manual resumes screening processes become tedious, ineffective and time consuming for talent acquisition professionals. Therefore, standardized automated screening methods are necessary to categorize qualified from unqualified candidates based on their background, education and professional experience faster, with more efficiency and more accurate results to streamline hiring processes.", "Artificial intelligence, along with text mining and natural language processing algorithms, can be applied for the development of programs (i.e. Applicant Tracking Systems) capable of screening objectively thousands of resumes in few minutes without bias to identify the best fit for a job opening based on thresholds, specific criteria or scores.", "These programs usually look for specific keywords; they sort resumes and rank them to determine the job applications that should be further reviewed by recruiters. While each company might have its own resume screening system, it is crucial for candidates to know how they work with the aim of improving their keywords selection based on the job opening they are applying to.", "Since I am an industrial and systems engineer, let\u2019s land the following example in this professional field. Within the industrial and system engineering field there is a wide range of concentration areas, which include \u2014 but not limited to \u2014 quality assurance, operations management, manufacture, supply chain, logistics, project management, data analytics and healthcare systems. Each of these has associated key terms and concepts well known within the industrial and systems engineering community.", "Even though industrial engineers must have knowledge and background of each concentration area, it is often recommended for them to pursue a career in a specific concentration area within this field. In addition, taking into consideration that we are currently on the specialization era, hiring managers are more likely to prioritize candidates with a strong background, knowledge and experience in a specific area than \u201cgeneralist\u201d\u2019 candidates. Unfortunately, there is a misconception within candidates between being \u201cgood and proficient\u201d at everything and being \u201cspecialized and highly skilled\u201d in a particular subject.", "For the following example, let\u2019s build a resume screening Python program capable of categorizing keywords into six different concentration areas (e.g. quality/six sigma, operations management, supply chain, project management, data analytics and healthcare systems) and determining the one with the highest expertise level in an industrial and systems engineer resume. Let\u2019s test it on my resume and see the results!", "The following Python code will be divided into six major steps. Lines of comments are included to provide a brief explanation and guide you through the coding process.", "Step #1: PDF file opening, reading and text extraction", "Step #3: Dictionary with key terms by area setup*", "*Disclaimer: the key terms included in each area of this dictionary were obtained through a research of the most common key terms included in industrial and system engineering job postings. This dictionary can be customized to add/remove key terms according to hiring managers criteria.", "Step #4: Scores calculation per area", "Step #5: Sorted data frame for final scores creation", "Interesting. According my resume screening results, my main industrial and systems engineering concentration area is operations management, followed by quality/six sigma tied with data analytics. The results show some degree of experience in healthcare and project management roles.", "There are two possible ways of analyzing these results. By looking at the scores summary data frame, hiring managers can determine how many key terms were included in each concentration area from a given list. On the other hand, by looking at the pie chart, hiring managers can identify my main concentration area and determine to what extent I could be considered for jobs related to other areas. The scores will be highly influenced by the number of keywords in each concentration area, reason why it is highly recommended to distribute keywords uniformly to avoid undesired bias on the results.", "As mentioned previously, is up to hiring managers and talent acquisition professionals to define thresholds, metrics and scores to determine a candidate\u2019s qualification for a given job type.", "Give it a try! Download the Python code here, load your resume in PDF format and run the code. Find out which is your strongest industrial and system engineering expertise area according to your resume!", "In this tutorial we have gone through one of the many possible applications of artificial intelligence and text mining on resumes screening programs. Real Applicant Tracking Systems are quite more complex and advanced than the program built in here; they not only scan resumes content but their format too. It is crucial for candidates to know how resume screening systems work to beat them and get their resumes to be viewed by a talent acquisition professional.", "Technology is making the job search process easier and harder. Larger pools of applicants and limited opportunities force candidates to write outstanding resumes capable of defeating the \u201cbots\u201d. It is highly recommended for candidates to optimize their resumes keywords to represent their soft and hard skills and avoid including buzzwords. Do not give up! Work on improving your resume and be confident about your skillset and professional competencies. All the best during your job search process!", "If you found this article useful, feel welcome to download my personal code on GitHub.
