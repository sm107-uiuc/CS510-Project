I\u2019m back for another month of fun data things! Last month, I looked at all of the plane flights I took in 2019, this month I decided to look at how many phone calls I made over the course of a month. (Mainly because my friends had a hard time believing how many calls I said I made, and I wanted to see what the data said).", "You know the old adage that data doesn\u2019t lie? \u261d\ufe0fThat data (yeah that one, the one that says I\u2019m 73% a Boomer), that\u2019s a lie (well, maybe \ud83e\udd14). There was no consistent data about how long people spend on the phone every day for non-work reasons, but over the course of January I spent fourteen hours, twenty minutes and seven seconds on the phone across 214 calls. That means that over the course of the month instead of being on all of my phone calls, I could\u2019ve watched Game of Thrones, Season 8, twice and had a few seconds left to spare. (but don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t hate myself that much \ud83d\ude02)", "Of the 214 calls that I was on, 137 were outgoing, 77 were incoming, and only 4 were spam (I know, I was surprised by that also, I guess being on the Federal No Call list helped \ud83d\ude02). Some people definitely did a better job picking up the phone when I called them, but collectively across all of the missed calls that I made I spent another 10 minutes and 51 seconds just waiting to see if they\u2019d pick up or not \ud83d\ude43", "I tracked a fairly limited amount of data this month compared to last month, but still saw some super interesting things.", "One of the things I was super curious about was if there was a schedule to my calls, if I called the same people around the same times, if my number of calls went up on weekdays or weeknights, and all of those types of things.", "Going into the month, I was interested to see if I made more calls on the weekends than the weekdays \u2014 at some level I thought that I\u2019d make more calls on weekends, but also accounting for the fact that there are 3 more weekdays than weekends\u2026 As I started pulling the data though, I realized that there were a few days that I didn\u2019t work, so I shifted my thinking into working days vs not working days. What we see when I do that is that I indeed make more calls on working days, and almost all of them are between 6 and 8 pm. On non-working days, I was much more varied, but there were still sections of time where I was much more likely to be on the phone (and there was in fact some overlap around 5pm, but there was a significantly higher blip in the mornings). Despite the number of phone calls I made later in the evening on working days, my average phone call was an outgoing call, that started at 4:18pm, that lasted 4 minutes and 53 seconds.", "One of the things I was super curious about going into this month was whether my ratio of incoming to outgoing calls was even per person \u2014 so looking in a sense of whether people \u2018equitably\u2019 called me or whether they let me initiate most phone calls. What I found was that most of my calls were outgoing, but it wasn\u2019t as skewed as I thought it would be.", "In the same vein, I wanted to see if there were people who I consistently didn\u2019t pick up the phone when they called or vis versa, and what I found was that mom is the busiest person I call (or she just loves me the least \ud83d\ude43) but the missed calls seem to be fairly consistent across people based on how much I call them (see above), although my sister has a fair gripe when she says I don\u2019t pick up the phone when she calls, given how consistently she picked up.", "This got me thinking about what days I talked to my immediate family, and whether there was any pattern to the days those calls occurred. Turns out, there wasn\u2019t, but it was still interesting to see that I didn\u2019t really call either of my sisters on Wednesdays or Thursdays \u2014 except for at the end of the month where I talked to both of them on back to back days.", "Lastly, I wanted to see who I was on the phone with for the entire month, at least from a duration perspective. I assumed going in that I\u2019d have talked to my mom the most, given that I talked to her almost every day, but it turns out that I actually talked to my sisters the most \u2014 despite not talking to them every day our average call was much longer and that added up.", "I spent a significant amount of time on the phone in the month of January \u2014 primarily to my immediate family, but I didn\u2019t discriminate, talking to 33 different people across the month. Total, I spent 14 hours, 20 minutes and 7 seconds on the phone (which is equivalent to the flight time from Portland, OR where I live to Buenos Aires, Argentina). There wasn\u2019t really a rhyme or reason to when I made phone calls, nor a ton of anomalies on day of the week (other than Sundays, I have no idea what I did every Sunday all month though\u2026)", "I\u2019m off to go plan future travel or something like that, I\u2019ll be back next month with something (theoretically). If you have any ideas about things you\u2019d like me to track, feel free to shoot me a note on LinkedIn (please don\u2019t call me, that\u2019d be too meta\u2026.)", "Your home for data science.
