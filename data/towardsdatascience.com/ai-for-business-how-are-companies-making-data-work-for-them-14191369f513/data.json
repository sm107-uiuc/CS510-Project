It was reported recently that scientists had discovered a new type of antibiotic using a powerful algorithm, an achievement heralded as a breakthrough in the fight against the growing problem of drug resistance. Industries ranging from journalism to retail, HR and aerospace have all seen fascinating examples of AI technology change the ways they do business in recent times. But how do these eye-catching stories translate to real businesses adapting to AI on the ground?", "AI is a huge opportunity for businesses to capitalize on the relatively recent and massive proliferation of data. According to McKinsey, AI has the potential to deliver additional global economic activity of around $13 trillion by 2030, or about 16% higher cumulative GDP compared with today. AI and machine learning are examples of tools that businesses can utilize to make sense of what is known as Big Data (data sets too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing software). But many companies, particularly small and medium-sized ones, have faced challenges adapting to the technology wholesale. These include a deficiency in technical skills required to utilize AI, a lack of understanding of its benefits or uses, or difficulty in defining a strategy and finding an appropriate use-case for the technology. It\u2019s vital to have a clear picture of what you want to achieve with an AI project; much like a jigsaw puzzle, you need to know what the result is supposed to look like before you start putting pieces together.", "\u201cEven though we hear that most business leaders believe AI provides a competitive advantage, up until recently, some industry watchers have pegged enterprise adoption at less than 20%.\u201d", "Once these barriers have been overcome, however, there is a virtually endless variety of applications for the technology. AI can improve automation, augmentation and scaling of many human-like processes. These can include:", "Automating expert decisions: using algorithms to calculate optimal maintenance schedules in a factory, for example. Ticket resale company StubHub reported a 90% reduction in online fraud after implementing a predictive analytics and statistical analysis package.", "Automating unskilled work: e.g. handwriting recognition to speed-up form-processing.", "Relieving skilled workers of unskilled tasks, freeing them to perform their core duties. This has implications in all sorts of industries, from cutting down on the amount of paperwork that nurses have to complete, allowing them more time with patients, to artists automating repetitive, time-consuming parts of the creative process.", "Machine learning tools can analyze large datasets to identify patterns or make predictions. Examples include Natural Language Processing applications that can analyze social media posts to see what customers are saying about a brand or tailored sales promotions for customers. Spanish financial services company CaixaBank recently reported a 50% increase in \u2018real sells\u2019 through personalized, targeted messages.", "A healthcare agency, for example, can use data from claims and biometric measures to produce machine learning models that accurately predict the likelihood of patients developing a disease. The model could also predict interventions most likely to improve the patients\u2019 health outlook.", "Smaller businesses and startups are agile enough to implement their own AI strategies from the ground up and may offer services to more established organizations. Many larger businesses that haven\u2019t yet adopted successful AI projects could have amazing opportunities to do so. These may include large data sets that haven\u2019t been fully analyzed, unstructured data sets, analytical classification and predictive tasks, forecasting, or document review and summarization.", "Some potential use cases by sector include:", "Marketing: DX Marketing reported delivering analytics projects 70% faster with machine learning, which corresponded with a 25% growth in revenue over six months.", "Financial Services: virtual assistants, fraud detection and natural-language processing on contracts have all been successfully implemented across numerous companies.", "Retail: Basket analysis and smart promotions can connect a business to its customers.", "Energy: Streamlining operations, exploration & discovery and predictive maintenance can all be facilitated by AI. Energy Australia utilized a Big Data solution to monitor the world\u2019s longest interconnected power grid to provide a seamless experience for their customers.", "Healthcare: Medical records, patient care and medical & image analysis can be simplified and made more accessible. The NHS reported being able to detect anomalies in behaviours where claims were made against healthcare professionals, and ultimately claimed savings of $561 million across the department by utilizing advanced analytics.", "Entertainment: AI recommendations account for 75% of usage on Netflix. Predicting consumer choices is a surefire way to keep people watching.", "The good news for business (and everybody else) is that by 2020, AI will become a net-positive job motivator, eliminating 1.8 million jobs while creating 2.3 million jobs", "The better news for business is that there are plenty of choices out there for third-party cloud-based machine learning solutions, negating the need for an expensive analytics department. Company strategists will have to decide how they want to approach this opportunity, keeping in mind the size and type of their business. What is certain is that the opportunity is massive and exists across industries, from one-person start-ups all the way up to mega-corps.", "Your home for data science.
