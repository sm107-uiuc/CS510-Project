We see their results every day, for example when Amazon recommends us products that are sometimes perfect for us, even though we had never searched them before. This usually scares some people, especially because not many people know how these algorithms actually work in practice, so I\u2019ll try to summarise the basics here. Whether you are a data scientist and want to start digging deeper into recommender systems or you are just curious to understand how the whole thing happens in real life, this is a good place to start.", "Recommendation algorithms can be split into two different groups, depending on their approach: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.", "Collaborative filtering takes into account similarities in taste, meaning that if Alice liked Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia movies but hated Transformers, and Bob likes Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings movies, we assume he is more likely to like The Chronicles of Narnia than Transformers. It is, thus, based on the similarity between users, not products.", "Content-based filtering, on the other hand, models the likelihood of liking a certain movie by looking at the features themselves. In the example above, we could sense that Alice and Bob like the fantasy genre, and recommend The Hobbit for both of them. In this example, it is based on the similarity between products, not users.", "In order to do any of the methods above, we have to find a way of finding similar users or similar products. Better yet, we need a way to measure similarities between them, so we can fin which products/users are \u201cmore similar\u201d than others.", "Similarity can be found by measuring distances: the nearer two elements, the more similar they are. In mathematics, there are many ways of measuring distance, but first let\u2019s understand what distance means in this context.", "In our day-to-day life, the distance between two points is measured using these points\u2019 spatial coordinates. For instance, if I know my exact spatial coordinates (longitude and latitude) and where I want to go, I can calculate my distance to this point using what we call Euclidean distance:", "How do we do this with when, instead of geographical coordinates, we have features such as age and sex, or movie genres? Well, it turns out to be not that different, except that with spatial coordinates we have 2 features (X and Y), and in our case, we end up with many more features and a high-dimensional space which is hard to visualise in a plot. It\u2019s not this article\u2019s goal to get into the details of the many available distance metrics, but if you want to read more about it, there is a good article here. Once we are able to calculate similarities between elements (users or products), we can then try different approaches to recommend products.", "Let\u2019s add some more people to our previous example with Alice and Bob. In a pure collaborative filtering approach, we would first take users\u2019 ratings (1\u20135) for our movies:", "We could then try to recommend a movie to Bob by trying to infer his ratings to the 2 movies that he hasn\u2019t watched yet. One way of doing this could be by taking the 2 users that are the closest to him (in this case Alice and Carol), and estimate his rating by taking their average ratings for each movie. For The Chronicles of Narnia, we would estimate 4.5, and 1 for Transformers (since Carol did not rate it, we wouldn\u2019t take her rating into account). In practice, we would probably use a lot more than 2 users, and maybe weight their ratings according to their distance to Bob, so more similar users\u2019 ratings are given a bigger weight. Notice that this approach has nothing to do with their age or sex, nor with the actual movies content: it is based purely on ratings and similarity between users.", "Content-based filtering is based on the similarity between products. One way of doing it is by using product features. In our example, it could look like this:", "To recommend a movie to Bob, we can look at which movies are more similar to the movies he liked, based on the features shown above. He likes Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, which are closer to The Chronicles of Narnia than to Transformers, based on the table above.", "Most companies use a hybrid approach, meaning they combine collaborative and content-based filtering, taking into consideration not only ratings and categories, but also demographic data such as age and gender, and more advanced features such as the text content in a book, for instance. Especially when you don\u2019t have enough data for a specific user, such as ratings, to be able to infer their preferences from that, you can use demographics to estimate it.", "If you want to learn a bit more about recommender systems, you can check this very useful article or, if you are interested in the mathematical and operation details, you can check out this book.", "Your home for data science.
