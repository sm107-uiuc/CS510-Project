What happens to all that corpus? Some human (mostly unpaid or underpaid) manually analyses it for some basic pattern , which is always if the endangered animal present or not and if an unexpected humans are seen. The sheer volume creates a lag in the system and inefficiencies. Most wildlife reserves still uses manual estimation to do animal census; which generates bad data and then that results in poor decision making. When I saw how Anthony\u2019s naive CNN code can detect elephants (killed heavily for ivory) & can help prevent poaching; it struck me that AI is more about imagination than algorithm. It can also potentially help track movements & habitat changes and avoid human conflict.I hope to expand it to Tigers and deploy as one of Wild Neurals project in tiger reserves soon. Still, lots of wildlife species out there which needs little attention ! Git", "There are ~7000 languages in the world, but most are dying. And with it dies the culture, the stories and a link to human evolution. For example; Madia, the language of the land where famous Jungle Book is based out of, is critically endangered.The major cause of extinction is lack of scripts as most native languages are only verbal.Technical revolution makes it even more marginalized . There is a serious dilemma as to how to educate natives in their own language when all education is only available in foreign language & no one from outside can easily learn their language? Forcing natives/tribal to learn modern languages may seem noble but is also seen as colonialism by them. How can we make their language accessible so that modernity comes to them than other way round? @TeHiku used Deep Learning to build the first speech recognition system for the M\u0101ori language of the indigenous NZ people. The goal is to train machines to transcribe thousands of hours of native language speaker audio recordings to make native te reo M\u0101ori more accessible to language learners as native speaker population is in decline. The project for Luxembergish is also underway. Github", "India in 60\u2019s was a chronically starving nation, always begging US to feed its hungry masses. This is despite agriculture being largest industry then. The problem? Poor yields due to age old methods! Late 60\u2019s saw India adopt modern technology with the help from US & Mexico , that increased its food production so much that it could export even after feeding a billion. This agri-tech transformation is known as \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d in India. But unfortunately nothing much has changed since then. Now its facing a new crisis led by crop failures that results in ~50,000 farmer suicides each year and still worsening. A German company uses crop pictures, later processed by Deep Learning model to predict plant diseases, which coupled with other features can provide further recommendations on epidemics of crop worms & yields. Model is based on vanilla CNN algorithm. While world is focused on high risk human diagnosis, this low risk plant diagnosis is having a larger human impact. Full Story (5 mins read)", "Illegal Mining in Africa and Latin America , is a huge problem . It not just causes deadly pollution but loss of habitat for natives, revenue plunder, child labor and human trafficking. One company is helping detect this Leprosy of the Land by doing image segmentation with Keras in Ukraine. Rainforest Foundation is providing drones in Amazon to arm native Peruvians protect their habitat. But does detection really lead to a cure? As below video story unfolds we see that, while AI & drones can detect daylight robbery; it is still helpless in a society where justice is a luxury. The deforestation continues even after police sees it nakedly. Does AI work when their is no rule of law or human rights? Unfortunately, the hype of AI seems to suggest it as a panacea but forgets to add that star \u2014 not applicable everywhere! It can work effectively if society has foundations built on equality, liberty & justice. This is not being pessimistic but reality check that AI may have all the solutions but its not an replacement for human struggle!
