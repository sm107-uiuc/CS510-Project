Let\u2019s say we have three questions in total:", "1). How do football players stay safe?", "2). What is the most hated NFL football team?", "3). Who is the greatest political leader?", "The Document-Term Matrix for the three questions is:", "Each row is a question (or document), each column is a term (or word), we label \u201c0\u201d if that document does not contain that term, \u201c1\u201d if that document contains that term once, \u201c2\u201d if that document contains that term twice, and so on.", "Latent means hidden, Dirichlet is a type of probability distribution.

As humans, we know exactly what each question is about.", "The 1st question is about football, the 3rd question is about politics, and the 4th question is about politics and football. When we fit these 4 questions to LDA, it will give us back something like this:", "The 1st question is 100% of Topic A, the 3rd question is 100% of Topic B, and the last question is split of Topic A and Topic B. It is our job as humans to interpret them.", "The word \u201cfootball\u201d has the highest weight in Topic A, followed by \u201cNFL\u201d followed by \u201cplayer\u201d.

If we reduce the number of topics, at some point, these sport related topics will collapse themselves and become one topic. Like any unsupervised learning there is no metrics this is better than that one. We basically have to choose for our own use case.", "I tried Gensim first, with 20 topics, and \u2026", "A good topic model will have little or no overlapping, this is definitely not the case here. Let\u2019s try Scikit-Learn.", "I kept the top 20 most frequent words from each topic that found by LDA. Here we are showing a partial table:", "Then look over top words in each topic, manually assign the theme to each topic.

I agree.", "The 2nd test question was \u201cJust like Larry Page and Sergey Brin unseated their incumbents with a better search engine, how likely is it that two Computer Science PhD students create a search engine that unseats Google? How vulnerable is Google to this possibility?\u201d", "Using the same way, this new question has been allocated to the topic that has \u201ccountry, student, computer, science\u201d and so on as top keywords. The word \u201ccomputer\u201d and \u201cproject\u201d have the highest weight, for this new question. And the theme of the topic is \u201cStudent/Internet/Computer/Science/Research\u201d. I agree too.", "As illustrated above, we take the term-document matrix, decompose to two matrices, first one has every topic and what terms in it, and 2nd one has every document and what topics in it.", "Let\u2019s use our football and politics example again:", "On the left we have 3 questions, on the right we have term-document matrix for these 3 questions.

So, I assigned \u201cWord start from ph\u201d as the theme to this topic.", "Using the same questions, we are going to see how NMF model is going to allocate it into one of these 20 topics.", "Question 1: \u201cWhat are the most important lessons you have learned in your life and when did you learn them?\u201d", "Question 1 has been allocated to the topic that has \u201clife, change, moment, meaning, experience\u201d and so on as top keywords, and the theme of this topic is \u201cLife/Experience/Love/Purpose\u201d.
