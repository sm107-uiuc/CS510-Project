Consequently, data visualization started playing a pivotal role in the day to day affairs than ever before. Hence acquiring skills in this arena is gaining prominence.", "In the world of data science, Python is the programming language of choice(the undisputed leader in data science). Hence we would be considering Matplotlib for plotting. Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of command style functions that enables matplotlib to work like MATLAB. pyplot function can be made to create a figure, create a plotting area in a figure, plot some lines in a plotting area, decorate the plot with labels, etc. Visualizations can be quickly generated using a pyplot.", "Let\u2019s create some code in Jupyter notebook to create a normal distribution. For the uninitiated, normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. It can be easily identified by the bell-shaped curve(Probability Density Function) and its symmetry.", "The code creates a simple plot of the normal distribution with mean=0 and standard deviation=1. As our primary concern is about making plots more beautiful, the explanation of code about the mathematical aspects will be rather brief. np.linspace() returns evenly spaced samples(number of samples equal to num) over a specific interval[start, stop]. scipy.stats.norm() returns a normal continuous random variable. scipy.stats.norm.pdf() computes the PDF at any point for a given value of mean(mu) and standard deviation(std).", "The graph seems to appear too ordinary and bland. There are neither labels nor title to provide some valuable information to a third person. There\u2019s no grid to easily identify and correlate values. The size of the figure is also a bit small to my liking.", "Let\u2019s make the plots beautiful by harnessing the various features of pyplot.", "Grids help to easily identify and correlate values in the plot. plt.grid() configures grid lines. It shows the grid in default settings.", "A simple code to create a figure is as follows:", "plt.figure() creates a new figure. plt.axes() assigns axes to the new figure and makes it the current axes(plural of axis). The figure of Matplotlib can be considered as a single container that contains all the information about axes, graphics, text, and labels. The axes can be seen as a bounding box with ticks and labels that will contain the plot elements of visualization. plt.show() displays all figures and block until the figures have been closed", "Let\u2019s play around with various aspects of the grid(). Start with the color of the grid.", "The color is a keyword argument that assigns the color to the grid. The optional parameter b takes boolean values(True or False). If set to False, grids will disappear. However, if any keyword arguments(like alpha, color, linewidth, etc) is present, then b will be set to True irrespective of the value of b given. For instance, if the above code snippet is changed:", "The output will be the same plot with the red-colored grid as shown above.", "For color, you can use any of the following strings as values:", "The properties of various keyword arguments in the code are as mentioned below:", "Note: The curves or lines of the plot can be styled in the same way as the grid using the same keyword arguments.", "The color and linestyle arguments can be combined to give a non-keyword argument. For example, \u2018c- -\u2019 is equivalent to setting color=\u2019cyan\u2019, linestyle=\u2019- -\u2018 as shown in the code below:", "This combining of color and linestyle will not work with the grid().", "The major and minor grid lines can be shown by providing any of the three values to which parameter of plt.grid(). The three values are major, minor and both. These are self-explanatory as their name suggests. The value major displays major gridlines while minor displays minor grid lines. The value both displays both major and minor gridlines simultaneously.", "plt.minorticks_on() displays minor ticks on the axes. The disadvantage is that it may reduce performance.", "Start by adding labels to the x-axis and y-axis. matplotlib.pylot.xlabel() is for adding labels to the x-axis. Similarly, ylabel() is for assigning labels to the y-axis. The fontsize is a matplotlib text keyword argument( **kwargs) and is used to control the size of the fonts of the labels.", "Matplotlib sets the default axes limits if the axes limits are not specifically mentioned. You can set the limits using plt.xlim() and plt.ylim for setting the x limits and y limits respectively.", "We have seen how to customize grids. Nevertheless, there is a plt.tick_params() method that can change the appearance of ticks, tick labels, and gridlines in one line of code. Isn\u2019t it convenient and powerful?", "The axis argument specifies the axis(\u2018x\u2019, \u2018y\u2019 or \u2018both\u2019) upon which the parameters are to be applied. direction places the ticks inside the axes, outside the axes, or both. The arguments length and width give the tick length and tick width(in float). The labelcolor assigns colors to the tick labels. colors argument sets the tick color and label color. grid_color sets the color of the grid and grid_alpha sets the opacity of the grid. plt.tick_params() can be used to change the important properties of the grid like grid_color(color), grid_alpha(float), grid_linewidth(float) and grid_linestyle(string).", "Legend is the wording on the map or diagram explaining the symbols used in it. plt.legend() method places the legend on the axes.", "When multiple lines are present in a plot, the code varies a bit from the usual practice.", "The position of legend can also be changed by setting appropriate values(\u2018lower right\u2019, \u2018lower left\u2019, \u2018upper right\u2019, \u2018upper left\u2019 etc.) to loc.", "Let\u2019s add all these functions to our code and see how the Plot 1 looks like.", "One of the several ways to save the plot as an image is to right-click on the plot and select \u2018save image as\u2019 option(the default option with any web browser).", "The other option is to use plt.savefig() method. It saves the current figure to the current working directory.", "To verify that the image has been properly saved, Image object of the IPython.display module is used. The following code will display the image.", "By default, the size of the plot displayed by Jupyter notebook is pretty small. The default size is only 640x480. However, the saved images have even smaller dimensions.", "The saved file has dimensions 433px * 288px. Let\u2019s tweak the settings to have custom size for the plot. The plt.rcParams[] is for this specific purpose. The general syntax is as follows:", "Matplotlib uses matplotlibrc configuration files to customize all kinds of properties, which we call \u2018rc settings\u2019 or \u2018rc parameters\u2019. Defaults of almost every property in Matplotlib can be controlled: figure size and DPI, line width, color and style, axes, axis and grid properties, text and font properties and so on. Once the matplotlibrc file is found, it will not search for any other paths. The location of the currently active matplotlibrc file can be seen by typing the following commands:", "The important point to be noted here is that the figsize tuple accepts the values in inches. To convert to centimeter(cm), divide the value by 2.54 will do the job, as 1 inch = 2.54 cm.", "Now try to customize the size of Plot 2 using rcParams.", "plt.style.use() can be used to switch to easy-to-use plotting styles. The style package provides a wide array of preset styles thereby making the plots attractive and their dimensions larger.", "The plt.style.available command lists all the various styles that are available for use.", "Suppose if we wish to have a dark background for the plot, then plt.style.use(\u2018dark_background\u2019) will serve the purpose.", "Matplotlib is the de-facto Python visualization library. I have covered every important aspect of Pyplot to make your plots in Jupyter notebook stand out. I believe the information being shared here would make your plots more meaningful and beautiful.", "The data visualization is witnessing change as I type. As someone rightly said, the only thing that never changes is the change itself. Permanence is an illusion. Many new tools are emerging like Tableau, Bokeh, Plotly, etc. Maybe in the future, a more feature-rich and technically sophisticated tool might replace Matplotlib as the numero uno tool. Till then, Happy Coding!!!", "Your home for data science.
