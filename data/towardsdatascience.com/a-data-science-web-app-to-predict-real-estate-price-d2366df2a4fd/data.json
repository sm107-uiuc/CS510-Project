It has always been an idea to combine these two interests and merge them together and make a project. Finally, I have managed to accomplish this task by building a web app that predicts the real estate price for properties and houses across the city of Bengaluru, India. It has been a huge project and has taken a while. I shall make sure to walk you through every step that I have followed.", "The project mainly has 4 steps:", "The first step is typical data science work where we take a data set from Kaggle called \u2018Bengaluru House price data\u2019 .We will perform some extensive data cleaning work on it to ensure that it gives accurate results during prediction.", "This jupyter notebook entitled \u2018RealEstatePricePredictor.ipynb\u2019 is where we perform all the data science related work. As the jupyter notebook is self-explanatory I shall briefly touch upon the concepts that I have implemented. Our dataset requires a lot of work in terms of data cleaning. In fact, 70% of the notebook is all about data cleaning where we drop empty rows and remove unnecessary columns that won\u2019t help in prediction.", "Next step, Feature Engineering which is the process of extracting useful and important information from the dataset that will contribute the most towards a successful prediction.", "The final step is handling outliers. Outliers are anomalies that cause an enormous amount of damage to data and prediction. There is a lot of things to understand from the dataset logically to detect and remove these outliers.", "Again, all of these have been explained in the jupyter notebook.", "In the end, the original dataset which had almost 13000 rows and 9 columns are reduced to almost 7000 rows and 5 columns.", "The final data obtained is subjected to a machine learning model. We will mainly use K-fold Cross Validation and GridSearchCV technique to perform hyper parameter tuning to obtain the best algorithm and parameters for the model.", "Turns out linear regression model gives the best results for our data with a score above 80% which is not bad.", "Now, our model needs to be exported into a pickle file (Bengaluru_House_Data.pickle) which converts python objects into a character stream. Also, we need to export the locations(columns) into a json(columns.json) file to be able to interact with it from the frontend.", "We will use a Flask server as our backend to host the application locally. In the server folder we will set up two files:", "The server.py file will be responsible for handling the routes for fetching the location names and predicting the house price. It also gets the form data from the front end and feeds it to the util.py. These routes can be tested using Postman app.", "The util.py file is the main brains behind the back end. It has a function to load the JSON and pickle file. This file takes the form data from server.py and uses the model to predict the estimated price of the property.", "The front end is made up of simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user can select the number of square feet area, BHK, bathrooms and location in the form and hit on \u2018ESTIMATE\u2019 button to get the estimated price. The JavaScript file is responsible for interacting with both the backend flask server routes and the frontend HTML. It gets the form data filled by the user and calls the function that uses the prediction model and renders the estimated price in lakhs rupees (1 lakh = 100000).", "Let's see how our project works. Run the server.py file in the backend and open up the HTML web page we created. Input the area of the property in square feet, the number of BHK, the number of bathrooms and the location and hit \u2018ESTIMATE\u2019. \ud83d\ude32Yay! We predicted the price of what could be the dream house of someone.", "This part is quite tricky so make sure to do every step along with me.", "As of now, the project is only local, we will learn how to deploy the application to the web using AWS EC2 instance.", "We will use nginx which is a web server that can serve HTTP requests. The nginx can then interact with our Flask Server.", "Download nginx from here and install it.", "These two were just for the sake of running our app locally, now we must change these two lines into:", "We need to configure the reverse proxy on nginx server so that all requests to \u2018/api\u2019 are routed to port 5000 only.", "Copy this command. It would look something like this.", "You are now connected to the Linux machine on AWS cloud.", "Copy this to your WinSCP host name as this is the host name of your virtual machine.", "You should see the homepage of nginx running.", "Copy-paste the following code in the .conf file. This is the reverse proxy setup.", "What we are doing in the above command is establishing a symbolic link.", "Your application is now live on the internet accessible from any place in the world.", "I understand if the deployment phase was a little tough. You can contact me on my LinkedIn if you run into any errors. Feel free to check out the entire code-base on my GitHub.", "I hope you all understood and learnt many things along the way.", "Your home for data science.
