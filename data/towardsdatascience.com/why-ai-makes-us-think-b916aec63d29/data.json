No news there. Just ask Daniel Dennett, or any philosopher of the mind.", "I mean that AI made us think again about the ethics and politics of computerized systems.", "Recently, I have noticed several voices call to \u201cregulate algorithms\u201d.", "Taken at face value, this phrase makes no sense. An algorithm is a recipe: a sequence of steps to solve a class of problems in a deterministic way. Surely, there is no need to regulate any algorithm in this sense.", "What the call for regulation actually intends to target is not what is classically known as an algorithm, but what only recently has started to be called an algorithm, namely: software systems that employ non-algorithmic components to make autonomous decisions.", "To understand what is going on, you need to know that the word \u201calgorithm\u201d has shifted meaning in two steps:", "Like a M\u00f6bius strip or an alligator biting its own tail upside down, the meaning of the world \u201calgorithm\u201d has shifted from \u201cdeterministic recipe\u201d to \u201ccomputerized system with non-algorithmic, data-driven decision-making components\u201d.", "And, actually, it is the ingredients of \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cdecision\u201d in this newly reborn notion of \u201calgorithm\u201d that explains why there is reason for ethical concerns and political debate, and hence for the call for regulation.", "Algorithms (in the new sense) make use of data \u2014 our data, the data of citizen-consumers \u2014 to make decisions that affect us. Affect our assets, movements, jobs, liberties, rights. In short: that affect our lives.", "Whenever personal data is handled, privacy is a concern. And privacy is intimately connected to the autonomy and agency of the individual.", "Whenever life-affecting decisions are made, accountability is a concern: our ability to scrutinize and call into question the reasons for a decision, and therefore its legitimacy.", "So, while computerized systems have been around and influential in our lives for half a century at least, their increased use of our data and increased power to make decisions indeed justifies to think again about their ethics and politics.", "My recommendation to those engaged in that debate, whether they are politicians, policy-makers, citizens, or (computer) scientists, is to reflect for a moment on the words they employ. Clarity of thought requires clarity of language. Make sure you are clear at least on what \u201calgorithm\u201d means.", "Joost Visser is professor of Software and Data Science at Leiden University. Joost holds a degree in Computer Science from Delft University of Technology and in Philosophy from Leiden University.", "NB: Interestingly, the Algorithmic Accountability Act of the US Congress only uses the word \u201calgorithm\u201d twice. Once in its title, and once to explain that this is merely the short title of the actual act that then goes on to state its true subject of regulation to be \u201cautomated decision systems\u201d. A regulation with clear content and a confusing title.", "Your home for data science.
