More and more people realize that being \u2018nerdy\u2019 and \u2018geeky\u2019 is a good thing, working with technologies is cool, and knowing how to code is the new kind of literacy. However, not everyone is ready to go back to school for another four-five-seven years to get a traditional degree. Enter the bootcamps. In just a few months they promise to give you all necessary skills and knowledge to become a developer, or a data scientist, or a UX designer, or a cyber security professional. What\u2019s that catch, right?", "I\u2019d like to share my personal story that will hopefully help you make a decision.", "As many people who want to join a bootcamp, I\u2019m a career changer. My first degree was in journalism (BA and MA from Moscow State University), and I have been working in science journalism for several years when I lived in Moscow. My special skill was to read a science paper, understand what the researchers did, and translate it into a \u2018human\u2019 language. After some time of writing about the heroes, I wanted to become one.", "I moved to New York and I remember studying math for several hours every day as a hobby. I was really passionate about it, but didn\u2019t even hope that my hobby would change my future. Until I decided to test my luck and apply to Columbia University. I know, this story is supposed to be about the bootcamp, not the traditional education, but bear with me.", "After graduating with a degree in applied mathematics, I didn\u2019t even know what to do with it. I wanted to do research and analytics, but there was one big problem: I didn\u2019t have any marketable skills. Honestly, who would pay a woman for solving differential equations by hand?", "That\u2019s when my friend told me about coding bootcamps. I knew that I didn\u2019t want to study software engineering, I wanted to study something a little more heavy on math. So I picked data science.", "There are several bootcamps in New York city that teach data science. Some only accept applicants with a PhD in technical discipline, some are more competitive, some a less, but in my experience that application process is similar across all of them. First, it\u2019s a good idea to book a campus tour and actually breath the same air as the students breath. Watch them work, interact with the instructors, feel the atmosphere, ask as many questions as possible. After all, you also need to understand what your daily commute would be like once you get in.", "Next, you need to fill a form, where you talk about yourself, your background, and your experience with coding. And yes, you do need some experience with coding, or at least a burning desire to learn how to code. I recommend starting with free or very affordable courses, such as youtube tutorials or Codecademy. If you are like me and interested in data science, you need to know the fundamentals of Python and SQL.", "After that, you need to complete the first part of the pre-work that will be sent to you after you apply. There will be some programming, some linear algebra, some calculus. You guessed, the math part was pretty easy for me, but I promise, there is nothing you can\u2019t learn with some passion and determination. Then come the interviews.", "There will be two interviews \u2014 cultural and technical. Cultural interview is the chance for you to show that you are interested, share your story, ask questions, and demonstrate determination and eagerness to learn. This is important: bootcamps are called bootcamps for a reason, you are expected to learn and do a lot of work by yourself, without people \u2018spoon-feeding\u2019 you the skills. Technical interview is the stressful part (at least it was for me). For data science program, there will be two parts: programming and math. You will be asked to share your screen with the interviewer and complete some fairly simple challenges (they will be simple if you honestly did the pre-work). The important part here is not to panic: they are not trying to trick you, don\u2019t overthink the questions.", "If you passed both interviews, you\u2019re in. If not, they will ask you to level up your skills and try again in three to four months. Once you\u2019re in, you need to complete the second part of the pre-work, it will get you ready for day one. There will be more coding, learning how to use the command line, and other fun and exciting stuff.", "The bootcamp where I studied data science offered a fifteen-week full time program. What does it mean? There were 12 weeks of studying and 3 final weeks of working on your most important final project. Those 12 weeks were roughly divided into 7 modules, each of those modules covered a specific data science topic: Python programming, SQL programming, statistics, regression, classification, natural language processing, time series analysis, deep learning, and many more.", "The first few weeks are mostly introductory, so it is important to pay attention. There will be lectures \u2014 make notes and ask questions. There will be working alone on so-called labs, and there will also be pair programming. You are expected to learn how to work on your own and with a partner.", "Starting with Mod 4, your routine will be divided into two parts: lecture weeks and project weeks. During the lecture weeks you will learn from the instructors and do daily coding challenges with a partner. Project weeks are when you work on a topic of your choosing, but using the skills and technologies that you just covered: you can classify the pokemons for your classification project, predict the quality of wine for your regression project, analyze The New York Times articles for your natural language processing \u2014 anything you want. But keep in mind that these projects will later be on your resume, so don\u2019t pick anything too wild.", "If you chose a full-time in-person program, you are expected to be on campus between 9 AM and 6 PM. It will be like your new full-time job. Attendance will be taken, so don\u2019t make it a habit of running late or leaving early: if you\u2019re present on campus less than 95% of the time, you won\u2019t graduate.", "Typically I would come to campus at 8:45\u20138:50 AM, get some coffee and get ready for the day. Almost every day at 9 AM sharp there will be a coding challenge. Our coaches would pair us up and send us to the lecture room. They will also send us a coding challenge (typically from Hackerrank or Leetcode) and we would have 15\u201320 minutes to figure it out. The first pair to send the solution to the slack channel will explain it to the rest of the class. No grades, just practice.", "Next, we would go back to our seats and work individually. You can do the labs and practice new skills, watch tutorials, research a new topic. Or, if it\u2019s a project week, you are expected to be working on your project. Coaches and instructors are almost always there. And they\u2019re there to help. You can pick their brains with your data science related questions at any time.", "You have one hour to go get lunch in the afternoon, so you can choose between actually going out or just buying something to go and coming back to campus, because you are too excited about what you\u2019re working on and don\u2019t mind eating at the desk.", "In the afternoon there will be lectures, typically one or two per day. This is your chance to gain as much knowledge as possible. Practicing your skills is extremely important, but these lectures are you chance to learn the fundamentals, and what\u2019s happening under the hood, when you\u2019re typing those two lines of code.", "After lectures you\u2019ll have a couple of hours to continue your individual work until you go home at 6 PM. Sometimes you\u2019ll leave even later, but nobody will force you to stay after 6.", "You are not expected to work at home in your free time, or do extra over the weekend. It is important to take care of yourself, and your coaches and instructors know it. But at least do some reading: new publications on Medium may be your inspiration for the next project.", "The best part of being a full-time bootcamp student is people. All these amazing people that you get to know. There will be instructors who give lectures \u2014 these guys have real professional experience, and you should really pay attention to what they say. There are coaches, who are happy to help and answer any questions that you have (they give lectures sometimes too). There are students from the cohort start started before you, you can learn from their experience, there are students from the cohort that started after you, you can share your experience with them. Students from other programs, such as software engineers and UX designers, and finally, students from your cohort. These are your best friends and your family. You will work with most of them on the morning coding challenges, and with some of them you will spend an entire week working on a project, and later presenting it together to the entire class.", "Almost every student and former student that I personally talked to would describe this program as a roller coaster. There will be moments when you are absolutely amazed by what you just learned or did, there will be moments of complete frustration, when you don\u2019t understand anything and the future seems hopeless. Sometimes these moments can be back to back. It is important to understand that even the best students don\u2019t get some of the topics, but you need to make an effort and ask questions, talk to the instructors, do some research. You will get it eventually.", "There were times when it seemed that I bit off more than I could chew. I remember panicking and figuring out the plan B, bugging the instructors and other students, trying to figure out things on my own. But looking back I\u2019d say I did a pretty good job. I finished every project that I planned (not without help, of course).", "It is NOT for you if:", "I hope my story helps you make a decision. If you have any questions, I\u2019d be happy to help. Connect with me on LinkedIn, and feel free to shoot me a message.", "Data scientist, Math and Physics enthusiast.
