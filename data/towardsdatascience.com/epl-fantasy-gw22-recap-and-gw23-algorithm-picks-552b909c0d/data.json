My partner in crime for this project has been Andrew Sproul, who just like me has lots of passion for Data Science, ML / AI and the Fantasy Sports.", "The top players in the world did relatively well, averaging 67pts compared to GW average of 57pts. There was one sicko who almost doubled the average with for the week with 111pts! But overall, if you scored anywhere in the 60pt+ range, you can still feel pretty good about yourself.", "While we\u2019re on the topic of the Top 100 players in the world let\u2019s look at who the most selected players on their teams by position and the most preferred team formations for GW22 were.", "We used this data and the current player prices to create the team below which is a blend of the most selected players by Top100:", "Pretty good looking team, and lots of wiggle room to try some different picks on key positions, while still keeping a solid core of players.", "Now that Vardy is back in business, we\u2019re back to the more popular attacking formations of 3\u20134\u20133 or 4\u20133\u20133.", "Overall this was a decent week for us with 60pts, above the average of 57. We were hoping for more points from Vardy as our captain and as I mentioned in last week\u2019s blog I was considering Rashford as close second choice for captain, so we wished we picked him instead :) Another empty week for Jimenez, but at least our two transfers from last week \u2014 Rashfrod and Willian paid off, so we\u2019re happy with that.", "Let\u2019s start with the Adjusted Opponent Difficulty Rating (FDR) for the next three game-weeks below:", "Looks like Burnley, Southampton, Sheffield Utd, Wolves and Man Utd have a relatively difficult program with, so our Algo will not be making any picks from these teams. Teams with relatively easy schedules are Bournemouth, Aston Villa, Everton, Newcastle, Leicester, Liverpool, Watford and Brighton.", "The data below comes from an independent site that updates the latest injuries much more frequently than the Fantasy Website:", "As per a reader\u2019s request last week I will now be posting the top and bottom 50 players in terms of ROI, so our readers can have a look at a broader pool of high-ROI players to pick from and overpriced and under-performing players to stay away from.", "Our algorithm takes in adjusted budget per team formation and tries to maximize spend per position for the main 11 players, and then get you subs which are good ROI value to fill the rest of the team. Based on current ROI scores, filtering out any team with AVG opponent difficulty (FDR \u2265 75th %) over next three games and removing injured players from the list of available picks, our algorithm picked the team below as optimal for spending the full $100MM budget:", "Looks like a pretty balanced team with some money left in the bank for experimenting with different configurations.", "As far as our own team is concerned, we decided to not make any subs as we want to save some free subs for next week and try to get more Liverpool players for the double game week :)", "Looking at Best / Worst defense and offense can be used in a few different ways \u2014 for example, if a best offense team is playing a worst defense team, you might want to captain your attacking mid or striker. Also, you might want to give preference to DF and GK from the best defensive teams when looking at the algorithmic recommendations for these positions.", "SIX consecutive clean sheets for Liverpool now! Really starting to dominate the on the defensive side.", "Below you can see the teams, sorted by cumulative player ROI. Note that an active player is any player that has played at least 33.33% of the total possible game time. So, we are counting any player that has played a total of at least 597 minutes as active on that team.", "Stats are starting to converge nicely here as the more solid performers with reasonably priced players are now occupying the top 5\u20138 spots. Some of the teams with expensive players that are struggling to catch up and improve their overall ROI are Spurs, Arsenal, Everton, and West Ham.", "Honestly, we don\u2019t expect that much from our team this week with Rashford showing as injured and also Man Utd playing Liverpool. We\u2019re hoping to get something from Jimenez as we\u2019re planning to sell him next week, so we can get another quality Liverpool player for the double GW!", "As always, thank you for reading, and we hope 2020 is off to a good start for all of you!
