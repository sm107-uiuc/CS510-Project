Each synapse has its own complex substructure, with signals coming in from all over the body, with all kinds of chemicals floating around that alter the way incoming signals get processed and redirected, with different areas inhibiting and exciting each other to struggle for the upper hand in determining the actions and feelings of the human being that they constitute.", "With a system as complex as the brain having to navigate a seemingly endless array of different and complex tasks, and being equipped with such a vast number of parameters (synaptic connections, neurotransmitter levels, structure of external stimuli, feelings from the body, short term and long term memory) that have to interact smoothly to guarantee the function of the system, it is obvious that a lot of things can go wrong.", "When complexity abounds, complex problems are bound to arise.", "Additionally taking into account that the brain was dreamt up by the fancies of evolution and not built in a top-down way by smart engineers (as is the case with a computer or a smartphone), with new brain areas coming in seemingly at random and old areas being re-functioned to serve new purposes, it\u2019s surprising that it works so well at all.", "It is becoming abundantly clear that mental health is a topic of great relevance, and it\u2019s not going away anytime soon. Estimates state that up to 40 percent of all people (in modern western societies) will have mental health issues warranting treatment during their lifetime. With depression rates, opioid deaths and suicides on the rise in the US to a degree that life expectancy is going down again for the first time in a long time, it is a topic that there is no way around.", "A caveat before I delve deeper into the subject: there is a fine line to be tread when it comes to understanding the causes of mental illnesses appropriately, and I think our societies have, to a large extent, failed to do so. Mental health issues have traditionally been accounted for by reasons that did not have much of anything to do with the brain. People were thought to be possessed by evil spirits and demons. Sometimes they were accused of a lack of character (as with the hundreds and thousands of shell-shocked, traumatized soldiers in World War 1 executed for cowardice) or a lack of work ethics, etc.", "Now I\u2019m not a fan of a purely mechanistic view of many mental illnesses such as depression. As laid out in Johann Hari\u2019s Lost Connections, there are potentially many different reasons for someone to be depressed, be they the increasing isolation of modern societies, a lack of perspective, trauma or grief not dealt with. Psychotic episodes are likewise strongly related to traumatic events prior to their onset. Under certain circumstances, mental \u201cillness\u201d naturally arises (see the controversy about the \u201cBereavement Exclusion\u201d), and blaming everything on a dysfunctional brain is too easy, is missing the psychological aspects and circumstances of the person behind the brain.", "But in other cases, I think it also clear that a psychological perspective is not useful, or not always the best angle for finding the right treatment, and at least some mental illnesses are best explained by functional disorders in the brain itself. Mending a person is best achieved by looking at a mental illness like at any other disease: identifying the physiological roots of the problems, finding the best intervention to restore healthy function, and applying that intervention through pharmacological or therapeutic means.", "Let\u2019s begin with two central assumptions:", "Nonlinear dynamical systems come with some counter-intuitive, hard-to-predict effects caused by its many interacting feedback loops. This means that if we truly want to model what is going on in the brain, we need to build nonlinear dynamical models that can capture nonlinear neural dynamics of effects such as neuron spiking, population-wide oscillations (alpha/beta/gamma\u2026), phase-coding (in which information is encoded by shifting a signal relative to a phase), chaotic activity patterns, or even just behaviors that change over time. It is further worth noting that not only network dynamics are dynamical systems, but each individual neuron can be viewed as its own dynamical system (see f.e. the Hodgkin-Huxley model), so dynamics play a role on all scales in the brain (single neuron, several neurons, between brain areas, on the scale of the entire brain\u2026)", "This all sounds very complicated, but we don\u2019t have a choice: it\u2019s very likely that many dysfunctions in the brain are connected to altered brain dynamics, so we need to understand the dynamics if we want to understand the illness.", "Luckily, machine learning provides some promising and scalable approaches helping us build nonlinear dynamical models.", "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a subtype of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which are formed by a set of connected, directed units called neurons. These neurons can connect to and pass input between each other depending on the strength of their respective connection. The sum of the inputs to the unit is then run through an activation function to give its output.", "RNNs further include a temporal sequence, allowing them to exhibit dynamics by communicating between the units. RNNs are not constrained to modeling brains: it can be shown that they are dynamically universal, meaning that they can simulate any other dynamical system under very general conditions. I have written in much more detail about how far their approximating power goes:", "This turns them into a powerful tool for studying dynamical systems in general. To get a better understanding of how this can work, let\u2019s take a look at a simple example.", "A Hopfield network is a very simple version of an RNN and was popularized by John Hopfield in 1982.", "It consists of a set of binary threshold units that are all interconnected with weights w_ij, which can be either positive (excitatory) or negative (inhibitory). The neurons that can be thought of as either firing or not firing (each unit either has the value \u201c 1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d, hence the name binary unit).", "Their firing depends on whether the input flowing into them through all the other neurons exceeds their threshold or not. The state of the whole network is characterized by the list of neurons with a corresponding number 1 or 0 encoding if they are firing or not (let\u2019s say for four units, it could be 0010).", "As the neurons \u201ctalk\u201d to each other, their activations change over time (so for the next time step, the activation of the network could be characterized by 0100, then 1100, and so on).", "No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the crumbs touched my palate than a shudder ran through me and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me [\u2026] And suddenly the memory revealed itself. The taste was that of the little piece of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray, when I went to say good morning to her in her bedroom, my aunt L\u00e9onie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of tea or tisane. The sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it. And all from my cup of tea.\u201dMarcel Proust, \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu", "The neat thing about Hopfield networks is that they form a nonlinear dynamical system which always converges to stable attractor states, so a state where their dynamics do not change anymore in time.", "This means that, for example, after running for some time the network remains at 1100 forever, with units 1 and 2 firing and units 3 and 4 not firing.", "One cool thing about Hopfield networks is that you can teach them to converge to a desired final state based on some initial state (say the pattern 0101) you begin with. When learning a pattern, the Hopfield network nodes are incrementally updated via a set of learning rules. These learning rules can be quite simple: Hebbian learning (\u201cneurons that fire together wire together\u201d) can be used for training a Hopfield network.", "The attractor state that the network moves into during training is then associated with the input pattern the network was trained on. This means that you can effectively store information in the dynamics of the network (the number of different patterns that can be stored scales with the size of the network). Even better: after the training phase, we can \u201cshow\u201d the network an incomplete version of the pattern it learned (more details here), and it still manages to recover the same attractor state.", "If this does not already remind you of something (hehe), this works a bit like associative memory. Think of seeing a glimpse of a face in a crowd, of smelling, in passing, a familiar scent.", "Of a whole world of memory getting reactivated by a subtle cue as in Proust\u2019s famous madeleine image (which now also reminds you of the fact that you saw the picture of a madeleine 30 seconds ago).", "From a physics perspective, we can think of there being an energy landscape that describes all the possible states of the network.", "The energy landscape of the network is shaped by the learning procedure in such a way that the final state corresponds to a minimum of this landscape. Think of another simple dynamical system: a ball rolling around in an area of hills and valleys. After some time, the ball will come to rest at the bottom of a valley after all his velocity is used up. Based on where you start with the ball, it ends up in one local minimum. This valley (=attractor), based on the starting point, is what the network remembers.", "In more complex landscapes, several meta-stable minimums can coexist. In noisy systems such as the brain, where there is always some energy flowing in and out (such that the ball would wiggle around constantly), these are connected through transition probabilities (which is a bit like tunneling in a quantum well potential, where an object can suddenly seem to be \u201cjumping\u201d from one valley to another one), depending on shape of the energy landscape and the depth/shallowness of its valleys.", "All this talk about energy landscapes and attractors might seem overly abstract, but I think they provide a relatively intuitive example of how the brain might code using network dynamics. As we will see, they have been related to actual cognitive function: attractor states of neural networks like fixed points and line attractors are thought to play a role in working memory and are related to pattern completion in the hippocampus, and have also been used in modeling e.g. decision making. It should be noted that if you shape the attractor landscape in a smart way you can in principle also implement complex sequences of thoughts or actions.", "It is fascinating to me how at the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience very abstract concepts suddenly become graspable by applying them to questions about how our own minds work.", "Now let\u2019s get back to the topic in question and consider what neuro-functional and structural abnormalities could be underpinning mental illness from a dynamical systems perspective.", "The energy landscape of the network, and therefore the shallowness of its basins of attractions is modulated by the network parameters. The neuroscientific equivalent of network parameters are receptor densities, neurotransmitter levels, random channel state transitions, etc\u2026", "Altering them, therefore, alters attractor dynamics, and thus cognitive function. As an example, dopamine D1 levels are thought to increase the stability of attractors, while dopamine D2 is doing the opposite. Dopamine could, therefore, regulate between cognitive flexibility, supported by flat attractor basins that ease moving among states and, therefore, among cognitive representations, and working memory and goal orientation, which protects cognitive states by keeping them protected in deep basins.", "Letting our own network dynamics jump to even more ambitious lines of thought, we might, in the long run, figure out how to connect network properties to personality types and emergent phenomena like creative thinking. This can also be brought into the context of the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis, in which the depth of the basins in the energy landscape relate to the precision of predictions stemming from high-level beliefs about the world (and could even help explain why psychedelics show promise in treating mental illness).", "What happens, for example, to cognitive function if dopaminergic regulation turns awry?", "In schizophrenia, dopaminergic function is strongly altered in some parts of the brain. Very flat valleys, that could in moderation encourage creative thinking and cognitive flexibility, would in the pathological case cause aimless thought wanderings driven almost by pure noise, or even lead to hallucinations.", "Other examples have been investigated: this paper points to connections between obsessions and compulsions in OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorders) and overly deep attractors, which might be caused by abnormally high glutamate levels.", "Some mental illnesses are characterized by the seeming impossibility to \u201cget\u201d to a person, to change his or her mental state by external intervention and stimuli. We can again think of this from an attractor state perspective: if the brain\u2019s dynamical state is trapped at the bottom of the neural equivalent of Mariana\u2019s trench, then it takes a lot of effort to get it out from there again.", "The list of mental illnesses that can be usefully looked at from a network dynamics perspective is long and includes wide-spread problems such as ADHD, rumination during depression or PTSD, in all of which attractor dynamics are in some way pushed out of a healthy and well-functioning equilibrium.", "All of this is not only interesting, but has important implications for treatment: if we understand the alterations in dynamics that are the cause of an illness, this might open up whole new avenues of sometimes naively counterintuitive intervention based on altering parameters of the network, thus restoring relevant dynamics.", "As an example, alterations caused by in D2 receptor affinity might be amended by altering synaptic Natrium currents just as effectively as they would be by directly tackling the dopamine receptor, while these kinds of interventions could be a lot simpler and cheaper from a pharmacological perspective.", "It is a problem in mental health that many medications are taken with a kind of black-box approach (take the very popular Lithium as an example, which has been used for 50 years with no one really knowing why it works).", "Having an actual causal model of the problem is always a good idea, and so we can close the loop to recurrent neural network models of brain activity: while we need to be mindful of building overly simplistic models, learning neural network models from brain data (like fMRI, EEGs or spike trains) to extract its underlying dynamics is a promising step towards a deeper understanding of the dynamical roots of the problems, paving the way for more effective treatments.", "As a final remark, Neural Networks are not only useful for modeling what goes on in the brain itself, but they might come in handy in a different way: RNNs allow forward predictions of any kind of time-series data.", "If the time series in question refers to, say, the medical history of a patient or some neural data measured at different times, it can be used to predict the trajectory of an illness. This would be very important for finding early interventions, but also to predict the effectiveness of an intervention for a certain patient, etc. Considering the immense wealth of potentially useful data that can be gathered by smartphones, attempts are being made to integrate and analyze them with RNNs in order to make them useful for psychiatry.", "Deep Neural Networks have also been used for diagnosis (not only of mental illness but for other diseases, such as cancer diagnosis and many more). There is room for optimism that they will play an important and hopefully beneficial role for medicine in the future to come.", "As I mentioned in the beginning, I don\u2019t think mental illnesses are always best approached from a purely \u201creductionist\u201d perspective, and there undoubtedly are important psychological factors at play. But I am also convinced that a dynamical \u201chard-science\u201d perspective can be very helpful. I think our challenge is to find the right balance which in the long run gives us the best and most effective therapies, ultimately achieving what we all want: to reduce the immense suffering caused by mental illness and to turn our societies into happier and healthier places.", "Your home for data science.
