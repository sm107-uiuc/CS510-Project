The team\u2019s oldest candidate Jamus Lim, 44, and youngest, Raeesah Khan, 26 have in some ways stood as bookends to the larger campaign trajectory itself, with Jamus\u2019 earnest idealism in a televised debate at the start of the campaign earning wide plaudits, while allegations of racial and religious prejudice in Raeesah\u2019s social media posts towards the end of the campaign arguably backfiring and instead bringing to light larger issues of systematic discrimination, inequities in speech regulation and other power imbalances in Singapore politics, issues thought to have particular resonance with younger voters. But did, in fact, younger voters lead the charge in the national swing away from the ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) and prove decisive in the result for Sengkang, because of their supposed predominance in that constituency?", "It is a slightly tricky business to determine the demographic composition of electoral divisions in Singapore, because electoral boundaries change with every election and the data published by government agencies do not conform to these divisions. However, it is possible to perform a rough mapping. The Department of Statistics publishes demographic data yearly on Singapore\u2019s resident population broken down into so-called planning areas drawn by the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore (URA), the city\u2019s urban planner. Each planning area can be further broken down into subzones. Using geospatial software, when electoral boundaries are overlaid against the boundaries of these subzones (both of which are publicly available), one finds that electoral divisions by and large can be characterized as aggregates of subzones. In the example below, we can see that Sengkang GRC is in fact composed of the planning subzones of Anchorvale, Compassvale, Rivervale and Sengkang Town Centre.", "The mapping is by no means exact \u2014 one finds that subzone boundaries often bleed into other electoral divisions. However, these incongruences are seldom fatal. We can use a simple rule of thumb \u2014 if at least a majority of the subzone can be circumscribed within the electoral division, and the circumscribed area of the subzone is populated by residential properties (as determined by a URA master plan overlay), the subzone is included. Hence, the subzone of Compassvale is included within Sengkang GRC, even though parts of it extend into the neighbouring electoral division of Ang Mo Kio, as these parts do not contain residential properties.", "(In the interests of transparency and reproducibility, I have published my mappings and you can reach out to me in the comments if any of these are in dispute.)", "Because the Department of Statistics publishes population data according to subzones, once the mapping (a rather tedious manual process) is done, it becomes quite trivial to determine the demographic composition of each electoral division through a process of aggregation (so far as the desired demographic characteristics are available). In this way, we can compute the proportion of residents in a constituency belonging to each major age category. I have used the following simple three-way convention:", "Based on the statistics published for 2018, what we find is that as a proportion of the total resident population in that constituency, there is no excess of younger voters in Sengkang GRC compared to other electoral divisions contested by the WP, and even nationally:", "Sengkang GRC has 21.1% of its residents aged 20 to 35 years, which is similar to other constituencies contested by WP and not vastly different from the national share of 20.7%. One might argue that my definition of younger voters is restrictive and that we should also include the 35\u201340 and even the 40\u201345 age brackets:", "We begin to see some separation here, with 39.7% of residents in Sengkang aged between 20 to 45 compared to 35.9% nationally. But do all these voters really qualify as \u2018young\u2019? Rather, the commonplace image of Sengkang as a youthful town is most apparent from the fact that it has a higher-than-average proportion of younger residents who are not yet of voting age:", "Just over a quarter (25.3%) of residents in Sengkang GRC are below 20 years of age, compared to 20.5% nationally. Also, Sengkang has fewer elderly residents proportionally:", "Sengkang GRC only has 8.7% of residents aged 65 years and older compared to the national share of 13.7%.", "It is clear that a surplus of younger voters does not exist in Sengkang GRC \u2014 what there is instead is a surplus of families with young children. Based on the data, it might be tempting to re-sketch the narrative of the Sengkang revolt being driven by this particular demographic, without the electoral cushion of a large and indebted elderly vote. One might even tell a semi-plausible story of how school-going youth, steeped in the ways of social media and invested in progressive causes, somehow influenced their parents to vote for the Worker\u2019s Party! But this is to escape the inconvenient data point of Punggol West SMC being the singularly best-performing PAP constituency contested by WP (61.0% PAP), with an even higher proportion of residents below 20 (30.3% vs. 20.5% nationally) and lower share of elderly residents (6.2% vs. 13.7% nationally). It cannot be the case that, having the same choice of WP as the contesting opposition party, the demographic of parents with young children and this demographic alone swung decisively against the ruling party in one constituency while rallying towards them in another.", "In fact, a simple generalised linear model of the PAP vote share in WP-contested constituencies shows that the effect of having of a higher share of younger residents below 20 is quite literally positive:", "Here, every 1-point increase above the national share in the constituency\u2019s share of residents below 20 leads to a 22% increase (estimated odds ratio 1.22) in the odds of PAP winning that constituency against the WP, taking it from a baseline odds of roughly 50\u201350 to 54\u201346. Interestingly, every 1-point increase above the national share in the constituency\u2019s share of residents 65 years and above also leads to a 22% increase in odds (estimated odds ratio 1.22) \u2014 conversely, this means that a below-average share of elderly residents decreases the odds. Hence, between Punggol West and Sengkang, a simple demographic model of the outcome suggests a tug-of-war between the constituencies\u2019 above-average share of younger residents and below-average share of elderly residents, with the much higher share of younger residents in Punggol West significantly countervailing its lower share of elderly residents to provide the PAP\u2019s healthy winning margin. The PAP vote shares predicted by the model are in fact very close to the actual results:", "Do I really believe, as suggested by the model, that families with young children moved towards the PAP in WP-contested constituencies in defiance of the conventional wisdom? Not at all. To begin with, the model was fitted with only 6 data points (the 6 WP-contested constituencies) and is vulnerable to overfitting. The point of the exercise was to demonstrate that identifying a particular demographic advantage to explain the WP\u2019s victory in Sengkang is challenging, because one would have to then account for opposing trends for that same, or even larger demographic surplus in neighbouring Punggol West. This conclusion has already been hinted at in public statements about a deeper analysis of the results by the ruling party.", "Rather, the more parsimonious explanation is strategic voting at a national level. All demographic groups, not only younger voters or voters with young families, swung away decisively from the ruling party in Sengkang, but only in Sengkang. Whatever issues proved salient in the election \u2014a desire for diversity of voices in Parliament, rejection of heavy-handed political tactics, even the personal popularity of Jamus Lim \u2014 the residents of Sengkang collectively took up the mantle of national responsibility and ensured that these views are represented, but similar voters decided otherwise in Punggol West and elsewhere.", "This bodes well for the Worker\u2019s Party and Singapore. Suggestions of an age-based political polarisation, where younger voters are irretrievably moving away from the ruling party while the elderly remain solid ballasts for the PAP, are perhaps premature. Instead, the same demographic would have voted differently depending on the constituency, even with the same opposition party contesting. The new Members of Parliament from the Worker\u2019s Party in Sengkang, instead of viewing themselves as the bearer of factional demographic interests, should view themselves instead as bearers of a collective national will \u2014 a will for an alternative but credible political representation, a check on the ruling party, and a rejection of authoritarian impulses in government. Voters in Singapore, not just in Sengkang but collectively, have made their voices heard.", "*While the legal age of voting eligibility in Singapore is 21, the definition of younger voters includes residents aged 20 to simplify calculations.", "Your home for data science.
