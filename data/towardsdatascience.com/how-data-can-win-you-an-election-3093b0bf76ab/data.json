Between these things, one might be able to form a coherent picture of what social media is doing, and how it\u2019s doing it.", "But understanding the tech isn\u2019t a complete picture. With just a technical eye, one can only rationalise what James Bridle \u2014 quoting the sci-if writer Iain Banks \u2014 calls, \u2018Infinite Fun Space\u2019 \u2014 the world in which computers live. We do not live in that world, and if our concerns about data and social media are \u2014 fundamentally \u2014 about how they impact is, we need to remember what the real-world is. Only understanding how social media affects change in the real-world can give us the full picture of how social media actually works.", "Infinite Fun Space is best understood as a correlative network, where thousands (if not millions) of data points are analysed for correlative patterns. The space comes from building a nexus of these correlates, with each correlation representing a new dimension of informational travel. This is where infinity comes in, and the human mind exits: massive correlative structures can be described as consisting of dozens or hundreds of dimensions which we can\u2019t even imagine. Computers of course, don\u2019t have this problem.", "The big data social media collects are only useful if we can ask the computer to go into infinite fun space and pull out a piece of data that we can use. That means we need to understand what that data is, and we need to know what data we\u2019re asking for. This is where behavioural insights come in.", "Behavioural economics and cognitive psychology \u2014 collectively configured as behavioural insights \u2014 have become extremely important areas of public policy in the past decade. Nudges \u2014 small changes in how decisions are framed which can have large and predictable effects on outcomes \u2014 have been used extensively by governments across the world. For example, by making 401k participation automatic rather than elective, nudges have been shown to increase saving.", "If, say, we want to influence a person to vote for a given candidate, a nudge is probably how we should do it. Some techniques are quite straight forward \u2014 using red to catch a person\u2019s eye and capitalising letters to convey the importance of the message. But this is just behaviourally informed advertising. Where\u2019s the personalisation? Where\u2019s the precision?", "When we say targeted advertising, what we\u2019re actually talking about is personalised nudging. By using large amounts of data, behavioural scientists can construct nudges that are highly effective on individuals. These are hypernudges \u2014 the combination of big data and behavioural insights \u2014 and this is how behavioural targeting works.", "So, you want to win an election? Maybe you want to get people to buy your product? Or, you want to grow your social media following? OK, let\u2019s do it.", "Firstly, do some research. Get a control group, along with their social media profiles, and identify some behavioural traits. Are they impatient? Are they risk averse? Are they easily influenced by authority figures or the opinions of others? These traits can all be identified using relatively simply psychometric testing. Behavioural scientists have spent years refining these tests, and they\u2019re endlessly adaptable (if, say, you wanted to identify who is likely to vote, these tests could do that).", "Secondly, test your planned adverts on this control group, and measure the effectiveness. If you\u2019re interested in getting them to back a political candidate, measure how likely they are to vote for them after seeing the ad. If you\u2019re interested in selling a product, measure how likely they are to buy the product. The goal isn\u2019t to find the most effective advertisement; it\u2019s to map effectiveness onto behavioural traits.", "Thirdly, analyse the control group\u2019s social media data. Try and find patterns between those behavioural traits the psychometric testing identified and individual behaviour on social media. Do impatient people have a lower click-through rate? Do highly impressionable people post more? Is the likelihood to vote related to age, or geography, or education?", "If we have a database of 10 million people, and we\u2019ve done the previous steps, we can now infer whether a person is likely to be impatient, for example, just by looking at their social media data. We can then target them with an ad that appeals to impatience. For example, an image might communicate information to them more effectively than an article. This is hypernudging.", "Finally, update. Measure click-through rates, measure site traffic, continuously update your database and expand it if possible. Each time the inferences will become more accurate, the nudges more effective, and the data more powerful. Soon you will be able to build a hierarchy of influence; a person may be both impatient and risk averse, but the latter may dominate the former, and through constant update, this dynamic can be found.", "Finally, update. Measure click-through rates, measure site traffic, continuously update your database and expand it if possible. Each time the inferences will become more accurate, the nudges more effective, and the data more powerful. Soon you will be able to build a hierarchy of influence; a person may be both impatient and risk averse, but the latter may dominate the former, and through constant update, this dynamic can be found.", "And congratulations, you now have a precision guided missile.", "What Cambridge Analytica did was just the start. There are more than enough behavioural and data scientists in the world to sustain a flourishing industry in hypernudging and targeted advertising. In fact, Cambridge Analytica appear to have been quite sloppy in their approach, not because they got caught, but because they didn\u2019t use control groups to identify behavioural traits \u2014 they just inferred them from the data using prior research. Furthermore, if you want to win an election, you don\u2019t need to convince someone to vote for you, just to not vote for your rival. As such, the possible uses of hypernudging are limitless.", "The language of war and weaponry is appropriate too. Hypernudging can be weaponised and is comparable to a precision guided missile. But an arms race is about to occur between hypernudgers, and thus the demand for data \u2014 and the creativity in acquiring data \u2014 will skyrocket. But this arms race, and the ensuing battle, will not be fought in the interests of we the people, but in the interests of political candidates and the firms they employ. We should all get ready for the next great hack.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Behavioural Science Fellow at the LSE.
