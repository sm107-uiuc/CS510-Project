It was a world of algorithms and mathematics that I desperately wanted to be a part of. It was cool, exciting, and fashionable, and appealed to my interest in mathematics and programming that I had developed in my undergraduate studies. I was lucky to be accepted into an urban spatial analytics graduate programme in the Fall of 2019, pushing me into the world of data science.", "Before that, I recall scrolling Medium, consuming as much as I could about machine learning. I had a confused idea of what machine learning was, partly because a quick google search of \u2018machine learning\u2019 brings up robots and brains in a futuristic blue light. (See it for yourself in this google image search.) I had conflated machine learning with robots taking over the planet (so naive and silly I know; someone invent time travel so I can give my past self a slap).", "Furthermore, Machine learning has become such a buzzword and is often used interchangeably with artificial intelligence (AI) although machine learning is merely a subset of AI, adding more confusion as to what machine learning is. Machine learning is much more nuanced than simply programming, and is not just about robots!", "After being exposed to different machine learning problems, I realised that machine learning is not a technique, it is a field. Framing machine learning in this way made it easier for me to begin studying it. It is not a one-off technique to learn, but rather, it is an extensive toolbox of algorithms that can be used in a vast number of settings.", "While machines beating professionals at board games or Facebook predicting the cutest cat photos to show on our feed are awesome and exciting applications of machine learning, machine learning can also be used for a ton of other applications. For example, machine learning can be used in medical diagnosis to identify if a tumour is benign or malignant. Machine learning can also be used in city planning, for example to predict the latent fire risk in a city. Machine learning can also be used in business via targeted marketing. That is, given some data about your consumers, you can identify future potential consumers to market to. Stanford\u2019s CS229 machine learning projects site provides an oasis of machine learning applications.", "Non-exhaustive list of applications of machine learning:", "Given the variety of applications, a whole host of different algorithms are available under machine learning to solve different problems.", "Here, I use algorithms to refer to the broad process of solving machine learning problems.", "Keywords:- Dataset: A set/table of different instances of data with values for a given set of features.- Instance: An instance is one data point.- Features: Each instance of a data point has a value for each feature. - Labels/Results: The item you want to predict for. This may or may not be part of the dataset.- Training/fitting: Finding \u2018solution\u2019 for a model that reduces the prediction error/loss.", "The first step is to identify the type of problem you need to solve. Two main problems are classification (predicting categories) or regression (predicting numerical values). For example, medical diagnosis of a tumour is a classification problem, where the result is either benign or malignant. Whereas house price prediction would be a regression problem, where the result is any real number. Hence different statistical methods are used to solve either classification or regression problems.", "Next, there are different types of learning as well. Other than deciding if the problem is a classification or regression one, you also need to decide what kind of learning is required given the information you have. Here are three main learning problems.", "After identifying the type of problem you are trying to solve (regression/classification) and the type of learning problem it would be (supervised/unsupervised/reinforcement), the final step is to decide on the statistical method to use. These are different mathematical models that help us make the predictions on our data.", "Without going into tooo much detail, here is a brief overview of the various machine learning methods.", "Remember those quizzes you used to do in magazines as a pre-teen where answered a few questions, followed some arrows, and it would tell you your ideal celebrity crush?? That is exactly what a decision tree is! Decision trees are used for classification and even regression (though is a little harder). At each node is a specific feature of the data; in the medical diagnosis example, the location of pain. At the leaf nodes (a final node), a classification is given to the data instance that ends up at the point. Training the machine learning model then consist of deciding what features to split the data on at each node. The goal would be to create an optimal decision tree (shortest) that is able to correctly classify the training data. The resultant tree will then be used to predict on a new instance (i.e. a new patient who has entered the hospital).", "Linear regression is used for regression problems (predicting numerical values), such as predicting house prices. The model works by fitting a linear combination of the data to predict the results.", "house price (the label) = constant + b1*age of house + b2*size of house + b3*number of rooms", "The constant and coefficients in the equation above would be identified during the training stage. The fitted equation would then be used to predict the house price on new data.", "Logistic regression is a method of using a linear equation to predict the probability that a certain instance of the data is of a certain class. Then, a threshold on the probability can be set such that if the predicted probability is less than the threshold, that instance if of a class A, and a class B otherwise.", "A random forest is the most famous example of an ensemble method. The idea is to take an aggregate of the predictions from many different decision trees.", "5. Neural networks and deep learning (supervised or unsupervised, classification)", "Neural networks are commonly used in image classification. This one is still pretty insane to me and is one of the more \u2018black box\u2019 machine learning methods. Neural networks loosely mimic the human brain. The idea is to stack different layers in the network to pass the data through and outputting a prediction after the layers. During the training process, the weights between different layers are fitted. Using these weights, the neural network is used to predict on new data.", "p.s. Deep learning is machine learning but machine learning is not deep learning.", "Recall that unsupervised learning meant that the original data did not have any assigned labels beforehand. In the animation below, each point represents an instance of data, and they are plotted based on the value of the features represented by the axes. The goal is to partition the data into k partitions where the data is classified into the cluster whose center it is closest to. The partitioning continues until the distance between points and the mean position (i.e. variance of distances) within all clusters is minimised.", "Used for solving reinforcement learning problems, the Q-learning algorithm updates the expected reward for taking a different action at each state in the environment during training. When using this model in the future, the action with the highest expected future reward will be selected at each state of the environment.", "I have mentioned a few algorithms above and this is again not the complete list. Moreover, each algorithm has further methods and parameters for fine tuning. Furthermore, there are many ways to make the above mentioned algorithms to reach a solution faster, and these methods are deployed when training the model. Hence there are an infinite number of machine learning algorithms! As a simple example, you could build a decision tree with various depths (layers of nodes), or a random forest with various number of trees, or you can use different iterations in k-means clustering. In practice, many different models with different parameters are used to solve the machine learning problem. Evaluation methods (another extensive field in machine learning) are used to identify the best model in the context of the problem.", "This article has been a very brief overview into different problems that machine learning can solve and the different types of machine learning methods! If there\u2019s one thing to take away from this article is that machine learning is an extremely diverse and deep field of study and that one size does not fit all. And machine learning is NOT about robots taking over the world (mostly). There is still much about machine learning techniques beyond this article, and I wish you the best of luck on your ML journey!", "Your home for data science.
