We are not health professionals or epidemiologists, and the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice. To learn more about the coronavirus pandemic, you can click here.", "Since the advent of civilization, the world has experienced the outbreak of many epidemics, often exacerbated by unhealthy living conditions allowing widespread transmission through vectors, air, water, bodily fluids, faecal matter or unsanitary animal husbandry. While the sophistication of healthcare has served as a mitigating factor for the amplification of such epidemics, the inter-connectedness of the world has aggravated the possibility of them becoming pandemic and thus, greatly magnifying its risk. Each disease outbreak would require a differentiated response for preparedness depending on mode of transmission, part of body affected and vulnerable population.", "Since the last 150 years, there have been umpteen pandemics and outbreaks of specifically respiratory viral diseases (1889, 1918, 1957(H2N2), 1968(H3N2), 2002 (SARS), 2009(H1N1), 2012 (MESR) etc. In this study, we shall try to look into the susceptibility of countries to respiratory viral pandemic through consideration of factors that aggravate community transmission (spreading rate of the disease). (The article will walk you through the creation of a composite index to measure susceptibility of countries to a respiratory viral pandemic i.e how vulnerable the country is to a rapid spread of such a disease within its populace). The idea is 1) to be able to compare the susceptibility so analysed against the performance of countries currently dealing with Covid-19 (when we know that a few countries are more vulnerable than others, it is prudent to assess their performance against their risk; there are countries that have been able to keep the virus under check, may be they had low risk exposure to start with); 2) to provide a reference for further inclusion of parameters that can more accurately capture the vulnerability and include more types of epidemic wherein the mode of transmission and impact on health vary and 3) to be able to work on factors that are adding to increased risk wherever possible.", "It is to be noted that the exercise of developing a pandemic preparedness index has been attempted earlier. Most of such indices\u00b9 are general in nature (with respect to epidemic preparedness) and are centered on the efficacy of health administration with the inclusion of bureaucratic effectiveness and availability of adequate financing. In this study, we shall also consider the weather characteristics, connectivity and population features that make some countries more vulnerable than others. A sliding index for a month or group of months is proposed to account for the variability throughout the year.", "Accurate data modelling entails a sound theoretical framework. The composite index being created must be comprehensive enough to include diverse factors of interest while excluding those that will lead to inaccuracy or data redundancy. Since we are measuring susceptibility of a country to viral respiratory pandemic, the factors that are majorly responsible for the spread of the disease has been considered.", "For the purpose of this study, the proposed susceptibility index considers 5 categories, each with its set of indicators\u00b2. The five categories are:", "a) Population characteristics: Density of population is seen as contributing to the spread of viral epidemics. Also, significant is the household size that can aggravate things due to shared spaces. It is also pertinent to capture the intensity of the population density in the country \u2014 what fraction of population lives in highly dense areas and is, thus, more vulnerable to community transmission. Considering the above, the indicators in this category are:", "-Urban population (% of total population)", "(The data has been taken from World Bank database and United Nations Population Division- Department of Economic and Social Affairs)", "b) Connectivity: A country that is globally connected with different regions is at higher risk of virus entering its borders through foreign sources.Also, developed transportation system within the country increase the spreading rate. These are accounted for with the help of the following indicators.", "- number of arrivals (International tourism) per resident (total population in that country)", "- Quality of trade and transport-related infrastructure (Logistics performance index)", "(The source for the data is World Bank. It is to be noted that ideally connectivity should have been captured by analyzing the air traffic data. Since this data is not easily available, a simpler metric has been resorted to.)", "c) Weather Characteristics: Research\u00b3 on influenza and respiratory diseases have found correlations with temperature, humidity and diurnal range of temperature. Since data on humidity was difficult to access, precipitation has been used as a close substitute (proxy) here, given the high correlation.", "The indicators for this category are:", "- Average diurnal range of temperature (March- May)", "For the purpose of collecting weather data, a scraper was designed to obtain temperature and precipitation data for the largest cities in the countries under study. (Country wise weather data dis-aggregated by months is difficult to obtain. The largest city which is highly vulnerable to an epidemic works as a good proxy.)", "The data has been taken from https://en.climate-data.org/ for the largest city in every country. The scraper implemented in python is as follows:", "d) Healthcare: A country with robust healthcare system is likely to be better prepared for handling a pandemic scare. (When the healthcare capacity is weak, spreading rate of the disease increases.) This robustness is captured through the following indicators:", "- Domestic general government health expenditure per capita, PPP (current international $)", "The data has been taken from World Bank and WHO\u2074.", "e) Efficacy of governance: The quality of governance and its facilitators would inversely impact the risk associated with the spread of any disease. Two indicators have been used that aid the effectiveness of government communication when the disease is spreading. Under this category, the following indicators have been used.", "Data can be missing in a random or non-random manner. In both cases, missing data can be problematic owing to loss of information and reduced variability. In case of data missing in a non-random manner, bias can creep in skewing the results.", "Missing data is dealt with by either deleting the cases altogether or by single/multiple imputation wherein an algorithm is followed to estimate the closest value to the missing data while preserving the reliability of the complete dataset. (There are mathematical packages for imputing missing data (such as MICE etc.))", "Here, for the purpose of imputing missing data, the data for the closest year (within a ten year period) when this value was available for the country was taken. e.g", "This is the world bank data for number of arrivals. As can been seen, in case of Cameroon, since the data was not available for the year 2018, data from the year 2017 was retained.", "The above is done using as array formula in excel. (It retains the first non-blank cell while going from left to right.)", "When no data was found through such exercise, the country was dropped from the study (also known as complete case analysis). The dataset after this exercise had 130 countries. A quick profiling was done to understand whether the 130 countries had enough diversity to make a composite index feasible. The countries were segregated by income type and geography for this purpose. An overview suggested that the dataset is diverse enough.", "For developing a composite index, multi variate analysis becomes essential to investigate the interrelationships between the indicators. Since this index is being developed as a scale, correlations between indicators become pertinent as high correlations will result in more weightage to similar factors skewing the final score.", "Since indicators have different measurement unit and scale, normalization is done to ensure that indicators have the same range [0,1]. (Caution is to be exercised if there are outliers that can distort the transformed indicators.) Here, the indicators were normalized keeping in view their relationship with the risk being investigated. For indicators that were inversely related (like average temperature, health expenditure etc. ), Varnormalized=(Var\u2098\u2090\u2093\u2212Var\u1d62)/(Var\u2098\u2090\u2093\u2212Var\u2098\u1d62\u2099) was used. This was done so that when indicator values are aggregated with positive weights, the risk from each category is appropriately accounted for.", "The correlation analysis was done in R.", "A correlation check was done to ensure that the indicators were not strongly correlated (threshold was 0.9 here in which case the indicator would be reconsidered or dropped from study). No such strong correlation was found.", "Principal Component Analysis was also done to assess how different indicators are associated. This was implemented in R.", "The proportion of variance is equal across the component suggesting a fairly independent set of indicators.", "A number of weighting techniques exist (such as factor analysis, conjoint analysis, analytic hierarchy processes etc.). Often, the weights are determined after doing a survey with subject matter experts (participatory methods). End of the day, these are value judgements.", "It is a common practice to resort to equal weighting scheme. This is what has been done here with the exception of the category on efficacy of governance (the reason being that government effectiveness was the primary indicator while mobile phones and sanitation levels are aids that augment the government capacity).", "The weighting scheme is as under:", "(Ideally, after these steps, a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is done to assess the model error. This is being reserved for another article :-) )", "The scores were obtained and normalized. The country susceptibility to respiratory viral pandemic has been plotted on world map.", "Through the website https://www.endcoronavirus.org/countries , the performance of countries till May 31st, 2020 was obtained and plotted on world map.", "The code in R for creating map is:", "It can be observed that the susceptibility profile and performance in the wake of pandemic after three months do not perfectly correlate(in the sense that countries that were seemingly low risk have been found struggling to contain the virus). Possible reasons could be:", "The study was aimed at exploring the possibility of quantifying the susceptibility of countries to a particular type of viral pandemic and evaluating a country\u2019s response in relation to its risk exposure. It is also proposed that risk profile for each country with respect to varying type of disasters be unbundled (to more granular level) to identify the priorities and the scale of effort required in reducing the risk of each disaster.", "1: Oppenheim and others Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation (2017); 2019 Global Health Security Index", "2: The categories and indicators have not been discussed with subject matter experts.", "3: China Yueling Ma et al Effects of temperature variation and humidity on the death of COVID-19 in Wuhan (2020)", "5: capturing perceptions of the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government\u2019s commitment to such policies.", "Your home for data science.
