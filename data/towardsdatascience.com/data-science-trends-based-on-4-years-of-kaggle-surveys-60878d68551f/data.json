The survey questions range from demographic questions, such as gender and level of higher education, to questions about programming languages, tools, and machine learning algorithms used. A full description, as well as the results, of each year\u2019s survey can be found on Kaggle\u2019s website for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020.", "Since it is the end of the year, and there are now four years of survey results, I thought it would be interesting to look at trends in the field over the past few years. New algorithms and techniques continue to be developed, so it will be interesting to see if newer techniques are replacing older ones, or simply being used alongside existing ones.", "The number of respondents has been consistently high, with between ~17,000 to 24,000 participants each year. Of those, approximately 2,400 to 4,100 survey respondents each year identify their job title as \u2018data scientist\u2019. On the left is a plot of the number of respondents, broken down by their reported job title.", "There are many respondents who have job titles other than data scientist. For the purposes of this article, I combined \u201cbusiness analysts\u201d and \u201cdata analysts\u201d into one category. For some reason, \u201cmachine learning (ML) engineer\u201d only appeared as an option in the 2017 and 2020 surveys, so this category is missing in the 2018 and 2019 results.", "Before diving into the results, there were many questions that were only asked on one or two of the surveys, so I do not include that information here. The questions that were consistent across at least three of the four years of surveys were the demographic questions (such as age, job title, etc.) and questions about programming languages and machine learning algorithms actively used at work.", "Furthermore, the focus here is to look at trends in the practice of data science in industry, and, in fact, a lot of the questions in the Kaggle surveys are geared towards working professionals. Therefore, I focus on respondents who are employed in the field.", "In terms of people who are employed as data scientists, or in a job that involves work related to data science, the overwhelming majority are male. Over the past few years, there has been a slight improvement in the percent who are non-male, but except for data and business analysts, the percent of males in the field has remained solidly above 80%.", "The median total yearly compensation (i.e., salary plus bonus) has increased slightly for most job titles,\u00b9 except for those with the job title \u201csoftware engineer\u201d, for whom salaries remained flat.\u00b2", "The final demographic trend I look at here is the formal education that data scientists have received. Interestingly, the fraction of data scientists with neither a PhD nor a Master\u2019s degree has increased slightly, from 27% to 32%. There has been a proliferation of online courses in data science and machine learning, as well as bootcamps. Perhaps, the trend shown in these surveys is reflecting an increase in people coming into the field with this non-formal education. Moreover, this steady decrease in the fraction of workers with graduate-level degrees was true across the board for respondents with job titles other than \u2018data scientist\u2019.", "A common question for those entering the field of data science is which programming language they should learn. Looking at the programming languages used by data scientists, software engineers, and machine learning engineers, over 78% reported using Python at work across the four years of the survey. For data and business analysts, the fraction using Python has increased dramatically, from 61% to 87%.", "There is still a solid camp of data scientists who use R, however, the fraction of data scientists who are using R in the field is dropping rapidly. For both data scientists and data analysts, the percent of workers using R has dropped over 33 percentage points (from 64% to 23% for data scientists).", "In parallel to this question of what programming languages data science practitioners are actively using, Kaggle also asked respondents which one language they would most recommend to an aspiring data scientist to learn. Across the board, the percent recommending Python has increased, with R being the language seeing the largest corresponding decrease.", "Another interesting trend is the drop in the fraction of data scientists and data analysts using SQL, approximately 30 percentage points. Despite this, however, the fraction of data scientists recommending that aspiring data scientists learn SQL first has actually increased slightly (from 3% to 7%).", "For Machine Learning Engineers, the usage of different programming languages has remained flat, or even slightly decreased. This can either be due to Machine Learning Engineers becoming more focused on a single language and using less of a variety of languages, or there are other languages they are using more than some of the ones included here from the survey. Although, in terms of language Machine Learning Engineers recommend learning, the percent recommending Python increased slightly.", "For people with job titles other than the ones shown in the plots here, there are similar trends, in that Python usage has increased, while R usage has decreased.", "Finally, the heart of data science is the techniques used for analyzing data and making predictions. In some years of the surveys, there were questions about general techniques and how much time is spent on different parts of the data science workflow. However, one question that appeared in three out of the four surveys was specifically about the machine learning algorithms used (for some reason, this question did not appear in the 2018 survey).", "Perhaps reassuring to aspiring data scientists, the more \u201cbasic\u201d methods of linear and logistic regression are still very popular among practitioners, with over 80% of data scientists saying that they use these methods at work.", "In general, the second most popular category of machine learning algorithms is decision trees and random forests. The popularity of these methods has remained steady, despite the increasing popularity of gradient boosting machines (such as, XGBoost).", "Another algorithm that has seen a significant increase in usage across the board is convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used with image data. For each category of job title, usage of CNNs increased by 20 percentage points. For machine learning engineers, this method continues to be almost as popular as linear and logistic regression.", "While not quite as dramatically as the usage of CNNs, the usage of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are used for time series and sequence data (such as, sequences of words), has also increased.", "Interestingly, the usage of standard dense neural networks has actually decreased over the last four years. Perhaps, this is due to the increasing usage of more specialized neural networks, like CNNs and RNNs.", "One category of machine learning algorithms that is missing here from this survey is unsupervised learning methods, such as clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques. It would be interesting to see trends in the usage of these techniques as well.", "After going through four years of Kaggle survey data, here are some significant trends in data science that may be worth further study:", "Hopefully, Kaggle will continue to perform this survey for years to come, so that we can continue to examine these trends, and pick up on some new trends, as the field of data science continues to evolve.", "[1] One note here is that I did not adjust for inflation, so any increase in salary may be less significant than it appears because of the effects of inflation.", "[2] I am only including salaries from respondents based in the U.S. because the 2017 survey asked for respondents to give their salaries in their native currency, whereas later surveys asked for respondents to give a reply in a USD range. Therefore, there are likely trends in the currency conversion over the four years covered here that could effect any trends seen in the data.", "Your home for data science.
