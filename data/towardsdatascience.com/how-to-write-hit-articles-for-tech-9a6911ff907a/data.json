That wasn\u2019t my goal when I started. But I can\u2019t complain.", "There\u2019s no one recipe for success. If there were, then everybody would be chilling on their yachts and sipping Pi\u00f1a Colada in the sunset.", "But there are a few things that I got right from the beginning. It wasn\u2019t about crafting the perfect headline or getting the SEO right. What made the difference was more my general mindset behind it all. After six months of tremendous growth on Medium, this is what worked for me.", "I started writing on Medium because I didn\u2019t want to work on Sundays but I needed something meaningful to do. But instead of just writing about anything, I thought about who I am and what I want to stand for.", "I\u2019m doing my PhD in physics, so writing about science and research seemed like an obvious choice. I\u2019m also queer, so I thought that I could share my experiences in science as a marginalized person. But I find it really hard to write about my personal life, so I didn\u2019t write that much about LGBTQIA-issues after all.", "When you look at my writing now, you\u2019ll notice that I don\u2019t even write a lot about science \u2014 it\u2019s more about data science and programming languages. I didn\u2019t adhere to my plan like a slave. It was more like a starting point for my journey on Medium.", "This is what a plan does. However good your plan is, it probably won\u2019t survive your first month of writing. But it gets you thinking about what matters to you, and what you\u2019d like to write about. It gives you an initial direction that can and should evolve over time.", "Your first article won\u2019t be a masterpiece. Neither will your second. Even your tenth won\u2019t go viral.", "If your dream was to write one viral hit and become a millionaire overnight, think again. The most successful writers on Medium have been churning out pieces for years already. Some daily, some every other day, others every week. But you can bet your a** that they\u2019ll be publishing this week, and next week, and the week after that.", "My initial goal was to publish one story each week. I started in December, and I kept the once-a-week schedule going through the Christmas buzz and all the other distractions that life has to offer.", "You got to show up. Each time.", "It\u2019s okay to take a break from time to time \u2014 I took a couple of breaks myself because life in the Coronavirus crisis is challenging. Don\u2019t beat yourself up for taking a break if you need it. But keep in mind that writing should keep a top spot on your priorities list if you want success.", "About a month after I started out writing, I realized that most readers liked the stuff about artificial intelligence. So I wrote more about that.", "I then realized that the people who were reading my stuff were programmers and data scientists, so I started writing about that. That\u2019s when I produced my first few hits:", "Your niche may be different, and your audience may be different. I thought that I\u2019d write for people from all walks of life who happen to be interested in science. But I was writing for programmers.", "Look into your stats and see which stories take off. That gives you a lot of clues about who to write for if you want a lot of readers.", "That being said, only write about stuff that you\u2019re really passionate about. If your aim is to please everyone with stuff that you don\u2019t give a sh*t about, people will see through that.", "Express your opinion, even if it\u2019s edgy. Take risks. Always stay true to yourself. Funnily enough, that makes you more successful in the long run.", "It\u2019s fine to have a look at how many views you\u2019ve been getting or how many claps a story got. You can learn a lot about your audience from that.", "But don\u2019t obsess over your stats. Choose a couple of key performance indicators, and leave the rest for additional insights when you have the time.", "My KPIs are the Partner Program earnings and the number of followers. The people who follow you are recurring readers, and therefore much more important for future success than the views you\u2019ve gotten so far. And the earnings \u2014 well, I guess I enjoy making money.", "I keep a nice little spreadsheet where I note the number of followers every week. And I note down the earnings of the current month every day. Not only does that give me some nice insights into what is bringing money \u2014 it\u2019s also a nice feeling to wake up in the morning and realize that you\u2019ve just made a couple hundred dollars overnight.", "One month into my writing endeavor, I started getting contacted by publications on Medium. Adding your work to a publication costs nothing, and gets your work under a lot of new eyes. So I said yes.", "Another month later, other platforms started contacting me, asking me whether they could translate my articles in other languages and feature them on their sites. It costs me nothing, and I get some free exposure. So I said yes.", "Four months into my career as a writer, I started getting contacted by other platforms that wanted exclusive content from me. I didn\u2019t always say yes this time \u2014 if I produce an article that could earn thousands of dollars on Medium, then I either want a similar amount of money or some exposure to amazing people.", "As a rule of thumb, I would say yes to whatever comes your way. You never know what that can bring you. And if you don\u2019t like it because the people suck or because it\u2019s not lucrative enough, you can still abandon it later.", "My success wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the support of other writers, platform editors, and other people in and outside of Medium.", "This includes Ludovic Benistant, who first discovered my writing and invited me to write for Towards Data Science. This includes Anne Bonner, who has been an amazing editor on TDS. This includes Jingles (Hong Jing), who has been lovely as an editor and writer alike. And many more people.", "I make sure I regularly check out their work, and recommend it further. I give them claps and follows because they deserve it, and exchange ideas on Medium and other social media.", "No matter where you are in your career, it\u2019s never too early to give back. Let people know that they\u2019re important to you. Try to help them pursue their goals, just like they helped you. Your network is your net worth.", "Once you gain some traction, chances are that you\u2019ll get a bunch of negative comments going your way. It does depend on what you write about and whether you are provocative (oops, I\u2019m guilty of that).", "Look at the comment section of my two most popular articles:", "They\u2019re full of haters! I could hide them, but I prefer to let people make up their minds themselves.", "And reading those comments hurts. No matter how hardened up you are, that sh*t won\u2019t put you in a great mood.", "I wouldn\u2019t suggest that you stay away from the comment section altogether. Your readers are the reason you exist as a writer, so you ought to take them more than seriously. They do provide constructive criticism, new ideas, and all kinds of awesome stuff.", "But there are also people who like to write hateful stuff beneath everything they read. I like to think that my story must have mattered to them anyway because they devoted five minutes to write a comment.", "Feel your feelings, but then move on. Don\u2019t let those folks discourage you.", "When writing time comes around, I often have plenty of ideas what to write about. I\u2019ve gathered them from my life, my current projects, conversations with people around me, and so on.", "But there are other times when I have no idea what to write about. All the material that I\u2019ve gathered doesn\u2019t seem inspiring or timely enough, and I\u2019m sitting in front of a blank screen and don\u2019t know what to do.", "Funnily enough, I\u2019ve published my most popular stories after moments \u2014 or hours \u2014 like that. I usually take 30 minutes or so to try to come up with something on my own.", "But if I don\u2019t find anything, I comb through the comments on my stories, and check through Twitter and StackOverflow. There\u2019s plenty of stuff there.", "After that, I google my headline to see if it fills a gap or not. If it\u2019s a niche that nobody has written about yet, great! But if there are plenty of articles about that topic, that\u2019s fine, too.", "You don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel every time. Just make sure you pay your fellow writers the respect they deserve and link to their articles.", "If you want to rise to the stars, learn from the greatest. There\u2019s some truly awesome stuff on Medium, and you can learn a sh*tload from that.", "You can learn how to write articles that resonate, headlines that rock, develop a style that is your own. You can learn what is popular at the moment, and what readers want to hear. You can learn about your niche or something totally different.", "If you look at what I highlight and clap for, it\u2019s all kinds of stuff. Most of it is not even tech-oriented. Even though I read most of these stories out of personal interest, I always see lessons in them that improve my own writing.", "I write about tech, but I don\u2019t want to sound like a nerd. I want to sound like me. Reading across all kinds of topics is key for that.", "If you read great stuff, that\u2019s going to add value to your writing in one way or another. Either you learn something from the content. Or you learn something from the style.", "In terms of writing advice, never stop learning. You don\u2019t need to read advice-articles \u2014 just draw lessons from what you read and like.", "These are some key lessons I learnt while writing on Medium:", "The list will grow on for as long as I\u2019m a human with a brain because human brains like to learn. You can maximize your learning outcomes by being intentional about it.", "Most days I wake up and find out that I\u2019ve made another couple hundred dollars overnight. But that didn\u2019t come overnight, as paradox as it sounds.", "In December 2019, I earned 55 cents. In January 2020, I got 20 dollars. February was $120. Since March I\u2019ve been getting a four-digit check and half a million monthly page views.", "Of course, I worked hard for it, but I guess I was lucky too. I started at the right time, got on the right publications, and reached the right audiences. Medium was the perfect opportunity for me.", "Your success will depend on what you write, what style you have, and whether you\u2019re consistent with your sh*t. In the beginning, you\u2019ll be happy when your story gets 20 viewers. Many months later, you\u2019ll be wondering what\u2019s wrong when a story only gets 2k.", "Wherever you are in your journey, success will come because you get up every day and pour your heart and soul into the things you love. Chances are, other people will love those things, too. Here on Medium, and everywhere else in life. So get down and write.", "Lost in my thoughts, mostly about tech. https://arijoury.medium.com/membership"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
