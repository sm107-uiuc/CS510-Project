It is about \u201cCelebrating Customer Heterogeneity\u201d knowing that all customers are not created equal and thus aligning the development and delivery of a company\u2019s products and services with the current and future needs of its highest-value customers. To execute this properly, we need to answer the following questions:", "1) Which Customers Have the Highest Probability of Churning Soon? As already stated, a prediction model can be trained to identify customers that are most likely to leave.", "2) What is the Lifetime Value for Each of Our Customers? After determining which customers are at risk of leaving, we encounter the question of \u201cWhat incentives do we offer to get them to reconsider?\u201d (This offer is commonly known as a treatment). By understanding a customer\u2019s worth to our business\u2019s long-term success (i.e. Customer Lifetime Value), we can begin to approach them with the right treatment at the right price.", "3) What Retention Offer is Most Appropriate for each Customer? Based on the Customer\u2019s Lifetime Value, the business can develop a variety of treatments. After distributing them across all high-risk customers, a model can be created to understand which treatments were the most effective.", "I will explore these questions using data from an existing business as an example. We will follow the CRISP-DM methodology for this article and building upon the Modeling and Evaluation in the following article:", "Finally, this article was written as a \u201cfollow-along\u201d to my repo. Here, I will be covering the main ideas, results, and inferences which I came across over the course of this project. So, let\u2019s dive right in with Question #1:", "Which Customers Have The Highest Probability Of Churning Soon?", "KKBOX is Asia\u2019s leading music streaming service and holds the world\u2019s most comprehensive Asia-Pop music library with over 30 million tracks. They offer an unlimited version of their service to millions of people, supported by advertising and paid subscriptions. This delicate business model, however, is dependent on accurately predicting churn of their paid users, which is what I hope to deliver on.", "The data for this exercise is publicly available at Kaggle. It was part of a competition hosted by The 11th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2018). The data contains the music listening and transaction habits of ~2,300,000 members from January 2015 to March 2017.", "The datasets we will be using for this project are divided into two versions: v1 and v2. Here, we will only be using v1 files since they contain nearly 3 years worth of data, while v2 only contains a single month.", "Total: 31.92 GB w/ 22 raw data points across all files, including 4 date fields", "Below is the data architecture I used for efficient, data preparation and model building:", "Given such a large dataset, I decided to use Google BigQuery as a persistent storage solution. For modeling, I used Apache Spark (via Google Dataproc).", "Disclaimer: I realize Google BigQuery isn\u2019t intended to be used as a DBMS, and something like a Postgre and MySQL Server would be more appropriate for this use case, but\u2026 they offered to let me use it for free!", "Please refer to the Create Derived Tables and Features section in the KKBox Churn \u2014 Part 1 \u2014 ETL notebook", "We will start by building our monthly Derived Tables with all members who have a Membership Expiration Date within each of the respective months. We will also include all member-specific information from the tables, as well as some simply derived features. Lastly, we calculate is_churn with respect to KKBOX\u2019s definition. The result:", "We will be using January 2016 and February 2016 as the Training and Validation sets, respectively.", "For this project I ended up creating ~230 features, with each of them taking one of two forms; Aggregate and Retrospective Data.", "The Aggregate Features were general aggregations of member data that were primarily absolute summations and averages. Examples of these Aggregate Features:", "The Retrospective Features take three main forms:", "Comparison of Bi-Weekly Activity Blocks. These features were created to capture trend behavior leading up to a member\u2019s expiration date. Examples:", "Refer to the follow notebooks for this section:", "As this article is focused more on the Modeling aspect of the project, I strongly encourage you to visit the corresponding notebooks for this section. As you will see in the first notebook, I like to use a statistical approach to guide the EDA process, especially when dealing with this many features. In addition to this, users were also divided into cluster groups via K-Means for further insight into the existing customer segments and their respective behaviors.", "I would define these segments as follows:", "Small in numbers but Loyal, this segment of users was the most active across all metrics. As these users tend to have longer membership lengths than the others, their proportional churn was below 1%. This group also had the highest average revenue per user.", "In terms of activity, these users were a close second to our Power Users and contributed to roughly ~16% of the total observed revenue. Like our Cluster 0 users, they have a churn % sitting slightly above 1%.", "Coming in at third, in terms of activity, we have what we call \u2018The Active Majority\u2019. Making up nearly 43% of our observed population these users are the strongest contributors to revenue making up nearly half of total revenue. Although Cluster 2 users were more active, there was virtually no difference between them in terms of Churn % and Average Revenue Per User.", "With the largest amount of churn compared to all other groups, we observed how this segment of customers is significantly less active than the rest of the other groups. What was interesting however was that these users were most likely to have received discounts on their subscriptions and yet many of them ended up churning (34.5% of all users in Cluster 1 who currently underpaid their plan price, churned.) This makes me question whether or not many of these people are even worth spending resources on and reinforces why Customer Lifetime Value is so important when determining who is worth going after.", "As discussed in our Exploratory Data Analysis, we are dealing with a significant class imbalance in our Target Variable (Churn), with a disproportion of 97:3, Non-Churn vs Churn. To avoid any dominance by our Non-Churn data, we will start by modeling based on a 50:50 balanced set (by under-sampling the dominant class) and adjust this balance as necessary.", "Refer to the follow notebooks for this section:", "We ended up working with two classification estimators on Apache Spark: Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) and Random Forest Classifier (RFC). There were various models built for this project with many of the features being created as a result of these iterations. Here, I will cover the general evolution that led to our final GBT model (best performing). This section was conducted as follows:", "We will refer to churn values as follows: Churn = 0: Positive Class, Customer didn\u2019t Churn. Churn = 1: Negative Class, Customer did Churn", "It is worth noting that our model features currently consist of only the Aggregate Features and the Aggregate Data over Time Interval Features. Looking at these scores, we can see that our model is slightly overfitting. What is most concerning, however, is our low Precision score compared to Recall. Looking at our Validation Model\u2019s confusion matrix, we can see the effect of these scores.", "Here we see that the False Negatives from our models are WAY too high in comparison to our False Positives. Considering our current use case, KKBox might be losing more on treatment costs than on actual customer churn if they were using such a model. There is no substantial difference between GBT and RFC in terms of validation scores, however, RFC seemed to generalize better.", "The first item we need to address is the large quantity of False Negatives in both models. As our model is currently more sensitive towards making a Churn=1 prediction, I believe that by introducing more Non-Churn data to create slight imbalances we might be able to reduce that sensitivity.", "Here we created 7 total subsets, 1-to-1 through 13-to-1 (Non-Churn to Churn) on every odd interval, as we hope to improve the balance between False Positives and False Negatives. We also added more trend-focused features.", "We now have ~230 Features with the inclusion of our Bi-Weekly Activity Block and Comparison of Bi-Weekly Activity Block Features. Looking at the results above, we can see that we have made some improvements to AUC. We also can see that Recall increased significantly over the ratio subsets. This means that subsets seem to have addressed the issue of numerous False Negatives, but at the expense of creating more False Positives.", "Our models are still overfitting with the high ratio models (9\u2013to-1, 11-to1, etc) performing lowest. However, our Recall scores are better on the high ratio models, where there is also an improvement in model error and a slight decrease in Precision.", "Due to the lack of consistency in generalization, we will address model complexity by reducing the number of features based on importance. To do this, we will first derive the average of all feature importance scores across all models. We will then produce a 5 Number Summary of this group to produce the following feature groups: Features Above Mean, Features Above 75th Percentile, Features Above 50th Percentile, and Features Above 25th Percentile.", "To simplify our analysis, we only included models across each ratio subset that are generalized best (The best 1-to-1 Model, the best 3-to-1 Model, etc). We increased the overall generalization of our models based on the current results.", "I was hoping for better results in terms of generalization, False Positives, and False Negatives. There are many ways in which we can continue to build upon and improve these models, but we will conclude this phase of the project and continue with our current results.", "At the beginning of this project, we set out to answer the question: Which Customers Have The Highest Probability of Churning Soon? And although we created several models that could easily answer this question, we still do not have enough information to select the best model for our business.", "Since we currently do not know each customer\u2019s worth, we thus cannot properly determine what treatment would convince them to stay with us. The cost of this treatment is what ultimately decides which model to use, as these models give us a clear understanding of risk and reward depending on the strategy that we choose. Let me explain a bit further:", "Example #1: Too Many False Negatives", "By looking at the Predict, Churn=1 column, we can see the total number of people that our model classified as high risks to churn. Acting solely on this model, we would provide treatments to 93,367 members in the hopes of keeping 17,305 of them while risking 2,618. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean this model is bad. For all we know, the cost of treatment for these members could be negligible, meaning it would be affordable to pursue all 93,367 members. But what if the total treatment cost is not negligible? In that case, such a model might be too expensive as the total treatment cost could outweigh the total value of users who did not churn.", "Example #2: Too Many False Positives", "Now we have only a fraction of False Negatives compared to the previous model, but we also have ~4.5x the number of False Positives. Looking at the Predict, Churn=1 column, we see 15,559 members are flagged as high-risk. We risk losing 11,670 members for a potential reward of convincing 8,253 members to stay. As such, this model may be better suited for cases where the total treatment cost is high and our resources are limited.", "These two models are merely two extremes of our pursuit in finding the perfect balance of how to identify and approach unhappy customers. They also demonstrate the importance of properly understanding a customer\u2019s value to the long-term success of our business and the associated cost to retain them. Churn Prediction projects often will not produce a single, perfect model, but they will provide valuable information that can be used for more effective decision-making and practices.", "If you enjoyed this topic you might enjoy the following article I also wrote on the subject.
