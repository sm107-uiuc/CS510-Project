That\u2019s true. Python List is a very powerful and flexible container type in Python. Although it is a little bit confusing, we always use List in Python just like the equivalent concept \u201cArray\u201d in most other programming languages.", "Or, you might say that Python does have \u201cArray\u201d, but it is from the NumPy library. That\u2019s also true. When we are dealing with mathematical problems, typically multidimensional array or matrix, NumPy array is a must-have tool.", "However, neither above two will be introduced in this article today. I\u2019m going to introduce the \u201cArray\u201d in Python. Yes, neither the \u201cList\u201d nor NumPy \u201cArray\u201d, but Python built-in \u201cArray\u201d. Have you ever know there is such a thing?", "The Array is built-in Python, which only means that you don\u2019t need to download and install it because it comes with native Python for sure. However, just like the other built-in libraries such as \u201cdatetime\u201d, you still need to import it.", "Before we can use the array, it is important to understand that it is still quite different from typical array concepts that would be found in most of the other programming languages.", "The most special feature is that it has to be defined with a Type Code. We can list all the available type codes as follows.", "Each character is corresponding to a specific data type that the array will contain. The Type Codes and corresponding types can be found in the official documentation as follows.", "The type code of an array has to be defined upon the array is instantiated. This also means", "Python array can only contain elements with a certain type.", "This is quite different from a List, right? For a Python List, we can flexibly put whatever objects in a single list without worrying about their types.", "Now, let\u2019s define an array. I would like to import the library again as follows because I don\u2019t want to have array.array() in my code, just like datetime.datetime.now() is kind of ugly.", "We can define an array of chars as follows.", "Refer to the table above-shown, the type code \u201cu\u201d means that this array contains Unicode characters. So, these letters will be treated separated and we have 7 elements in this array now.", "OK. This built-in array seems to be quite unique. So, it also has some quite unique features as follows.", "Since the type code is very important to an array, which determined what kind of elements that the array can have. We can get the type code by accessing its property typecode.", "As above-mentioned, unlike Python List, the Array is much more rigid. That is, the items that an array contains must be of the same type. Therefore, the size of the item will also be the same. We can check the size of each item.", "Don\u2019t be confused that this is not the length of the array, but the size of a single item in the array.", "Like Python List, the Array also has the count() function that will count the number of occurrences of a certain item in the array. Maybe you don\u2019t even know that Python List has this? Try it out :)", "If we want to add new items into an array, we can either use the append() or the extend() function. The former will add a single element, while the latter can add multiple items at one time.", "As an array, we must be able to do something with it using the index. Yes, we can get the index of a certain item. Please be noticed that we will only have the index of the first occurrence if the item repeated in this array.", "Also, we can insert an item at a certain index.", "If we want to delete an item at a certain index, we can use the pop() function.", "After poping the item out of the array, the original array will be updated in place.", "We can also reverse the array as follows.", "Of course, we don\u2019t have to be limited within the scope of Array because it is quite restricted. If we want to convert it to a normal Python List, it is very easy to do so.", "I guess this is the most important problem. If the Python Array is much more restricted than Python List, why we need to have it? In other words, when we should use it?", "The short answer is: you may never use it because Lists and NumPy Arrays usually are much better alternatives. That\u2019s also the reason why rarely people knows Python has a built-in Array type.", "However, when something is restricted, it must bring some benefits. That is the so-call \u201ctrade-off\u201d. In this case, Python Array will have a smaller size than Python List.", "Let\u2019s make up an example. A Python List with 100,000 integers is created. Then, it is converted to Python Array.", "Let\u2019s have a look at the size of them.", "It can be seen that the size of the array is only about half of the size of the list, even smaller than half. This is because the type code of the array is fixed and the number of bytes of each item is also fixed. It loses some flexibility but has less overhead.", "Python Array uses less memory size than Python List.", "In this article, I have introduced Python Array which is built-in to Python. It is not the Python List that we are quite familiar with. It is also not the NumPy array that is very powerful in terms of mathematical calculations and modelling. It is built-in to Python that is quite restricted in that it can only contain elements of the same type.", "If you feel my articles are helpful, please consider joining Medium Membership to support me and thousands of other writers!
