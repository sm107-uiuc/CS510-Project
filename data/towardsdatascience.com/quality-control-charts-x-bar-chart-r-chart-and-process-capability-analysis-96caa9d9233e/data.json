They help visualize variation, find and correct problems when they occur, predict expected ranges of outcomes and analyze patterns of process variation from special or common causes. Quality control charts are often used in Lean Six Sigma projects and DMAIC projects under the control phase and are considered as one of the seven basic quality tools for process improvement.", "However, how can we determine the right quality control chart to use for monitoring a process? The following decision tree can be used to identify which is the correct quality control chart to use based on the given data:", "For the following example, we will be focusing on quality control charts for continuous data for when the sample size is greater than 1 and less than 11.", "The x-bar and R-chart are quality control charts used to monitor the mean and variation of a process based on samples taken in a given time. The control limits on both chats are used to monitor the mean and variation of the process going forward. If a point is out of the control limits, it indicates that the mean or variation of the process is out-of-control; assignable causes may be suspected at this point. On the x-bar chart, the y-axis shows the grand mean and the control limits while the x-axis shows the sample group. Let\u2019s take a look at the R code using the qcc package to generate a x-bar chart.", "The x-bar chart generated by R provides significant information for its interpretation, including the samples (Number of groups), control limits, the overall mean (Center) the standard deviation (StdDev), and most importantly, the points beyond the control limits and the violating runs. Engineers must take a special look at these points in order to identify and assign causes attributed to changes in the system that led the process to be out-of-control.", "In order to use the R-chart along with the x-bar chart, the sample size n must be greater than 1 and less than 11. For bigger samples, the s-chart must be used instead to monitor the standard deviation of the sample rather than its range. On the R-chart, the y-axis shows the range grand mean and the control limits, while the x-axis shows the sample group. Once you have created a x-bar chart, you will only need to add the following lines of code to generate the R-chart.", "The R-chart generated by R also provides significant information for its interpretation, just as the x-bar chart generated above. In the same way, engineers must take a special look to points beyond the control limits and to violating runs in order to identify and assign causes attributed to changes on the system that led the process to be out-of-control.", "The process capability is a statistical measure of the inherent process variability of a given characteristic. In other words, the ability of a process to meet the given specifications (e.g. customer requirements, engineering tolerances or other specifications).", "Once you have generated the x-bar and R-charts using R, you will only have to add the following lines of code specifying the lower control limit, upper control limit and the target. Once you have done so, add the last line of code below to generate the process capability summary chart.", "The process capability analysis summary chart above provides significant information and capability estimates for the engineer to interpret the process ability to meet the given specifications. Interested in learning more about what this capability estimates mean? Go to the ASQ (American Society for Quality) website by clicking here.", "We have gone through one of the many industrial engineering applications that R and the qcc package have to offer. As you might have noticed, just with few lines of code we were able to construct quality control charts and get significant information to be used during Lean Six Sigma and DMAIC projects for process improvement. Once again, I invite you to continue discovering the amazing stuff you can perform using R as an industrial engineer.", "If you found this article useful, feel welcome to download my personal code on GitHub.
