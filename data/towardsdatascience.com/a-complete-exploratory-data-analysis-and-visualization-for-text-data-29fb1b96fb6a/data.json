As a data scientist or NLP specialist, not only we explore the content of documents from different aspects and at different levels of details, but also we summarize a single document, show the words and topics, detect events, and create storylines.", "However, there are some gaps between visualizing unstructured (text) data and structured data. For example, many text visualizations do not represent the text directly, they represent an output of a language model(word count, character length, word sequences, etc.).", "In this post, we will use Womens Clothing E-Commerce Reviews data set, and try to explore and visualize as much as we can, using Plotly\u2019s Python graphing library and Bokeh visualization library. Not only we are going to explore text data, but also we will visualize numeric and categorical features. Let\u2019s get started!", "After a brief inspection of the data, we found there are a series of data pre-processing we have to conduct.", "To preview whether the sentiment polarity score works, we randomly select 5 reviews with the highest sentiment polarity score (1):", "Then randomly select 5 reviews with the most neutral sentiment polarity score (zero):", "There were only 2 reviews with the most negative sentiment polarity score:", "Single-variable or univariate visualization is the simplest type of visualization which consists of observations on only a single characteristic or attribute. Univariate visualization includes histogram, bar plots and line charts.", "Vast majority of the sentiment polarity scores are greater than zero, means most of them are pretty positive.", "The ratings are in align with the polarity score, that is, most of the ratings are pretty high at 4 or 5 ranges.", "Most reviewers are in their 30s to 40s.", "There were quite number of people like to leave long reviews.", "For categorical features, we simply use bar chart to present the frequency.", "General division has the most number of reviews, and Initmates division has the least number of reviews.", "When comes to department, Tops department has the most reviews and Trend department has the least number of reviews.", "Now we come to \u201cReview Text\u201d feature, before explore this feature, we need to extract N-Gram features. N-grams are used to describe the number of words used as observation points, e.g., unigram means singly-worded, bigram means 2-worded phrase, and trigram means 3-worded phrase. In order to do this, we use scikit-learn\u2019s CountVectorizer function.", "First, it would be interesting to compare unigrams before and after removing stop words.", "Second, we want to compare bigrams before and after removing stop words.", "Last, we compare trigrams before and after removing stop words.", "Part-Of-Speech Tagging (POS) is a process of assigning parts of speech to each word, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc", "We use a simple TextBlob API to dive into POS of our \u201cReview Text\u201d feature in our data set, and visualize these tags.", "Box plot is used to compare the sentiment polarity score, rating, review text lengths of each department or division of the e-commerce store.", "The highest sentiment polarity score was achieved by all of the six departments except Trend department, and the lowest sentiment polarity score was collected by Tops department. And the Trend department has the lowest median polarity score. If you remember, the Trend department has the least number of reviews. This explains why it does not have as wide variety of score distribution as the other departments.", "Except Trend department, all the other departments\u2019 median rating were 5. Overall, the ratings are high and sentiment are positive in this review data set.", "The median review length of Tops & Intimate departments are relative lower than those of the other departments.", "Bivariate visualization is a type of visualization that consists two features at a time. It describes association or relationship between two features.", "It is obvious that reviews have higher polarity score are more likely to be recommended.", "Recommended reviews have higher ratings than those of not recommended ones.", "Recommended reviews tend to be lengthier than those of not recommended reviews.", "There were few people are very positive or very negative. People who give neutral to positive reviews are more likely to be in their 30s. Probably people at these age are likely to be more active.", "Sometimes we want to analyzes words used by different categories and outputs some notable term associations. We will use scattertext and spaCy libraries to accomplish these.", "First, we need to turn the data frame into a Scattertext Corpus. To look for differences in department name, set the category_colparameter to 'Department Names', and use the review present in the Review Text column, to analyze by setting the text col parameter. Finally, pass a spaCy model in to the nlp argument and call build() to construct the corpus.", "Following are the terms that differentiate the review text from a general English corpus.", "Following are the terms in review text that are most associated with the Tops department:", "Following are the terms that are most associated with the Dresses department:", "Finally, we want to explore topic modeling algorithm to this data set, to see whether it would provide any benefit, and fit with what we are doing for our review text feature.", "We will experiment with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) technique in topic modeling.", "By looking at the most frequent words in each topic, we have a sense that we may not reach any degree of separation across the topic categories. In another word, we could not separate review text by departments using topic modeling techniques.", "Topic modeling techniques have a number of important limitations. To begin, the term \u201ctopic\u201d is somewhat ambigious, and by now it is perhaps clear that topic models will not produce highly nuanced classification of texts for our data.", "In addition, we can observe that the vast majority of the review text are categorized to the first topic (Topic 0). The t-SNE visualization of LSA topic modeling won\u2019t be pretty.", "All the code can be found on the Jupyter notebook.
