While I was not entirely surprised by the topic, what struck my eye was the sheer unbelievable accuracy of their model.", "We are talking about an Area Under the Curve of 95 %, perfect sensitivity, and nearly flawless specificity. For sure, they must have committed a mistake? The article itself is behind a paywall. Nevertheless, the presentation provides enough information for replication.", "According to the presentation, they used pretty basic economic indicators (differences in federal funds rates, unemployment rate, etc.) as well as differences in monthly SP500 prices (500 biggest US Companies), an indicator of the overall market. They sometimes used log differences as these are more likely to follow a normal distribution.", "A quick summary of where I got my data:", "On Macrotrends only data starting in1962 was available. I will therefore only consider data starting in 1962.", "Data preparation is pretty straight forward. We calculate the log difference and differences. Furthermore, we divide the data in the train on the test set, starting from 1962 but otherwise sticking to the end date suggested in the presentation.", "Given that the full title of their article is \u201cMachine Learning Prediction of Recessions: An Imbalanced Classification Approach\u201d \u2014 that fact that recessions are a very infrequently occurring event should play a principal role in the process of fitting a model adequately.", "First, we might ask our selves, how frequently do these recession months occur in the data?", "So how can you handle class imbalances?", "Well, there are two main strategies:", "With undersampling, you sample examples from the majority class to match the minority class. Since the presentation does not mention which method was used, I used random undersampling.", "With oversampling you synthetically add data to the minority class to match the majority class. SMOTE is a frequently used oversampling technique.", "I will use both over and undersampling on the train data to help fit our model and compare them to the original data.", "We end up with 3 different train sets. The original training data, one oversampled version with SMOTE and one randomly undersampled.", "Since the paper title puts an emphasis on the fact, that this is a problem of imbalanced data - recessions are luckily a rare event - I expect substantially different scores for these sampling methods.", "So let\u2019s compare the three sampling methods - fit a random forest and have a look at the performance.", "Nice! We can see that the sampling methods makes a substantial difference in the reported AUC scores. Undersampling performs better than SMOTE and was also used in the paper. Overall I think the replication was a success \u2014 considering that I missing the first three years of data and I did not tune any hyperparameters.", "So, given that we can predict recessions, what can we do with this information?", "Several strategies come to mind. To investigate these strategies, I will use the predictions from our model fitted on the training period.", "The SP500 index will serve as our benchmark as it is often considered as a good representation of the US market.", "During recessions, one might want to limit exposure and just take the money and put it on the side \u2014 maybe hide it under your pillow?", "Gold always seems like a safe option. And during recessions, one might observe a run on it.", "The VIX is a Volatility Index calculated on SP500 Options. It is usually also referred to as a Fear Index, where higher Volatility implies times of instability.", "Comparing these trading Strategies and using the predictions from our model we get the following chart for the test period:", "The main recession in this period is between 2008 and 2010. We see contrary to popular belief that investing in Gold is actually not a great idea. Gold seems to have a high exposure to the general market movement. Taking our money out of the market during a recession is fine, but is not really giving us an edge. Investing in the Volatility Index (VIX) on the other hand seems like a real game changer for passive investors. As the recession hits, fear and volatility increases and so do profits.", "To determine whether there will be a recession we can fetch more recent data like this.", "We can use our model to get an estimate for the confidence that our model has in its predictions.", "As of September, our model is confident that there will not be a recession for the coming month. We can see that due to Jerome Powells changes in the Fed Rates as well as rising unemployment numbers we actually encountered higher confidence levels in April and March.", "If you find any errors, have any questions, or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out to me on Linkedin.", "Your home for data science.
