A Google search on \u201cIs A/B testing overrated\u201d shows this chronic problem.", "In this post, first, we\u2019ll briefly tackle why AB tests are not a panacea for all problems. Subsequently, we\u2019ll look at other hypothesis validation methodologies Growth PMs must draw from for robust and speedy decision making.", "Typically, folks look at hypothesis validation stack along three dimensions:", "AB tests are the most scientific of all methodologies. We get to know the real preference, not the stated preference. We get to know the hard data, not mushy words; moreover, we get the hard behavior from users in the context of product use, not from a scripted setting.", "With so much going for the AB test, it is not hard to see why inexperienced teams rely on the AB tests more and more. They do it to avoid debate, accountability and tiring critical-thinking. Little do they realize that by choosing AB testing by default, they are slowing down the organization, and they may still get caught in decision quagmires.", "We don\u2019t draw a sword to kill a fly, similarly, we shouldn\u2019t pick up AB testing for all idea validation needs.", "Teams make mistakes because the above three-dimensional framework is misleading. It does talk about, Qual-Quant, Attitudinal-Behavioral, Natural-Scripted product use\u2014 but it misses the crucial 4th dimension.", "The 4th dimension is our Context \u2014 company size, product size, product maturity, experimentation maturity, and business need. It gets overlooked because product management and user research literature does not talk about it.", "Ironically, teams don\u2019t account for their own context. They forget themselves, resulting in wrong choices.", "For a mature organization with a well-developed tech stack, analytics system, and program management, erring towards conducting AB testing is not a blunder, as quality is more important than speed. Moreover, a large organization has the resources to build an experimentation platform and a system to recoup some lost speed.", "For smaller companies, the focus is growth. You cannot sew your pants with a sword, so don\u2019t rely on A/b tests. You need to talk to users more often; Product sense, competitor product teardown, and critical thinking are your tools, not the A/B test.", "A/B testing trades velocity for precision. With an A/B test, we are more confident in our numbers, but it slows us down. Startups should prioritize velocity over precision, and should not run AB tests for months to obtain stat-sig. However, as a company grows, every 1% change matters, so the best practices for hypothesis validation must also change.", "A/B testing best practices by company size:", "Here is a hypothesis validation stack by company size, keeping the 4th dimension in the mind.", "Before we wrap this section, we must recognize that idea validation is an exercise on decision making. Business guru Ram charan mined the nugget of the wisdom from Amazon's way of doing things. According to Charan, Bezos says that there are two types of decisions, Type 1, and Type 2.", "Type 1 decisions are consequential and irreversible. Once the decision is made, and the door has closed behind you, there is no going back. Type 2 decisions are changeable and reversible; they are two-way doors. Suboptimal choices can be course correct.", "It is important to bucket ideas by Type 1 and Type 2. For Type 1, make sure that the team is undertaking due diligence, collecting qualitative and quantitative data, and testing the \u2018natural use of product\u2019.
