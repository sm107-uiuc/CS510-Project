Since 2014, more than 15,798 AI Startups have received an investment of at least $400k, according to the Stanford AI Index. AI Startups have also attracted record investments of $26.6bn in 2019, as stated by CB Insights. Given the projected exponential growth of data, both investors and entrepreneurs long to have an impact through AI.", "Yet, not all AI Startups are created equal. This article examines the differences and commonalities between Vertical and Horizontal AI Startups. The insights are based on discussions with AI experts from a Silicon Valley-based VC, a Berlin-based AI Venture Studio, and an AI Entrepreneur.", "To understand Vertical and Horizontal AI Products, let\u2019s dive into the topic of AI product development first.", "Every AI-based product follows roughly the same workflow. For each Machine Learning project, the team has to gather and prepare data, develop a model, and deploy and monitor its performance. The CRISP-DM model describes the Machine Learning workflow below.", "Understanding the Data Science workflow is important to distinguish between Vertical and Horizontal AI Startups. While Vertical AI Startups complete the entire workflow to deliver a product, Horizontal AI Startups focus on enabling the general Data Science workflow.", "A Vertical AI Startup delivers a product based on AI, owning the entire workflow to solve a very targeted customer need. These startups develop a complete product from end-to-end, starting with understanding the business case to monitoring product performance.", "Vara, for example, is a Vertical AI Startup that identifies breast cancer on x-rays. Vara is the first company that has received federal approval to use its AI solution to assist radiologists. The company is a prime example of a Vertical AI Company that completes the full Data Science workflow to deliver an innovative AI-based product.", "AI is a powerful tool that helps companies achieve superhuman performance on specific tasks. AI opens up new possibilities to deliver new products, improve existing products, or automate tasks. Vertical AI Startups optimize their predictions towards a specific use-case. If they\u2019re successful, they can perform better in this use-case than humans or competitors.", "Vertical AI Startups include domain experts in key positions such as product roles. For example, it is highly likely for a company that builds an automated cancer detection product to have in-house radiologists and/or oncologists. \u2014 Sahar Mor, Entrepreneur in stealth mode", "However, it is harder for Vertical AI Startups to adjust their product to serve adjacent use-cases. For Vara, which excels at identifying breast cancer, it is not trivial to switch the task to detect brain cancer. AI models perform well in their narrow tasks. Vara could train a new AI model to detect brain cancer from a new dataset, but still reuse their existing model development pipeline.", "In 10 years, Vertical AI Startups will substantially change how we work in certain professions. \u2014 Rasmus Rothe, Co-Founder and CTO at Merantix", "Additional examples of Vertical AI Startups are driverless car company Waymo and financial crime prevention company hawk.ai. Altogether, for Vertical AI Startups it is of paramount importance to focus on solving a single use-case that is large enough to ensure growth. As it takes time and data to train a new model for a new use-case, the initial use-case has to be impactful enough to support a profitable company.", "Let\u2019s evaluate the specifics of Horizontal AI Startups next.", "A Horizontal AI company enables Data Scientists to complete the Data Science workflow more efficiently. Thus, the customers of Horizontal AI Startups are generally Data Scientists or development teams.", "Horizontal AI Companies pick specific or multiple parts of the Data Science workflow and improve them. A Horizontal AI Company could for example focus on helping Data Scientists monitor their models. Horizontal AI Products are use-case agnostic and are used to develop any AI-based product.", "Saturn Cloud is a Horizontal AI Startup that aims to make Data Scientists more effective. It provides a fully managed service that enables data scientists to work at scale using the tools they know best: Python, Jupyter, and Dask. The tool is generic so that it can be used for any AI-based product.", "\u201cAcross dozens of industries, we are hearing how automating data science workflows is enabling more efficient teams and better experiences for their end customers. At the same time, Python is soaring in use and rapidly dominating the data science landscape \u2014 so adopting a suite of Python-native tools for analytics and automation makes sense for most data teams.\u201d \u2014 Hugo Shi, co-founder of Saturn Cloud and previously founder of Anaconda.", "Horizontal AI Solutions promise to become more useful in the future, as the amount of data created grows exponentially, according to an IDC forecast. Data is the fuel for AI-based products, thus the more data available, the higher the potential to create valuable data-based products. Additionally, the market for Data Scientists continues to grow steadily. According to a study by IBM, the demand for Data Scientists will increase by 28% to 2.7m in the USA in 2020. Thus, the pool of target customers continues to grow.", "However, Horizontal AI products also face challenges. They have to seamlessly integrate into the target Data Science workflow and software stack. Additionally, \u201cit is important to strive for market leadership when developing a Horizontal AI Product\u201d, says Rasmus Rothe. For Horizontal AI Startups, it is hard to collect proprietary data and thus to build data defensibility. When defining which step of the Data Science workflow to automate, it is important to keep different requirements for different AI-based models in mind. Focusing on the most valuable features for the target group will set aspiring from successful Horizontal AI Startups apart.", "While Horizontal AI companies often have more competition, their product is generally more acquirable because its tech can fit into the stack of a broader set of acquirers. \u2014 Jason Risch", "Additional examples of Horizontal AI Startups are the data labeling company understand.ai, and Data Science workflow management startup neptune.ai. The potential for Horizontal AI Startups is vast. Yet, it is challenging to build a tool that outperforms competitors and reaches market leadership. Once you provide value to many Data Scientists, your Horizontal AI Startup will be successful.", "AI Startups are different, and understanding their unique value propositions is central to building a successful AI Company. While Vertical AI Startups deliver products, Horizontal AI Startups empower AI product creation. T-shaped mixes of both startups types exist as well, but are subject to another article.", "It is important to be aware of the type of AI startup you\u2019re building because that will ultimately impact your product roadmap.", "Thank you for your attention! After finishing this post, you have a better understanding of the characteristics of Vertical and Horizontal AI Startups. If you\u2019d like to hear more about the intersection of Business, Project Management, and Data Science, follow me on Medium, LinkedIn, or Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
