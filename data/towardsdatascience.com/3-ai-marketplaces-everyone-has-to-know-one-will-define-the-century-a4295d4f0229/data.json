A platform dominating this market could have almost unlimited growth potential. Millions of GPU hours are consumed every few days to train bigger and stronger AIs for the world. Simultaneously, collaboration and sharing of knowledge is achieved through the thousands of academic AI papers published every year. The sharing of the trained models though, is still in its infancy stage.", "This is where AI Marketplaces start their career. Sharing is caring, and if AI developers and companies can turn a profit in the process, even better.", "In this article, we will look at three promising solutions you have to know. While going over them, we will have a look at their interface and some demo models.", "I am not associated in any way with any of the following AI Marketplaces", "The biggest, the champion, the one to rule them all. On top of all of our minds, when we combine the magical words", "Marketplace + AI = AWS from AMAZON", "And as you might expect, Amazon allows developers to sell and showcase their beautiful models. If you have a great Machine Learning model or any other intermediate program worth selling, you must consider AWS. Not only does it offer your solution access to millions of customers, but it will also simplify deployment and much more.", "So why do we need any other AI Marketplaces? Amazon offers everything, not just AI services, which could result in lost focus and suboptimal design decisions. Additionally, many developers and customers are growing increasingly skeptical of their dependence on Amazon and big tech players in general, and so do governments.", "Amazon's AI Marketplace can be found when browsing their normal marketplace and filtering for AI. This will list a total of 873 solutions for us to pick from, of which roughly ~500 seem to be actual AI models. The AWS interface is both simplistic and familiar and offers plenty of combinations.", "My favorite example of the day is the Mask Detector for Epidemiological Safety by Vitech Lab. Mask Detector \u2014 is a real-time computer vision model for detecting the absence of masks or respirators on people. And as we can clearly see in this picture, it works great! It detected that I was wearing a mask with 97.83% and an eye pad with 0.17%, which again shows the superiority of AI solutions. What a time to be alife ;)", "Another amazing AI that we found on AWS Marketplace is Vehicle Damage Inspection. As they state, significant time is spent by auto insurances to appraise vehicle loss and estimate the final settlement amount. A Machine Learning model can reduce the inspection time and identify damage types after a car accident.", "I tried their model and was surprised by the results. The basic approach is that we upload an image of a car, and the AI answers what is broken.", "As we can see, the results are somewhat accurate, given that this is probably not an ideal car image. It correctly classified that we have a Broken Windshield, but honestly not entirely sure how useful these results and classes are in practice.", "Genesis Ai, I am usually not too hyped about startups. Clearly, they all help us accelerate the wheel of history a little, but let\u2019s face it, most of them will fail miserably. This is why I don't point this team out lightly. It really could have an impact. Their pitch?", "GenesisAI is a Machine Learning protocol. On top of this protocol, they are building a marketplace for AI products and services \u2014 an Amazon for AI services, as they state.", "That all sounds great, but\u2026I know how you feel. Their team and board look like they know what they are doing. So if anyone, I feel they might have a shot.", "As we can see, their founders have worked in the best places (Google, Yahoo, Harvard) and achieved the highest degrees. Moreover, their board features top players such as Thomas Magnanti, a well-known professor who surely knows one or two things about computer science. At the same time, I am not confident enough to invest in their company. I think their idea is lovely, and I really hope they succeed, but AWS is in a strong position. Please have a look at their idea in this video.", "What happens if you take the biggest buzzwords of the century and throw them together? Exactly! SingularityNET aims to be an AI marketplace on top of a blockchain. Their basic idea is to create a blockchain-driven ecosystem where developers can connect and interconnect their different AI solutions. They put special emphasis on intercommunication between the different AIs.", "What makes this project even more intriguing is the CEO and co-founder, Dr. Ben Goertzel. Goertzel\u2019s career has been dedicated to Artificial General Intelligence human level and beyond, like no other.", "The SingularityNET platform brings blockchain and AI together to create a new AI fabric that delivers superior practical AI functionality today while moving toward the fulfillment of Singularitarian artificial general intelligence visions \u2014 Whitepaper SingularityNet", "I honestly get what they are trying to achieve. There is certainly a lot of room to make AI more accessible to developers worldwide and increase its value for interoperability. The only thing that I keep wondering is, \u201cWhy on the blockchain?\u201d. So far, I have not seen any specifics on why all of this should be built on a blockchain instead of a normal marketplace.", "Big tech giant's control may be an issue with a dominant AI marketplace, but whether developers will choose a blockchain solution over a central solution remains to be seen.", "Definitely check out their video. It shows that they know a thing or two about marketing.", "The cool thing about SingularityNET is that it\u2019s one of the few marketplaces that actually already is up and running. While most of their models are pretty much standard models you can find lying around on the internet, such as GPT-2 and many other text models, they have around 46 models at the time of writing.", "To use their services, we would theoretically need to buy their token. Luckily we can easily use the demo mode on their website to see if it works. I tested the Minecraftizing service first, which failed and did not work. However, I tested the DeOldify application and have to say the result is quite good. The issue I had here is the response time, which took quite a bit of time, but all in all, this is pretty good for an early demo.", "The price was 0.02 AGI for one picture, which at the time of writing is around 0.0012$. I generally love the feeling of the marketplace and the fact that it is the only working marketplace that exclusively specializes in AI services.", "Sharing is caring. The current trend of retraining the same AIs in different companies is clearly not always the most efficient way. If we would learn to come together and share our accomplishments such that everyone can build on and with it, we would progress faster and stronger. Additionally, a strong player or group that could define rules and standards for AI developers\u2019 to play by would make AI adoption less risky.", "We have seen two promising approaches that want to solve the problem, and the most likely winner AWS. If any of the two underdogs can take on the big tech companies remains to be seen. While only the future can tell, remember that you vote with your dollars.", "If you enjoyed this article, I would be excited to connect on Twitter or LinkedIn.", "Make sure to check out my YouTube channel, where I will be publishing new videos every week.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "I want to empower you to build the future. As a Machine Learning Engineer, I am passionate about everything in the data sphere Computer Science (MSc ETH)"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
