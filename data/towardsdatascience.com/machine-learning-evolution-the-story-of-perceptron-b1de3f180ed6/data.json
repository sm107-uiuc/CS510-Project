It has become the talk of the town. Fancy words like machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are now a mandatory part of every product or solution offered by the corporate world to galvanize their clients and end-users. But in reality, these are not just fancy terms anymore.", "Over the last few decades, numerous applications of AI have emerged which are solving real-world problems, making it a global phenomenon. Andrew Ng, who is a mentor to thousands of aspiring machine learners like me, referred to AI as the new electricity and said:", "Just as electricity transformed almost everything 100 years ago, today I actually have a hard time thinking of an industry that I don\u2019t think AI will transform in the next several years.", "Every major technology company has adapted to this computing revolution as they understand the major tech trends and cannot take the risk of being left behind. ML is here to stay for a while and if you are a developer looking to upskill your portfolio, I suggest you start learning. Plus, it pays more.", "Artificial intelligence has already disrupted all major industries. Today, AI & ML have become an integral part of our lives due to its cross-domain applications in healthcare, neuroscience, agriculture, security, surveillance, and many more. Over the years, AI has evolved and now it is capable of helping mankind. But it all started some fifty years ago when the perceptron was invented.", "Before we continue with our approximately 65 years old perceptron story, let us define the perceptron informally first:", "A perceptron is a convenient artificial model of a biological neuron. It is a single-layer neural network algorithm used for supervised learning. It consists of input values, weights and bias, and an activation function.", "We are not going into the technical details so let\u2019s continue our story.", "The perceptron, which is the basic building block of the neural network, was invented by Frank Rosenblatt in January 1957 at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, Inc at Buffalo, New York. This invention was the result of research titled \u201cThe perceptron \u2014 A perceiving and recognizing automaton.\u201d", "A machine or control mechanism designed to follow automatically a predetermined sequence of operations or respond to encoded instructions.", "It was part of five-year-long research intended to design an electronic brain model that is capable of learning complex patterns, pattern perception, and generalization. The intuition behind this research was to construct a device which possesses human-like functions such as perception, concept formation, the ability to generalize from experience, recognize the complex pattern of information and perceive similar objects of different size, shape, and orientation.", "However, to perform all these operations, a conventional computer system would be required to store thousands if not millions of patterns, and then whenever required, these excessive number of patterns are searched for recognizing an unseen pattern which was computationally very expensive and not an economical way of identifying a pattern or object.", "To solve this problem, Frank Rosenblatt proposed a system that would potentially work on the principles of the biological brain and recognize similarities among patterns using a probabilistic approach, instead of the deterministic approach.", "His perceptron model consisted of three main components:", "Each of these three main systems would further contain units that are connected. These connections can be turned on or turned off based on the pattern that is being recognized. The sensory system would take in the input pattern. The association system would turn specific connections on or off and output would be presented using the response system.", "The perceptron model was given life by building custom hardware called Mark 1 Perceptron, which was designed mainly for image recognition. It was a black box much like the present-day neural network with an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer.", "Now moving ahead a few decades, the perceptron story continued with the work presented by Geoffrey Hinton in 1986, when he presented a new learning procedure by the name of back-propagation which went on to become the backbone of modern-day neural network models. This technique works by minimizing the difference between the actual and desired values by adjusting the weights of the neural network model. It made the neural network learn or extract features and generalize a pattern or sequence of inputs to make fairly accurate predictions on unseen representations of data.", "A lot of progress has been made since then. Now, we have models like VGGNet, ResNet, Inception, and many more at our fingertips which can classify objects quickly and accurately. All of this is based on the fact that we are trying to mimic the human brain.", "But the question remains, have we understood how our brain recognizes objects we see in our daily lives? With every passing day, neuroscience researchers are postulating brain theories that are helping us in understanding how our brain learns, perceives, and memorize patterns.", "One such theory was presented by Jeff Hawkins who call it The Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence which tells us how a part of our brain called the Neocortex is responsible for making various models of a certain object and then vote in a hierarchical manner, to reach a consensus that tells us what we are feeling, sensing or looking at.", "The theory suggests that when we look at a certain object in real life, a specific set of neurons are fired in our Neocortex. Now, if we are presented with a similar object of different sizes and orientation, a similar set of neurons would be fired in our Neocortex which allows us to generalize objects that we see in our daily life. It is not that simple, but you can get a general idea.", "This is a different approach than traditional ML or state-of-the-art DL, which requires a huge amount of input representations to learn a pattern and then make predictions.", "Jeff Hawkins founded Numenta, which is working on integrating the most advanced theories of neuroscience like The Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence with AI, to create truly intelligent machines that work on the same principles of the biological brain. We might still be a long way off but we are certainly headed in the right direction. We have made significant advancements and the perceptron is at the heart of it all.", "As an aspiring data science researcher, I feel we owe a great deal to the early thinkers of the computing world. From the invention of the first mechanical calculator by Blaise Pascal in 1642. To Ada Lovelace, who was the first person to describe a sequence of operations for solving mathematical problems in 1842. To Alan Turing who created the world-famous Turing Test in 1950, and to many more down the history lane.", "With the current advancements in the field of AI, we often tend to forget the humble beginnings that resulted in the outstanding work we have been able to do today. The ability to work on intuition and prove it using conscious reasoning is the biggest asset for any researcher. So, let your intuition drive you towards scientific greatness and become part of this evolution.", "Your home for data science.
