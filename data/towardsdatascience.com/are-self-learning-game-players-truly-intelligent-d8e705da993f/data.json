Is this intelligence distinguishable in any meaningful way from that of traditional chess engines such as the world\u2019s strongest chess player, Stockfish?", "The field of AI is burdened by a subjective definition of intelligence: if you can explain it, then it\u2019s not intelligent. To avoid this mysticism we attempt to come up with a definition that is more objective. Using the formalism of a Markov Decision Process, \u201can intelligence is an agent that can sense and manipulate its environment to achieve its goals\u201d. This is problematic in the definition of \u201cit\u201d; but for the purposes of game playing we can treat a player (the agent, the \u201cself\u201d) as distinct from the game (the environment).", "Given this definition, can we say that Leela (the self learning chess player) is any more intelligent than Stockfish (a human-coded chess player). I would argue that they are equally intelligent according to our definition: both consist of an evaluation function, a tree-search, and some time-control logic. Both have exactly the same goal (checkmate; or, failing that, draw). As of today, Stockfish is slightly better at achieving that goal; but the difference is marginal.", "In both these programs, the tree-search and time control logic are coded by humans. For Stockfish, the evaluation function has evolved through the agency of humans. For Leela, it evolved via a process of self-play (that was itself written by humans).", "If we think of Leela and Stockfish as just chess-playing agents then either both are intelligent; or neither is. There is no meaningful difference. But if we expand the scope of the \u201cit\u201d that is the agent, to include the processes that create the players, then we can perhaps start to tease apart what makes one intelligent and the other not.", "So consider, as our two agents, the system that creates Stockfish and the system that creates Leela. What is their environment; how do we characterize their agency? The environment is no longer a single game of chess; but it instead becomes a sequence of games and players. Our \u201cagent\u201d interacts by observing and updating its player (or players) and not by playing the games themselves.", "When Stockfish plays a game of chess \u2014 and especially when it loses as a game \u2014 a human will analyze what went wrong; and propose changes to the rules embodied in its source code. Playing a game of chess is thus a sensory act that permits an update to the agent\u2019s state.", "In contrast, Leela learns only through self-play. Playing a game against an external opponent is not a sensory act that results in an update to the player-agent. The obvious conclusion is that Leela is not an agent in any meaningful sense in this broader environment. The self-learning of Leela may be a highly successful exercise in navel gazing \u2014 machine learning \u2014 but as a system it exhibits no agency because it does not sense its environment.", "We could, of course, expand our scope still further to include the programmers of the self-learning system; but then we would lose the concept of Leela as the self-learning agent.", "So what would it take to establish a claim that a self-learning Leela is actually an intelligence, in the sense of being an agent that manipulates its environment to achieve goals? If the environment is iterated game playing, then our agent needs to sense that environment and use those observations to achieve the goal of building players that win more games. Ideally it would also sense the rules of the game(s) from that environment; but I would not claim that that is necessary.", "As of today, I conclude that Stockfish exhibits the superhuman intelligence of a Searle\u2019s Chinese Room (with internal humans that do have some limited understanding of the problem that it is solving); but Leela (and Alpha Zero) do not.", "I am, however, optimistic. AI researchers are actively working on these problems: for example, using inverse reinforcement learning. I would not be at all surprised to see a truly intelligent gaming agent in 2019: one that learns not just from self-play against a hard-coded model; but also that interacts (cooperates or competes) with other such agents to explore the rules. Such intelligence is not needed if our only goal is to create the world\u2019s strongest chess player; but, as we increasingly embed these AIs in our everyday lives, we will require systems that learn, and adapt with, the ever changing rules of the game we call \u201creality\u201d.", "Your home for data science.
