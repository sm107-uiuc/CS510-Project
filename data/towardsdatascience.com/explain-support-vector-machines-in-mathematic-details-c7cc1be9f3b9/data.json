It can also be applied in multi-class classification problems and regression problems. This article represents the mathematics behind the binary-class linear Support Vector Machines. Understanding mathematics helps implement and tune the models in practice. Moreover, you can build your own support vector machine model from scratch, and compare it with the one from Scikit-Learn. For details, you can read this article along with another article of mine.", "Specifically, this report explains the key concepts of linear support vector machine, including the primal form and its dual form for both hard margin and soft margin case; the concept of support vectors, max-margin, and the generalization process.", "Assume we have n training points, each observation i has p features (i.e. x_i has p dimensions), and is in two classes y_i=-1 or y_i = 1. Suppose we have two classes of observations that are linearly separable. That means we can draw a hyperplane through our feature space such that all instances of one class are on one side of the hyperplane, and all instances of the other class are on the opposite side. (A hyperplane in p dimensions is a p-1 dimensional subspace. In the two-dimensional example that follows, a hyperplane is just a line.) We define a hyperplane as:", "where \u02dcw is a p-vector and \u02dcb is a real number. For convenience, we require that \u02dcw = 1, so the quantity x * \u02dcw + \u02dcb is the distance from point x to the hyperplane.", "Thus we can label our classes with y = +1/-1, and the requirement that the hyperplane divides the classes becomes:", "How should we choose the best hyperplane?", "The approach to answering this question is to choose the plane that results in the largest margin M between the two classes, which is called the Maximal Margin Classifier.", "From the previous graph, we can see that H1 doesn\u2019t separate the two classes; for H2 and H3, we will choose H3 because H3 has a larger margin. Mathematically, we choose \u02dcb and \u02dcw to maximize M, given the constraints:", "Defining w =\u02dc w / M and b =\u02dcb / M, we can rewrite this as:", "The support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the separating hyperplane. They are the most difficult data points to classify. Moreover, support vectors are the elements of the training set that would change the position of the dividing hyperplane if removed. The optimization algorithm to generate the weights proceeds in such a way that only the support vectors determine the weights and thus the boundary. Mathematically support vectors are defined as:", "The hard-margin SVM is very strict with the support vectors crossing the hyperplane. It doesn\u2019t allow any support vectors to be classified in the wrong class. To maximize the margin of the hyperplane, the hard-margin support vector machine is facing the optimization problem:", "Soft-margin SVM and the hyper-parameter C", "In general, classes are not linearly separable. This may be because the class boundary is not linear, but often there is no clear boundary. To deal with this case, the support vector machine adds a set of \u201cslack variables\u201d, which forgive excursions of a few points into, or even across, the margin, like showing in the graph below:", "We want to minimize the total amount of slacks while maximizing the width of the margin, which is called soft-margin support vector machine. This is more widely used, and the objective function becomes:", "for some constant C. This optimization problem is called the primal problem. The constant C represents the \u201ccost\u201d of the slack. When C is small, it is efficient to allow more points into the margin to achieve a larger margin. Larger C will produce boundaries with fewer support vectors. By increasing the number of support vectors, SVM reduces its variance, since it depends less on any individual observation. Reducing variance makes the model more generalized. Thus, decreasing C will increase the number of support vectors and reduce over-fitting.", "we can rewrite the constrained optimization problem as the primal Lagrangian function :", "Instead of minimizing over w, b, subject to constraints, we can maximize over the multipliers subject to the relations obtained previously for w, b. This is called the dual Lagrangian formulation:", "This is now a reasonably straightforward quadratic programming problem, solved with Sequential Minimization Optimization. There are a lot of programming tools you can use to solve the optimizing problem. You can use the CVX tool in Matlab to solve this question. Or if you are familiar with python, you can use the CVXOPT package to solve it. I have another article at Medium that discusses the use of the CVXOPT package, and how to apply it to solve SVM in the dual formulation. Once we have solved this problem for \\alpha, we can easily work out the coefficients:", "Waling through the math behind the Support Vector Machines algorithm definitely helps understand the implementation of the model. It gives insights on choosing the right model for the right questions and choosing the right value for the hyper-parameters.", "Hope this helps. Thank you all for reading!
