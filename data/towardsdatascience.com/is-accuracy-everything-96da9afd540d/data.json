Then the accuracy of the model is 980/1000 = 98%, meaning that we have a highly accurate model, but if we use this model to predict fruits in the future then it will fail miserably since the model is broken as it can only predict one class.", "One must have experienced a situation where the model achieves good accuracy on one test set but fails to perform equally when new data is provided(of the same nature).", "Getting the full picture of the model, i.e., how it realizes the data and how it can make predictions, helps in understanding the model in-depth and helps in improving it.", "So, suppose you develop a model which attains an accuracy of 80%, then how are you planning to improve it?To correct a mistake, first, we have to realize the mistake.Similarly, to improve the model we have to look at how our model is performing at a deeper level.This is not achieved by simply looking at the accuracy and hence other metrics are considered.", "In this article, I will walk you through some of the most used and important metrics for classification models.", "To start with we will have to look at the confusion matrix.", "Confusion Matrix is a table which is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It looks like the following.", "Here, TN = True Negative, i.e. when the actual value was \u2018no\u2019 the model predicted \u2018no\u2019(i.e., correct prediction).", "FP = False Positive, i.e., when the actual value was \u2018no\u2019 the model predicted \u2018yes\u2019(i.e., wrong prediction)", "FN = False Negative, i.e., when the actual value was \u2018yes\u2019 the model predicted \u2018no\u2019(i.e., wrong prediction)", "and TP = True Positive, i.e., when the actual value was \u2018yes\u2019 the model predicted \u2018yes\u2019(i.e., correct prediction)", "If you have studied about classification techniques then you must be familiar with the confusion matrix, if not I highly recommend you to be.", "The confusion matrix is all we need to calculate all the metrics for the classification model. YES!!!", "Let us look at the following metrics:", "The accuracy tells that overall how often the model is making a correct prediction.", "As clear from the above formulas,", "Here we are only considering the actual values which are \u2018yes\u2019(positive).As clear from the above expression, recall is a fraction (between 0 and 1, both inclusive).", "Recall is a measure that tells us how great our model is when all the actual values are positive.", "If Recall = 0, this means that the model is broken and can not make even a single correct prediction when the actual value is \u2018yes\u2019(positive).If Recall = 1, this means that the model is good enough to correctly make a prediction when the actual value is \u2018yes\u2019(positive) but has some loopholes which will be discussed further.", "Now one might ask \u2014 why do we need to consider recall when accuracy provides the general information?", "To answer this let us consider an example.Suppose we have a binary classification problem. Let\u2019s say we have 100 instances in our dataset and 90 of them are 0 (negative) and 10 are 1(positive).Now let us assume that due to class imbalance our model predicts all the 100 entries as 0(negative).The accuracy is equal to 90/100 = 90%If one only looks at the accuracy then he/she can say that the model is highly accurate. But let us now check the recall.", "Recall = 0/10 = 0We get recall = 0, which means that the model is broken and it can not correctly classify even a single entry when the actual value is positive.Hence, this shows that how important recall is to comment on the model performance.Also, this shows that accuracy only is not the best way to evaluate a model.", "So, we do not want a very low value of recall but what if our recall is very high(very close or equal to 1).If recall = 1, then this means that the model has correctly classified all the values when the actual value was positive. But this could also be the case that our model has predicted all values as positive, which would mean that the model has low precision.Before going any further let us first define what Precision is.", "In other words, it means that when the model predicts a positive value then what are the odds that the model has made a correct prediction.", "It is calculated as follows :", "This means that we want to maximize the precision of our model so that it can classify the relevant instances correctly, but if the precision is too high(very close to or equal to 1) then the model will have a very low recall because we still will be having a high number of false negatives.", "So, we have a precision-recall trade-off. We want to maximize both but maximizing one minimizes the other.", "A great explanation I read :", "While recall expresses the ability to find all relevant instances in a dataset, precision expresses the proportion of the data points our model says was relevant actually were relevant.", "If you happen to be in this field for a long time then you must be knowing that maximizing one of them is situational. We often encounter datasets where we either need to maximize recall or precision, irrespective of the other since it hardly makes a difference.There are a few examples I can think of but I will not go into the details since it is not this blog\u2019s objective.", "To get a more \u2018combined\u2019 expression for the precision-recall situation we consider another metric called F1-score.", "We use the harmonic mean instead of a simple average because it punishes extreme values. A classifier with a precision of 1.0 and a recall of 0.0 has a simple average of 0.5 but an F1 score of 0. The F1 score gives equal weight to both measures and is a specific example of the general F\u03b2 metric where \u03b2 can be adjusted to give more weight to either recall or precision.So, if we want a balanced classification model with optimal values of recall and precision then we try to maximize the F1-score.", "The F1-score is a specific case of the F\u03b2 metric, let us look at the general case.", "It is calculated using the following :", "Specificity tells how good our model is for identifying the false(negatives) correctly.", "It is calculated using the following :", "So, FPR tells us that when the actual value is a negative(false) then how wrongly have the model performed to classify the data.In other words, if we look at only the negatives(false), then how wrongly the model has classified them as positive(true), is what FPR is.That is, up to what proportion the model raises a false alarm.", "So far we have been looking at metrics that alone can not be used to describe the robustness of the model, but what if I tell you that there is a metric that can pretty much \u2018alone\u2019 do the job.", "Many scientists believe that MCC is the single most informative metric for any binary classifier.", "MCC(just like other metrics) is calculated using the TN, FN, TP, and FP.MCC is not a biased metric and flexible enough to work properly even in highly unbalanced data.", "MCC returns a value between -1 and +1.A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, A coefficient of 0 represents no better than a random prediction,A coefficient of \u22121 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation.", "So, we have discussed quite a few metrics to evaluate our model and we have seen how accuracy is not the only metric one should consider judging the model.", "I hope this article was useful to you, and if you have any queries or suggestions please write in the comment section.", "Your home for data science.
