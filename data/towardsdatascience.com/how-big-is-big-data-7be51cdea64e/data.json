After all, it has the term \u201cBig\u201d in its name so the data has to be big right?", "Big Data terminology started growing in popularity around 2012 before really hitting its stride from 2014 onwards.", "It has mainly been used to cover the ever-growing data footprints of large companies. As companies collect and process more varied and disparate data, the old language of database and data mart didn\u2019t really fit the bill. Terms like big data and data lake were thus born to bring data processing into the future.", "So what is really meant by big data? Is the job role of a big data engineer different than a normal data engineer?", "I look to shed some light on these questions in this post.", "Well, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be that big at all. Big data is used to describe data storage and processing solutions that differ from traditional data warehouses. This is often because the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed becomes too expensive using traditional databases, but it\u2019s not the only reason.", "Big data also encompasses unstructured data processing and storage. Rather than collecting standard tabular data, companies can now collect and process videos, images and documents and big data solutions need to account for this.", "This is why the term data lake became so popular, as you refer to your data storage as an open and varied lake rather than a fixed and structured warehouse.", "With that being said, big data is often used to describe large amounts of data.", "We are generating almost 30 times more data today than we were 10 years ago.", "Trying to store and analyse this amount of data in a traditional data warehouse would cost too much money and take too long to return results.", "This is because traditional data solutions were built to scale vertically. By this, I mean that you had a database and if you wanted more storage you added more hard drives and if you wanted more power you improved the CPU and RAM. However, there becomes a time when adding more doesn\u2019t give you any extra benefit and becomes too expensive.", "Big data solutions scale horizontally. This means that your datastore is often a cluster of servers/databases. If you need more storage or compute power, you can add almost infinite more servers.", "This sounds simple and begs the question why didn\u2019t we just do this with the old databases? The answer is simple, it required a change in how data is processed. If you split a traditional database up onto multiple machines and you wanted to count all records in a single table, how do you get to the number as your table is now spread over multiple machines, each giving you a different answer?", "This is what big data solutions provided. Not only do they provide a way to store incredible amounts of data (see Google article below) but manage the processing of data across multiple nodes (servers).", "In short, to answer the question of how big is big data, well it depends\u2026 it\u2019s as big as you want it to be. It only really becomes a big data platform though if you can handle the three V\u2019s. Volume, Velocity and Variety.", "Today there are so many big data technologies available to us so here I\u2019ll list those with the most interesting stories.", "Early on during the rise of big data technologies, a big data engineer would not only need data processing skills like SQL but also programming experience too. This is because a lot of the early systems were built by programmers before becoming more widespread with SQL like interfaces being built on top.", "These days a good combination of programming and SQL is still required but in some instances, you may get away with just SQL knowledge, especially if you understand the core differences between clustered and single-node data processing.", "In most cases though, you\u2019ll need a strong technology background, I\u2019ve found that programming skills are just as important as data processing skills. This is because you are often building and managing a data lake, requiring a DevOps like skill set as well as integrating these technologies together.", "As a big data engineer, you\u2019ll also be expected not to just perform ETL processing on data but also ingest data from a variety of sources including websites, API\u2019s, servers and other databases. You may also need to create real-time solutions that can ingest, analyse and store results with millisecond latency. All of these tasks require new skillsets outside of the traditional data warehousing model.", "At the end of the day, the worlds data footprint is only getting bigger so eventually what we call big data today could be small data tomorrow. It\u2019s learning to scale to meet the ever-growing demands that makes big data, big data.", "Your home for data science.
