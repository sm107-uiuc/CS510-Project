The sub-sample size is always the same as the original input sample size but the samples are drawn with replacement.\u201d", "In other words, Random Forest is a powerful, yet relatively simple, data mining and supervised machine learning technique. It allows quick and automatic identification of relevant information from extremely large datasets. The biggest strength of the algorithm is that it relies on the collection of many predictions (trees) rather than trusting a single one. With Random Forest you can do:- Classification (input = categorical data), each tree casts a vote for the final prediction.- Regression (input= continuous data), the tree\u2019s results are averaged to create the final prediction.", "Let\u2019s take a real-life example to explain it. Suppose you hesitate about where to go for your next holidays. You decide to ask your friend Rasmus for advice. Rasmus will ask you, where you already have been, what you did, and whether you liked it or not, to know what kind of things you like to do or see. Based on your answers and his own experiences, he will give you some recommendations. Here, Rasmus is making a decision tree to provide you with the best choice possible. You want to ask more friends for advice because you think that Rasmus is a bit biased by his own interest. So, in order to make the most accurate decision, you repeat the operation with \u201cn\u201d other friends. They ask you random questions just like Rasmus did and provide you with different places to go. Each answer is like a vote for the place to go. There are some common places recommended by your friends. You collect all the votes and aggregate them. You decide to go to the place with the most votes. Here, you are doing a random forest.", "In other words, before to take a decision do you want to ask one single person for recommendations or do you rather ask many different persons and compile all of their answers to decide?", "This is what you are doing when you are using Random Forest. You are empowering your classification/regression by accumulating the predictions of various trees.", "Decision trees are the foundations of the random forest model. They are easy to understand as they are intuitively used by everyone consciously or unconsciously:", "In the world of Data Science, decision trees break down step by step (i.e decisions after decisions) a dataset into smaller subsets. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes.", "Decision trees are simple but quite inaccurate. One misstep in the choice of the next node can drive you to a completely different result. In addition, they are holding a high risk of overfitting.", "Remember: Overfitting happens when our model captures the noise along with the underlying pattern in data. It happens when we train our model a lot over noisy datasets. These models have low bias and high variance.", "So basically, the deeper is the tree \u2192 the more specific it is to your dataset \u2192 the higher is the risk of overfitting.", "Instead of creating one single decision tree, the Random Forest algorithm creates many individual trees from randomly selected subsets of the dataset. Each of these individual trees generates a classification/regression of objects within the subset of data.", "Let\u2019s consider that we have a total of m features.", "Quite robust to outliers and non-linear data", "Random forest handles outliers by essentially binning them. It is also indifferent to non-linear features.", "Deal quite well with imbalanced data", "Let\u2019s make it clear, we are far from the undersampling, oversampling or SMOTE methods. What Random Forest offers, is the possibility to weight classes anti-proportionally to their presence in the dataset. In other words, if you have a minority class and a majority class, the minority class will be weighted much more (large error rate) than the majority class in order to re-balance the fact that it is under-represented in the dataset.", "Each individual bootstrapped dataset may get its classification/regression slightly wrong. However, as the algorithm relies on the aggregation of all the bootstrapped sets it limits drastically overfitting without substantially increasing error due to bias. Let\u2019s see more in detail how:", "\u2192 Training on sub-samples of the dataset: Each decision tree has a high variance, but low bias. But because we average all the trees, we are also averaging the variance as well so that we have low bias and a more moderate variance model.", "\u2192 Training on sub-samples of featuresIf we have 12 features, Random Forests will only use a certain number of those features in each model. Let\u2019s say 4 by trees, so 8 features potentially useful are omitted. But as Random Forest is a collection of decision trees, eventually many or all of our features will be represented. Features in each tree are chosen randomly in order to limit error due to bias and error due to variance.", "We are more likely to hit the target with Random Forest", "Thanks for reading!
