The two authors, coming from neuroscience and computer science backgrounds based this work on two biological observations:", "In biology, the synapse update depends on the activities of the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic cell and perhaps on some global variables such as how well the task was carried out. (page 1)", "The weight of a cell between A and B trained with backpropagation not only depends on the activity of A and B but also on the previous layer\u2019s activity and the training labels. So it doesn\u2019t depend on A, B activity but other potentially any other neurons in the network. This is inspired by Hebb \u2018s idea.", "2- Animals learn without labeled data and fewer data than neural networks trained with backpropagation:", "Second, higher animals require extensive sensory experience to tune the early [\u2026] visual system into an adult system. This experience is believed to be predominantly observational, with few or no labels, so that there is no explicit task. (page 1)", "Authors managed to train their model on MNIST and CIFAR-10 with only forward passes, meaning: \u2014 This technique is less computationally demanding, its computational complexity is comparable to the computational complexity of the forward pass in backpropagation ( source). \u2014 Doesn\u2019t require to train the model on a given task to make meaningful representation from the data.", "The blue rectangles are the authors \u201cbiological learning algorithm\u201d. First, the data is going through it, without any label or any indication on the task it\u2019ll be used for. Once trained a fully connected network is appended on top of it in order to specialize the model and make the desired predictions. This part is trained using backpropagation.", "Usually to compute the activity of the hidden layer h\u03bc, we project the input vi on it by multiplying it with a matrix W\u03bci and then apply non-linearity. In this new technique the h\u03bc activity is computed solving this differential equation:", "Since training is local and requires only forward passes, this architecture is different from an auto-encoder.", "In an experiment on MNIST and CIFAR-10, the authors trained 2000 hidden units using their biological technique to find the matrix W\u03bci:", "The training error on MNIST can be seen in the rightmost figure of the image below (BP stands for backpropagation and BIO for the proposed approach). We can see that despite a higher training error, the testing error is very close to the model trained end-to-end.", "On MNIST, we can see that the features learned by the proposed biological learning algorithm (left figure) are different from the one trained with backpropagation (middle figure).", "the network learns a distributed representation of the data over multiple hidden units. This representation, however, is very different from the representation learned by the network trained end-to-end, as is clear from comparison of Fig. 3, Left and Center.", "no top-down propagation of information, the synaptic weights are learned using only bottom-up signals, and the algorithm is agnostic about the task that the network will have to solve eventually in the top layer (page 8)", "Your home for data science.
