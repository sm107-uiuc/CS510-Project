Out of the 40 competitors, Google took or tied for first in 35 out of 36 categories. Yet, their translation program contained no explicit grammatical rules or dictionaries. In fact, nobody on the team that created the program spoke Arabic or Chinese.", "This is a paradigmatic example of Machine Learning (ML): software that\u2019s trained with data rather than explicitly programmed. And, hype notwithstanding, it\u2019s also a great example of the power of ML, which we\u2019ve now seen succeed again and again in translation, image processing, search engines, and many other fields.", "A good question to ask is: What technological advancement has allowed us to achieve results like this?", "While some explanations pervade nearly every technological advance: faster computers, cheaper storage, and theoretical progress, a specific driver of AI/ML has been the massive increase in the availability of data. In the last 30 years, we\u2019ve cataloged and created data exponentially faster than ever before. One impact is obvious: The more data you have about things, the more things you can analyze. But, the growth of data also has a deeper and more subtle impact, which has become known as the \u201cUnreasonable Effectiveness of Data\u201d.", "To understand the effect, consider an experiment done by Microsoft in 2001. Researchers ran a side-by-side test to evaluate the merits of 4 of different approaches to ML translation. They trained each model from scratch with the same input data, running a series of trials with varying data set sizes from 100k to 1 billion words.", "Source: Banko, M. and Brill, E. (2001) , \u201cScaling to Very Very Large Corpora for Natural Language Disambiguation\u201d", "As seen in the chart above, they discovered that the size of the dataset used to train the model mattered far more than the choice of ML approach. And, the performance differences between the models became very small as the dataset grew large.", "In fact, this is how Google won the automated translation contest in 2006. They had access to more examples of correct Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English translations (i.e. training data) than anyone else, because Google had just spent 8 years cataloging the Internet.", "They key lessons, from a practical standpoint, are that more data is almost always better and \u201cmore\u201d gets measured in orders of magnitude. Sadly, we don\u2019t always get to choose the how much data we have to work with. But, we always do need to take dataset sizes into consideration. And, as I\u2019ll cover in future posts, there are often clever tricks and trade offs to improve a situation.", "For techies only, since the Microsoft terminology is dated:", "Your home for data science.
