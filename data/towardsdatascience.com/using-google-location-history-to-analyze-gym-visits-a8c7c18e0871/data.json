Being an avid enthusiast of analyzing datasets, I decided to investigate how consistent and fruitful I was in this endeavour last year, using the Location History that I had been collecting. For all those not aware, Google keeps track of all the places you have visited (provided you give permissions, of course!). Since I had assigned Google permissions to store my location history since 2013, when I had my first Android phone, it was not difficult to retrieve the data in JSON. Using Python and Matplotlib to analyze the data, I decided to see how successful I was in keeping my resolutions last year.", "The data, at first, did not make much sense to me. But a little research brought me up to speed with the intricacies of the data. The data contained information regarding latitudes, longitudes, and DateTime of all the places that I have visited since 2013. Additionally, it also included several columns describing the \u2018accuracy\u2019, \u2018velocity\u2019, \u2018altitude\u2019, \u2018heading\u2019, \u2018Vertical Accuracy\u2019, which were not useful to me in the current context. The first task, therefore, was to wrangle the data into something which I could interpret.", "In addition to converting \u2018timestampMs\u2019 to the corresponding date and time, I also removed the \u2018accuracy\u2019, \u2018velocity,\u2019 \u2018altitude\u2019, \u2018heading\u2019 and \u2018verticalAccuracy\u2019 columns to create a processed dataframe. The second challenge was to zero in on the coordinates of my gym to filter the dataframe.I have to admit that this was one of the most challenging parts of the analysis. Latitudes and Longitudes form part of a geographic coordinate system to determine the position or location of any place on Earth.", "My gym is described by 50\u00b0 06'53.5\" N and 8\u00b0 41'12.9 \u201cE. However, using them, I was unable to filter out the data points corresponding to my gym from my location history. To find out a rough range of latitude and longitude positions for filtering, I zeroed in on the coordinates that were recorded by Google for my workout on the 6th of December.", "Using the range of the coordinates corresponding to my gym,along with the corresponding date and time informaton,I could finally get started. Using a little data pre-processing tricks, I added a few columns for my convenience that would make the analysis a little easier.Using the \u2018date\u2019 column I added the day and month information to the dataframe.I also added the time duration that I spent at the co-ordinate pair in minutes.", "Before studying the data for further insights, I had to tackle certain hindrances:", "Now that I had the necessary information that I needed, i.e., date and time, I could delve deeper into the data.", "Using unique() from the pandas library, I determined that out of 365 days last year, I visited the gym 119 times.Going deeper, I decided to investigate how long every workout would take and study the trends with respect to the time of the day,day of the week and month.", "So what were the average times for my gym workouts? For most of the day, I would either be in university,language school or at work, which probably explains why the peak times of my workout would be around 17:00 or 18:00. During holidays, there were also a few days where I would head to the gym a little early. There also exists an outlier where I was at the gym at 00:00.", "Which day of the week was I more likely to hit the gym?Tuesdays!.Surprisingly the days I was most free are the days where I have rarely hit the gym. However, in defense, most of the weekends were also the days where I would have trips planned. In hindsight, though, one can conclude that my motivation would taper off as the week progressed.", "Viewing my visits per month also threw interesting facts. October tops the month with the most amount of visits.", "The table completely turns however, when they are plotted with respect to the average time spent per visit, where July tops the list. July was the time when summer set in, and the pleasant weather coupled with the impending summer vacations added to the motivation to put in the hours at the gym. While I did hit the gym more frequently in October, I was too busy juggling work and school to put in long hours at the gym(also dipping temperatures!). The months February and March are missing due to the stress that examination brings.", "The gym subscription cost me \u20ac15 per month and with 119 visits last year each visit cost me an approximate of \u20ac2 . Business sense or not, the benefits far outweighed the cost, so for me, it was worth it.", "Coming from just 20 days in 2018 to 119 in 2019,I would consider last year quite an improvement.I regret not tracking my growth through an app, which would have given me a holistic information about how my habits have influenced my overall fitness. However, I have begun taking measures to incorporate them and hopefully will be able to give you a better picture in 2020.Thank you for reading.You can surely reach out to me if you have any questions.", "Your home for data science.
