In the end, our job is to create value for our company or client. Even if we have a model with 99.9999999% accuracy, management is unlikely to use it to make decisions unless they understand (at the very least) the basics of the model.", "A large part of any business is built around understanding the company\u2019s clients, and ensuring their needs and wants are being satisfied. This helps us ensure our clients are actually using the products we\u2019re creating/providing and that we\u2019re spending our own resources in optimal business segments. A common approach to understanding our clients is to segregate them into distinct groups. Instead of trying to understand and develop products for hundreds of thousands of individual people or companies, we can instead focus our efforts on a few distinct groups which represent our underlying clients. This allows us to make more informed, targeted decisions that will have a greater impact. In short, it ensures we see the forest and not the trees.", "If you\u2019ve been around machine learning over the past few years, you\u2019re brain has automatically already switched into unsupervised learning mode and you\u2019re already thinking of coding up a k-means or nearest-neighbor model. I can\u2019t deny that I\u2019m not usually right there with you. But let\u2019s take a step back. Is there a simpler method? One that requires almost zero explanation to management? One that\u2019s much less computationally expensive?", "RFM analysis began in the mid 90\u2019s when companies where trying to find optimal groups for Direct Mail. Most site Jan Bult and Tom Wansbeek\u2019s article, \u201cOptimal Selection for Direct Mail\u201d in Marketing Science, as the first emergence of the idea. And the idea is simple.", "RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. In short we want to group customers based on:", "Customers who have purchased three items within the last month are more important than customers who purchased two items over the last three years. Customers who have spent $10,000 on our products/services are more important than customers who have spent $50. As you can see, this methodology requires little (if any) explanation.", "The implementation of the analysis is equally as simple. For each group (R,F,M) we\u2019ll divide our customers into N segments. We\u2019ll then issue a rank to each group from 1-N (with 1 being optimal). At the end, we can use our RFM scores as-is, or we can use some aggregation method to develop one super-score for each customer.", "First, we\u2019ll need a list of all invoices over the time period we\u2019re analyzing. For each invoice we\u2019ll only need three things:", "For any analyst, this should be nothing more than a simple SQL query.", "We\u2019ll then pull our SQL data into a pandas dataframe. (The data in this example has been anonymized.)", "We\u2019ll now create a new dataframe (rfm) where we\u2019ll house our RFM metrics. Our new dataframe will contain one row for each client, along with their individual R,F,M ratings.", "We\u2019ll need a few helper functions to generate our metrics. We can use Pandas\u2019 apply to use these on our data.", "Finally, we\u2019ll need one last bit of code to split our customers into N groups and assign a ranking. For this example I\u2019ve chosen 4 groups and am splitting based on simple quartiles.", "Our ranking is now complete. Now we can dive into our analysis and pull out different segments that are useful for management.", "With RFM analysis, there are many different types of customer segments we can choose. Of course our best customers (with recent, frequent purchases who have spent a large amount of money) are denoted by R=1, F=1, M=1 \u2014 or more concisely as (1\u20131\u20131). A listing of some other notable groups is below:", "All of these segments are easily accessible with a simple pandas filter.", "Of course, what would an analysis be without a visualization? A small side-advantage of RFM analysis is that it provides 3 dimensions \u2014 making it easy to visualize. Let\u2019s step into it with plotly.", "Of course this analysis isn\u2019t as elegant or intense as k-means or almost any true machine learning algorithm \u2014 but that\u2019s not what we were after. We traded elegance for ease and simplicity.", "Generating the data, coding the solution, and reviewing the results will probably take you no more than an extended coffee break. We also didn\u2019t need a GPU\u2026 Developmentally and computationally, this analysis is a win.", "As we discussed in the beginning, our job is to bring actionable insights to decision makers. Here again, time is money. The simplicity of our approach saves us time (in that we don\u2019t have to develop a 10-page PowerPoint to explain our methodology) and saves management time (because they won\u2019t have to sit through your PowerPoint). In the end however, we\u2019ve provided actionable segments that can be used throughout marketing and product development.", "What will you do with all of that spare time?", "Thank you for taking the time to read.
