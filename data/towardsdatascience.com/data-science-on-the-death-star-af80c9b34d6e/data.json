As someone with a real interest in the field, I have often been warned by others and read about the complicated world of adopting data science into an organization. There have been many stories that go like this: A place hires a data scientist because they are told it\u2019s the cool thing to do, disappointment ensues because of lack of understanding, a data scientist needs a job again. There is obviously a disconnect sometimes of what the role can be.", "My simple definition of the role would be this: a data scientist is there to analyze and interpret data to build business solutions. It is work that requires contextualization, problem framing, experiment design, and data collection to craft solutions that make things better. You are free to Google the countless Venn diagrams that might drill more into what skills and knowledge that entails, but it is essentially business understanding, statistics, and programming knowledge put in a blender on high.", "I get questions from friends often about what data science can do, which is sometimes challenging as what it is can vary greatly by the context of what an organization does. If you are at Netflix, you could be working with big data to test algorithms for recommendations. If you are at eBay, you could be working on fraud monitoring tools for listings. If you work at Apple, you could be working on object recognition for photos that a user takes. Just as every business has different needs, so will their use and need for data science.", "I am by no means an expert, but let\u2019s think through an example and see what types of solutions come to mind:", "They have great benefits, a good salary, and the travel is amazing. The Emperor has sent you right to headquarters, The Death Star, to help along with construction to see if there could be some tasks that you may be able to help with. To help frame problems, you will need to start at the beginning of CRISP-DM and get some business understanding from staff. You\u2019ve never worked in multi-teared-galaxy-dominating agency before, so it\u2019s good to talk with others and see where you may be able to help.", "\u201cMaybe we could find a way to better automate firing on a planet, so I didn\u2019t have to bear the incredible guilt and disgust I feel about doing this\u201d", "Wow. That\u2019s rough. Is there ways to further automate the firing of a massive planet destroying super laser? Potentially, but as launching directive comes from a simple human directive, I think having the additional level of manual oversight is probably intentional. Just because some things can be automated doesn\u2019t mean they need to be, and ensuring the proper execution of planet destroying orders could use a personal approach. Any changes to the computational process would most likely be more a pure engineering improvement. Maybe changed departments?", "\u201cI think we might have a Rebel spy who is sending our plans out. What can you do?\u201d", "That sounds like a pretty serious problem! We probably also have an existing data source to work with with: the logs of communications. Since we\u2019re The Empire and there\u2019s no secrets around here, we can gather as much data as we can on all outgoing communications from the base. We need to first get a sense of this comms data, maybe see if we find anything irregular, like staff sending messages when scheduled on duty, messages sent during odd hours, anything that includes a schematic attachment, or anything sent to known enemies (a rebelalliance.org email is a common tip-off). If we still aren\u2019t finding enough, we could do more evaluation of the actual text, either just by searching for particular key words or phrases, or even sentiment to look for discouraged staff. If we want to monitor future messages, we can look to building a model that searches for the particular criteria (based on what we found in research) and have it alert us when potential offenders appear!", "\u201cI need to make sure we aren\u2019t letting people slip through our shields with older clearance codes. My neck is on the line, hahaha, but seriously it is. I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d", "Yeah, I\u2019ve heard that might be an issue. I\u2019m going to assume because you flippantly allow older codes that there is no formal system of managing them, beyond some handwritten post-it notes. This might not be at a point where we can do good analysis, but we can look into creating some organization for code management to begin with, perhaps by organizing a new database. We can work as a team, along with engineering, to understand how the codes should be organized and come up with an appropriate system. We can create reporting on code use and keep everyone up to date on what is acceptable. If we get to a point with enough understanding of code use, we could look into some other solutions that could automate the process, but sounds like we have some lengthy ground work ahead.", "\u201cI\u2019m concerned about Jedi coming on board and seriously compromising our security systems.\u201d", "You can have all the Stormtroopers you want, but if they fall to Jedi mind tricks, what\u2019s the point!? Maintaining base safety is definitely a key priority, and I think we may have some options. Perhaps with some cameras we can use facial recognition to watch out for pesky Jedi. If we gather some images of any known Jedi, we can train a model to look for the exact person and warn us if they are on the station. As just an example, let\u2019s take that Obi-Wan Kenobi character and train it on him, since I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s all that is left. Here\u2019s an example of what we might find if he shows up:", "This will take us some time, and computing power, but I think this ones possible.", "\u201cI\u2019d like a system to automate delivering critical updates to upper management without getting killed\u201d", "I\u2019m sorry, Ozzel. Dealing with others, especially those with supernatural choking abilities, is part of the job. Communication, especially within a team, is not something that can be automated away. We can discuss more how your team communicates and see if there are systems that can be set into place to make updates are more transparent, but you will have to handle working with others. If you are feeling intimidated, I suggest talking with HR, but I don\u2019t have a good feeling they can help you either.", "\u201cI want to systematically destroy all those who rebel against the Empire so I can stop killing for just five minutes and sit with the emotional impact of what has happened in my life.\u201d", "It is understandably frustrating that this rebelling thing is so regular. I don\u2019t think there is a magic bullet for finding all the Rebel Alliance, but we can look for trends in information to see if we can help narrow down where to find them. We can review data about past Rebel bases, find out as much detail about the locations (climate, solar system, distance from previous base, etc.) and resources (how many Rebels were there, type of firepower, etc. ) at each, and see if we can find any trends that could be helpful. If it looks like we can find a clear enough pattern, we may be able to take our research further into creating a model that, based on the most recent found base, can approximate where they might go next.", "As you can see, data science solutions aren\u2019t for everything, but when possible, you can do some amazing work that can improve how an organization runs.", "Your home for data science.
