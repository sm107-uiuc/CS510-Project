But how significant is the difference? Is it worth $10/month? Let\u2019s find out.", "We\u2019ve already written about Google Colab (free version), so check that article if you haven\u2019t:", "To perform the tests we\u2019ve used both Free and Pro version of the service, performing deep learning tasks on the Pneumonia dataset. The dataset is made of around 5,000 lung X-Ray images, perfectly suited for this type of task.", "The article is structured as follows:", "So without much ado, let\u2019s get started!", "The goal of this section is to discuss general differences between Free and Pro versions of the service \u2014 like CPU, available disk space, and runtime. I don\u2019t think these 3 should influence your purchase decision much (except maybe the last one), because I haven\u2019t had issues with them in the free version.", "With that being said, here\u2019s the comparison between the CPUs:", "So not much of a difference here \u2014 but once again, you\u2019re probably not using Colab for its CPU, so this part really isn\u2019t that important.", "With regards to the disk size, I\u2019m getting the same 34GB of available memory on both \u2014 which is kind of strange \u2014 but then again this will be enough for 99.99% of the users. The runtime duration might surprise you. Here\u2019s an official statement from Google:", "With Colab Pro your notebooks can stay connected for up to 24 hours, and idle timeouts are relatively lenient. Durations are not guaranteed, though, and idle timeouts may sometimes vary.[1]", "With the free version we had 12 hours of runtime at most, and the idle timeouts were stricter. There are ways to avoid this though, a possible solution is described in this article.", "Okay, we are now aware of some basic differences. In the next sections, we\u2019ll explore how RAM and GPU differ, and after that, we\u2019ll also compare the training duration on a real dataset.", "The single most important aspect of Google Colab is the GPU. It doesn\u2019t matter how powerful is your laptop, you\u2019ll get access to modern and powerful GPU. Down below are the GPUs you can expect on both Free and Pro tier:", "It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t know how these GPUs differ from one another. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve prepared a chart comparing the available GPU memory:", "Don\u2019t worry about the High RAM runtime, it will be discussed in the next section. Just from this, you can see that with the Pro tier you get roughly 5GB more of GPU memory, which in theory means that the neural network training process should be faster (we\u2019ll see about that).", "The Pro version of Colab will give you access to a High-RAM runtime environment. In theory, this runtime should give us more RAM, in case the standard 12GB isn\u2019t enough. Most of my deep learning work was on \u201ctoy\u201d examples, where datasets are only a couple of GB in size, so I never had an issue with RAM.", "If you need more work memory, you can change the runtime by going to Runtime \u2014 Change Runtime Type:", "But does the Pro version give you more RAM by default?", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve asked. Let\u2019s see in the next visualization:", "Both Pro and Free versions are exactly the same until the High RAM environment is enabled. Keep that in mind for your projects, but I\u2019ve found 12.8GB to be just fine for most of the cases.", "Now comes the part you\u2019ve been waiting for. Here we\u2019ll finally compare the differences in training time for Free and Pro tiers of Google Colab. As mentioned earlier, the model is trained on the Pneumonia dataset.", "Two architectures were prepared for the same dataset, with the first being a custom CNN architecture, and the second one being DenseNet201 pre-trained network, with the last layer modified to output two classes. You can see the custom architecture below:", "Furthermore, here are some additional specifications you might find useful:", "So everything is pretty much standard here, but I\u2019ve wanted to share this info in case you want to replicate the results.", "During training, I\u2019ve taken note of training duration, and that information is presented in the following chart:", "As you can see, the training process on the DenseNet201 architecture lasted 50% longer on the Free version, whilst the decrease in training time for a custom architecture isn\u2019t that significant. Keep this in mind, as you\u2019ll be using pre-trained architectures most of the time.", "I think now you have all the information needed to make your decision. Let me tell you my opinion in the next section.", "We saw that the training process on a prebuilt architecture lasted 50% longer on the Free version. But is that actually significant to you?", "Remember, you are limited to the 24-hour runtime at best, even with the Pro version. 24 hours still isn\u2019t enough for some businesses, where the training process lasts for days/weeks.", "If you are an individual who is still learning data science and deep learning, then I see no actual benefit from the Pro version \u2014 as the Free version will handle all dataset you\u2019ll encounter. The Pro version will provide speed improvements, but not as significant for most users.", "In case you absolutely need the speed improvement then just go for it \u2014 it\u2019s only $10/month. If not, save the money for something else \u2014 you\u2019re not missing out on anything special.", "What are your thoughts? Is the Pro version faster in your country?
