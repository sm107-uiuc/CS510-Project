Essentially, the business request was to enable supervisors to dynamically filter the tasks that need to be performed.", "Since supervisors also have their own tasks, they should be able to dynamically switch views between their own tasks, and tasks from all representatives.", "As usual, DAX offers a handy solution to your challenges. This time, I will use one of the information functions\u2026Or to be more precise, not one, but two of them, which are very similar, but still produce different results in different environments.", "Let\u2019s start with the USERNAME() function. This function will return you the domain name and user name of the current connection. So, if I create measures like this:", "And put it in a simple card visual, here\u2019s what I get:", "USERPRINCIPALNAME() will return the UPN (User Principal Name). Depending on your settings, in Power BI Desktop, the result can be exactly the same as for the USERNAME() function (as in my case), or it can return the email address of the user that is signed in to Power BI Desktop.", "However, once you publish your report to Power BI Service, both functions will behave the same and return the email address as a value:", "Now, going back to my original problem, here is how we can leverage these functions to find an elegant solution.", "Here is a table with data related to tasks. As you can see, I have a user to whom the task is assigned, Task ID, and the date when the task was created.", "The other table contains data about users (I\u2019ve created a dummy second user, just to mimic the real scenario):", "Two tables are connected via User Local column, as you can see in the following illustration:", "The most important step is to define a measure that will calculate \u201cmy\u201d tasks \u2014 and when I say \u201cmy\u201d, I\u2019m referring to a task for the user who is browsing the report.", "The following measure will help us to achieve this:", "Using KEEPFILTERS() function, we are modifying the default behavior of the CALCULATE function, as filter arguments defined within the CALCULATE function will replace all existing filters on the specified columns.", "Applying KEEPFILTERS, if the CALCULATE filters replace the current context, KEEPFILTERS will add filters to the current context.", "That being said, if I put this measure to a card visual, I\u2019m getting the following result:", "Since I\u2019m logged in as NIKOLAI\\nickk, I see that 5 tasks had been assigned to me, which is correct.", "Now, I want to enable my supervisor user to choose what he wants to see in the report: either all tasks or only those tasks assigned to her/him. To achieve this, I will use bookmarks and make some tweaking within my report page.", "The first step is to create a copy of the existing table and apply a filter on it, to display only rows where the value of My Tasks measure is greater than 0:", "I\u2019ve put this new table exactly over the old one, which shows all tasks. I will just switch the headings\u2019 background color so that users could be able to distinguish the tables based on colors also.", "And here comes the final polishing of my solution: I will put a button on the report canvas, to enable my user to dynamically switch between two different views. Or, even better, I will put two buttons one over the other to save the space on the report page, at the same time preserving the full functionality of the bookmark actions.", "The final step is to create bookmarks and define proper actions for each of them:", "The \u201cAll Tasks\u201d bookmark will have two visuals hidden (please see the illustration above), while the \u201cMy Tasks\u201d bookmark will apply similar logic, but in the opposite direction:", "Finally, let\u2019s define actions for our buttons so that we enable navigating between the two bookmarks we\u2019ve just created:", "And once we\u2019re done with that, here is how our final solution looks:", "Before we conclude, one important remark: in order for this trick to work in Power BI Service, you need to switch the function in My Tasks measure, and use User Service instead of User Local:", "At first glance, the original request seemed tricky and challenging. However, by applying some basic but useful DAX functions, and with little tweaking using bookmarks, we were able to provide our users with an elegant, yet effective solution.", "Become a member and read every story on Medium!", "Subscribe here to get more insightful data articles!", "Your home for data science.
