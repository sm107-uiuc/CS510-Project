After that, I hope you will feel comfortable to continue learning and improving your knowledge about this fascinating area of data science.", "The notebook with all the code is just here. Be my guest :)", "In python, the most popular library to do web scraping is Beautiful Soup. It helps us to get information from HTML files, and, as all web pages are written in HTML, we use a lot of what we call soup commands to extract the data we need.", "Regarding HTML, it\u2019s useful to have at least a basic knowledge about it, including the way it\u2019s written and its syntax, but I should warn you that it\u2019s not something that you can learn in just a couple of days, so I suggest you to learn it in parallel while your practice your scraping skills, as for me, personally, I learn things better when I see them being used in practical examples.", "Before diving in real world pages like Amazon, IMDB (for movies reviews), etc, I recommend you to have a look on Scraping Hub, where you can find pages created specifically for people who want to practice scraping. The reason why I recommend that is because giants like e-bay and others don\u2019t want people scraping their pages, as it can affect page\u2019s performance, so they create mechanisms that make scraping harder. For this tutorial, we will use a fictional book store, so let\u2019s check how it looks like:", "The focus today is on the basics, so our goal is to create a data frame with the title and price of each book, and that\u2019s exactly what we are going to do next, step-by-step.", "The first step is to figure out where on the website the information we want (book title and price) is stored. To do that, if using Chrome, click on the right button of your mouse and select \u201cInspect\u201d. All the HTML information will be displayed. Then, click on the arrow on the left upper corner of the inspection box and hoover it on the first book, so it will display the name of the class that store information about that item:", "All book information is stored under the \u201cproduct_pod\u201d class, which creates what we call a container, an object that stores a group of data. We will then create a soup object, simply using the command find_all() to get the information about each book on that page:", "The result shows that we retrieve info about 20 books. This is because on this page we have just 20 books displayed, in a universe of 1000 books. We will find a way to get info about all the books later. For now, we will focus in exploring the first book, to find out where the information we need, title and price, is stored.", "As mentioned, there is 20 containers available, all with the same structure. Let\u2019s explore the first one:", "The result are quite long, but please take a few minutes to read line by line. Can you figure out where are the title and the price?", "If you are new to HTML, think about it as a tree. The trunk of our tree here is the <article class=\u201dproduct_pod\u201d>, and everything comes after, inside that structure. You should have noticed that we have the title under a \u201ca\u201d element, which is also inside a \u201ch3\u201d element:", "To get this info, the syntax is similar for when you want to access a column into a data frame, but using the command get() to navigate inside the \u201ca\u201d element:", "Pretty straightforward, isn\u2019t it? What about the price? Well, the logic is always the same, but now we have a different case:", "Here we have the information stored inside a class on the element \u201cp\u201d. To access that, we need to use the find() function, which will need both the object and the class names as arguments:", "Voila! We have now the code we will need to get our data!", "Let\u2019s think about how many pages we need to scrap. Normally, online stores, like the one we have here, like to display products grouped in few elements in each page. In our case, on the first page we have the first 20 books displayed:", "Sometimes the total pages we have are displayed at the bottom of the page, so let\u2019s have a look:", "We have to scrap 50 pages and, as the link for each page is the same, we will need to change the page number on the url. With this knowledge, what we are going to do is:", "This is precisely what the code below does. Once again, I invite you to read carefully line by line. I tried to leave it as simple as possible because it\u2019s important that you understand how code is written, so you can write it in your own:", "After creating the lists, we just need to use our good old friend pandas to \u201czip\u201d the lists together and create the data frame we want:", "As result, we have a fresh baked data frame, ready to be used!", "I hope you get excited about the possibilities of web scraping. It can be very challenging as every website is different, and so are the strategies we need to perform in order to retrieve data on each one. But practicing the use of Beautifulsoup is, in my opinion, the best way to sharp your web scraping skills. As next steps, you could use the notebook of this project as a starting point, and try to add more information to your data frame, like:", "After you feel comfortable with the syntax, you could also try to improve the loop, to navigate inside each book page and get the product description. In any case, the knowledge you got here can be used pretty much anywhere on the web.", "Thank you very much for your time reading this article, see you on the next one!", "Your home for data science.
