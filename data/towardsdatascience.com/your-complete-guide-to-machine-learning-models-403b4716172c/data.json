Excessively hard tutorials, inadequate explanations, issues; \u201cMaybe I am not good enough,\u201d you think.", "At the end of that story, you\u2019ll recognize each step accurately. Let\u2019s begin!", "We will be using the scikit-learn library. In a minimalist definition, every Machine Learning process rotates around this library. Click here to know more.", "That is the first question and the most important one. If you choose the incorrect estimator (aka model), it will generate the wrong inferences. It commonly depends on your data and what you want to predict. The output dictates the rules here.", "If you need to predict several numerical outputs, like salaries, it will require a regression estimator. Different from the classification, regression estimators predict unknown numerical values with different ranges based on features. Also, the metrics aren\u2019t the same. Do not forget.", "Based on these features, how much will output?", "A classification estimator is useful whenever you need to predict if something is A or B (up to Z). Questions like: it\u2019s a cat or a raccoon? Which month it\u2019s more likely to occur? You elucidate those questions with a classification estimator.", "Based on these features, which type will output?", "The clustering algorithms are useful whenever you need to break your samples into combinations based on their features. Want to group your clients based on their purchase history? Use this kind of estimator.", "Based on these resources, how do they behave?", "All of them are from the cluster package.", "You will notice that there are more algorithms for particular uses like Control and Association, and so on. We use the first one if many features aren\u2019t valuable at all, so we clean our dataset. The others are for Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning, so we will not discuss it today.", "It\u2019s time to create our model. Please, for deep understanding, read all my keynotes inside the code.", "We will be using the Adult Census dataset provided by UCI, click here to take a look directly on the website. The reason behind it is the following:", "It is a classification problem, where we want to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year. We expect a boolean output where will trigger true if greater 50K or false if smaller. Let\u2019s see how our dataset looks.", "The first step of any Machine Learning project is to prepare your data. Fill empty values, delete unused columns, and so on. The first thing I want to do here is to put the right names for the columns.", "Now it\u2019s time to apply the necessary changes to our data. Remove incorrect symbols and convert columns with less than two unique values into numerical.", "Alright, now our data looks more friendly. During this phase, you need to answer the current doubts that appear. You need to entirely understand what is under the hood before starting managing your models, so don\u2019t be shy here.", "Question 1: Based on sex, what is the difference between age and hours per week working of the employees that receive more and less than 50K a year?", "Question 2: How spread our data is? There are outliers?", "Question 3: How does the type of work impact on the target?", "It\u2019s time, let\u2019s start to work with our data. First, we need to create splits. Train and test, more precisely.", "If you\u2019re working on a complex project, maybe it\u2019s needed to split your data into train, validation, and test. The difference here is that you just will get inference from the test data and tune your model by using the validation. I\u2019ve prepared a function to help you with that.", "During that phase, you apply any kind of modification to your data like normalization, standardization, encoding, imputing, and so on. Before going right to the code, let\u2019s see what I\u2019ll be doing here:", "I've added the LabelEncoder, but there is no need here, our target (y) is already encoded. Right, let\u2019s see how it looks like on code.", "Don\u2019t worry, the code above does nothing, we\u2019ll use it later.", "We use the base score to get a general insight of how good our model will predict. We will delete the model that gets the worst score before proceeding to the next step. I\u2019ll be using three different algorithms to create the model:", "Each model type has its own set of metrics. It\u2019s applied to output the model\u2019s precision. Let\u2019s take a look at the most known below.", "Keep in mind that they are needed for any project, but isn\u2019t complex at all. If in doubt just google it.", "After knowing how your initial models perform with the base set of parameters, now it\u2019s time to try to improve your settings. We will be using the cross-validation method, that tries out our parameters on different sections of our data.", "There is no mystery here! You just adjust each model parameter. Initially, we start with RandomizedSearchCV that will randomly choose one value for each parameter and try, looking for the pack that will deliver the best results.", "Notice that I have created a dictionary (line 4) that contains the parameter name followed by a list with possible values. That dictionary goes inside the RandomizedSearchCV, on the param_distributions parameter (line 19).", "Depending on how complex is your project, you\u2019ll need to force search for improvements. Different from the randomized search, that randomly chooses one value for each parameter, GridSearchCV will try then all.", "Remember that it doesn\u2019t matter how much parameters you pass into the random search, but here you can\u2019t exaggerate, so pay attention.", "The more time you use by looking for improvements, the better your model becomes.", "After tuning and evaluating your model, you\u2019ll get the best possible set of parameters for your problem. Below the expectation? Try another model. Doing really well? Maybe it\u2019s an overfitting problem, let\u2019s see it below.", "This is one more bonus section. You need to know what problems your model can face and how to get through it.", "You\u2019ve selected the best algorithm for your problem, learned how to tune your parameters, and finally how to prevent some problems. We\u2019ve also talked about metrics to evaluate your models. Shortly, you learned a lot so far. Now you can create the final model, the one that will go to production.", "I hope that you have liked this content and can apply your new knowledge with mastery! If you want to keep learning something interesting every day, I\u2019ll be really happy if you follow me!", "Also, you can check my Github profile. I\u2019ve been working with some Data Science projects for a while. All key concepts are there to learn and reuse!", "Your home for data science.
