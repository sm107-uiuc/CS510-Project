My most wanted superpower at those times would definitely be telekinesis, because once you are in place for feeding e.g., if you don\u2019t have all the things you need with you and someone to help you, depending on the baby\u2019s mood, you are very much doomed to starring at the thing you are trying to reach for and is right out of your grasp, the wall, or worse, the tv.

An optimistic estimation :)", "Superpower I wish I had\u00a0: telekinesis", "After the first few weeks of craziness, idleness and sleeplessness, I thought I should figure out how to make the most of these quiet hours, whenever my hands are tied and I cannot do anything but stay still\u00a0and\u00a0wait.", "I took up writing on Medium to better understand the things I know a few months ago, when I was about 7 months pregnant. I quite enjoyed the process, but at the moment it is not really feasible for me to open my laptop and start the writing and the researh. To get back to this, I am trying to make use of Medium\u2019s mobile app whenever I get a few minutes here and there. The editor is almost the same as that of a browser and it seems to work quite well on mobile. I haven\u2019t found a way to add captions or delete images up to now though.", "Another thing I needed was to either work on existing code, e.g. fix bugs or add features or create new things. This means I need a way to get\u00a0my code on my phone, so the easiest and most reasonable way to do it is though versioning tools, git and possibly github. I\u2019ve found Termux to be of great help! It took a few tries and some searching to figure out where to save the repositories so that they are visible to other applications\u00a0though:", "Most of my work these days is in Python, so I needed something to help me work with Python files. I don\u2019t expect to run my projects on my mobile phone\u00a0of\u00a0course, I\u2019d be waisting precious hours\u00a0otherwise.

However, with no suggestions for possible corrections. Autocomplete suggestions begin when you start writing the import,\u00a0e.g. import traceback, which is useful. But the most important thing is that there are suggestions for the imported module, the traceback module\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0case.", "I am currently trying out the paid version and so far so good, besides the difficulty switching between files of a complex project.", "An alternative to Pydroid 3. I haven\u2019t had the time to explore it adequately but, with a first look, the kind of annoying text wrapping is not there and the code looks as it should. However, it seems to lack autoconplete and I couldn\u2019t easily navigate to the Projects folder, but again, not enough testing up to now. I am thinking of using it to view the code more easily than in Pydroid, but we\u2019ll see.", "I find the situation I am in a great opportunity to do some refreshing on old stuff, like algorithms and data structures, and learning new things like deep learning with PyTorch etc. That is, when I am not frantically searching and researching about every little thing related to babies and what is normal or not for a newborn\u00a0\u263a", "I didn\u2019t really spent much time searching, I just went with the app that currently has the best reviews.
