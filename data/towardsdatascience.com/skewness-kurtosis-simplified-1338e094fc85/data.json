What if a process is under the influence of assignable/significant causes as well? This is surely going to modify the shape of the distribution (distort) and that\u2019s when we need a measure like skewness to capture it. Below is a normal distribution visual, also known as a bell curve. It is a symmetrical graph with all measures of central tendency in the middle.", "But what if we encounter an asymmetrical distribution, how do we detect the extent of asymmetry? Let\u2019s see visually what happens to the measures of central tendency when we encounter such graphs.", "Notice how these central tendency measures tend to spread when the normal distribution is distorted. For the nomenclature just follow the direction of the tail \u2014 For the left graph since the tail is to the left, it is left-skewed (negatively skewed) and the right graph has the tail to the right, so it is right-skewed (positively skewed).", "How about deriving a measure that captures the horizontal distance between the Mode and the Mean of the distribution? It\u2019s intuitive to think that the higher the skewness, the more apart these measures will be. So let\u2019s jump to the formula for skewness now:", "Division by Standard Deviation enables the relative comparison among distributions on the same standard scale. Since mode calculation as a central tendency for small data sets is not recommended, so to arrive at a more robust formula for skewness we will replace mode with the derived calculation from the median and the mean.", "Replacing the value of mode in the formula of skewness, we get:", "What is Kurtosis and how do we capture it?", "Think of punching or pulling the normal distribution curve from the top, what impact will it have on the shape of the distribution? Let\u2019s visualize:", "So there are two things to notice \u2014 The peak of the curve and the tails of the curve, Kurtosis measure is responsible for capturing this phenomenon. The formula for kurtosis calculation is complex (4th moment in the moment-based calculation) so we will stick to the concept and its visual clarity. A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3 and is called mesokurtic. Distributions greater than 3 are called leptokurtic and less than 3 are called platykurtic. So the greater the value more the peakedness. Kurtosis ranges from 1 to infinity. As the kurtosis measure for a normal distribution is 3, we can calculate excess kurtosis by keeping reference zero for normal distribution. Now excess kurtosis will vary from -2 to infinity.", "Excess Kurtosis for Normal Distribution = 3\u20133 = 0", "The lowest value of Excess Kurtosis is when Kurtosis is 1 = 1\u20133 = -2", "The topic of Kurtosis has been controversial for decades now, the basis of kurtosis all these years has been linked with the peakedness but the ultimate verdict is that outliers (fatter tails) govern the kurtosis effect far more than the values near the mean (peak).", "So we can conclude from the above discussions that the horizontal push or pull distortion of a normal distribution curve gets captured by the Skewness measure and the vertical push or pull distortion gets captured by the Kurtosis measure. Also, it is the impact of outliers that dominate the kurtosis effect which has its roots of proof sitting in the fourth-order moment-based formula.
