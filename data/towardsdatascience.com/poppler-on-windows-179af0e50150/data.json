So, naturally, if you want to use Poppler and its associated packages, we need to bridge the gap.", "Let\u2019s visit google and see what our options are\u2026", "A quick Google (StackOverflow) search reveals that there are many other people having this problem and they are still looking for solutions.", "Poppler and Python\u2019s PDF-libraries, which leverage Linux-utilities, don\u2019t play well with Windows.", "When we look for solutions, many of them are outdated, ineffective, too difficult, etc\u2026", "Of the purposed solutions, one solution appears to work well.", "Actually, because of how powerful Windows Subsystem for Linux is, it\u2019s a great solution for other problems which require Linux tools on a Windows machine.", "Windows Subsystem for Linux is a compatibility layer for Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10. It recently entered version two (WSL 2) and introduced a real Linux kernel. To put it plainly, WSL makes it feel like you\u2019re working on a real Linux machine (and you are).", "In this section, we will, in five short steps, install and setup WSL.

Note, mine is already installed, so you have to do some imagining here.", "Enter WSL through a terminal like this one in VS Code. Notice that, once you enter WSL, the terminal prompt will change. You are now operating within a Linux machine! Exciting!", "Conduct the following commands within the WSL-prompt. Note that, you can ignore some of the steps that deal with Tesseract-OCR and PyTesseract.

Although, you will need a PDF to mess with.", "This code works by converting a PDF to JPG. Then, it conducts OCR and writes the OCR-results to an output-file.", "That\u2019s it. You are certified Poppler-On-Windows.", "Enjoy the spoils of war! You have gained some seriously new and powerful skills. You are well on your way to becoming a more flexible developer (if you aren\u2019t already).", "It\u2019s so important to experiment with these new skills and solidify your understanding. True understanding comes with experience.", "I built an OCR application to help document the historical work of emeritus professor and famous computer scientist, Dr. Kenneth E. Batcher. It uses a PDF to image tool for JPEG-conversion. Then, it does OCR on the image and writes the results to an output file.
