My name is Philip Wilkinson, and as the title suggests, I have just finished my first week of my PhD at University College London (UCL). My research is focused on a very particular topic of developing spatial interaction models, or finding alternative models, which can essentially be used to understand and predict store revenue based on the existing distribution of the population and other factors. This specific topic is part of a much broader history of spatial interaction models, which while being used in this way have also been used to understand migration patterns, predict the impact of new transport infrastructure, and understand how the creation of new jobs may affect the local demand for houses. It is also a topic that has recently recieved a new breath of life due to new and large datasets becoming available, along with an increase in computing power that allows for larger and more accurate models. It is an area that I got interested in mainly during my Master\u2019s course of Smart Cities and Urban Analytics, also at UCL, where one of our modules centred around the history and development of these models. This focused primarily on predicting how the job distribution in London would change in response to changes in income or dramatic increases in the cost to travel, but I was excited to see what else these models could do and how better data and software can allow us to better understand the built environment around us.", "So what was the experience of my first week? Well, primarily I would say it feels like I have just been thrown in at the deep end of a very large pool (As I am only 5 foot 6 a deep pool doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be that deep) or that I have just started at the bottom of a very large mountain that will take me at least three years to climb (my funding runs out after three years so that is the aim at least). I would say this is primarily because, while wading into these waters, or starting at the base of the hill, the problem and challenge of completing my PhD is very much looming right in front of me. In this time I realise I am going to have to continue to develop my coding skills to a level where I can deal with extremely large datasets and potentially create new software to present and run the models developed, read hundreds and hundreds of papers in and around the topic of the history of retailing, retail location, e-commerce, spatial interaction models and agent based models, effectively absorb and understand all that knowledge, and produce a final product for my sponsor and around 100,000 words for my PhD thesis. If that prospect doesn\u2019t scare anyone starting a PhD then the enormity of the task has surely not become real yet.", "Of course, while I am scared, anxious and worried about how I am going to manage all that knowledge and the creation of all these outputs over the next three years, I am thoroughly looking forward to the challenge, and there are several reasons for that. Firstly, a PhD has always been something I had been interested in doing, and while this was not my original plan after having taken a job offer (only for Corona to put a spanner in those works) I readily took the opportunity when a project that I was interested in presented itself. This is something I hope will make my parents and grandparents very proud once I have completed it given that they have always encouraged me to pursue my education as far as I possibly can. Secondly, it presents an opportunity to continue my academic and personal development over the next three years, completing all of the tasks mentioned previously, and learning a whole lot in the process, whether that is through the work that I will be doing or through societies I join or people that I meet, I\u2019m sure I will have a lot more knowledge by the time I finish, which is something I can then take with me into my next steps. This is especially so given that I will be working within a discipline that I am interested in, applying data and technology-driven solutions to our understanding of the built environment. Thirdly, although work is currently remote, I genuinely enjoy being part of my department at UCL, due to the people that I have met already (including many incredible lecturers and tutors that have helped me to finish the Master\u2019s last year and apply for the PhD) and look forward to meeting in the future, and the world-leading work that they are undertaking which presents a whole lot of opportunity to learn from some incredibly intelligent and interesting people. This includes being a part of the sponsoring company who although I have yet to be fully integrated into, I am looking forward to doing so in the future.", "So with all that said, what have I actually done during my first week? Well this has started off with some initial exploratory reading in the area of spatial interaction models, which definitely fed into all of those feelings on anxiousness and fear due to the recognition of how much there is to cover. So far I have only covered around 14 academic papers so far in terms of both reading and making notes on, which is basically me dipping my toes into all that I could read and is a lot less than the amount that I wanted to get done in the first week, but it is a start. This small amount covered has primarily been because I have had to focus quite intently on each paper to see what they are modelling, how they are doing so and what their main findings are and hence what I can take away from them, helping to inform me where I should read next. This should hopefully get easier as I read more and more papers and I realise what I don\u2019t need to read or what I need to read more in-depth as I discover what exactly I want to focus on. This was also balanced alongside a teaching assistant opportunity within the department that will run through my first full term, covering the Python programming language, alongside two other teaching assistants and two lecturers who are leading the course. This definitely ate into much more time than I thought it would but it has shown me that I should be expecting to learn a lot from this at the same time so it is also very beneficial in terms of developing my coding skills. So these two main tasks occupied most of my time this week in terms of generating my work product.", "However, alongside working, treating it so far as a 9am-5pm job (although usually a 8am to 4:30pm currently unless work tips over further) there was also a virtual departmental show and tell which showcased some of the exciting work taking place within the department, along with the opportunity to meet with other academics, PhDs and Master\u2019s students to get to know them a bit better. We also had a small virtual meet up for the new PhDs in the department over a coffee/tea which was good to see how everyone was getting along, make sure we were keeping in contact and helping each other if we needed anything and will become a regular feature as well. Both of these were certainly needed due to working from home and not seeing many people, so it was good to keep in contact with people alongside starting the PhD. Finally, last night I managed to get back into playing Fives, a sport I have sorely missed over this time, with all the precautions in place and being outdoors it was good to get some much-needed exercise and get back into the more welcoming community and catchu-up with a few people I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. This shows that a PhD isn\u2019t just work work work, there is some time for fun (or at least so far anyway)!", "So overall a mixed bag in my first week, feelings of both fear and excitement for what lays ahead, but that was to be expected. I feel simultaneously like a lot has been accomplished but also that a lot has not so I will see how next week goes. It has been good to get a start to this long journey and I am excited for what lays ahead. For next week the aim is to settle down a bit more, get stuck into the teaching assistant position, produce my first piece of work for my supervisor and continue to read more into the world of spatial interaction models!", "I am hoping to continue to develop these thoughts, feelings and actions that I have/do over the life of my PhD through a series of blogs published on a weekly basis. While recognising that everyone\u2019s PhD is different, before starting I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what a PhD would contain so I hope that these blog series would illuminate the process for anyone seeking to do a PhD in the future!", "CASA PhD student, Spatial Analysis, Data Science and Software Engineering. 400,000+ views.
