It might be tempting just to throw everything you know at it to see what will work but in reality (as with everything) having patience will pay off in the long run. That\u2019s why Data Scientists have developed various frameworks designed to help manage data projects and provide structure. Most of these frameworks follow similar steps that will be outlined throughout this post.", "To give a real-life example I will be referring to a project I\u2019ve been working on to compare Airbnb data from Seattle & Boston in an attempt to extract useful business insights. Following the steps in this post will give you a place to start and hopefully allow you to concentrate on the underlying data.", "Before performing any task it is important to know what the objective of the analysis is or what problem you are aiming to solve. This may seem obvious but you\u2019ll be surprised by the number of times someone will ask you to do something without a clear objective. To begin with, you should question why the task should be performed, find out the stakeholder\u2019s aims and understand the key performance indicators (KPI\u2019s). It\u2019s important to keep these things in mind throughout the project so that you don\u2019t lose sight of what is important.", "In my case, with the Airbnb data, the objective was to recommend users a listing price based on various factors (e.g. location, amenities or size). The business case for this is simple; users with better prices wouldn\u2019t undervalue their property resulting in lost revenue, or overvalue them losing out on bookings. To help keep me focused during the project I came up with some short business goals to answer on the way to reaching my final objective:", "Breaking down a task into business questions, small targets or milestones can help keep focus making sure you achieve the core business objective.", "It\u2019s now time to dip your toe in and see what data you have available. A good place to start is to think about what data points you may need to achieve your goal and how this goal aligns with your current data. In the Airbnb project, I needed my dependent variable: the price that I was aiming to predict. In order to create my model I also needed my independent variables e.g. review scores, locations, guest numbers and amenities.", "Next, it\u2019s good to check the quality of the data. I did this by looking for NaN\u2019s, simple errors and checking to make sure that all the datasets could be merged. This last bit sounds trivial but if both my dependent and the independent variables had different identifiers the data would have been useless. Finally, creating initial visualisations at this point will start helping with an overall understanding of the data.", "The histogram above shows the spread of prices for each of the Airbnb markets. Seattle prices are on average lower with a smaller spread when compared with Boston. This indicates regional variations that may need to be taken into account later on in the project. It displays that on average property prices in Boston will be much higher than a property in Seattle.", "After rummaging around in the data you may find out one of several outcomes: you have everything you need to perform the analysis, more data is needed or the project isn\u2019t feasible as the data required is not available.", "Now that we have all the data we need, it\u2019s time to process it to the required format for all the analysis and modelling ahead. This is normally the most time-consuming part of the process (60\u201380% of your time) and is likely to be intertwined with any analysis/modelling as your data needs evolve.", "The first thing to do is to apply some cleaning to the data. This can involve dealing with NaN\u2019s, formatting dates, merging files, stripping strings, editing prices and much more. At this point in the Airbnb project, I made some basic functions for cleaning and merging my data. I would strongly recommend doing this as you can add them to a package and use them again multiple times throughout the project.", "The next part will depend on what the project is ultimately trying to achieve. I did some basic analysis to learn more about the Airbnb data before performing more cleaning. For a lot of projects, some more advanced processing will be needed especially to perform Machine Learning (ML) tasks. Examples of these are encoding categorical variables, running NLP (Natural Language Processing) on text-based data, or performing PCA (Principle Component Analysis) to reduce dimensionality. The final step before any modelling would be to split the data between training and testing datasets, as this allows you to keep some data for model tuning & evaluation.", "This is the section most blog posts, research papers & client-facing presentations will focus on. However, if you\u2019re lucky it will take up a maximum 10\u201320% of your time. In this section, we create machine learning models, insightful visualisations or perform projections.", "In my project, I did some analysis looking to address my first business question: Does the price vary seasonally across both Airbnb markets?", "The seasonal trends turned out to be rather surprising as both markets varied to a similar degree throughout the year. They both had a seasonal low towards the start of the year and a high around August. This seasonal change can be used to adjust the final ML model to get a better prediction of price throughout the year.", "After the analysis above I moved on to the core modelling problem with the Airbnb dataset. For this, I performed a regression analysis to predict the listing prices based on my dependent variables. The regression model used was an ensemble method known as Random Forests (details of this method can be found here). Model training is shown below:", "When optimising any form of modelling it is important to make sure to validate testing with solid performance metrics. These will vary depending on the business case. In the case of my regression analysis, I used MAE (Mean Absolute Error) as it doesn\u2019t overweight large errors like some other methods such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). This is useful for predicting Airbnb prices as we would prefer a more general model even if some of the outliers are predicted wrong.", "After the model has been made and optimised everything needs to be checked, tested and evaluated before anything can be deployed.", "Evaluation of your model/analysis is one of the most important steps of the process. This is to assess how well the model or insights can be generalised to new datasets. The first step in this process is to use the testing data that was set aside prior to modelling to ensure the models aren\u2019t overfitting during parameterisation.", "Another important part of my model evaluation was to see how each of the variables was influencing the model prediction. This is called feature importance and helps answer my second business question: Which Airbnb listing variables will have the biggest impact on price?", "From the above plot, the most important features influencing price are (as you would expect) property size indicators such as bedrooms, bathrooms and guests. Surprising features that drive the model are whether the property had a First Aid Kit or Carbon Monoxide Detector; these could be an indicator of lower-priced properties that are boosting their amenities. Another key takeaway from performing feature importance is that some variables have a negative influence on the model and so should be removed prior to modelling.", "The final step to evaluate how the modelling performed was to apply the process to another market and see how the results compared. In my case, this helped to answer the overall business question: Can I predict prices based on the market, variables & seasonality?", "The results above show the actual Airbnb prices against the predicted prices. The line represents perfect predictions and the distance from the line to each point is the error of the prediction. On the whole, the model has predicted the general trend well, except for outlier properties. These outliers may have low bookings or have other reasons for why the price varies from the trend (quality of the Airbnb for instance). Overall the model predicts prices well enough to provide recommendations to users and so achieves the core business objective.", "By looking at your model validation metrics and your KPI\u2019s you can ultimately decide if you have been successful in achieving your business goals.", "Finally, it's time to put everything you\u2019ve created into practice. This could be deploying a model for an external process (think Netflix recommendation engine) or adjusting internal procedures based on insights from the analysis. For the Airbnb project, this would entail implementing the price recommendation on the hosting page based on the amenities provided by a user.", "If you think the project ends here you\u2019re sadly mistaken, in the real world once you deploy a project there\u2019s endless improvements, updates and bug fixes to attend to. In terms of conclusion, the best you can do is hope that you get a new project to focus your attention on between all of the iterations!", "In summary, the main steps to go through in any project are:", "The framework above largely follows the CRISP-DM process with added extra comments from other frameworks. This is largely seen as the industry standard when it comes to performing data science projects and should provide a strong foundation for running any data project.", "There are several data frameworks that this post has taken inspiration from beyond CRISP-DM. Here are a few examples in case you want to google or look into them further:", "Currently, I\u2019m a Data Scientist at the ASO Co (An App Marketing company). For any further info on the project or a look into how I performed in analysis please find links to my various social platforms linked below:", "All of the data in this project was provided through Airbnb on Kaggle and used in conjunction with my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.", "Your home for data science.
