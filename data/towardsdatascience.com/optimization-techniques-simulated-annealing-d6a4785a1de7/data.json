Physical Annealing is the process of heating up a material until it reaches an annealing temperature and then it will be cooled down slowly in order to change the material to a desired structure. When the material is hot, the molecular structure is weaker and is more susceptible to change. When the material cools down, the molecular structure is harder and is less susceptible to change.", "Another important part of this analogy is the following equation from Thermal Dynamics:", "This equation calculates the probability that the Energy Magnitude will increase. We can calculate this value given some Energy Magnitude and some temperature t along with the Boltzmann constant k.", "Simulated Annealing (SA) mimics the Physical Annealing process but is used for optimizing parameters in a model. This process is very useful for situations where there are a lot of local minima such that algorithms like Gradient Descent would be stuck at.", "In problems like the one above, if Gradient Descent started at the starting point indicated, it would be stuck at the local minima and not be able to reach the global minima.", "Step 1: We first start with an initial solution s = S\u2080. This can be any solution that fits the criteria for an acceptable solution. We also start with an initial temperature t = t\u2080.", "Step 2: Setup a temperature reduction function alpha. There are usually 3 main types of temperature reduction rules:", "Each reduction rule reduces the temperature at a different rate and each method is better at optimizing a different type of model. For the 3rd rule, beta is an arbitrary constant.", "Step 3: Starting at the initial temperature, loop through n iterations of Step 4 and then decrease the temperature according to alpha. Stop this loop until the termination conditions are reached. The termination conditions could be reaching some end temperature, reaching some acceptable threshold of performance for a given set of parameters, etc. The mapping of time to temperature and how fast the temperature decreases is called the Annealing Schedule.", "Step 4: Given the neighbourhood of solutions N(s), pick one of the solutions and calculate the difference in cost between the old solution and the new neighbour solution. The neighbourhood of a solution are all solutions that are close to the solution. For example, the neighbourhood of a set of 5 parameters might be if we were to change one of the five parameters but kept the remaining four the same.", "Step 5: If the difference in cost between the old and new solution is greater than 0 (the new solution is better), then accept the new solution. If the difference in cost is less than 0 (the old solution is better), then generate a random number between 0 and 1 and accept it if it\u2019s under the value calculated from the Energy Magnitude equation from before.", "In the Simulated Annealing case, the equation has been altered to the following:", "Where the delta c is the change in cost and the t is the current temperature.", "The P calculated in this case is the probability that we should accept the new solution.", "Due to the way the probability is calculated, when the temperature is higher, is it more likely that the algorithm accepts a worse solution. This promotes Exploration of the search space and allows the algorithm to more likely travel down a sub-optimal path to potentially find a global maximum.", "When the temperature is lower, the algorithm is less likely or will not to accept a worse solution. This promotes Exploitation which means that once the algorithm is in the right search space, there is no need to search other sections of the search space and should instead try to converge and find the global maximum.", "This is a sample boilerplate implementation of Simulated Annealing.", "Simulated Annealing is a popular algorithm used to optimize a multi-parameter model that can be implemented relatively quickly. Simulated Annealing can be very computation heavy if it\u2019s tasked with many iterations but it is capable of finding a global maximum and not stuck at local minima.", "Your home for data science.
