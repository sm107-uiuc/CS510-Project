Will their own computers replace Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg any time soon?", "Since I am a CEO building Sat-Nav (that\u2019s short for satellite navigation) tools for managers, and with Sat-Navs being the first step towards self-driving cars, these days I often get asked the Skynet question \u2014 will scientists ever enable companies to be run by robots?", "The answer to that is a definite no. Here\u2019s why.", "Sure, artificial intelligence has come on in leaps and bounds in the last 30 years. However, we are not even close to a singularity event where machines can replicate or surpass human reasoning.", "At its heart, the new data science term is a noble name for a broad set of number crunching activities that were mostly invented long ago. They recently received a new lease of life from being applied with greatly enhanced technical devices: more data, more processing power, more reasonable outcomes at a cheaper price.", "As the cost of storing and processing data went down, the volume of data collected went up: very simple law of supply & demand, or you can call it the Price Elasticity of Data if you will. Price goes down, volume goes up. This means that the new data has lower value, compared to the old, smaller data. Pure economics. And, someone will then have to do something with all this stuff. Enter data science.", "Data science is mostly old science; remember expert systems, anyone? This science has severe technical limitations even today, in spite of the hype:", "The best SatNav can even drive your car, but not tell you where to go.", "That\u2019s an awful lot of functionality that machines are structurally missing out on. And that is exactly the point when it comes to the artificial intelligence vs. human debate \u2014 machines do what they are programmed to do, while people can be creative.", "Asking the right questions is the ultimate human ability, only a pity that schools today are teaching how to answer questions instead, which is becoming an increasingly irrelevant skill.", "Is that the reason why we are freaking out unnecessarily?", "Currently, the debate on artificial intelligence is being shaped by self-driving cars. As Uber, Google, and Tesla race to get the first self-driving car on the market, people assume this is just the thin end of the wedge and will very quickly lead to machines running a company, or even the planet.", "Managing a company requires complex skills to navigate ambiguity and interpret human sentiment \u2014 it\u2019s often \u2018messy\u2019 and unquantifiable. Defining a target will eventually change the market and requires defining a new target, a property called reflexivity.", "Reflexivity refers to circular relationships between cause and effect, especially as embedded in human belief structures. A reflexive relationship is bidirectional with both the cause and the effect affecting one another in a relationship in which neither can be assigned as causes or effects.", "Self-driving cars only need to read physical things \u2014 road conditions, other cars, pedestrians \u2014 using measurable data like location and speed. Even then, there could be \u2018black swan events\u2019 that programmers hadn\u2019t taken into account, however there is a finite number of these and eventually they will be mapped out.", "Structurally once a car can drive that\u2019s it; whereas management actions will cause a shift in the market paradigm, and the full loop requires the machine to start from scratch once again.", "In 2012, in Melbourne, Australia, a truck carrying sheep crashed on an overpass and this resulted in hundreds of sheep raining down on the freeway below.", "While a human would overcome the cognitive dissonance of flying sheep, you could just picture a confused Uber robot uttering that old sci-fi chestnut, does not compute!", "That is an extreme example of an unforeseen event. It may help to laugh a bit and illustrate why machines won\u2019t be taking over companies anytime soon. Plenty of sheep fly around in the competitive game of management.", "Of course, just like a lot of manual labor jobs were replaced by machinery during the industrial revolution, many administrative functions can be transferred to machines. However, the more creative and high-level thinking roles will remain in human hands and strengthen.", "The more data is used, the more leadership is required to steer the course.", "This AI/human interplay has been the subject of much research at carmaker Volkswagen in recent years. Chief Information Officer Martin Hoffman explained how the company had adapted the checklist for autonomous cars to the field of \u201crobotic enterprise\u201d \u2014 using auto-adaptive algorithms in corporate functions and processes.", "To sum up matters with a practical example: imagine the automation of the warehouse reordering process, which is one I personally know well. Today, we have systems that can put the supply-chain on autopilot EXCEPT that the strategy still needs to be set by humans:", "Volkswagen has identified 5 levels of AI control from Level 1 (Manual), where humans make all the business decisions, through to Level 5 (Fully automated), where there is no human input at all.", "Typically machines excel at Level 2 (Assisted) on the Volkswagen scale: the machine offers a recommendation but a human makes the final decision. Machines do not replace human judgment, only they augment it, much as our mobile phones today already augment our brains every day.", "PS I regularly write about Business Science.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "The learnings and benefits of the \u2018science of billions\u2019: what if you could access more data than Amazon?
