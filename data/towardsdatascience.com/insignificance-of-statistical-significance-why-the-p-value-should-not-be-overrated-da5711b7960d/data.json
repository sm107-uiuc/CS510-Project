What does that even mean? Let me introduce you to a practice in the scientific industry that is deeply debated and still used to answer research questions. Simply put, it roughly goes like this: If you run a model and your computer gives you a p less than .05, your results have reached the holy grail of being statistically significant and therefore are more likely to be published. On the other hand, if p is over .05, your observations do not seem to deviate from what was already known. However, this is probably a dangerous way of going about making conclusions from data and arouses the temptation to use this tool almost mechanically. This practice is so hotly discussed, that the American Statistical Association (ASA) published a statement regarding p-values to shed some light on the issue (Wasserstein & Lazar, 2016). Some experts even go this far saying that the p-value is the reason why most research findings are false (Ioannidis, 2018) and make its misuse responsible for a reproducibility crisis in research (Peng, 2015). There is a whole guide to misinterpretations around this concept because the p-value is far from being intuitive, foolproof and straightforward (Greenland et al., 2016) \u2014 for amateurs as well as researchers. Thus, it is worth getting a grasp of the underlying concept. Therefore, I would like to give a you a gentle and basic introduction to the most famous and yet most confusing concept in statistics: null hypothesis significance testing.", "Nowadays, we have huge amount of readily available data around us. Forbes Magazine suggested in an article from 2018 that the internet alone is creating 2.5 quintillion (!!!) bytes daily which led the last two years account for 90% of the world\u2019s data alone [Link]. This sentence is definitely worth reading again. You may have also realised that the number of Data Scientists is growing, although their efforts to analyse these data cannot make up for these huge amounts. In addition, there is a long tradition in science to use an approach called null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) to answer their research questions. So, given that we have the opportunity to analyse data to satisfy our curiosity and inform our decision-making, we should know what to use key statistical concepts for to arrive at conclusions that do not stand on a too wobbly ground. Look at the following questions:", "These are a tiny fraction of questions we ask ourselves because an answer may affect the way we shape our life, teach our children or develop new technologies \u2014 as I said, to just name a few. All of these can only reliably answered using data to make inferences beyond your own nose. Being a psychology graduate, I have learnt that a majority of people hate everything that comes close to statistics and evokes considerable feelings of anxiety as soon as it comes to mathematical formulas. To your reassurance, I do not want to include any math here. It will be worth it in the end, I promise.", "So, here is my attempt to explain what statistical inference is about and why it is not as straightforward \u2014 for this purpose, I would like to invite you to a little journey to space. Do you want to join?", "An imaginary case study \u2014 study extraterrestrial life in space", "Imagine you are part of a research team who has discovered nonhuman intelligence on plant X that does not seem to be dangerous to humans. Eager to find out more about this species, you instruct your colleagues to collect data about their some of their main characteristics. Apart from cellular samples and behavioural observations, you send a bunch of space-proof robots to collect data from their physical height as they have approximately the same height as humans. The glibberish texture of their skin makes you name them glibglobs in the lab \u2014 just like some creatures are called in your favourite cartoon series named Rick and Morty. Now your colleagues have noticed that glibglobs have different sexes \u2014 one of them being a bit taller than the other. As females are usually smaller in height than males on earth, you are starting to wonder: Is this sex-dependent difference maybe a universal pattern in our universe? Okay \u2014 such a big question, so let us make it more specific: Are glibs smaller than their globs? Or has this been just a random observation by one of your colleagues?", "As you have collected 100 height samples for each of the sexes, you start to study this phenomenon visually and ask yourself if there really is a fundamental difference between glibs and globs. Looking at the plots, you can see globs are on average taller than glibs, but there is also a lot of variation going on. In some case, glibs are even taller than globs \u2014 so maybe there is even no difference between the sexes if you would have the resources to measure every glibglob on whole planet X. How can you tell how likely your data is assuming there is maybe even no difference in height at all?", "After you have checked whether the data is appropriate for the test that you would like to use to answer this question, you run a computer program to compare the means of both sexes. There are two possible scenarios:", "1. The true difference in height is equal to 0 in the population.", "2. The true difference in height is NOT equal to 0 in the population.", "You can imagine the first hypothesis (called \u201enull-hypothesis\u201c) as a kind of default in significance testing \u2014 that is probably the most confusing thing at first sight because you are actually interested in the second one. Now imagine a part of your computer program is a critical sparring partner which suggests that there is no difference. Rational as it is, it suggests that chance is operating alone. Still you assume that there might be something different going on, backed up with some real glibglob data and present your alternative to this view. Let\u2019s debate! To get a bit closer to the answer, the computer runs some calculations for you. It now \u201cpretends\u201d to run the same experiment over and over again and thereby generates lots and lots of simulated samples of imaginary glib glob data. These fake samples represent how the height difference could look like if glibs and globs actually had the same height, allowing for some random variation. Now the computer generates a summary statistic (e.g., a t-statistic) for a) your observed sample data as well as for b) each simulated sample (the fake data).", "Experience shows that as long as we have many observations, a lot of phenomena in nature approximate a bell-shaped distribution, called normal distribution. This also applies to the fake data of theoretically possible glibglob height differences: If you take a random sample out of the fake data, you will more likely observe height differences around zero, allowing for a little random variation. On the other hand, it will be less likely to observe extreme differences that just occur by chance. Still not sure about your hypothesis that there could be a difference in height, your computer finally compares this observed summary statistic against the summary statistic of the fake samples it has generated earlier and tells you where your data would fall onto the distribution of fake samples that are completely random. Giving you a p-value < 0.01, the computer must admit that your sample makes his default state (\u201ethere is no difference in glibglob height!\u201c) look a bit unusual. Why? Because there seems to be unlikely to observe this or even more extreme data when assuming that chance was operating alone.", "The p-value estimates the probability to observe such or more extreme data given that there is actually no effect in nature \u2014 assuming that your model suits the data and you stick to your original intentions.", "So, what can that p-value tell me? And what not?", "Congratulations for coming this far. Look at that lengthy definition. Can that p-value now answer your original question?", "Nope. Confusing, right? Although this is actually the question we are interested in, this question can only answered using Bayesian Statistics which encompasses a completely different way of thinking and mathematical approach (Dienes & Mclatchie, 2018; Kruschke & Liddell, 2018a, 2018b; Vandekerckhove, Rouder, & Kruschke, 2018). If people using traditional significance testing claim that their hypothesis is true because null hypothesis was rejected, this should raise some red flags to you. Taken by itself, a small p-value does indicate that for now, the data seems to be incompatible with a scenario in which there is actually no effect to begin with. But it cannot tell you if your proposed alternative (e.g., \u201ethere is a sex-dependent difference in glibglob height greater than zero.\u201c) is likely to be true because it does not incorporate any prior knowledge (e.g., how likely is this alternative in the first place?) \u2014 this would have been the posterior probability of the alternative which got updated by our fresh glibglob data, but this is beyond the scope of the current article.", "2. Can you tell your colleagues that the data seems a bit interesting considering the claim that there is NO true difference in height in glibglobs?", "Yes, you can. If you have checked the preconditions required by the model and strictly kept your sampling intentions constant during the experiment (e.g., stopped measuring after collecting a predefined sample size regardless of the outcome of your experiment), this height phenomenon is maybe worth investigating further. Given that nobody has measured these creatures before and your experiment is thus quite exploratory, this result provides a preliminary starting point for ongoing research on the topic.", "3. Can you tell your colleagues that the results are practically meaningful?", "Nope. You have no idea if the difference in height between glibglobs serves any role in their life on planet X and cannot even tell solely based on that p-value whether that difference is equally large in magnitude like the one observed in humans. Likewise, you cannot tell if you have asked the right question. Maybe there are some characteristics of glibglobs that are way more fascinating studying which you have not considered so far?", "Now you may feel a bit disappointed. You have come such a long way to planet X, measured a bunch of glibglobs and still know so little about them \u2014 it seems to be just the start of an even longer journey of various research teams taking a closer look at that foreign species. Knowing that you are part of the first research team studying glibglobs, you are still tapping in the dark, even if you have a tiny little signal pointing towards a specific direction.", "Okay \u2014 this story probably seems to be a bit far-fetched and oversimplified. Nevertheless, it hopefully illustrates the traditional approach towards statistical significance in a concise manner and understandable way. If you are still struggling, don\u2019t worry: Even scientists or health professionals usually have trouble interpreting the p-value (Gigerenzer, 2004; Gigerenzer, Gaissmaier, Kurz-Milcke, Schwartz, & Woloshin, 2007; Gigerenzer & Marewski, 2015). So, it should not be surprising if you are still stuck in your head.", "Basically, we can say goodbye to the idea to answer questions about nature very quickly, effortlessly and precisely. Therefore, it may take a lot of perseverance and tolerance to a) wrap your head around this, b) be able to endure your curiosity and c) forget the dream of having one magical universal statistical tool applicable to all problems. To make meaningful conclusions about complex phenomena, we need to purposefully picking from a whole statistical toolbox each time we solve a new problem. It takes a lot of training for the analyst not only to be able to run the analysis, but also ask the right question in the first place, choose a suitable way to test it and finally interpret the findings. When it comes to human behaviour, it should become even more apparent that it takes a lot to measure it reliably and make general inferences about the sum of manifold individuals. This is why experts suggest to always explicitly communicate the uncertainty that accompanies the research findings, provide a detailed documentation about every single step that led to the result and share the data with the research community. This makes scientific reasoning more traceable, demonstrates whether or not an effect holds true across different Laboratories and paves the way for future researchers to answer key questions altogether. By integrating evidence in respect to phenomena of interest, we are able to paint a bigger picture that probably represents its nature more precisely (Hunter & Schmidt, 2004; Weinberg, 2001).", "The p-value has been criticised to divide study results in significant and non-significant, thus sadly and erroneously considered to be not worth a publication for many research journals. Because there are clear cut-off values for the p-value for a result to be considered statistically significant (usually p < .05 or p < .01), it supports a black-or-white style of thinking. Moreover, significance testing is only the end result of a long chain of other decisions the researcher makes beforehand (e.g. the research design, sampling method, model selection etc.) which determine the quality of the research but this simply cannot get expressed into a single value. However, the p-value taken by itself is a useful tool to indicate non-random patterns in the data and \u2014 if used thoughtfully \u2014 allows statistical inference to become fast and scalable.", "I would never claim that science is nonsense because of this practice \u2014 the p-value just needs to be used and interpreted as one of many tools and not put as a mindless decision-making cut-off. This is exactly what the inventor of p-value, Sir Ronald Fisher, aimed for \u2014 it should be taken as a hint that indicates whether your observations are worth a closer look. Nevertheless, the p-value is not a fool-proof concept, seems to be quite a bit counterintuitive and therefore does require in-depth training of the analyst to interpret the results with the right amount of scepticism. Fisher (1956) even writes: \u201eNo scientific worker has a fixed level of significance at which from year to year, and in all circumstances, he rejects hypotheses; he rather gives his mind to each particular case in the light of his evidence and his ideas.\u2019\u2019 Consequently, it is not the p-values fault because it just does what it should. We just should not expect too much from it or yield to the temptation to switch off our minds.", "[2] J. P. A.
