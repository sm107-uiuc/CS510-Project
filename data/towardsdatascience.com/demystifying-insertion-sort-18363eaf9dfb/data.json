Another intuitive sorting algorithm that performs a little bit better than the two previous sorting algorithms, Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. If you have not read about it, you can take a look at it first to stay in pace with us. Understanding Insertion Sort will help you to strengthen your foundation in learning the more effective algorithms later on.", "Insertion Sort operations might not as intuitive as Bubble Sort and Selection Sort at first, however, stay tuned since it is quite interesting.", "Insertion Sort, also known as card player sort, is derived from the idea of inserting a new element into the array. This algorithm is known as an on-line algorithm due to its flexibility to start even if not all elements exist in the beginning.", "So, when the algorithms are running, you can just add other elements and it still runs fine.", "Notice that after the first array, the sorted part of the array has 2 elements. Then, after the second run, 3 elements will be seen in the sorted part of the array. This goes on until the n-1 cycle.", "We will take a peek at the pseudo-code before turning our attention to the implementations in Python, C, and JavaScript.", "Now, we will move to the code for Python, C, and JavaScript.", "At this point, most of you might agree that the operations of for Insertion Sort are not as intuitive compared to the ones for Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. Despite this condition, Insertion Sort performs better Bubble Sort and Selection Sort in almost every case. The best case for Insertion Sort happens when the array is already sorted. So, the only required comparisons are the ones between the new element that is inserted into the array. That\u2019s why we only need to do 1 pass which leaves us with O(n) time complexity.", "For the worst case, it happens when the array is in reverse order. In this case, we need to compare all the elements and go through each iteration once. The total number of comparisons is:", "This might seems familiar and this brings us to O(n\u00b2) time complexity for the worst case. In the average case, half of the elements of the sorted array are smaller and the remaining half are greater than the inserted element. This leads us to compare only half of the array in every pass. Then the total number of comparisons is half of the worst case.", "This still gives us O(n\u00b2) time complexity for the average case. However, the number of comparisons is approximately half of the Bubble Sort for the average case.", "In conclusion, Insertion sort is one of the basic sorting algorithms that every developer should know. Understanding the insertion sort algorithm will help develop your thought process as it utilizes the fact that we can increase the size of the sorted part of the array by inserting one element at a time until the whole array is sorted.", "As we move into the more advanced topic, you will encounter the more efficient sorting algorithms. For now, you should remember that one algorithm might perform better than the others in general. Some algorithms can also perform very efficiently in specific cases. So, there is nothing more in understanding each one of them and apply it according to your need.", "\u201cWhat we learn with pleasure we never forget.\u201d", "Enjoy learning all of the previous and upcoming algorithms.", "Your home for data science.
