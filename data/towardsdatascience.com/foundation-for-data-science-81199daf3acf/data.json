It has become a lot wider over the past few decades due to exponentially growing amounts of data and computational resources, as well as the need to understand it deeper. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are very close to DS in many ways, but most importantly their goal is to make machines understand and operate data, basically automating even more what humans currently do with computers.", "I believe it is fair to describe Data Science as a common ground for almost all areas of study and practice that originated with the development of digital computers, as well as most empirical fields that rely on factual data and it\u2019s analysis to make progress. However, because DS has grown a lot wider than just statistics without refining basic theories, it gets harder to communicate the ideas and collaborate on important projects. With this article, I want to fill the gap by defining core concepts in a simple way and use them to describe the most common types of data.", "\u2014 any given representation of information about anything. Text, numbers, graphics, acoustics, or in any other form. It comes from measuring, imaging, mining, descriptions, and in many other ways. It is important to understand how it was collected and the limitations of the method to keep in mind that it\u2019s not a complete description of reality. However, data is everything we can discuss and analyze.", "On a very basic level, according to our current understanding of physics, all data can be split into some kinds of separate objects. Continuous representations are still useful as approximations in many scenarios, but they might be also viewed as abstract or mathematical objects. Some data, like art, could hardly be described by formal languages at all.", "While any data can be represented as some kind of an object, sometimes it could be better described as a relation between objects. This type of data usually holds information about identificators of the related objects, often coupled with a description of the connection or encoder/decoder functions to send information between them.", "Sometimes data source is random like the results of a coin toss. It\u2019s usually represented by a set of possible states, for example (heads; tails), coupled with numerical values that represent our beliefs about how likely the system will end up in one of the states during observation, like (0.5; 0.5) for a fair coin. In most cases, probabilistic variables actually represent our approximations due to the lack of knowledge. For example, you can actually accurately predict on which side the coin will land if you have enough data about it, force applied to it, air conditions, and other details. However, it doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with quantum particles that appear to be stochastic in nature, but we will return to that later.", "Understanding probabilities is important to understand how information that is stored in a piece of data is commonly quantified. Imagine tossing a coin once without looking. What is the minimal amount of data someone else will have to send to you so that you will know the result? Heads/tails, 1/0, or in some other representation. This is the basic idea behind entropy, denoted as H, and usually measured in bits. You will need to get at least 1 bit of information to know the outcome. With, for example, the English language, you\u2019ll need a lot more information to describe even a single word since there are millions of possible words and their forms and not just two possible outcomes. Interestingly, with every subsequent word in a sentence, as the idea becomes clearer, probabilities of most words are getting closer to zero while fewer remain and each following word actually conveys less information.", "Another important concept based on entropy that I will refer to later is mutual information that is denoted as I. Simply put, it is a measure of how much common information there is between two pieces of data, or how much information about one piece tell us about the other. In the example above with English sentences, each word has mutual information with its neighbors, and on average each new word adds less information that wasn\u2019t already in some previous ones. Also, this explains why sentences rarely have more than 10\u201350 words despite languages being capable of constructing arbitrarily long sequences.", "Often raw data is too heavy to make sense and we need to perform operations on it to extract interesting information. In practice we use numerous different transformations: sorting, filtering, cleaning, counting, querying, merging, inferring, refactoring, modeling, visualizing, searching, mapping, approximating, compressing, pruning, coarse-graining, and many others.", "What is common to all of these operations is that if we consider all input data including functions used in the process, outputs will contain the same or smaller amount of information. Also, if we discard operations that produce outputs that are independent of the provided inputs, like mathematical constant functions, we will be left with operations that might actually help us meaningfully transform data into other representations and find relevant information. Since our goal usually is to reduce masses of data to interpretable representations, I propose to call this type of operations Reductions and denote as ~>. Mathematically speaking:", "For some data A that an operation is defined for, A ~> B is a valid reduction if B = f(A) where operator f does not inject new information H(A) \u2265 H(B) and preserving at least some I(A; B) > 0.", "Many such operations have their own names like in the examples above, but not every one of them, and even for named ones, actual computations might differ between different types or instances of data. Also, such notation forces us to consider all the data that is used to produce the output like the parameters of a function or a model, internal workings of a database, implicit or explicit knowledge about the domain where these numbers came from, and many other potential aspects.", "Now we can review some practical cases that we might work with, starting with more intuitive ones and gradually shifting towards complicated real-world problems.", "Let\u2019s start with what you are reading right now \u2014written natural language. I mentioned a bit about it in the examples above, but this type of data is exceptionally rich while being represented by compositions from relatively small alphabets. Some languages actually have hundreds and thousands of basic symbols like Egyptian hieroglyphs or some eastern writing systems, which often graphically resemble the meaning of those characters. Besides typed languages, there are also spoken variations that may correspond almost 1-to-1 to their written counterparts or differ a lot, sign languages that usually contain the same information as spoken ones but in a very different representation, Braille and many other examples. One common reduction for them is summarization, where some data coupled with knowledge of the language may be reduced to a shorter form.", "One language that is standing out particularly and used around the whole world \u2014 mathematical. It is especially formal, compact, and convenient for definitions of computations that we might do ourselves or with the help of a computer.", "The basic data representations in digital computers\u2014 bits and bytes(=8 bits) are usually denoted by ones and zeroes. Boolean True/False values are just 1/0, integers are directly translated into binary number system with an additional bit representing the sign, float number is a combination of an exponent and a fraction, multiplication of which produces the stored value. Strings may be represented by different encodings like ASCII or Unicode, but all of them are just mappings between integers and assigned characters. Arrays, vectors, tensors and others are usually just the collections of values of the same type. Depending on the programming language and libraries, these representations might also have built-in functions/reductions or be combined into more complex structures.", "Code in programming languages is itself a string that is translated into machine code, which is a mapping between integers and specified operations in the processor. These mappings are usually called instruction set architectures or just computer architectures, and the most popular among them are x86 that is mostly used in desktops and servers, and ARM that is mostly packed in mobile devices. Interestingly, recently ARM entered laptop and server markets as well.", "Programs that transform higher-level code into low-level instructions, usually called compilers or interpreters, were themselves once written directly in these instructions, but modern versions are compiled using older ones. Important to note that in this process a lot of information like variables\u2019 names and comments is usually lost, while source code in combination with a compiler is being reduced to a series of specific machine-level instructions.", "Besides the code and basic types described above, computers often store other data like texts, tables, images, sounds, videos, and many other forms encoded in different ways. All that data is split into files according to some filesystem so that humans can browse and make sense of it. This works well for relatively small numbers of pieces of data with little overall structure.", "However, dealing with thousands, millions, or even billions of entries as just files is nearly impossible. That\u2019s where we need databases. In general, a database is a collection of tables with stored data, encoders/decoders for it, a query engine that can add new entries or perform different reductions on existing ones, and a lot of secondary tools for access control, migrations, replications, and other purposes.", "What differs a lot between databases is how much emphasis they put on individual objects and relations between them. On one extreme we have SQL databases that implement Structured Query Language and fit well for data with tons of relations, on the other NoSQL DBs like key-value and document storages which excel at handling lots of independent entries. Somewhere in the middle we have Graph Databases that represent data as nodes for objects and edges for relations. While graph DBs aren\u2019t very popular yet, I believe their flexibility, intuitiveness, and better ability to represent messy real-world data will eventually make them at least as popular as SQL and NoSQL competitors.", "One computer can store up to hundreds of trillions of bytes and perform up to hundreds of trillions of the simplest operations per second. That might sound like a lot, but such performance is achieved thanks to thousands of cores and in practice it requires parallelization of the workloads. For example, if you want to get sin(x\u00b2), you can\u2019t start computing sin() before you're finished with squaring x. However, if you need something like (a*b) + (c*d), you can perform the multiplications at the same time on different cores and then sum the results on one of them.", "But if you don't want to build a supercomputer to scale it even more or you want to connect to computers remotely you need networks. Besides hardware, you need protocols like TCP and HTTP to have common representations for the transmitted data. With that, you can connect all kinds of things with digital computers to the internet, even your clothes and furniture, a phenomenon usually called the Internet of Things.", "However, just sending raw data back and forth might be dangerous for your security. Decades ago only governments, banks, and few other entities needed to protect their data, but nowadays, with all your surroundings collecting and being controlled by digital data we need encryption to make sure that we have control over access to reading and editing this information. Roughly speaking, encryption works by transforming data into unrecognizable representations while preserving full information using digital keys. These keys are required as inputs for encoding and decoding algorithms to work, and by controlling who have these keys you control who has the access.", "One particularly interesting data structure, based on a cocktail of a database, internet, and encryption, is blockchain. The basic idea behind it is to create a database where anyone can add new blocks of data following the consensus procedure and protected from manipulations, like editing or deletion, by encryption. The most popular applications are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but there are a lot more of them. However, its name is slightly misleading since in practice it's hard to store all the data on a single chain and scaling requires some amount of branching to work with thousands and millions of users. Since real-world solutions are already closer to something like a \u201cblocktree\u201d, I believe it would be beneficial to generalize the core ideas to something like a \u201cblockgraph\u201d to make it even more scalable and applicable to a wider set of problems.", "A more general concept of representations that describes the behavior of some object is called a model. It could be as simple as a linear function of a single variable, like total distance d traveled with fixed speed parameter v and given time t: d=v*t, or as complicated as artificial neural networks with billions of parameters working for arbitrary long series of inputs. There are models of data that define how they should be represented in databases, models that describe how things should be classified, valued, generated, decided, and many other types of them.", "Machine learning models, like regressions, decision trees, or neural networks, are particularly useful because they don\u2019t require the exact specification to be made by humans of the thing that we want to model, but can \u201clearn\u201d a representation of it from the provided examples. By adjusting parameters in a way that improves their ability to simulate data that they are given, models can automate any data processing tasks and sometimes they outperform humans on important problems. However, their effectiveness directly depends on how much information these examples contain about the object of interest and how close their architecture resembles the inner workings of the object.", "Another important class of models is physical. They are the most accurate and detailed descriptions of the real world that we have. Among them, you can find models of as common things as water, electricity and how computers work, gravitation and how planets form around stars, all the way to dark matter, dark energy and other barely understood things.", "The most fundamental and widely-accepted among them are the models of quantum physics. They mostly describe the behavior of the smallest particles that we observe, but this data is also deeply connected with our understanding of the black holes and how the universe developed into what we see around. There are also models that seek even smaller basic objects like String theory, and a lot of higher-level abstractions like electrical circuits or combustion engines.", "Quantum particles have a lot of puzzling properties, but the most counterintuitive among them are superposition and entanglement. The first one means that a particle can be in a mix of different states and will be seen in one of them after measurement according to some probability distribution. The second one means that you can relate multiple particles in a way that their states would be connected, this connection can\u2019t be broken with distance and has an instant effect. Such weird behavior is problematic because it\u2019s computationally hard to model and understand on classic digital computers, but it led to the invention of quantum computers that exploit them.", "The basic unit of data in quantum computers \u2014 qubit, which stands for a quantum bit. Right now we know that such computers can perform certain operations much faster than classic counterparts, but we don\u2019t have a theory that will describe all such operations and these computers are still extremely rare and expensive. Another example of an important difference: with classic data, you can always apply a reduction on a copy and get the result while keeping the original intact, but it doesn\u2019t always work with quantum data.", "All the observable matter is made of quantum particles, including living organisms. While most parts of it are relatively simple from physical and chemical points of view, some are extraordinary complex and hardly understood even after decades of studies. DNA is probably the most interesting biochemical structure since almost all the data about how individual cells behave and construct large creatures like us is stored in it. It is common to think about DNA as just a long list of static data that encodes some proteins, but it also dynamically reacts to changes in the environment, and all the complexity and possibilities behind those mechanisms are still poorly understood. Also, it is surrounded by a lot of other biochemical machinery that interacts with it in many ways, and on this scale, even some quantum effects are totally conceivable.", "There are countless species of bacteria and types of cells around and inside of us. But one particular type is especially interesting for its data processing capabilities \u2014 neurons. They can form thousands of connections with each other and other cells even meters away, receiving, carrying and sending signals in both electric and chemical forms. Part of the body that has the highest concentration of neurons \u2014 brain, has an extremely complicated and interconnected architecture that we still barely understand. One huge problem with the brain is that we don\u2019t know how much of the signal is unnecessary noise and how much is purposefully stochastic. I don\u2019t suggest quantum effects at this scale, but the exploration-exploitation dilemma from reinforcement learning and the effectiveness of noise in the training of machine learning models suggests that some randomness might be an evolved feature rather than a problem.", "Neurons and a bunch of other cells together can constitute a human, while a bunch of humans can constitute a society. At these scales, quantum effects are not a problem anymore, but collecting data and performing operations on humans have a lot of ethical and other kinds of problems. Also, thanks to the internet and digital devices it became a lot easier to connect with people thousands of kilometers away. However, these devices can also be used to collect all kinds of information about our lives that we might not want to share, especially when we don\u2019t know who will see it. Overall, understanding societies and politics have never been as important as today since we can unite across borders and the whole globe, but also because we have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all civilizations and kill virtually everyone, leaving the whole planet uninhabitable.", "In conclusion, it is impossible to count all types, representations, and operations on data. Every day physicists discover new facts about the universe, biologists \u2014 new species of life, engineers \u2014 new tools, psychologists \u2014 new dimensions in our minds, and other people collect new knowledge in all kinds of forms. However, with the help of computers, we can find new insights in these piles of data, which in turn can be used to bring positive changes to many aspects of our lives.", "Your home for data science.
