Being a Data Scientist can mean different things for the different areas within a company but it also depends on the way a company is structured. I can assure you that being a Data Scientist in Google has nothing to do with being a Data Scientist in a startup, their functions change, the amount and the nature of their responsibilities change. Basically the position of being a Data Scientist can morph and adapt on what you as client need or what they as a company ask.", "I\u2019m a 22 year old women in a Third World Country called Guatemala, just on the little bridge that divides North America (Mexico, the US and Canada) from South America (Brazil, Colombia, Peru, etc.) we are part of Central America and while most of the people in the world can\u2019t make a difference between out flag and most of the other Central American countries flags we do have a really different economy, and because I really don\u2019t want to get into detail let\u2019s just say that, we\u2019re different.", "Being on a third world country can mean that you have to look at poverty and violence in the eye every day, but it also means that you have a bigger frame to fill with creative ideas to solve your worlds problems, and those opportunities that can be filled with a slight alterations of ideas that you have seem in more advanced countries never ceases to amaze me. At the US they have Uber, well we have 20 more apps like that, you have Uber eats, we have the Colombian version of that plus 15 more. And as part of those implementations comes the creation of the new positions in the work force, such as the one that I\u2019m filling now as a Data Scientist.", "Yes, but only a true Data Scientist will achieve a great level of change with different kinds of work, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in the medical field, or on tech, or with finch or working with whatever you\u2019re working. And here\u2019s is where you can see the difference with a person that has studied, tested, applied and gotten the knowledge of how to implement models and another run-of-the-mill developer who just happened to snag the Data Scientist position at the company.", "The role a Data Scientist is to analyze, deconstruct, construct and create a new way for data to process in an effective way as to get the answer that is expected from them, assuming that yes, they knew what their target variable was. But in a third world country the real deal and the copycat can appear to be mixed. That mixed race of someone yelling for data, for someone blindly assuming that every model works the same or that what the model says is the final and ultimate truth in the universe is the wrong kind of data scientist that a third world country needs. A data scientist that skeptical but not to an extreme, who is cautious but knowing the risks that he is taking, the data scientist to reinforces his knowledge in different alterations of a model or who knows when a \u201cmodel is lying\u201d is the the kind of data scientist that a third world country needs. A data scientist that know that a computer is a machine that\u2019s meant to empower rather to slave the human analysis, a data scientist that gets to know the business before discarding variables randomly, a data scientist that knows that what worked in the US economy is not going to have the same behavior as one in a Central American country, that is the kind of data scientist a third world country deserves.", "Your home for data science.
