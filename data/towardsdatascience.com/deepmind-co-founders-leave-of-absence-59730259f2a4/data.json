Working alongside experts from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), we have developed technology that, in the future, could give doctors a 48-hour head start in treating acute kidney injury (AKI), a condition that is associated with over 100,000 people in the UK every year. These findings come alongside a peer-reviewed service evaluation of Streams, our mobile assistant for clinicians, which shows that patient care can be improved, and health care costs reduced, through the use of digital tools. Together, they form the foundation for a transformative advance in medicine, helping to move from reactive to preventative models of care.\u201d", "Later in the blog post it was said that:", "\u201cThis is a major milestone for the DeepMind Health team, who will be carrying this work forward as part of Google Health, led by Dr David Feinberg.
