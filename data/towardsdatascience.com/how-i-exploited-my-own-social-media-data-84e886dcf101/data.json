Throughout the duration of the ten weeks that I was enrolled, I learned how to scrape data, modify it, analyze it, visualize it, and stick it into machine learning algorithms. I was instantly hooked. In an age where big data is as available as an all-you-can-eat buzzword buffet, it felt like a whole new world had been unveiled before my eyes.", "At the same time that I was taking introductory data science, I was also enrolled in a class called Professional Responsibilities. At my University, this was commonly referred to as Computer Ethics. My quickly growing data-hungry appetite was suddenly squashed by extreme cognitive dissonance.", "In the morning I would learn how easy it was to infer missing attributes from a training data set, while in the afternoon I\u2019d learn about the de-anonymization scandals happening in industry. I learned how to create a web scraper the same day that I was taught contextual integrity. I was glimpsing into two futures; one that would perpetuate systemic deception and another that could utilize my technical knowledge for social justice.", "Although I was fighting a conflicting war on data, I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for the battle. Those ten weeks changed my perception of technology entirely. The reality that I had been living in was one of complacence and denial. I had thought that if I feigned ignorance about my own need for data privacy, I wouldn\u2019t have to justify my excessive use of social media.", "Then came the last three weeks of the quarter. We were assigned a final project for the data science course. I was to obtain a data set, clean it, perform some sort of analysis, create visualizations, feed it into a machine learning model, and teach the class something.", "I knew I wanted to do something important with my project. I wanted to make a statement. I could have easily found a dataset on sports stats or movie reviews, but those weren\u2019t going to leverage my ability to cultivate ethics in the ways that I needed. I was uploading a group photo to the all-too-illustrious database of Facebook, when it suddenly hit me.", "I was going to exploit my own Facebook data.", "Before the emergence of the GDPR, data collection on Facebook was the opposite of transparent. I had a hard time finding what data the company was even collecting, let alone how to gain any sort of access to it. Eventually, while squinting to read the fine print on the settings page, I found my golden ticket in one sentence.", "It took a few days, but eventually I was given a zipped folder of html files with all* of the information that I had personally provided the social network giant over the course of my eight years with them. I was shocked.", "*I say all with hesitation, because there is a possibility that this information is only what Facebook is willing to share they\u2019ve collected/aggregated from their users.", "I don\u2019t know why I was so surprised, actually. I should have known that they had been keeping all of my data. Thoughts, messages, events, pictures, and likes over the course of almost a decade had added up. I think it was the act of physically seeing the aggregation of my online life in one zip file that really put the cherry on top of the metaphorical data-privacy-crisis sundae. They even had my facial recognition data. I deleted Facebook for the first time ever.", "Ironically I had just learned in my Computer Ethics class that deleting a Facebook account is actually impossible, since the data that has already been collected will never be deleted. Regardless, I opened my laptop and began to search through the htmls of my online identity. I had work to do.", "At this point in time, I was about eight weeks into my first taste of data science. I wasn\u2019t capable of creating a face recognizing neural net or a social graph analysis of my friends. Really, there was only one thing that I wanted my project to prove: if social media companies benefit from using our personal data, why can\u2019t we do the same? I decided to create two datasets:", "Using the nltk library, I performed sentiment analysis on both of these datasets to see if I was consistently positive and/or negative between my public persona and my private affairs. I learned that I wasn\u2019t. I was (understandably) much more negative privately than I was publicly. I played around with the data. I learned that I was much more likely to be negative overall in the month of January. April was great though. I created a machine learning predictor that would guess how positive or negative I might be on any given day, down to the second.", "I did this with eight weeks of data science knowledge. What was stopping the professionals at Facebook from doing something similar? If I had learned this much about my own personal life through rudimentary data analysis, I couldn\u2019t even imagine what a fleet of experts could discover about me.", "I presented my findings to the class. I told them about my motivation, online data privacy, and social media data exploitation. They clapped and I sat down. The project was over\u2026 but the journey had just begun.", "I exploited my own data in hopes of learning more about myself. Instead, I learned more about my identity. In Europe, my data is considered to be a part of my identity. In the US, it isn\u2019t. As I scoured through thousands of my personal messages, public thoughts, or habitual page likes that had been collected throughout the last decade; it became impossible to imagine how someone could ever think that data isn\u2019t a part of our identity.", "One moment in time can change someone\u2019s outlook for the rest of their life. My moment was junior year of college, sitting in a coffee shop, exploiting my own data. As the comfort of complacency began to feel increasingly illusory, I knew indifference wouldn\u2019t be an option.", "While on this topic, I\u2019ve been considering turning my old project into a generalized, open-source tool so everyone can analyze their own Facebook sentiment. Please reach out if you\u2019re interested in exploiting your own data and maybe we can make this a reality!", "Your home for data science.
