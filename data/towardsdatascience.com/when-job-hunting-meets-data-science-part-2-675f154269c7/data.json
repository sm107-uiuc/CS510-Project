The actions taken are formulating problem statements, web scraping for data and storing the data in a database.", "For Part 2, we focus on Data Preparation and Data Modelling!", "Obviously, we first fetch the data from the database that stores them and randomly sample 5 observations of our career data.", "\u201cLet\u2019s jump into modelling!\u201d I know how eager we can be when it comes to modelling. However, let\u2019s revisit the business problem and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) first before jumping into it.", "The business problem is to investigate the factors that impact salary. We want to know the features that can be used to predict the salary. More specifically, given a cut-off salary as determined by us (perhaps the median or the mean of all the job postings\u2019 salary), what are the features that will likely to predict if the salary is above or below the cut-off salary.", "There are a total of 1,173 observations with 16 features. A few features will not be used for modelling though, such as the posting IDs, companies\u2019 names companies\u2019 information and the links to the postings.", "Interestingly, there is no information captured under \u201crequired years of experience\u201d. Hence, this feature will be dropped.", "The rest of the features are either categorical or text. For text features, we clean the data by converting to lowercase, removing unnecessary special characters and escape sequences (\\n, \\t).", "Some salaries are quoted in annual frequency, instead of monthly frequency. We divide these salaries by 12 and drop the \u2018salary frequency\u2019 feature.", "At this point, we have to decide how to formulate our targets, which is the salary. A easy way is to take the average between the high and the low endpoints, and use that as our targets. However, consider these 2 scenarios: 1. $4,000 \u2014 $6,0002. $3,000 \u2014 $7,000It is trivial to determine that the average for both is $5,000, but both of them have very different ranges.", "As such, I decided to use the low endpoint of the salary as the target. (Another practical reason is that bosses usually want to minimise cost, which means\u2026)", "Now, we focus on our targets, the salary. We plot a histogram to see how salary is distributed.", "3 points observed from this distribution:1. No negative values (Thank goodness, you don\u2019t pay your boss to work for him/her)2. Significant number of $0 salary (It\u2019s not charity work, it\u2019s just that the salary is undisclosed in the posting)3. The presence of outliers on the extreme right (where I want to be in)", "To resolve Point 2, we can perform imputation to impute 113 $0 values. To do this, we first convert all features into a bag of words using the function CountVectorizer. Then we use regression based on k-nearest neighbour to impute the $0 values. The algorithm will first take a data point whose salary is $0, look for 5 nearest points around it and impute the values based on the average of the salaries of those 5 nearest points.", "With the updated list of salary, we can once again plot a histogram to see the new distribution.", "Since it exhibits a lognormal distribution, and that it doesn\u2019t have 0 value, we can perform a log transformation so that it will look like a normal distribution.", "Then, we determine that 590 out of 1173 observations are equal or higher than the mean of the normal distribution, whereas 583 observations are not. Obviously, the cut-off in this case is the mean of the log(salary). Using Zero Rule Algorithm, we can predict all to be the majority class, which is equal or higher than the mean of the log(salary), and the baseline is 590/1173 = 0.503.", "After preparing the data, we split the data and use 80% for training and 20% as the holdout set.", "We take 2 models for the classification task: Logistic Regression and XGBoost Classifier.", "While we can use accuracy as a metric, we will use ROC-AUC as the key metric to measure the performance of the models.", "Ideally, we want 100% for true positive rate and 0% for false positive rate. However, in reality, this is almost impossible. Thus, by varying thresholds, we can plot Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve using the corresponding true and false positive rates. Then, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) will tell us how well our models is able to separate between the 2 classes. The higher the AUC is, the better the model is able to predict true 0s as 0s, and true 1s as 1s.", "Using all the features given to us, a good ol\u2019 Logistic Regression model performs slightly better than XGBoost Classifier on the holdout set. With the model, we can predict if the log(salary) is above or below the mean, given the information of the job posting. For companies that provide jobs matching services, this model can assist in managing the salary expectation of both the employers and the employees.", "Thanks for reading, I hope you have enjoyed the story as much as I have written it!
