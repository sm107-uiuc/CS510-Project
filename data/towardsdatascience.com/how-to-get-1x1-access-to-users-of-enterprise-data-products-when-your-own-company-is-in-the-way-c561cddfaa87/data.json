One of the things that came up in this was a common challenge I\u2019ve seen at really large companies: getting access to the actual end users (not some proxy person). The concern? Too many gatekeepers and politics, or simply the fact that too many people (with good intentions) are all trying to access the same people.", "Now, this is actually a nice problem to have-it assumes that your team really is invested in building innovative ML and analytics solutions. They WANT to talk to customers and see how their work fits in. They have already made the decision that design and UX matter. That is something to celebrate, because in a lot of places, the culture is more like this:", "\u201cI have no idea what they\u2019re going to do with this data, but I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m told-here\u2019s the dashboard/excel you requested.\u201d Next Jira ticket please.", "THat\u2019s not how you create innovative ML and analytics products.", "If you\u2019re in the former camp where the problem of NOT talking to customers has already been recognized and people are ready to get out there and learn, then let\u2019s look at the next challenge: access.", "As companies scale into the 1000\u2019s of employees, it\u2019s only normal for politics to creep in, for the status quo to rule and for change to be inhibited.", "Leaders need to be aware of this, and step in to make changes-including clearing the space for what I think is the #1 most important activity in the process of designing innovative ML and analytics products: 1x1 customer research with the people who will use the service/solution/apps. It\u2019s not playing with data, building things, coding things, or drawing things.", "Access is not always a trivial matter of just emailing or calling somebody. Simply figuring out WHO is a customer can be difficult. You may have sales people, sales engineers, customer service people, market researchers, business process people, and a whole host of other roles potentially trying to talk to the \u201cusers\u201d as well-or prevent your team from doing so at first.", "Typically, for data teams serving internal users, there is much less excuse and it\u2019s a lot easier to tap your customer-they\u2019re getting paid to support the same mission as you, after all. When your user is a paying/end customer though, this needs to be handled differently sometimes-but not to the point that the org. creates a bureaucracy that effectively prevents any meaningful contact between the creators (designers-i.e. YOU) and these users.", "So, what to do? Let\u2019s look at some options.", "First, as a leader, you have to develop relationships with the existing stakeholders and gatekeepers to your real end-users/customers. There may already be a centralized customer-research group to manage all the \u201ctouches\u201d and a line of colleagues in your company who also want direct customer access. Understand that some of these people, such as sales people, may be scared to let you access customers-for fear you may promise the wrong then, scare them away, or jinx a sale/relationship.", "Other people may be (rightfully) concerned about being too much of a \u201ctax\u201d on a specific customer and will want to do the proper internal research to make sure that your company isn\u2019t going back to the buffet for too many extra helpings.", "These are all valid concerns-just don\u2019t let the bureaucracy get in the way. And if there isn\u2019t a department, that\u2019s good in some ways \u2014 in the short term, you\u2019ll be able to make some easier customer relationships and develop what we sometimes call \u201cdesign partners\u201d-customers who are interested in being long-term resources for your team as you work on solutions. Aka \u201cfriendlies.\u201d", "When there is a gatekeeper already \u201cin the way\u201d of your team\u2019s customer research, try to understand the gatekeeper\u2019s process, how they grant access to customers, and their concerns. Find ways to potentially combine research activities-i.e. you may be able to combine two research sessions into one with another department who also needs \u201cface time.\u201d You may find out that the information each of you gets benefits each other-because your perspectives are different. You can also use the very same empathy and techniques you\u2019ll use on your customers with these gatekeepers: figure out what their concerns are, and see if you can help them while you help yourself. Sharing your findings, and finding opportunities to inform these gatekeepers of any relevant insights you get during your team could be really helpful.", "Ex: \u201cHey you know what? Paulette, that director of IT we spoke to mentioned XYZ about next quarter\u2019s belt-tightening when we were showing her our dashboard and getting feedback on how she uses it in her work. Something about how all company purchasing may be on hold due to Covid for another 6 months \u2014 even with the vaccines coming out. Thought you might want to know we overheard that.\u201d", "A salesperson would find that feedback VERY useful most likely.", "Another way to get access to precious customers?", "Find out if the \u201cknown\u201d customers have \u201ccolleagues\u201d who do the same work/job.", "This may be easier than you think.", "For example, many sales leaders are going to be focused on getting access to \u201cdecision makers\u201d-i.e. Directors, VPs, SVPs, etc-who are often NOT the people who are going to be living with the technology you may be creating.", "So, use that to your advantage: let them know you don\u2019t need to talk to a decision maker-you want to talk to the direct end users under them. You can also position this as something that could benefit the salesperson: by going out and talking to the subordinates, you\u2019re creating \u201cface time\u201d with the [company] customer. Your org\u2019s brand, products, and services are getting more attention-even if you are genuinely there to do research and inform the data products you\u2019re creating-not to sell anything. That can be a win-win. I\u2019ve seen it happen more than once: research sessions end up \u201cwarming up\u201d a customer or even making them feel like they are being \u201ctrained\u201d or getting special \u201cface time.\u201d This isn\u2019t always true: sometimes people are really busy, and your cash incentive for participating may be what drives a user to say yes.", "Another idea if the gatekeepers are just blocking all meaningful access? Escalate this to a senior stakeholder who can break the ice. The thing is, chances are, there is something about \u201ccustomer centricity\u201d somewhere in the company\u2019s long-term goals. At a high enough level, there is almost CERTAINLY an executive leader who very much would not like to hear that her departments are blocking your access to customers when you\u2019re on a mission to serve them. Sometimes a casual mention of this in the lunch room can go a long way. \u201cHey can I ask you something? Why is it so hard for us to get access to real customers so we can do our job? Can you help?\u201d I\u2019ve seen an excel spreadsheet appear within 24 hours before using this technique, listing out a bunch of customers to reach out. Even better? Sometimes these senior stakeholders will know EXACTLY which types of people to talk to. They may even want to hear what you learn.", "On the other hand, I think some caution is warranted if you have many departments all trying to tap a limited number of qualified end users for research inquiries. Some stakeholders will be very concerned about how many times the company is interfacing with customers.", "Be sure you understand the last time that customer was spoken to, perhaps ask the employee who last spoke to them to understand any sensitive issues that may exist, and be human. I am sure you\u2019ve been on the phone with customer service before and they\u2019re just like, \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know: that\u2019s another department. We don\u2019t have a way to contact them internally. But here\u2019s a phone number.\u201d Ick. Well guess what? Now you\u2019re the equivalent of that CSR rep/person on the end of the phone representing the company. Understand that the customer may need/want something not relevant to your particular work. Take down their concerns, follow up, and make sure it does\u2019t get dropped-they\u2019ll likely remember, and those gatekeepers will be glad that you didn\u2019t forget that your [selfish UX research!] needs aren\u2019t the only thing the matters.", "I know this may seem like a lot, but hey, if you want to design innovative ML and analytics solutions-particularly external-customer-facing ones.", "Or, you can keep guessing and praying.", "If your company is quite large, your BI/analytics/data team may not be alone, and there may be some \u201cfree help\u201d you can tap so you can focus on the data products you\u2019re working on and the relevant research questions. See if your organization already has a group/dept. dedicated to handling customer research inquiries. It might. And secondly, even if you haven\u2019t traditionally worked with your UX/Design department, they may have a LOT of insight about how to do the type of research you\u2019re doing successfully. They may also know how to navigate your organization/company politics, and how to maximize the time spent with the customers. They\u2019ll likely be thrilled to know somebody else even cares enough to do qualitative research and will want you to be successful.", "As to what to ask customers? Here are some ideas in a previous article I wrote.", "Now, get out there, turn your ears up to 11, and start hunting for the unarticulated problems and needs that you can only get from these 1x1 interactions. If you want to design innovative ML and analytics solutions, this is a big part of doing that well in a consistent, repeatable way.", "Photo by Yann Allegre on Unsplash.
