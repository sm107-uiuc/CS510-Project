It is the result of our unprecedented data revolution, yet it is obscure and hard to find, although it is hiding in plain sight.", "Some believe that by 2020 (in little less than one year\u2019s time) each individual will generate around 2 MB of data each day, with a significant proportion of this data created in readily analyzable and easily accessible digital format. The insights that data can create in the future are still difficult to imagine; but with increased quantification it\u2019s likely that most decisions will be driven by data exclusively.", "To understand how alternative data as value, let\u2019s look at the sources of this digital data before discussing the various data sources \u2013 and their proven uses \u2013 in detail.", "Alternative data can be data extracted from", "Harnessing the information content of this enormous data requires computing power. With close to 2.5 exabytes of data are created daily, large storage, processing, computing and analytical power is needed. And, with more data created each day, doubling every 40 months or so, the amount of data \u2014 some good and some bad \u2014 becomes significant.", "Some alternative data is structured, while other is unstructured.", "Through their social media activity, online reviews and web searches, individuals are the major producers of alternative data, particularly thorough their continuous social media posts and similar information. With over 1.56 billion daily active users on Facebook (on March 2019) and 2.38 billion monthly active users on Facebook (March 31, 2019), users generate enormous amounts of data through posts, comments, shares, and re-shares. Patterns, contacts, and networks create an added layer of information.", "Similarly, Twitter has a strong following as well: there are close to 321 active million users (February 2019), who provide insights into how people think on the fly and express themselves contemporaneously in front of friends and the world. Because this information is personal, immediate, and deliberate, it represents a richer perspective into the inner workings of human nature and psychological trends than news and media.", "Individuals generally create three types of alternative data:", "Business processes are often designed and planned, occur in structured manner, and contain information with high signal to value ratio. Specifically, exhaust data refers to data that is a by-product of corporate activities including supermarket scanner data or supply chain data. It is widely believed that aggregated credit card transaction data offers the most reliable indictor that provide insights on price formation, inflationary expectations, and product-level profitability, and act as a leading indicator of revenues as well as determinants of profitability", "Corporations generally create three types of alternative data:", "There are many data distributors that actively gather transaction and other corporate data to anonymously aggregate such information for further processing and refinement. It works: GoPro shares dropped in November 2016 when product receipts from more than 3 million email inboxes were analyzed and the results indicated that sales volumes declined at major points of sale for the product.", "Sensors collect images from satellites and monitor movements using apps on mobile phones, other devices such as CCTV, and the IoT (internet of things). There are companies specialized in quantifying and grouping various types of ships at ports or along important international shipping routes, mainly at the four major maritime transhipment and choke points. Real-time access to data on ship and plane movements generate comprehensive picture of global economic conditions.", "Mobile apps (on digital devices) generate geolocation intelligence for consumers and businesses. And, IoT devices that automatically monitor activities can track human movements, precipitation information and other regular patterns. Traffic from wireless and mobile devices \u2014 particularly in the emerging markets \u2014 is increasing rapidly, and will likely generate more insights about behaviors than what we now have.", "Sensors generally generate three types of alternative data:", "The value of data comes from its use. As hedge funds, institutional investors, traders, and others are looking for their unique edge to improve alpha, alternative data generated through digital activities is emerging as the new oil. Most of the value added by alternative data enhances traditional data; however, as the signal to noise ratio improves, alternative data is likely to become the major source of information.", "Your home for data science.
