Someone who analyzes and extracts business value from big data?\u201d (Asha Saxena from her article \u201cIs \u2018Data Scientist\u2019 the \u2018Sexiest Job of the 21st Century\u2019? And How Do You Get One of Your Own?\u201d, https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/327162)", "Data Scientist. It may be the sexiest job of the 21st Century (at least the Harvard Business Review thinks so). There are few job titles as trendy as a data scientist in today\u2019s workforce. They are in high demand in nearly every industry \u2014 some of which you couldn\u2019t fathom as recently as a couple years ago. As the demand has continued to increase we have seen colleges and universities begin to adopt data science related programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. There are some high schools around the country beginning to get into the mix and design data science related courses and material to better prepare students for this data-centric world we now live in. But what in the world really is a \u201cdata scientist\u201d? What does it take to be one? If I have certain skills do I automatically become one? To me, analogous to world of numbers and statistics that we love to live in, there is no perfect answer.", "As the desire and need for companies to hire data scientists to do \u201cdata science\u201d has become extremely clear, the lines that define what a data scientist is has never been more muddy. Data science has become ubiquitous in today\u2019s world and seemingly everyone has their ideas and opinions on what a data scientist is and what a data scientist should and shouldn\u2019t be able to do. Because of this, the market is becoming increasingly saturated with titles of \u201cdata scientist\u201d. Some with skills centered around the umbrella of artificial intelligence including machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing. Some with expertise in computer programming languages like python, Java and C++. Some with backgrounds in data engineering and software development. Some with a focus on marketing and A/B testing. Some with degrees in statistics, computer science, physics, psychology, history, or even astronomy. Some. Some. And more some. I think you are starting to get the picture. There is no one size fits all to define a data scientist. There is no predefined checklist. What there is are traits and skills that translate across boundaries, checklists and industries. A desire to learn. A desire to be challenged. A desire to solve problems. Most importantly, a desire to listen to the data and extract meaningful value from it. These are at the core of what any data scientist is no matter the educational background, technical skillset or years of experience.", "As I say all of this don\u2019t get me wrong, having a skillset that includes experience with any of the following: python, R, SQL, Hadoop, cloud computing (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.), random forests, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, topic modeling and on and on and on absolutely helps. These are technical skills and knowledge that allow a data scientist to solve the problems and extract the value from data that they are so trying to do. They are the conduits to getting to the data driven decisions that we all crave, but they are in no means meant to be a list of boxes you must check off to be defined as a data scientist.", "Ultimately, being able to understand data and knowing the right questions to ask and the right avenues to go down define someone more as a data scientist than just being able to check off boxes. These skills are accrued from years of working with large amounts of data and being subjected to different challenges, circumstances and situations. These are nuanced skills that come from the experiences you have as you go through your career. Building blocks of a data scientist that continue to stack on top of the foundation that you have laid prior.", "I would be remiss to not mention the importance of being able to explain your techniques, methods and ultimately your solution to your peers, partners, clients or bosses. This is the final trait that rarely shows up on a job description, but should have the utmost importance to you as a data scientist. This is where you truly shine. Where you get to show-off the freakin\u2019 sweet work you just did. Where you get to recommend the best way to move forward. Amazingly, with how technical and complex the techniques and algorithms are that got you here \u2014 those were a breeze! \u2014 this part can trip up even the most savvy data scientists. This skill is an ongoing evolution of refining and improving, but without the ability to properly translate and explain a lot of that amazing work can fall flat. If you are comfortable with this final piece to the data science puzzle then you are well on your way to becoming a truly well-rounded data scientist.", "The term data scientist is synonymous with a lot of things \u2014 machine learning, coding, statistics \u2014 to name a few, but there is no universal definition of what it means to be one. That is for you to shape yourself. For you to define your path to becoming the data scientist and self-anointed data geek that you want to be. How you get there is up to you.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Lover of data.
