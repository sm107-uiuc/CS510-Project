Sometimes getting a VPN can be hard at times, especially when you have to pay to use the service. In this article, I will show you how you can set up a working VPN server on AWS and you don\u2019t have to necessarily pay for anything at all to use it. Let\u2019s get started.", "To get started with this tutorial, you need a Free Tier AWS account so you won\u2019t be charged for running the VPN on AWS. If you don\u2019t have an AWS account, not to worry, you can create one here which comes with a Free Tier Eligibility for 12 months.", "Login to your AWS account, Navigate to the EC2 service and then click on Launch Instance.", "Then on the page click on \u201cAWS Marketplace\u201d and type \u201copenvpn\u201d select the \u201cOpenVPN Access Server\u201d, the one with the \u201cFree tier eligible\u201d option and click Select.", "OpenVPN is an opensource VPN server, in this case, we are using an Ubuntu AMI(Amazon Machine Image) to run the VPN, sometimes AWS marketplace is better if you don't want to go through the headache of configuring the OpenVPN server yourself.", "After clicking Select, you will be directed the page below. Remember, as I said earlier OpenVPN is a free and Open Source VPN, but it\u2019s a commercial service but although we can be allowed to open two VPN accounts for free without being charged anything using the Bring Your Own License(BYOL) option and that\u2019s the essence of the page being displayed here. After this, scroll down and click Select.", "Then you\u2019ll be directed to this page, this is where the service will be running on, select the t2.micro which contains the Free tier eligible tag, then click on \u201cReview and Launch\u201d", "After clicking on Review and Launch, you see a review of the instance you\u2019re about to create. If you read through you\u2019ll see that the cost of running the service is $0.00 per hour. Click on Launch", "Then you\u2019ll see a pop up which ask you to create or use an existing key pair, this part is very important because you\u2019ll need it to SSH to your server. If you don't have one already you can create a new key pair and download it to your computer. Then click on Launch Instances. In a few seconds, your instance will start running and you\u2019re good to go.", "After your instance has successfully launched. Open your terminal and SSH to your server as a root user in order to configure the admin side of the VPN, to do that use the command below:", "Your key pair is the one you either recently downloaded or you have on your computer, also ensure you specify the path of your key pair for it to work, that\u2019s if it\u2019s in a different directory. Your public instance domain can be found on the EC2 dashboard. If entered correctly you should see a license agreement terms, type yes and enter.", "Next, you\u2019ll be prompted with how you want to configure your VPN, to leave the settings default just continue to hit enter and it will start the configuration process for you. After it's done you\u2019ll see an instruction to no longer login as root but as user \u201copenvpnas\u201d which is created by default.", "Now SSH to the instance again, but not as root but as user \u201copenvpnas\u201d using the command below:", "When you\u2019ve logged in successfully, create a password for the user \u201copenvpnas\u201d, this is going to be the admin and client password to have access to the VPN portal, you can do that using the command below:", "You\u2019ll see a prompt to create a new password. And that\u2019s it, you\u2019ve successfully configured the server.", "Congratulations on getting to this point of the tutorial, but before we start using it we just need to enable one little feature in our VPN.", "Copy the public DNS or the IP address for your instance and paste the following on your browser:", "You should see the following page:", "If you don\u2019t see this page, try using an incognito browser to open the webpage. For the Username enter, \u201copenvpnas\u201d and password is the one you created earlier in step 2. If successful, you\u2019ll be asked to accept license agreement terms and then you should see this page:", "Now on the left page, go to configuration and click on \u201cVPN Settings\u201d", "Then scroll down to Routing and enable \u201cShould client Internet traffic be routed through the VPN?\u201d option:", "Scroll down and click on Save Settings.", "When you change the settings, you\u2019ll need to update the server, so click on \u201cUpdate Running Server\u201d and you're done!!!", "Go to the URL and remove the admin path, it should be something like this:", "You should see the user login page, enter the same credentials you use to log in for the admin", "Now select the OS of your choice you want to use the VPN on, follow the prompts and you\u2019re good to go!!!", "And that's all.
