You could build the greatest module known to mankind, but without documentation, nobody will know\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Love it or hate it, documentation creation is a rather crucial step in the creation of any software. You could build the greatest module known to mankind, but without documentation, nobody will know how to use it. Creating documentation can often be an afterthought when it comes to programming. Making modules and applications is time consuming, difficult, and can be very frustrating. Since programming, in general, is usually a process that is very gritty and might take a lot longer than expected, documentation can usually be a very long and drawn-out, boring part of the programming process.", "Fortunately for Julia developers, there is Documenter.jl. Documenter.jl is a module that can be used to extract Julia doc-strings from code and compile them into meta-information, markdown, and HTML. Not only does Documenter have the capability to automate the creation of documentation websites, but it also has features that can be used to easily push that documentation into repositories to automate the entire process of expediting your documentation on the web.", "Like most other languages, Julia features doc-strings that document code inside of the actual software itself. Unlike most other languages, however, Julia has a really cool way to explore this documentation that makes using modules an absolute breeze. Firstly, Julia includes a help function, ?(), which can be used on any module, type, macro, or function in the language.", "This in itself is incredibly helpful, and if your module has a documentation map, like Lathe, then it is likely that you won\u2019t ever need to go to a website to view documentation in the Julia language.", "On top of that, if you happen to use Juno to develop Julia in, you have the advantage of the wonderful documentation pane. Using the documentation pane, you can view Julia module documentation across all of your packages after pre-compiling them in a beautiful GUI from your text editor.", "To document a function in Julia, it is as easy as adding a docstring above the function. Alternatively, you could also use the @doc macro to document something.", "In order to create documentation with Documenter.jl, we are going to first need to set up some directories for the module to use. We will start by making a root directory to store our documentation in. This is normally done in the /doc directory of Julia packages, however, it is important to remember that Documenter uses your global Julia packages, not your local ones. So with that in mind, you don\u2019t necessarily need to put these files into where your repository is stored. There is, however, one stipulation to this, as you must have a source directory in order to build the documentation.", "Now that we are in an empty directory, we will need to make a basic file structure for Documenter to work with. The first file I like to make in this process is \u201c index.md.\u201d Without an Index markdown file, Documenter will not be able to make documentation, so this file is very important and is never auto-generated.", "Next, we\u2019ll a make file. You can put this in a new directory called Doc, or just put it pretty much anywhere.", "The first thing we will want to do in this file is import Documenter.", "Next, we\u2019re going to want to import the module we would like to make documentation for. For this example, I will be using Hone.jl.", "If the package you desire to document does not export the functions you would like to document, then you are going to have to add any modules that are children of that module, as well. This will make it a lot easier to keep the documentation of your different modules separate when using auto-doc. I will not be doing so, as all of Hone\u2019s functions are included and exported without the use of any additional modules.", "Next, we are going to need to call the makedocs() method from Documenter. This function takes a lot of parameters, so I will go through them one by one:", "Here is what my file looked like:", "Now we will need to close nano with ctrl + x, and we can move on to making our source directory.", "Then we will just copy our source files into that directory. Next we will move our index.md into the src directory. After that, we can go ahead and run make.jl:", "After a short while, a new directory will appear in our root folder called \u201c build.\u201d If we open that folder, we will see an absolute behemoth of files. The only one that is going to be important to us right now is index.html. If you now open that file up in your web-browser, you\u2019ll likely see something similar to this:", "Now we can finally get to work on our index.md file. This file is of course just simple Github markdown, so we could for example add a title with a hashtag.", "Now if we run our make.jl file again and refresh our page,", "Notice that the menu on the right is now populated. Now we can begin discussing a few macros that we can use to automatically populate the documentation. Macros are always going to be used in a similar way to how code is in Github Markdown with three of these:", "to open, and three more to close.", "Firstly we are going to look at the @meta macro. This macro is used to delimit code that needs to be run by Julia. This is primarily used to set the current module, like in this example:", "The next important macro is the @doc macro, which will do exactly what you might suspect it does. The @doc macro is followed by the function, module, macro, or type that you would like to document.", "There is also a context macro that takes no parameters and will create a table of contents for your documentation.", "The last important macro I am going to demonstrate is the @autodoc macro, which is by far the coolest one on this list. @autodoc takes a single parameter. This parameter is simply a list of modules to create documentation for. For this example, I am going to be using @contents, as well as @autodoc. Firstly, I am going to add @autodoc to my index.md for the Hone module.", "For my index pages composition, I decided to have all of the documentation stored within a single page. This is because there really isn\u2019t a lot to go through in Hone as of version 0.0.3, so there doesn\u2019t need to be much organization. If you\u2019d like to view a more complex Documenter doc, you can check out Lathe\u2019s documentation here:", "Now after running make.jl again, and refreshing the page:", "Back in our source directory, let\u2019s add another markdown file. For this example, since my module\u2019s documentation is pretty much complete, I will just make another page to show off the contents macro.", "Now we just add this file to our pages dictionary parameter in our make.jl file.", "Then run that make file again:", "Now we will have multiple pages available on the navigation bar to the left.", "Needless to say, Documenter.jl is awesome! I love not having to manually create documentation! Creating websites to serve documentation with proper searching can take hours or even days, and take even more work to maintain. Having a package that can do this automatically, and even go as far as pushing your new build to a repository is definitely a large blessing!", "Your home for data science.
