It\u2019s even in our homes now, such as with Alexa, which is able to interact with us and complete tasks on command. However, this is far from the full capabilities of human beings.", "Human beings have emotions and cognitive ability. Right now, we are a far away from creating AI which has those capacities. Even if we manage to complete this feat of giving artificial intelligence these qualities, we will still come short because of the answer to one underlying question:", "What does it mean to be human?", "We can say that being human, like I said above, is having emotions and cognitive ability. However, science has proven that animals feel emotion and present some cognitive ability. For example, if animals were absent of some sort of cognition, then dogs would not be able to follow voice commands or even know their names.", "So, if emotion and cognition is found in animals as well, then what\u2019s so special about being human?", "The question of what it means to be human is fundementally a philosophical question. We can turn to Rene Descartes, a French philosopher, who said, \u201cI think, therefore I am.\u201d What he meant by this is that since he could think and comprehend that he was alive then he must exist. Descartes continued this idea by saying that he could only know that he existed. However, he could never be sure if everyone else existed.", "Thus our core human quality is that we believe we exist. But how do we know we exist? Our world around us could just be an elaborate illusion.", "This philosophical principle challenges the metaphysical nature of artificial intelligence. To understand how, we must look at the relationship between human existence and the pleasure principle, and how it applies to artificial intelligence.", "First off, I agree with Descartes. I can only be sure that I exist because I can\u2019t tell if other people are thinking or if they can think. A corollary is that I can\u2019t tell if this reality is real.", "For instance, I have had many dreams, or at least what I think are dreams, feel real.", "I recall one time \u201cdreaming\u201d I was in Missouri with my father and that I spent the whole day with him, then went to bed. When I awoke from my \u201cdream,\u201d I was utterly confused because \u201cin reality\u201d I was in Texas with my mother. I was trying to figure out how I went to sleep in Missouri then woke up in Texas. I then came to realize that I \u201cdreamt\u201d that I was in Missouri but the whole time I was actually in Texas.", "It\u2019s fair to say that \u201cdreams\u201d don\u2019t feel like reality. But, the distinction between dreams and reality still doesn\u2019t prove that this is the true reality. I could find myself in a few years choosing between the blue pill or the red pill.", "Since we can\u2019t be sure that reality exists then we can draw the conclusion that the world literally revolves around us. Everyone in it, and everything around it, is there solely for our purpose and use. If it didn\u2019t revolve around us, then it would prove that someone else existed and that reality existed, however, Descartes tells us that this scenario is not possible.", "So if we can\u2019t prove that this reality exists, then how can we tell a computer that it exists? If the only true thing that we can know is that we as individuals exist, then how will we know if the computer has developed cognitive ability that matches a human?", "We might be able to test a machine using the Turing Test, (which a computer only passes when it fools a person in believing it is human) but that would be irrelevant. This is because we wouldn\u2019t be able to know for sure that the computer recognizes that it exists; nor would we be able to recognize the computer as an existing entity due to our \u201cfickle\u201d reality.", "Another challenge to artificial intelligence is what I call the \u201cpleasure principle.\u201d In my article \u201cMy Life As A Hedonist,\u201d I talk about how the driving factor for human action is pleasure. Every action we take is in the pursuit of pleasure. Without the pleasure principle, artificial intelligence could never match that of human intelligence.", "In fact, if we manage to create artificial intelligence that acts on the pleasure principle, we then defeat the purpose of creating it in the first place. That is because it will become self-serving rather than serving us. The computer will, like I said above, believe that the world revolves around itself and only take action in the pursuit of its own pleasure.", "In addition, if we give a machine the pleasure principle, we would then expose ourselves to the threat that artificial intelligence will take over, much like \u201cThe Terminator.\u201d We could prevent this event from happening by programming the computer to take pleasure in serving humans; but then we take away its free will \u2014 thus, not making true artificial intelligence.", "For example, we currently have Tesla cars that are self-driving. If I program that car to have the pleasure principle, it will only want to serve itself. I might want to go to a fancy Italian restaurant but \u201cBetty,\u201d my red Tesla, might want to drive me to New York for a pizza instead because it finds that trip more pleasurable for itself. However, if I program it to take pleasure in serving me, then the car no longer has free will; therefore, it can not truly have artificial intelligence.", "Finally, the pleasure principle and our nature of existance are concepts that can\u2019t work together. If we program an artificial intelligent machine to have the ability to know it exists, ignoring the fact that we can\u2019t tell if the computer knows that it exists, then it will lose the pleasure principle. All because it would then recognize that its true purpose is serving us. This means that it couldn\u2019t conceive of anything other than serving humans \u2014 thus not giving it free will to choose its own actions. This limitation is due to that fact that it can now recognize that it\u2019s a tool and not a human. So it can\u2019t act on any form of pleasure because it\u2019s not actually human.", "If we program the machine to have the pleasure principle, it will lose any understanding of its existence. This is because it will be given free will, thus, preventing the machine from realizing it\u2019s true purpose. As a result, it could never understand that it exists as a tool and is not a human.", "If we can\u2019t program a machine to know it exists and also have the pleasure principle, the question then becomes:", "The answer for me is simply no.", "Your home for data science.
