Turnout is expected to break modern records and many believe it will be one of the biggest political events in American history.", "Over the next 12 months, in living rooms around the country, we\u2019ll ask the same questions. Who will win? Which states will they carry? Why will they win?", "To help get some early answers \u2014 and inspired by other approaches\u2014 I built a regression model that predicts what will happen in every state in the U.S.", "Before diving in, below is a quick walk through of how I built the model. If you are less interested in the technical details, feel free to skip to the \u201cKey Insights\u201d section.", "I set up a regression problem that predicts the % of votes the Democratic candidate will receive in the general election out of the total votes cast for either the Democrat or the Republican.", "Data was scarce so I analyzed only the period from 1976\u20132019. I selected the model and the features based on a time-series cross validation scheme. Each election year was predicted using only prior years. For example, the model trained to predict the 1980 election only saw data from 1976, while the model trained to predict the 2016 election saw data from 1976\u20132015.", "One consequence of this approach is that it takes a number of years before we get stable results. As such, the final performance (R-squared) is estimated using an average of the performance over the last 4 to 6 elections.", "Below is a diagram of this approach where each \u201cTest\u201d time period is the prediction for all states within one general election.", "The first thing I looked at was how well the prior general election predicts the next one. Perhaps unsurprisingly, vote share varies little from year to year with a median absolute swing of just 3.7%.", "In fact, over the last forty years, just three states saw swings of more than 15%:", "Two of those were the birthplaces of the nominee (Obama 2008; born in Hawaii, Clinton 1992; born in Arkansas). The third \u2014 Reagan\u2019s flip of Georgia in 1984 \u2014 was a part of the largest general election landslide since FDR\u2019s first campaign.", "Barring special circumstances, we can typically get a good understanding of the states that will be close in the next general election, by simply looking at the prior one.", "Per James Carville\u2019s 1992 suggestion \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s the economy stupid\u201d \u2014 the next factor I looked at was economic growth. For each election year, I looked at the prior year\u2019s real GDP growth, a common measure for the health of the economy. Plotting this variable against the average Democrat vote share gives us a negative relationship:", "On average, a worse performing economy is better for a Democratic nominee. When the economy is hurting, the middle class is struggling. When the middle class is struggling, progressive policy tends to resonate better.", "The biggest exceptions to this general pattern were 1996 and 2000 \u2014 two years which saw a fairly high Democrat vote share in spite of a strong economy.", "I also looked at the percentage of votes that the Democrat won in the last congressional election. The theory here is that midterms provide a pulse-check on how the country feels about the Party in power.", "In order to create this variable, I combined total votes in both House and Senate races, and removed any races that did not include both a Democrat and a Republican.", "There does appear to be a mild relationship between the two variables. Party performance in the congressional races is associated with performance in the general election.", "When added to the model, the feature provides modest but clear gains in predictive power.", "The last variable that showed promise is the approval rating of the current president prior to the general election. In years where the Democrat was not in office, I subtracted the Republican approval rating from 1. For example, George H. Bush\u2019s approval rating was 39% in 1992, so I converted that to 61% in favor of the Democrat.", "Again, I plotted the variable against the average Democrat vote share:", "As expected, we find that higher \u201cDemocrat Approval\u201d is associated with better performance for Democrats in the general election.", "Using the insights above, I developed two models. The first includes only three variables: \u201cPrior Democrat Vote Share\u201d, \u201cPrior Year GDP Growth,\u201d and \u201cMidterm Democrat Vote Share.\u201d The second uses these 3 variables, but also includes \u201cDemocrat Approval.\u201d", "There are two reasons why I built two models:", "Below is a summary of each model\u2019s performance, measured by R\u00b2:", "With fairly strong and consistent performance, let\u2019s make 2020 predictions.", "Below are the predictions for the 2020 election. In order to come up with this result, I averaged the scores of the two models together and grouped the states into 5 categories, based on the predicted Democrat vote share.", "If this modeling approach achieves perfect accuracy in 2020 below is the outcome of the election:", "With such tight predictions, my primary takeaway is that the election is slated to be very close. In fact, if the model misses Wisconsin, and only Wisconsin, we would see a 269\u2013269 tie.", "It goes without saying that the model cannot capture all important factors. Most notably, it does not address who the non-incumbent nominees are and how well they appeal to the key swing states in the country.", "Nonetheless, the model provides a solid baseline for understanding and discussing the various paths to victory for each Party. In my next post, I will take a deeper dive into these strategies and potential outcomes.", "Your home for data science.
