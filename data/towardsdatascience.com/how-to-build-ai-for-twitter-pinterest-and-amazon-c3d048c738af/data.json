He freely shared his wisdom and lessons he has learned from over a decade of data science work, ranging from his PhD at Harvard to his time at large companies such as Pinterest, Twitter, and AWS (Amazon).", "Douglas took a unique path to becoming a data scientist. Although computers were always part of his household growing up, he thought they were boring, and he told his family he would \u201cnever study computer science.\u201d", "Instead, Douglas went to USC to study filmmaking, thinking he\u2019d follow his dream of becoming a film director. Soon, he realized that filmmaking school wasn\u2019t all he\u2019d imagined it would be, and he took up classical guitar instead. From there, he accidentally discovered a passion for theoretical physics, which he found fascinating (and which paid more than guitar playing).", "Not long after, Douglas discovered his interest in data science and climbed the ranks until he was heading engineering and data science teams at Twitter, Pinterest, and AWS. He describes working in the field as feeling like he\u2019s living in a science fiction film.", "\u201cWhen I work on that kind of stuff, I feel like Doctor Strange \u2014 as if I\u2019m in the Multiverse. You actually get to live this Rick and Morty parallel-universe life.\u201d", "But Douglas wasn\u2019t content with using his expertise to improve revenue at large corporations, so he went on to found his own business, Koyote Science. He\u2019s currently focused on building COVID-19 models to predict outbreaks.", "Douglas\u2019s success hasn\u2019t come without some hard-earned lessons. He told us about some of the challenges he\u2019s seen across many of the teams and projects he\u2019s worked on.", "At Twitter, Douglas worked on a feature called \u201cwho to follow.\u201d This gives Twitter users personalized recommendations about which accounts might be interesting for them. As a data scientist, Douglas discovered that people used this feature a lot. At first, it seemed great \u2014 people were following nearly everyone it recommended. But in the longer term, people who used this feature visited Twitter less.", "Their feeds were filled with tweets chosen by an algorithm, rather than tweets from people they chose themselves \u2014 and there were just too many of them.", "By reducing the number of \u201cwho to follow\u201d recommendations, Douglas improved long-term engagement.", "It\u2019s common knowledge that long-term and short-term goals often conflict, but Douglas discovered a deeper lesson here. As machine learning solutions become more capable, it\u2019s often tempting to use them to do too much. This is almost always a mistake. Douglas says:", "\u201cI aim to build products that work with the user rather than trying to take over from the user.\u201d", "AI as depicted in science fiction \u2014 with human-level intelligence \u2014 is probably to blame for the fact that many people try to do too much with machine learning. In many cases, it\u2019s best used to augment human actions rather than replace them.", "People get very excited about new machine learning algorithms. First we had neural networks (NNs), then convolutional neural networks (CNNs), then generative adversarial networks (GANs), transformers, and more. Algorithms are fun and exciting to talk about and explore.", "But Douglas, a self-confessed math nerd, has learned that the math and algorithms tend to get far too much attention, while real success comes from good data, good engineering, focusing on the customer\u2019s problem, and not getting trapped in the math. He says:", "\u201cIt\u2019s very, very rare for the algorithm to make the difference. It\u2019s almost always the data pipeline. In my work, I have been able to reduce errors by 90% with a data pipeline, compared to 75% with a better algorithm. And yet everyone wants to talk to me about the algorithm, but no one wants to talk about the data pipeline.\u201d", "We use metaphors that associate machine learning algorithms with neuroscientists and data pipelines with plumbing, so it\u2019s not surprising which one grabs popular attention. Douglas found success by focusing on the less glamorous aspects of machine learning. In most cases, deciding what data to use and how to present it to the algorithm is more important than the algorithm itself.", "Many \u201cAI startups\u201d today talk far more about the solutions they provide than the problems they solve, and Douglas has learned to maintain a laser focus on customer goals. Sometimes this means pulling himself away from the more enticing theoretical aspects of machine learning. He says:", "\u201cAs a mathematician, I love all the nuances of the math, and easily get lost in it. But the reality is that there\u2019s an infinite amount of math out there to learn. It\u2019s not feasible to lock myself in my room and learn all the math before I focus on customer goals.\u201d", "The truth that many data scientists don\u2019t want to hear is that successful machine learning solutions are not usually about creating something new, powerful, and exciting. More often, seeing problems from the correct angle and using tried and tested approaches is what you need.", "Douglas has personally engineered many successful machine learning solutions and led teams of software engineers, but he remains modest about his engineering ability and emphasizes the importance of solid engineering.", "\u201cAt Amazon, I let the engineers do as much as possible, because they\u2019re better than me at engineering. I would love to give you another answer, but they\u2019re efficient, they\u2019re thoughtful, they\u2019ve seen these structures before, so they know about implementation details.\u201d", "It\u2019s not all smooth sailing though. Douglas acknowledges the difficulties of getting different experts to work with each other, especially when highly technical people tend to have very strong opinions about tiny decisions.", "The best way he\u2019s found to get everyone on the same page is by constantly releasing Minimal Viable Products (MVPs), which takes us to our next lesson.", "Douglas swears by MVPs, which demonstrate core pieces of a solution, even if many of the features are missing. When developing a machine learning solution, he\u2019ll aim to deliver a new MVP every week.", "\u201cIf something ends up being way harder and I keep doing MVPs and never reach the goals, then that gives us information about the difficulty of what we\u2019re attempting to do.\u201d", "\u201cPeople\u2019s response to an abstract concept of something is often completely different to their response when they see something real. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always putting out MVPs. People who are looking from a higher-level perspective can gain the required intuition to give me feedback.\u201d", "It\u2019s better to have to trash two weeks of work than two months, and MVPs can help with this.", "MVPs have other benefits too. By releasing stripped-down versions of a solution, Douglas often discovers that less is more.", "\u201cWhat you end up delivering is often much simpler than the thing you originally intended to do, but it\u2019s refined.\u201d", "Of course, customers are sometimes unhappy when it turns out that the best solution was the simplest one. Douglas compares building machine learning solutions to creating art: it\u2019s about the time that went into development, not the effort required for the final product.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a classic Zen story about a king who hires an artist. The artist works for a year, but then paints the final painting in only three seconds. When the king complains, the artist says, \u2018Oh, I spent a year trying to paint much harder things.\u2019\u201d", "MVPs keep you open to finding a better, simpler solution, even late in the development process, and it\u2019s important to stay agile so you can pivot to these better solutions if necessary.", "People often think something has to be complicated in order to be powerful, but in fact the opposite is often true.", "Large machine learning models, such as GPT-3, are exciting and often make their way into headline news. But Douglas compares large models to early (failed) attempts to build planes. These planes competed against the famous, successful plane built by the Wright Brothers. What made them different? The Wright Brothers focused on control, while their competitors were going for size and power.", "\u201cWhat the Wright brothers did that was so ingenious was that they didn\u2019t go for bigger engines. They were bicycle mechanics. They didn\u2019t even use powerful engines. And instead, what they focused on was control.\u201d", "This is similar to machine learning models. As Douglas says:", "\u201cWe made the biggest model that does all this stuff. But then people ask, \u2018How do I interpret this stuff?\u2019 \u2018How do I control it?\u2019 \u2018How do I make sure that my models don\u2019t go off the rails?\u2019\u201d", "Large machine learning models might often be more powerful, but unless they solve real problems, they\u2019re not useful. If a model produces amazing results unpredictably and only some of the time, that\u2019s not useful. If a model produces accurate results but we don\u2019t understand why and can\u2019t be sure the results will always be accurate, then that\u2019s also not useful.", "Instead, smaller, simpler, and arguably less powerful models that offer more interpretability and consistency are more valuable in nearly every case. Just like with flying, we need to be able to steer and to land, not just to go fast.", "Douglas shared many lessons in our chat with him, but these were his most important rules for successfully shipping machine learning solutions:", "We (Data Revenue) have shipped dozens of successful projects. If you need help with yours, don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch.", "Your home for data science.
