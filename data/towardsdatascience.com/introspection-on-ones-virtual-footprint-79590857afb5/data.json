We\u2019ll take a quick glance through what Google, Instagram, and Facebook offer and see what we can tease out easily.", "Jupyter notebooks to replicate the questions asked and graphs plotted here can be found on my GitHub.", "Google offers the ability to download your data through Takeout.", "Follow the directions given, and a few hours later, Google will email you with links to download what will likely be several gigabytes of personal information, depending on the level of privacy you\u2019ve already told Google to keep for you. My full archive came in at over 20 GB (reasonable, I think, considering that most of that is Google Photos and Mail).", "If you\u2019re interested in simply browsing your data, then the format you choose may not matter to you. HTML might be the easiest to read with human eyes, but if you\u2019re interested in examining your data, you may wish to drill down into each service and change the format, and select JSON whenever possible, to make data manipulation easiest. This choice is most important with My Activity, a meta-product where records of activity across products is stored.", "There are obvious products, like Search and Location History, whose records you want to dig into, but there are likely \u201cproducts\u201d you may not be aware of. The one I\u2019m going to examine here is Purchases & Transactions.", "Purchases & Transactions contains information that was scraped from other Google services. If Google detected that a piece of information (email, usually) regarded a purchase, reservation, subscription, delivery, or other kind of financial transaction (not, seemingly, including bank transactions), that content was extracted and placed in a JSON file. Each transaction gets its own file (as opposed to the My Activity files, which contain all actions for a particular product).", "For example, I was surprised (but should I have been?) to see that Google had parsed the contents of a GrubHub receipt email from an order I made in November 2017.", "I was curious how much of this kind of content Google had extracted from emails I\u2019d received, and from other financial services I might have been unaware were connected to Google.", "I also wanted to know the \u201chow\u201d behind the creation of this JSON file. Did Google in fact extract this content, or did GrubHub sell it to Google? I don\u2019t know.", "Without entering details of other individual transactions, it appears that Google had extracted/acquired, over the course of my use of various Google products, data from 521 transactions (as of the time of my Takeout archive), going back to at least May 2008. (There were 42 that did not have dates.)", "Out of these 521 transactions, 390 of them had a \u201cSUBTOTAL\u201d field. Summing these values (ignoring any line items) shows that Google had indexed over $11,000 worth of my transaction data over the past 11 years.", "The real surprise is, that\u2019s not actually a lot. It looks like they really started picking up the pace on transaction scraping in 2013, if my data is representative. (That, or that\u2019s when I started to spend more online using this particular gmail address. Or both.)", "To collect your Instagram data, follow these directions, under the heading \u201cDownloading a copy of your data on Instagram\u201d.", "This data is only offered in JSON format.", "We\u2019ll run a simple query here: what does the breakdown of likes I gave to other profiles look like, from month to month?", "I started using Instagram in mid-2012. After a few months of little activity, it is fascinating to see how power laws seem to emerge from the simple task of which pictures I clicked the little heart icon \u2014 an unintentional popularity contest, to say the least. (Profile names are, of course, hidden.)", "Also note that the number of ranked profiles increases; as the number of accounts I follow increases, the variance of photos available to like increases, but the rough power law structure is maintained even though the likes themselves have become more diffuse.", "As before, follow these directions, under the question \u201cHow do I download a copy of my information on Facebook?\u201d You\u2019ll notice, like Google\u2019s My Activity, that Facebook data is available in both JSON and HTML formats.", "We\u2019ll look at two aspects of the Facebook data: reactions and post sentiment.", "Reactions (likes and other kinds) can be counted much like Instagram likes, once the recipient of a reaction has been extracted from sentence-structured posts.", "Collecting reaction data from 11+ years of my own Facebook feed drove home how many people have left the platform; not wanting to discard those reactions without an object (\u201cMichael Carlisle reacted to a post.\u201d), I found, in ranking my top 25 reaction recipients, that #5 was the aggregate-of-all-who-left-Facebook placeholder \u201cNO_NAME\u201d.", "As with the Instagram data, the \u201cpopularity\u201d effect of likes and reactions appear as a kind of \u201cwealth distribution\u201d, governed by a power law.", "Running a sentiment analysis on my Facebook posts was a bit more intriguing. VADER, which has been incorporated into NLTK (the \u201cNatural Language Toolkit\u201d), offers a breakdown of document-level sentiment as \u201cpositive\u201d, \u201cnegative\u201d, \u201cneutral\u201d, and \u201ccompound\u201d.", "First, we\u2019ll check how many posts were made each year.", "Next, we\u2019ll generate box plots of the sentiment of these posts per year. I\u2019m a relatively neutral speaker (hi, mathematician), so we can see the medians are pretty much solidly neutral, and almost all negative sentiment past 2010 (when Facebook\u2019s posts became more sentence-like, instead of the \u201cPERSON is _____\u201d format of the late 2000s) are considered outliers.", "This barely scratches the surface of what can be uncovered and what you can learn about yourself in this data. The examples given above don\u2019t really get into the detail known in the individual transactions and posts involved, where a more nuanced analysis can be done.", "And if you can learn about yourself through this data, then the companies holding the data can learn as well. And use it to market to you. And possibly sell it to others to market to you.", "Your home for data science.
