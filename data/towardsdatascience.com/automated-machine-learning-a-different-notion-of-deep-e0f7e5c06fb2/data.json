Then, automated machine learning is the automation of automating automation.", "Automated machine learning has been under the AI radar for a couple of years now. Although large companies like Amazon and Google have already launched their AutoML tools, the AutoML workshop of ICML has attracted significant interest and research makes significant steps towards understanding the nature of machine learning problems, AutoML is still a niche term, reserved for the avant-garde of the data science community.", "Possibly overshadowed by the deep learning frenzy, evidently not mature enough to dazzle us with applications, AutoML has not yet been understood or clearly defined. A next step into the human-machine relationship? A deeper level of understanding of artificial intelligence?", "Important discoveries are usually acknowledged ex post, as society needs to experience, understand and evaluate them. Especially when it comes to AI, it\u2019s easy to miss the forest for the trees, as things are going deeper \u2014 but deeper towards which direction?", "1. Inserting more automation in training a machine learning model.", "Wait, isn\u2019t a machine learning model already automatically trained? Partly yes, and this is why we call it machine learning, because the algorithms \u201clearn\u201d by themselves, based on the data we give to them. However, the most tedious, time-consuming tasks, the ones that are traditionally undervalued when publishing amazing results, have nothing to do with the actual training of the model.", "75% of machine learning is preparing to do machine learning \u2026 and 15% is what you do afterwards.", "It is a realization of anyone involved with a machine learning experiment that good results are easy to have, but satisfactory results take time, smart design, experience in the field and, quite often, a bit of luck to achieve. The 90% of an experiment Caruana is referring to, is pre-processing, feature extraction, hyper-parameter tuning, algorithm selection, model evaluation and other possible steps of an ML pipeline.", "The step that AutoML has mainly focused on is hyper-parameter tuning, which in general refers to choosing the optimal values for the hyper-parameters of a learning algorithm that it cannot choose by itself. For example, a neural network learns the optimal weights by itself, but defining the number of layers, the number of neurons and the learning rate is a task, and a most tedious one, for the ML practicioner. As tuning is a well-defined task, it has been a primal target for AutoML tools .", "2. Gathering meta-knowledge from the application of ML experiments.", "So, what does one get from an ML experiment? A good model, hopefully. Some insights into the data, possibly. A more experienced data scientist, arguably the only long-term gain. But what is the substance of this newly acquired experience? The data scientist has understood the properties of the ML problem, has subconsciously recognized some patterns and, when he is confronted in the future with a similar problem, he will be able to reuse his knowledge and provide a quicker, more direct solution.", "This is the essence behind the area of meta-learning: to create meta-knowledge when solving an ML problem that is not part of the model, but is generalizable enough to be used in other cases.", "Extracting meta-features from the dataset is a technique often employed in AutoML tools to initialize the hyper-parameters of a learning algorithm: if you know that some values have worked well in a specific problem, why not start with them when solving a similar problem? It is in formulating and quantifying similarity across datasets where the challenges of meta-learning lie and human experience still surpasses AI.", "3. Transferring knowledge across learning tasks.", "If meta-learning is concerned with creating meta-knowledge, then transfer learning is about finding the correct ways to use it. You\u2019ve probably already heard of applications that have successfully used transfer learning: a deep neural network that plays different Atari games and an agent that learns skills for Minecraft, are some of the few examples.", "Transfer learning can get from simplistic, where you simply transfer data or a trained model across problems, to more subtle, where you reuse a good hyper-parameterization, to highly sophisticated, where a machine learning algorithm learns, not just a good solution to the specified problem, but skills that can be reused.", "It must be obvious by now that research in AutoML is focusing on the higher levels of machine learning: since we have been practicing machine learning for decades, have we reached the level of understanding that will allow us to clearly formulate it and teach it to someone? And who better a student than a machine?", "Those that know, do. Those that understand, teach.", "With great computational power, comes great responsibility. It would be unfair to say that the recent deep learning breakthroughs can be solely attributed to the immense computational power some research groups possess. There is a great deal of intuition, experience and creativity involved, but it is accurate to say that without this computational power, deep learning is not feasible.", "Achieving an excellent hyper-parameterization by giving immense resources to a naive technique, such as grid search, is not AutoML. Getting a good model by training on 1202 CPUs and 176 GPUs is not AutoML. AutoML is about making informed decisions by exploiting past experience in order to make machine learning less brute-force, more intelligent. It takes a shift of the research community, both in approach and tools, to go from application-oriented deep learning to abstract-oriented automation, but it might be the (only?) way to surpass the performance barriers we still have in the majority of applications, like reinforcement learning ones.", "2. A magical box that gives a good prediction model.", "Admittedly, the short history of AutoML reveals that our initial hopes materialized into this: a black box that gets requests and returns the best model possible. No need for data scientists, no need to understand the properties of the problem and no need for a transparent interface to the experiment. Pure automation.", "Although we can\u2019t be sure whether this approach failed because it is wrong in general or because our technology is not ready to support it, it does feel contrasting to our so-far human experience: automation comes only after an in-depth understanding of a problem. We don\u2019t really know how Strong AI could look like, but a black box sounds like an implausible (and quiet cyberpunk) scenario.", "3. The meteorite that will lead to the extinction of data scientists.", "Until we reach a point where the whole mankind becomes obsolete and lives inside the Matrix, we will still be in need of data scientists. No matter how more advanced our machine learning tools, and technology in general, becomes, we need a human-in-the-loop. In fact, the more sophisticated a technology gets, the more experienced, imaginative, analytical scientists you need to master it.", "AutoML tools are today marketed as assistants for data scientists that can undertake and improve some of the steps of the ML pipeline, but still need a human to orchestrate and inspect the experiment. As long as you maintain an improving skill-set, curiosity and a unique perspective of the world, you are not expendable \u2014 as a data scientist, an employee and a human being in general.", "AutoML is a young research area, so it is easy to get a good understanding of it by going through the tools and ideas involved. Naturally, these ideas are old and have matured in different fields. Observing how the research community responded to the need for AutoML by defining the problem and blending these ideas is exciting! (Alright, subjectively exciting for a computer scientist like me.)", "Probably the first definition of the AutoML problem was provided by the team of AutoWEKA, which attempted to automate the Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyper-parameter optimization problem. There is an elegant mathematical formulation of this problem, but, put it simply, the question is:", "Which ML algorithm (SVM? neural networks?) and what parameterization of it (kernel? number of layers?) should I employ when designing an ML solution for a dataset?", "All data scientists have their preferences when it comes to choosing their go-to ML algorithm. Neural networks have attracted significant interest, but there is a variety of algorithms out there. As the decision is usually a product of application, taste and habit, it is natural to wonder:", "Is there one ML algorithm that is always the best choice?", "The short answer is no. The long answer, provided by the authors of the No free lunch theorem, is quite more technical, but mainly boils down to the fact that if we average the performance of all ML algorithms across all possible datasets (probability distributions that generate data) the performance is the same. AutoML cannot therefore automate the algorithm selection task to the point where only one algorithm will be used for all applications.", "So, how do you go about finding the optimal algorithm and its parameterization? Well, this is nothing more than an optimization problem, which we have so far been solving by the well-known try-them-all-and-see-what-works method.", "As this method proves inefficient for large search spaces, say deep neural networks, data scientists need either (exponentially) more GPUs or a better optimization method.", "Bayesian optimization is a technique that has attracted significant interest (see auto-sklearn), as it is an efficient way to optimize a black-box function: if we assume that there is a relationship between the number of layers in a neural network and the performance it achieves, then we can try to approximate how this relationship looks like by modeling it as a probability distribution.", "Bayesian optimization begins by assuming a model (usually a uniform one). Then, is samples the search space by picking a number of layers and experimentally evaluating the performance. After this, the model can be updated by fitting a probability distribution to the samples and the algorithm will pick as a next sample the value that will most probably maximize the performance, based on the current model. By iterating this process, we can end up with an accurate model and a good value for our parameter.", "AutoML tools seem to follow two distinct directives: they are either research-oriented frameworks that focus on automating particular steps of the ML pipeline or full-fledged, marketed products.", "Auto-sklearn focuses on the CASH problem. It employs Bayesian optimization and meta-learning to intelligently search through the combined algorithm-hyper-parameter space. Auto-sklearn has been proven very effective in ChaLearn AutoML and KDnuggets competitions, probably because it incorporates ensemble learning in the model formation problem.", "HPO-lib, is a hyper-parameter optimization library, that can prove very useful for research purposes, as it offers a unified interface to three other AutoML packages: SMAC, Spearmint and TPE. Unfortunately its development has been discontinued.", "R has also embraced the spirit of automation. Caret is more of an interface than an autonomous package that has been employed to address the notorious diversity of R packages by offering a simple interface to an ML experiment. Caret mainly automates the formation of the ML pipeline, but the steps remain conventional.", "Then, there\u2019s the marketed products, which a data scientist can use, but not extend. A data scientist or a company can choose to employ Google\u2019s Cloud AutoML, Microsoft\u2019s Azure or Amazon\u2019s web services. These tools offer elegant interfaces, immense back-end processing capabilities and useful hints towards designing a good experiment. However, the market is still far from claiming that AutoML has been perfected, as these tools cannot be blindly trusted with solving an ML problem end-to-end.", "AutoML is a brand new tool into the quiver of data scientists. And as all tools, it can be valued, misused or left to rust. As a data scientist, you can choose to use AutoML now as an assistant that will increase your productivity by relieving you from the tedious tasks of pre-processing your data or tuning your models. Or you can invest your time into becoming an AutoML expert and use it as a strategic weapon in the future job market or as a shield against an industry that automates what is trivial, but is still struggling with the nontrivialities of intelligence\u200a\u2014\u200aartificial\u00a0or\u00a0not.", "And finally, as part of a human society that is consistently developing its relationship with technology, we should bear in mind that the question is not always what we should automate, but can sometimes be: what should we not automate?", "A weird time in which we are alive. We can travel anywhere we want, even to other planets. And for what? To sit day after day, declining in morale and hope.\u2015 Philip K.
