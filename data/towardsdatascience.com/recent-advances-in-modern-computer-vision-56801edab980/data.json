Today, as of 2019, the field of computer vision is rapidly flourishing, holding vast potential to alleviate everything from healthcare disparities to mobility limitations on a global scale.", "In recent years, we have seen great success in Computer Vision built on top of AlexNet or similar CNN based architectures as a backbone. It\u2019s true that the process is modeled after the human brain in terms of how it learns; a network of learning units called neurons learn how to convert input signals such as a picture of a house into corresponding output signals like the label \u2018house\u2019. For more details regarding this see my previous blog.", "In the last 2\u20133 years, we have started having great achievements in Deep Learning based vision tasks beyond Classification. I have mentioned few important of these in this blog.", "Out of several methods available, 2 families of techniques for object detection have been popular for last 3\u20134 years in modern computer vision -", "Object detection here is framed as a regression problem. A single neural network is used to directly predict classes and bounding box anchors without requiring a second stage per-proposal classification operation.", "For a complete comparison, check this \u2014 Speed/accuracy trade-offs for modern convolutional object detectors, Jonathan Huang et. al., 2017", "Group pixels into meaningful or perceptually similar regions. Companies such as Keymakr offer best in class tools and full service solution for complex segmentation on video and images.", "The Mask R-CNN not only provides evidence that their model outperforms all previous models, but also conducted various ablation experiments to show that RoIAlign, segmentation decoupling, and fully convolutional mask heads each individually improves accuracy. Check the paper for details.", "Simply put, locating an object in successive frames of a video is called tracking.", "Classically object tracking has been approached with techniques such as -Dense Optical flow: These algorithms help estimate the motion vector of every pixel in a video frame.Sparse optical flow: These algorithms, like the Kanade-Lucas-Tomashi (KLT) feature tracker, track the location of a few feature points in an image.Kalman Filtering: A very popular signal processing algorithm used to predict the location of a moving object based on prior motion information. Meanshift and Camshift: These are algorithms for locating the maxima of a density function. They are also used for tracking.", "Most of the methods for object tracking employ \u201conline\u201d learning. Online methods are expensive, have to make simplifying assumptions to make things efficient. Such classical methods sometimes fail due to fact that classical image features such as Harris corner, HOG or SIFT they all break in different natural image property variations, for example, Harris corner is not agnostic to scale of the image.", "But recently, there have been works that have tried to explore the employment of tracking using deep learning features.\u2022 As efficiency is key, a strategy is to learn from a large ensemble of labeled offline videos.", "How does it work-Two hypotheses:1. The network compares the previous frame to the current frame to findthe target object in the current frame.2. The network acts as a local generic \u201cobject detector\u201d and simplylocates the nearest \u201cobject.\u201d", "It has been only 5 years and progress in generative AI is unbelievable. Especially this GAN architectures appeared in the year 2019 such as BigGAN by Google and StyleGAN by NVIDIA are able to generate images precisely indistinguishable from real images, consequently Seeing is no more believing.", "A GAN is composed of two successive networks-", "Especially talking about StyleGAN, which instead of focusing on creating more realistic images, it improves a GANs capability to have fine control over the image that\u2019s generated.It doesn\u2019t develop on architectures and loss functions. Instead, is a suite of techniques that can be used with any GAN to allow you to do all sorts of cool things like mix images, vary details at multiple levels, and perform a more advanced version of style transfer.It employs existing techniques like Adaptive instance normalization, a latent vector mapping network, and a constant learned input.", "Do not wonder if someone tells that none of the images above is real. These are produced by StyleGAN.", "With further research on and refinement of the technology, the future of computer vision will see it perform a broader range of functions. Not only will computer vision technologies be easier to train but also be able to better recognize images than they do now. This can also be used in conjunction with other technologies or other subsets of AI to build more potent applications. For instance, image captioning applications can be combined with natural language processing and speech recognition to make visual intelligence interactive. Computer vision will also play a vital role in the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence by giving them the ability to process information as well as or even better than the human visual system.", "Read my new article about compressing large deep neural networks without hurting accuracy.
