I have good news: MiniKF. Just like minikube, MiniKF provides a single-node Kubernetes cluster with Kubeflow deployed on top, without any hassle. And now, we are excited to see the leading Kubeflow distribution on the AWS Marketplace!

Review your configuration details and don\u2019t forget to view the Usage Instructions and keep them handy, as you are going to need them later", "7. You can also select how to launch MiniKF or change the EC2 instance type", "Arrikto recommends you leave the default value for Choose Action.
