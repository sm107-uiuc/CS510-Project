This was particularly interesting to me as I had only dreamt about creating jaw-dropping visualizations but never imagined that I could ever turn data into another format, especially sound. This post covers basics about TwoTone and how to use it.", "Sonification refers to using sound to represent data and is usually intended to either complement or replace traditional visualizations. Although it has existed since quite a few time (first used in 1908), it has not been explored as much as visualizations have been explored \u2014 which makes it an excellent choice for people who want to try out something new (and cool).", "TwoTone, built by DataVized Technologies with support from Google News Initiative, is a tool for doing sonification. It exists as both a web-app (to run in your browser) and command line app (to run onto your computer) and allows users without any music or technical background to create sounds out of their datasets to better understand them!", "With the above features, it is a great tool for someone who wants to break into the field of Data Science without having much background knowledge! It is very easy to get started with.", "How is Data translated into Audio?", "For converting numerical values to audio, TwoTone uses a Musical Scale, whereby higher values correspond to higher pitches. You can read more about it here. Without further ado, let us dive into using TwoTone!", "In this post, I\u2019ll be using the more user-friendly and accessible web-app of TwoTone.", "Head over to app.twotone.io to get started! You don\u2019t need an account, but you definitely need a dataset \u2014 you can either choose your own or use any of the default ones available. After you click on the \u201cGet Started\u201d button, you\u2019ll be prompted to select your \u201cdata source.\u201d", "I\u2019ll be using the dataset \u201cUS Historical Revenue, Public Debt and GDP\u201d which is one of the datasets provided as a sample by TwoTone. You can also choose to add your own data (make sure to meet the requirements).", "After you press \u201cSelect,\u201d you\u2019ll be given a mini-tour of the portal (please don\u2019t skip it). As the tour highlighted, an audio track is automatically generated for you! So are you done? No.", "An important note is that TwoTone only supports one data source per audio track \u2014 which makes intuitive sense with the musical scale. However, you can add multiple \u201ctracks\u201d to add more data!", "Clearly, you can do SO MUCH more with the data so why settle for less? Let us explore some of the interesting features:", "Yes, you heard it right. You can choose to represent your data with different instruments! Pop-open the instrument drop-down menu of your audio track, and you can view the following menu:", "That\u2019s right! You can \u201csonify\u201d your data in 12 different instruments! Select your favourite instrument and press the play button to hear your data.", "2: Multiple tracks \u2014 become a DJ", "Yes, you can too become a DJ by mixing tracks. Click on the \u201c+\u201d icon in the bottom right to add another audio track and select \u201cmusical scale\u201d (we\u2019ll come to the other option in a bit). Tada! Another audio track is also automatically created for you. Now, you can change the data source or the music instrument to change the sound of this track and try out the mix!", "PS: You don\u2019t have to stop at two tracks.", "Remember the other option while adding another track? That\u2019s narration! You can add your own voice to the data by narrating in between or during tracks and make into a beautiful story. This way, you can literally tell a \u201cstory\u201d with the data and get insights and meaning from the data across to multiple audiences.", "After you\u2019re done, you can export the audio (bottom-right) and download it to your computer! Here\u2019s my first sonification!", "If you produce a sonification, please do share with me by responding to this story or sending it to me! I\u2019m always interested in storytelling with data (and sonification).", "Your home for data science.
