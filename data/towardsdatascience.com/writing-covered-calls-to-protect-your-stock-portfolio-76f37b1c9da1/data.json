Nobody knows what will happen next or whether markets will finally experience an extended downturn at some point.", "But it doesn\u2019t hurt to take some money off the table while stock prices are still near all time highs. Here is a reasonably safe method for taking some profits and reducing your risk while at the same time still preserving some upside exposure.", "Let\u2019s say we have been investing in Apple for quite some time and are sitting on sizable gains. We believe in the company and think that the current valuation is somewhat stretched but reasonable when compared to other big tech stocks.", "We can protect ourselves somewhat by selling (finance folks call the act of selling options \u201cwriting\u201d) call options against our Apple stock position. When we do this, we are trading upside for protection \u2014 we receive some money for selling the call option but in return, we lose out on any money we would have made if Apple\u2019s stock price moves above the strike price on our option. Let\u2019s go through this with an example:", "That\u2019s a lot of finance lingo, especially in that last bullet. Let\u2019s walk through what it all means. When we own stock, like our 100 shares in Apple, our payoff diagram looks like the one depicted below.", "The Y axis is the profit or loss of our investment and the X axis is the current price of the stock. The blue line shows our profit or loss as a function of the price of the stock (in our case, Apple).", "Since we own 100 shares of Apple, when the stock price increases (moving right on the X axis), our profit increases also (moving up on the Y axis), so the up and to the right direction of the blue line makes sense. For the mathematically detailed, a $1 increase in the price of our Apple stock would translate to a $100 increase in the profit of our position (since we own 100 shares).", "The vertical gray dashed line denotes the price at which we purchased our Apple shares. If the current stock price is higher than our purchase price, then the Y axis value of the blue line is above the blue \u201c0\u201d, denoting a profit. If it is not, then we are sitting on a loss.", "Now let\u2019s see what happens when we add call options to the mix. First let me quickly cover the nitty gritty of how options work:", "Let\u2019s look at what buying and holding a call option looks like on our payoff diagram (below). Notice that there is now a kink in our blue payoff line. The way the line flattens out at the strike price as we move left on the diagram means that our losses are capped at the premium (the price we paid for our call option). This is an attractive aspect of investing in options \u2014 the knowledge that regardless of what happens, our losses are capped at the premium. The other aspect of call options that investors love is the unlimited upside. Notice that as we move right on the diagram our blue payoff line goes up in the same way as it would if we owned the underlying stock. This means that by paying just the premium, we end up getting the same economic exposure that we would have if we had bought the underlying stock outright (when the stock price is greater than the strike price).", "On the other hand, one disadvantage of owning call options is that unlike with buying stocks, if the underlying stock price doesn\u2019t move at all, you still take a loss since you are out your premium (also call options don\u2019t pay dividends even if the underlying stocks do).", "Additionally, there are also the added dimensions of time to expiration and the fact that the rate at which your option\u2019s price changes is itself not constant and a function of many things (for example if our strike price is much higher than the current market price and the option is close to expiring, then even a large increase in the price of the underlying stock may not change the value of our option much) \u2014 these factors make options investing much more complicated than it appears at first glance. If you plan to jump into options investing whole hog, you must understand how all of these additional factors work before doing so.", "If you sold a call option instead, which is what we want to do in our example, everything works in reverse. In this case, we have sold to someone (for a price) the right to make us buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price. Since everything is in reverse, we are now forced to take a loss if the stock price moves above the strike price on the call option we sold \u2014 in this case, the person who bought the option from us would force us to sell him or her 100 shares of the underlying stock for a price lower than the market price of the stock (so we are forced to sell at a discount).", "The graph to the left shows the payoff diagram for writing (a.k.a. selling) a call option. It\u2019s pretty much exactly the reverse of the previous one. Notice that the blue payoff line now starts above $0 for low stock prices all the way up to our strike price. This means that as long as the market price of the underlying stock is below the strike price of our option when it expires, we get to keep all of the option premium (the money we got for selling the option). Also observe that the premium is the maximum amount we can gain from selling a call.", "Now if the stock price rises above our strike price by the expiration, we take a loss because we are forced to sell stock to the buyer of our option for a discounted price \u2014 that is why the blue payoff line slopes down after the kink. Notice that the potential loss is uncapped \u2014 if the price of the stock keeps going up then our losses would keep going up along with it. So selling call options provides limited upside while exposing us to unlimited downside (scary!).", "Yes it is scary, but I am definitely not recommending that you write naked calls (selling calls without first owning the underlying stock, and yes it really is called that) as doing so on the wrong stock can be devastating. For example, imagine if you sold one 11/15/2019 (the expiration) Amazon call option at a strike price of $1,940. That\u2019s about 10% above the current market price. For selling the call, you would receive a cool $3,300. Pretty nice right? But if Amazon returned to its 52 week high of $2,050, you would be forced to sell 100 shares of Amazon at $1,940. And since you sold a naked call, you would need to buy 100 shares at $2,050 and then immediately sell them for $1,940 \u2014 a loss of $11,000. So your total P&L (profit and loss) is:", "We don\u2019t want to be exposed to that kind of risk so writing naked calls are out of the question. But writing covered calls (selling call options when you already own the stock) in a richly valued stock market can be a risk reducing and potentially attractive trade for risk averse investors. Let\u2019s see how in the next section.", "Since we don\u2019t want to sell calls naked, what we want to do is to only write (remember that write means sell in financial markets) call options on stocks we already own at least 100 shares of. The way I personally think about writing covered calls is that it\u2019s like:", "Making a promise to sell your stock if it hits a certain price (or goes up a certain amount) and being paid for making that promise.", "Prior to entering any transaction, we need to decide the following:", "It\u2019s important to realize that these two decisions are connected. If you write a call option expiring in 2 years, then you would want to set your strike price at least 20% above the current market price, otherwise you are all but ensuring that your stock will be called away. On the other hand, if you write a call option that expires in one week, you don\u2019t want to set the strike too far above the current market price, because then you would receive almost no premium for your troubles.", "The premium that you receive for selling a call option is a function of how likely that, at expiration, the market price of the stock will be above the strike price of your option.", "Call options that are very unlikely to end up in the money (a call option is in the money when the market price of the underlying stock is greater than the strike price) are worth very little while call options that are highly likely to end up in the money are worth a lot. Below is a 2 by 2 matrix that summarizes this. Unfortunately, there is no magic formula for where to set your strike and over what duration to write the option over. Rather, you need to decide for yourself where to strike the balance between the amount of premium you receive and the likelihood of having your stock called away. Keep in mind also (more on this later) that the more premium you receive, the more your portfolio is protected in a market downturn \u2014 if markets crash, then the option you sold will go down in value (which is good for you since you are short it) and you can either wait for it to expire worthless or buy it back for cheap (buying it back closes your position). So in this case, because you believe that the call option\u2019s price will decline in the future, you would want to sell one that is worth more and thus, receive more premium.", "Wow I didn\u2019t expect to go that far into the mechanics and intricacies of writing call options when I started this post. But it is critical to understand what we are doing, especially the risk, before doing it.", "Let\u2019s finally return to our Apple example. Recall that we own 100 shares of Apple stock and that we decided to write a 11/15/2019 call (2 and a half months to expiration) with a $220 strike (5% above the current market price). In return for doing so, we will receive $630 in premium. Let\u2019s see how our total position (our Apple stock plus our sold call option) looks on a payoff diagram:", "This chart is a bit more complicated than the others so let\u2019s take it one step at a time:", "Sorry for the long post but options are complicated and risky, and I wanted to make sure to cover all the basics before recommending a strategy. Finally, I should emphasize that covered calls are not for everyone. If you are the following type of investor, they might be for you:", "More by me on Finance, Investing, and Money:", "Visualizing the Stock Market with Tableau", "A Data Science Project I Did on Investing in Lending Club Loans", "Do Stocks Provide a Positive Expected Return?", "Do You Have Enough Money to Retire?", "Data scientist.
