The community\u2019s hyperfocus on novel methods ignores what\u2019s really important.\u201d", "This isn\u2019t the first article (and won\u2019t be the last) to discuss how the AI community seems to follow an agenda of its own. Large venues blatantly ignore application papers \u2014 works focused on applying current methods to real-world problems and the challenges of doing so (which are many). Proceedings are simply out of touch with reality. An extra 10% on object detection is far more valued than a 1% reduction in cancer deaths.", "The AI community largely ignores the obvious: deep learning is an experimental science. Despite their formal roots, neural networks are massive non-linear systems that defy explanation. Although the growing body of work dedicated to their interpretation, neural networks remain as mysterious as ever. The only reliable tool we have to understand them is the scientific method \u2014 which is deeply rooted in experimentation.", "And here is the contradiction: despite being experimental in nature, the field rejects pure experimentation. The average neural network paper presents its novelties, attempts a formal proof, and does an ablation study. The end. This is as far as experimentation goes.", "Imagine if the civil engineering community decided to invent novel bridge designs, but opted to do all its validations on table-sized LEGO replicas. No expensive simulations nor trials using real building materials. Would you trust the newly proposed designs? Would you trust these experiments enough to invest millions of dollars in realizing them? I don\u2019t think so.", "Simplified world models are useful for quick prototyping and trying ideas. They hint at good designs, even though they can\u2019t prove them. For actual proof, you need the world. It is a two-step process.", "Modern AI research is stuck in the first half: benchmarks. Real use cases are the other half \u2014 the missing half. ImageNet, COCO, CIFAR-10, and the sort are the LEGO of AI. They allow us to experiment with new ideas and dismiss bad ones. They are great tools. However, they are a means to an end, not the end itself.", "The message is not that current works are bad, far from so. The issue is the current disconnect between academia and the real world.", "Consider the plot. It shows the recent progress on the COCO object detection benchmark. Each tiny dot is a different model \u2014 a new technique or a blend of existing ones. Leaders are highlighted in blue.", "The chart shows a trajectory from 28.8 AP in January 2016 to a whopping 55.1 in July 2020. The progress is undeniable. According to the plot, EfficientDet D7x is the current best technique for object detection. Yet, I ask you: which of these models would you implement for an application?", "High are the odds that you won\u2019t even answer, as you don\u2019t know which app I am talking about or which are its requirements. Does it need to run in real-time? Will it run on mobile devices? How many classes does it have to identify? How tolerant are its users to wrong detections? Etc.", "Depending on the answers, none of the above are even worth considering, not even EfficientDet D7x. For instance, if the model has to run in real-time on a mobile phone, none of these models are even slightly tuned for performance. Worse, no guarantee exists that these models will yield consistent detections across sequential frames. I can\u2019t even name an app that requires the highest quality detection available despite anything else \u2014 that has no other requirement besides high accuracy.", "In other words, the metric the research community is chasing serves no one but the community itself.", "Back in 2015, increasing the depth of neural networks beyond a dozen layers was detrimental to performance. He et al., in the famous ResNet paper, hypothesized that connecting non-sequential layers by skip connections could scale capacity, as it would improve the gradient flow.", "In its first year, ResNet achieved terrific results on several benchmark competitions, such as ILSVRC and COCO. By now, you already realized this is just a hint that ResNet was a significant contribution \u2014 it is no proof.", "The definite proof of ResNet\u2019s place on AI history is the enormous body of work built upon it. The striking aspect of ResNet is the number of unrelated problems it solves, not the competitions it won. And, to be fair, the real contribution is the skip idea, not the architecture itself.", "Likewise, the Focal Loss paper stood the test of time because its contributions brought real improvements to other people\u2019s work. The Attention paper follows the same route. Every day a new article shows how Attention improved some benchmark (and a focused loss made it even better).", "It is not the competitions that matter. It is the legacy. In fact, AlexNet won the ILSVRC in 2012, and ResNet won it in 2015. Can you name the 2013 and 2014 winners? What about the challenges held in 2016, 2017, and 2018? Are you even sure there was an ILSVRC for each year?", "So you may ask, why is this happening? Why aren\u2019t there better benchmarks or more useful metrics? How can we measure legacy or impact?", "The sad truth is\u2026 we can\u2019t. We could use citation or download counts, or maybe Reddit mentions or GitHub stars. However, these are all flawed metrics. For a fair comparison, we need to account for every detail while normalizing all bias out of the equation. It is insanely hard.", "For instance, to compare the legacy of Attention with the legacy of ResNet, we need to account for any successful use of these concepts, weigh their relative impacts, and normalize for age (ResNet is older) and reach (Attention is also relevant for text). It is readily apparent that quantifying these properties is a huge undertaking likely to be as flawed as any benchmark or metric. Ideas such as the journal\u2019s impact factors don\u2019t even scratch the surface of this issue.", "Some goals just can\u2019t be quantified. Who was the most important person: Bach, regarded as the most influential composer of western music, or Shakespeare, regarded as the most influential dramatist? It makes no sense to compare their work, let alone their fields.", "This brings us to a dead end. We can measure accuracy, we can measure speed, but we can\u2019t measure impact. We all agree we need better science, but how can we tell one science is better than another? How can we measure the disconnect between research and reality?", "We want to move forward with AI, but we don\u2019t know which direction forward is nor how far have we walked.", "This isn\u2019t a problem with AI alone. We want better governments, better health care, better education, but how can we really quantify these things? So far, the least unsuccessful approach (and the most popular one) is surrogate metrics. A surrogate is a substitute \u2014 something we use in-place of something else. For instance, the COCO AP score.", "We can\u2019t measure the progress of AI, but we can measure how accurate the current object detection methods are. Since object detection is a part of AI, if we make any progress on it, we can expect also to be making progress on AI. Before COCO, we used ImageNet Top-5 results\u2026 until we nailed it, so we moved to a more challenging problem. Hopping from problem to problem, we hope also to be making progress towards better AI.", "We do this all the time. We can\u2019t train detection models to improve their AP, but we can teach them to reduce the L2 loss of the bounding box coordinates. Losses are surrogates for undifferentiable metrics. The L2 loss is not AP, but we know that a low L2 loss correlates with a higher AP, so it works.", "Once upon a time, literacy rates were the dominant metric for progress in education in many countries. Some decades later, literacy was high enough for the focus to shift towards higher school completion rates. Then, higher college attendance. I don\u2019t know if degrees are as correlated with education as we think they are \u2014 or if high schools teach what they should, but these are the metrics we target today.", "In a sense, there is no right direction to tackle such problems. Therefore, by definition, all routes are wrong. The only way we can increase our odds of picking a less-wrong path is by following as many paths as we can. Using AI terminology, we need to use a larger batch-size and sample as many distributions as we can.", "This means we have to broaden our focus beyond \u201caccuracy\u201d and \u201cspeed\u201d also to include things such as \u201crobustness\u201d or \u201ccoherence.\u201d On top, we need to move from hand-picked benchmarks to the real-world.", "Giving my personal account studying breast cancer detection algorithms, it is easy to think the field is solved. Recent works have achieved super-human scores on the topic, yet, you don\u2019t see these algorithms being applied at any hospital. For a simple reason: it doesn\u2019t work.", "I know this sounds a bit of a stretch, but it is pretty simple: if you train on dataset A, the algorithm doesn\u2019t work on dataset B, even though it is the same thing: mammograms. There is no known technique today that can be trained on one dataset and work well on others without fine-tuning. You have to build a dataset for each machine/hospital to get any useful results. Metric-wise, the field is solved. In practice, it hardly even began.", "On top of that, algorithms provide little to no insight into their answers. Put yourself on the doctors\u2019 shoes: would you tell someone they have cancer because a machine said so? You won\u2019t; you will give the images a second look. If the AI isn\u2019t trusted, it will never be used.", "So far, the dominating metric for published works is the AUC score. It tells you how well the algorithm classifies mammograms as benign and malignant. It doesn\u2019t tell you how robust it is to other datasets or if any of it is explainable. In other words, it answers almost nothing about: is it useful?", "There is no right path to advance AI, but there surely are very wrong ones. It doesn\u2019t take much time in the industry to realize how inapplicable most of the literature is and how the real pressing issues are clearly neglected. As I said at the beginning, this article\u2019s message is not that current works are bad. The point is the current disconnect between academia and the real world. We are too narrowly focused on accuracy.", "Quoting Hannah Kerner again, \u201cThe community\u2019s hyperfocus on novel methods ignores what\u2019s really important.\u201d In my opinion, what is really important is advancing our society \u2014 and we expect to do so by improving AI. However, we will only be able to do so properly when we embrace real societal problems. Problems way more complicated than accurate object detection.", "Feel free to comment or connect with me.
