The article is part of their excellent project called \u201cThe Polluters\u201d \u2014 a series of well-researched and terrifying articles investigating the entities and forces driving the global climate crisis and shaping our collective action in regard to the environment.", "While I recommend everyone to read the series, I felt inspired by the compilation of the details of the top 20 polluters: their revenue, past and future emissions, investments in renewables, etc. So I created a dataset on Kaggle using data collected by \u201cThe Guardian\u201d and played with it to produce some visual insights.", "\u201cThe Guardian\u201d calculated the total emissions in CO\u2082-equivalent for the time between 1965 and 2017, and estimated the future emissions for the next 12 years, basing on the investments undertaken by each company and their fossil fuel reserves. I plotted these numbers on the left subplot. Clearly, Saudi Aramco is the biggest polluter of all time and intends to hold this title proudly in the future.", "These bare numbers however do not reflect the full scale of climate devastation that is coming in the next decade, because they represent the emissions over the last 52 years, compared to an upcoming period of just 12 years. So I calculated average yearly emissions for these two periods (see the subplot on the right). While it is only a rough estimate, the comparison is chilling. Every third company where the estimate is available aims to more than double their yearly emissions compared to the average level from 1965\u20132017! Welcome, hot new world.", "Although all these companies operate on a global scale, they are still headquartered somewhere. When I looked at how big is the 2018 revenue of the companies, grouped by the HQ country, I was surprised and not surprised at the same time. I was not surprised to see the US and Saudi Arabia on top of the list, but the presence of 3 EU countries made me wonder \u2014 especially the Netherlands. Can this be a reason why it has been so difficult to regulate the CO\u2082 pollution in Europe, despite the good will? I was also surprised to see that 80% of the total revenue generated by these 20 polluters has been captured by only 7 countries: the US, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, China, the UK, France and Russia \u2014 most of them, however, went to privately-owned companies. This list of countries makes nevertheless a lot of sense when you think about the international alliances and tensions.", "And here comes the megaplot, which reveals the incentives of the polluters. What do we have here: on the vertical axis is the projected growth of a company for the period 2018\u20132030, as estimated by \u201cThe Guardian\u201d. On the horizontal axis, there is 2018 revenue divided by the total amount of oil barrels produced, so it represents the revenue a company makes per oil barrel. The color encodes the ownership type of a company. The size of each plot scales with the total oil production in 2018.", "What story does it tell us?", "The incentives of the polluters are really clear here. Fossil fuel is money, and big fossil fuel production is big money that is difficult to give up. Although you could think that fossil fuel revenue would be an easy profit for the state to increase the spending budget, the anonymous shareholders are much more ruthless about getting their profit than the state-appointed owners.", "This points to some obvious complications when it comes to implementing regulatory solutions. By means of international pressure, grass-roots protests and national-level policies, revenue from a state-owned fossil-fuel company could be relatively easily at least partially redirected towards investments into renewables and sustainability within a state budget. This would compensate for part of the emissions in the long term and help transition into a new economy. There is no such a simple leverage mechanism in case of shareholder-owned companies, however, which are corporations that form a global structure parallel to the geopolitical division into nation-states. These companies operate and extract fossil fuels globally, which gives them a way to run away from the regulatory efforts, and as we see here, they have a very strong incentive to find a way to continue polluting despite international efforts. And the private shareholders evidently do not care at all about the climate catastrophe approaching us within the next few decades. Maybe they think that they can be just fine in a private bunker once the plankton dies off because of the ocean acidity and we will start to struggle with having enough oxygen to breathe?", "Your home for data science.
