To view the code used to complete the analysis, please check out my notebook.", "New South Wales (NSW) is one of the major states in Australia, being most populous with over 8.1 million residents. There are many cities and towns within NSW, where its capital city Sydney is home to almost two-thirds of the NSW population.", "The aim of the project is to explore different areas of Sydney and find optimal locations for a new resident based on the top common venues in each borough. This article will be targeted to people interested in becoming a resident in Sydney NSW, Australia, as well as home buyers, people staying over a long period and other similar conditions. Others who are interested in learning about different boroughs of Sydney may also benefit from this.", "With Australia being a multicultural country, its landscape is constantly evolving, seeing increases in different ethnic communities and venues. Sydney boroughs will be discussed such that stakeholders can choose an optimal living location based on their interests.", "The following data will be used:", "The data set (1) consisted of 11 states or territories and 1395 boroughs, which was subsequently extracted to obtain only data pertaining to NSW; this contained 199 boroughs. Exploring the data for NSW, there was no quick method to find boroughs in NSW in the Sydney region. Instead, rows were manually removed which were not in the vicinity of Sydney, which was specified to be within an 80 km radius of Sydney.", "After finding that the geometry of each location was of MultiPoint type, I used the first coordinate for my data frame which was later found out to be inaccurate. Instead, I cleaned up the data frame manually, removing duplicate names of boroughs (e.g. Liverpool-East, Liverpool-West) as they overlapped other boroughs and obtained correct coordinates for each division using Google Maps/Search. The final data frame now consisted of 38 boroughs in the specified Sydney region.", "After retrieving the boroughs in our specified Sydney region as well as the longitude and latitude for each borough, we will now use Foursquare API for exploratory analysis to find venues near our neighborhoods. We will then use K-means clustering to create clusters of neighborhoods which have similar characteristics.", "First, using the geopy and folium library we can create a map of Sydney with the 38 boroughs superimposed on top.", "Now, we use Foursquare API to discover the nearby venues from the given coordinates. I defined the radius to be 1 km and extracted information of the venues such as its name, category and coordinates. We can then merge this into a new data frame containing neighborhood and venues information. For example, around Ashfield we found:", "Unfortunately, some locations did not return any venues (Botany Bay, Warringah) which may have been due to the placement of coordinates, so they were removed from the analysis. Overall, there were 143 unique categories and 890 venues in total for our boroughs. The next image displays the top 10 venue categories that were returned; however, some were inaccurate as they did not capture at least 10 different venues.", "After using one hot encoding and taking the mean of the frequency for each venue category, we can use K-means clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm used to create K clusters of data points based on feature similarity. Observing the elbow method and silhouette score, we find that the optimal number of clusters to use is K = 4.", "After running K-means clustering, the cluster labels generated were added to a new data frame, merged from our original data frame and their corresponding top 10 venues.", "It would also be great to visualize our 1st most common venue for each neighborhood in each cluster. This way, we can form different labels for our clusters. I created a stacked bar plot of the 1st most common venues:", "Quite interesting. From analyzing the bar chart (as well as the top 10 venues), we can generalize each cluster and label them as the following:", "Inspired by Sercan Y\u0131ld\u0131z\u2019s project, I added the top 2 venues for each borough so we can view more information about the area after creating our new map.", "We can merge our new columns to form our final data frame containing all our information.", "Finally, our final map displaying the clusters with information is created.", "The results of K-means clustering of a total of 36 neighborhoods depict 2 major clusters and 2 single neighborhood clusters. From examining the clusters, we found that:", "These clusters could have been more unique with more characteristics by including more neighborhoods/council areas. A one km radius around the coordinates for each neighborhood may not have been large enough to capture information about the area. For example, only 2 venues were found around the locations for clusters 2 and 3. This could be improved by choosing better coordinates such that more venues would be enclosed. Increasing the radius of the circles would also capture more information about other venues within the areas.", "It is recommended for people looking to visit or live in Sydney NSW to research more about the neighborhoods to investigate whether the areas suit their lifestyle or culture. The red dots (Cluster 0) are mostly closer to the CBD area of Sydney, with the areas being characterized by caf\u00e9 venues. The purple dots (Cluster 1) are further out from Sydney CBD, with the areas being characterized by their variety of food venues. By closer inspection, some areas are uniquely identified by the number of restaurants from a specific cuisine. For example, our analysis captured Italian restaurants (7) at Leichhardt, Vietnamese restaurants (8) at Marrickville and Korean restaurants (15) at Strathfield.", "From analyzing the top venues at different neighborhoods, this resulted in exploring many areas characterized by cuisines and caf\u00e9s. Choosing an area to reside in based on this factor alone is not optimal but could help specific groups of people looking for different areas for social gatherings and food.", "People looking to become residents and other stakeholders could choose an optimal location in Sydney NSW based on their interests such as the cuisine of food at restaurants, the number of caf\u00e9 venues or being near beaches and parks. However, this is not recommended as there are a wide range of factors that come into play when looking for an area to visit or live in. Clustering by top venues could be useful for people looking to open a restaurant in areas where the cuisine is distinctive from other restaurants in the area. The analysis performed in this project has showcased some unique venues for each cluster.", "Overall, the final decision to find an optimal location for a new resident will be made by the individuals themselves. As well as finding about how the neighborhoods are characterized by the number of venues, they should also consider other factors such as transport, housing prices and access to different necessities.", "This was my capstone project part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. You can find the code used in this analysis here. Next time, I would like to explore different cuisines in Sydney so keep a look out for that!", "Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or follow me on Medium.
