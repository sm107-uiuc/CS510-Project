As a data scientist, you\u2019re required to have some basic knowledge of maths and statistics as well as some basic programming skills. You will also need to know a little about business and science communications to be able to deliver your work to a wider audience. On top of that, you need to have a keen eye for patterns and trends.", "The process of structuring, analyzing, and formulating massive amounts of raw data in order to find patterns and anomalies through mathematical and computational algorithms is called Data Mining.", "Every data scientist who wants to advance further in their career and obtain powerful skillset needs to \u2014 at least \u2014 know the basics of data mining. Through learning the techniques of data mining, one can use this knowledge to generate new insights and find new trends.", "The process of mining data can be divided into three main parts: gathering, collecting, and cleaning the data, applying a data mining technique on the data, and validating the results of the technique.", "There are many techniques out there that one can use to perform data mining, however, in this article, I will focus on the top 5 data mining techniques used right now by individuals and big companies. The techniques we will cover are:", "MapReduce is a programming model and implementation for collecting and processing big amounts of data sets on parallel. In other words, MapReduce takes on some chunk of data, divided it to be processed on different hardware, and then gather the information from all of that hardware and come to a conclusion.", "MapReduce has applications in different areas such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), document clustering, statistical machine translation, and various machine learning applications. Big companies, such as Google has sued MapReduce to regenerate its index of the WWW by replacing ad hoc programs that updated the index and running different analyses on the results.", "A MapReduce program is composed of three steps:", "An example of the usage of MapReduce is trying to count words occurrences in a large number of documents. What will be done in this case is, dividing the documents on different computers. So, if we have 10,000 documents and 10 computers, each computer will analyze a 1000 document.", "I must mention that often during the map stage, there will be no communications between the different computers. Each computer will do the job independently.", "We can build a simple implementation of the word counting example using Python to implement two main functions: mapper and reducer.", "Clustering is the task of grouping a set of items so that the items in one group are connected somehow. Every group is then called a cluster. Clustering is often used in exploratory data mining and statistical data analysis. You can find clustering in many applications such as pattern recognition, computer vision, data composition, and bioinformatics.", "The goal of performing a clustering operation is to obtain clusters of points that are close to each other. When several points are within a small distance from each other, they will fall in the same cluster, while if they were far apart, they will have different clusters. Often the distance measures used are Euclidean, Cosine, Jaccard, Hamming, and Edit.", "Clustering can be done using one of two strategies:", "Probably the most famous clustering algorithm is the k-means algorithm, and it can be implemented easily using Python and Sci-kit.", "Link analysis is a data mining technique based on a mathematics branch called graph theory. Graph Theory represents different objects (nodes) and the relationships between them (edges) as a graph. Link analysis can be used for both directed and undirected data mining.", "Link analysis can be very useful in cases such as where relationships between different data points can be observed easily. However, as observations increases, automated methods are preferred because they will yield faster results. In those cases, Link analysis tools can be relatively inexpensive and represent an economical point of entry into data mining.", "Link analysis is often performed in 4 steps:", "There are different algorithms for link analysis, such as PageRank and Link Sapna and TrustBank. You can use the Python NetworkX library to implement and analyze graph data easily.", "Here is a simple implementation of the PageRank algorithm using Python, Scikit, and pagerank_fast module.", "Recommendation Systems are a class of application that involves using machine learning and mathematical models to predict the user\u2019s responses to different sets of options.", "You come across recommendation systems on a daily basis. Do you use Amazon? Netflix? Spotify? All these big companies use a recommendation system to offer the user options on what to buy/ watch or listen to next.", "The core concept of recommendation systems is linear algebra. More precisely, an aspect called a utility matrix. The way recommendation systems often work is by collecting data on users and products \u2014 or songs or shows \u2014 and then put encode the relation between this information in a matrix form. This matrix is then used to predict how much a user will enjoy similar products.", "There are different approaches to implement a recommendation system, the 4 most used approaches are:", "You can implement recommendation systems in Python using the Suprise Scikit library.", "Frequent Itemset Analysis is the analysis approach used with market-basket model data. The market-basket is a data model that is used to describe a common form of a many-to-many relationship. This data model is used to connect two kinds of data points, items, and baskets. Each basket has a set of items \u2014 hence, itemset \u2014 and it is often assumed that the size of the itemset is smaller than the total number of items.", "Frequent itemset analysis can be used to categorize and analyze different kinds of applications, for example, let's assume we have some text documents that we want to min for specific words, we can use:", "We can perform the frequent itemset analysis in Python using Pandas and MLXtend libraries.", "These techniques are an example of techniques often used to predict properties of future instances of some data, or simply to make sense of present properties of this data.", "Data mining is one of those techniques that can transform your abilities and make you stand up as a data scientist. Knowing the different approaches to mine data, find patterns, and visualize these patterns is a highly-demanded skill nowadays.", "As a data scientist, we always have to keep up with future technologies and trends, data mining is one approach to keep our skillset relevant and up to date.", "Your home for data science.
