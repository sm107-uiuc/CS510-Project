In this article, I will discuss my method of analyzing the data and drawing meaningful information from it.", "In this article, I have analyzed the school distribution in the city of Hyderabad. This is significant in identifying the areas where the school infrastructure needs to be developed.", "In order to obtain the distribution of schools in Hyderabad, I have used FourSquare API.", "It is essential for everyone to have access to quality education at the school level. This is the foundation of education. There are plenty of good schools in Hyderabad, however, they are clustered in certain neighbourhoods.", "There are several neighbourhoods in Hyderabad where there is a lack of infrastructure in terms of schools etc. It is important to identify these regions for the development of the city and to provide easy access to education for everyone.", "The government needs to develop school infrastructure either by constructing schools in these regions or support in the development of private schools in these areas to provide easily accessible quality education available to everyone. However, in order to do this, it is essential to identify these neighbourhoods. So in this article, I have analyzed the distribution of schools in Hyderabad and have identified these neighbourhoods.", "This information is useful for people also when they have moved in the city and are looking to buy a house or rent a place to live because they would definitely want to choose a neighbourhood which has easy access in terms of transportation and number of options of good schools for their children.", "As I have explained earlier, the target audience will be the government agencies looking to build school infrastructure, the private sector agencies looking to build schools in areas with good potential and the people looking for houses in different neighbourhoods to identify which ones will be closer to good schools.", "I have used beautiful soup to scrape the various neighbourhoods in Hyderabad from this source.", "Then I have obtained the Latitudes and Longitudes of these neighbourhoods using geocoder library in Python.", "I have then used FourSquare API to obtain the location of various schools in each neighbourhood setting the limit to 100 for each neighbourhood and a radius of 1km.", "For plotting the choropleth map, I have acquired the geojson file of Hyderabad from this source.", "There were some unwanted entries in the dataset which I have dropped. There was a duplication of data because it was possible that a school was within 1000 metres distance from each neighbourhood as a result of which it may appear twice with the same latitude and longitude in both these neighbourhoods. I have removed such duplicates and have kept the first copy of such data.", "This is an image of the first 9 entries of the dataframe used.", "Each row corresponds to a particular school and its information, i.e. neighbourhood it belongs to, its category, name and its location.", "There are a total of 235 entries in the dataframe.", "Using this data I have analyzed the distribution of schools in Hyderabad.", "It can be observed that the schools are clustered more in the centre of the city which can be expected.", "First, the data has been retrieved and cleaned as explained previously. The data consists of schools within a radius of 1km for each neighbourhood with a limit set to 100.", "Next, we analyze the data by exploring the various categories to which the schools belong.", "After this, we explore the distribution in each neighbourhood in a more explanatory way using choropleth maps for visualization. This gives us a good idea of the distribution of schools.", "Then for those neighbourhoods where there are no schools we find the distance to the closest school by incrementing the radius by 100 metres in each iteration until a school is found using Folium.", "On obtaining this refined data, consisting of the distance to the nearest school for each neighbourhood and the number of schools in each neighbourhood we cluster this data using K-Means. This helps us identify those regions where there is a need for improvement and those neighbourhoods which have good facilities in terms of schools.", "Finally, we will discuss and conclude which neighbourhoods require an improvement of facilities in terms of schools and which regions have very good facilities.", "Based on the data obtained from Folium about schools, I explored the categories to which schools belong.", "The various categories of schools are as follows:", "As we can see most of the schools have \u201cnot mentioned\u201d their category. An interesting thing to note is that a lot of these schools provide education from kindergarten level to high school. Hence there is no surprise in finding only a few schools providing only primary/play level education as the big schools already cover this. Also \u201cStudent Center\u201d categorized schools provide education from kindergarten level to high school (included).", "Using Choropleth map, we can get a good idea of the distribution of schools.", "(Note: This map does not cover neighbourhoods in Secunderabad as I could obtain only the geospatial data of those neighbourhoods covered by GHMC.)", "It is clear from the map that most of the schools are clustered in the centre of the city especially near the Abids, Himayath Nagar, Basheerbagh areas. In fact, a lot of good schools are present in these neighbourhoods and they are close to each other.", "Towards the outskirts of the city, the density of schools decreases which is clear in the map. This is expected as the neighbourhood near the center are more crowded than those in the outskirts.", "Also, these are older regions and the outskirts are being developed now.", "We will now cluster the neighbourhoods using K-Means clustering algorithm into 3 clusters based on the distance to nearest school and number of schools in each neighbourhood.", "These features form a good basis for identifying the neighbourhoods requiring improvement.", "The nearest distance to school is varied between a radius of 1km to 2km.", "Next, we look into the different clusters. The averages of the features for each cluster is as follows.", "Obviously, the average of Latitudes and Longitudes has no meaning in this context.", "As it is clear, the neighbourhoods labeled 0 not only have schools within 1km (which let me remind you is the starting point for nearest distance and it can\u2019t get any better) but also have a number of options in terms of schools with an average of 18.63 . These neighbourhoods have hence access to excellent education facilities in terms of school level. Some neighbourhoods in this cluster are Abids, Himayath Nagar and Basheerbagh all of which are close to the city center.", "The neighbourhoods labeled 1 also have easy access to good education facilities at school level within almost 1km radius with an average of about 3 schools per neighbourhood. Most of the neighbourhoods fall under this category.", "The neighbourhoods labeled 2 are the ones requiring improvement as the average distance to nearest schools is close to 2km with no schools within 1km of the neighbourhood. These are present mostly in the outskirts of the city. Some neighbourhoods in this region are Alwal, Jeedimetla, Cherlapally, Patancheru, ECIL X Roads etc.", "The blue circles correspond to label 0, the green ones to 1 and the red ones to 2.", "We have observed the various categories the schools belong to in Hyderabad, with most of them being more of general schools which provide education from kindergarten level itself till 12th grade.", "Also, we observe that schools providing education only at primary level are comparatively less which is expected.", "Next, we have observed the distribution of schools and find that mostly they are concentrated towards the center of the city and are less dense in the outskirts. This is clear from the Choropleth map.", "So when someone is looking to find a neighbourhood with easy access to good facilities, they should find such neighbourhoods closer to the center of the city.", "Finally, we have clustered the neighbourhoods into 3 clusters and have observed that most of the neighbourhoods fall under category with label 1, i.e, the average distance to nearest school for these neighbourhoods is 1025 metres and there are about 3 schools on average in these neighbourhoods.", "These regions consist of potential neighbourhoods for the private sector to build schools in, because they don\u2019t have many schools but at the same time there will be many people living in these neighbourhoods as they have access to good facilities.", "We have also identified the neighbourhoods requiring improvement which is the motive of this analysis.", "These neighbourhoods have a school with an average radius to closest school close to 2km which was the upper limit set on the distance to nearest school feature. Some neighbourhoods in this region are Alwal, Jeedimetla, Cherlapally, Patancheru, ECIL X Roads etc.", "These are the regions requiring attention in terms of improvement at the school level. The government should concentrate on these areas.", "The full list of neighbourhoods in each cluster can be found in the jupyter notebook I have attached.", "In this analysis, the distribution of schools in Hyderabad has been analysed. Also, the various neighbourhoods have been clustered based on their access to school facilities. The neighbourhoods requiring improvement have been identified along with those neighbourhoods which have the potential for profitable schools. Also, the various categories of schools have been observed.", "Your home for data science.
