Most AI initiatives have their budgets cut because they don\u2019t deliver results quickly enough.", "The problem is not technology or talent. The culprit is often a corporate culture and organizational structure designed for a pre-AI age. To deploy AI at scale, executives must build a culture where business and technical teams can collaborate seamlessly.", "What follows is a 10-part framework to help executives prepare their company for AI implementation at scale. This is not a sequential list for companies to progress along. Most companies will be proficient at one or more parts of this framework.", "Instead, this executive guide describes the necessary conditions for a culture of successful AI implementation. Business leaders can use this framework to diagnose their company\u2019s proficiency in each of these areas.", "Almost every CEO says they are \u2018doing AI\u2019, just like your friend tells you that he is \u2018hitting the gym\u2019.", "Both of these people probably won\u2019t get the results they hoped for. Many companies won\u2019t go beyond AI pilot projects and your friend will tell you that he\u2019s too busy to exercise.", "The Gartner CIO survey in 2019 claimed that 37% of 3,000 surveyed companies have deployed AI. It is a safe bet that many of the remaining 63% have hit a snag or two in their AI journey.", "Technology and talent are not enough. Firms must break down cultural barriers and rethink organizational structures to deploy AI across departments and geographies.", "There is no single blueprint for enterprise AI deployment. How firms approach AI implementation depends on their size, talent pool, and AI maturity.", "Executives can, however, use this 10-part framework to guide them on their AI transformation journey:", "AI enables businesses to classify data, find patterns, predict outcomes and make repeated decisions at scale.", "Scale matters. It is relatively easy for a bank to deploy a machine learning tool for customer segmentation to help with cross-selling and up-selling. It is more challenging \u2014and far more rewarding \u2014 to deploy a suite of AI solutions to optimize the entire customer journey from on-boarding to ongoing relationship management.", "How can firms build and deploy a portfolio of scalable AI solutions? It comes down to organizational structure and culture. Firms must promote collaboration across business and tech teams so that AI solutions can accommodate evolving business needs. Organizational structures must also be fluid enough to allow AI talent to be deployed where it is needed most.", "Firms must increase AI awareness throughout the organization. Everyone from the C-Suite to individual contributors must be aware of how AI can solve business problems and how they can work with AI tools.", "AI education can be internal or external. Companies with high AI maturity will set up internal AI academies and on-the-job training programs. Other companies can use external trainers and consultants for classroom sessions and workshops.", "C-level executives and senior managers will already have a deep understanding of their company\u2019s business needs, goals and challenges. Therefore, they must build AI awareness so that they can:", "Firms must invest in technical training for their data scientists, AI engineers, and those who build AI tools. Depending on their roles, their training can include:", "Also known as analytics translators, this emerging role will bridge the business and tech teams to ensure that AI products satisfy business needs. Business translators may also manage technical staff that build AI tools and take ownership of AI project implementation and adoption.", "Business translators usually come from the business side (e.g. project managers, business analysts, subject matter experts, business unit managers). They will already have a sound understanding of the business and may also be skilled in project management, people management, or strategic planning.", "Business translators will need fundamental technical training and AI awareness in order to:", "These are the end users of AI tools in marketing, finance, sales, or other functions. These employees need training on how to use AI tools in their day-to-day jobs. They also need to overcome any fear of AI.", "Most people are afraid that AI and automation will take away their jobs. Managers may feel offended if executives value machines over their own people\u2019s skill and experience. Executives must convince employees that AI will help them achieve more. They must tell a compelling story about why AI is critical and how it will benefit the company and its people.", "Crucially, executives must convince employees that humans will always be the most important part of the equation. While AI can generate data-driven insights and automate processes, only humans have the common sense and functional knowledge to apply these insights. Think of AI as augmented intelligence instead of artificial intelligence.", "Realistically, there will be some job loss due to automation. Jobs that involve routine and repetitive tasks are at most risk. However, headlines screaming about how one-third of jobs will be lost to automation don\u2019t tell the whole story. AI automates tasks and not entire jobs. The real story is about AI augmentation of employees, not large-scale AI substitution.", "Employees should welcome AI augmentation. Once mundane tasks are automated, employees can devote more time to impactful and fulfilling work. Employers want this too. Deloitte\u2019s AI in the Enterprise survey of 1,900 AI adopters revealed that a leading benefit of AI was that it freed up employees to be more creative.", "Employees are more likely to embrace AI if they believe it is critical to growth (or survival). Retail executives need only point to the existential threats posed by Amazon and e-commerce. Explaining how AI can make the retailer more efficient and responsive is compelling. Underscoring the critical role that employees play and painting a picture of future success will bring employees fully on-board.", "A company\u2019s odds of AI success increase when its executives can explain their AI transformation vision. A transformation vision is not about individual use cases. It is about winning big in the market.", "Specifically, the C-Suite should have detailed answers to four questions:", "Consider an HVAC company that installs heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment in office buildings. They see an opportunity to combine sensors with machine learning to manage temperatures throughout the building based on human activity. This enables the HVAC company\u2019s clients to minimize energy usage. In this case, energy savings from AI adoption will differentiate the company and help it gain market share.", "This is the start of the HVAC company\u2019s AI transformation vision. Next, they should ask themselves how they are going to win by leveraging their data, talent, and culture.", "An AI transformation vision should inform the company\u2019s AI strategy and project portfolio. It should also help the firm prioritize AI projects.", "A long term AI transformation vision will help executives commit to a multi-phase AI journey. Executives will realize that the real benefits will take time. Without a long-term vision, executives might pull the plug if they don\u2019t see results quickly.", "Even successful AI projects may take time to generate ROI. Pilot projects may not yield a financial ROI at all. Still, if the pilot teaches the firm about how data infrastructures should be overhauled to enable large-scale AI adoption, this is a valuable quick win.", "Pilot projects don\u2019t cost much and can give the firm valuable insights to build scalable AI solutions. They can reveal what type of data should be collected at higher volumes or detail and identify where the current data gaps are. This knowledge will help the firm develop core capabilities related to data collection and governance, for instance.", "Executives that commit to a long term transformation vision are more likely to incentivize and encourage a culture of innovation where financial ROI isn\u2019t the only measure of success. This mindset opens the door to greater financial ROI in the long term.", "Successful AI transformation is driven by a portfolio of projects with different time horizons.", "Measurable benefits from larger, more ambitious AI initiatives may take years while incurring significant costs in the short term. Investing solely in large multi-year projects creates budgetary pressure and executive impatience.", "Firms should plan a portfolio of AI projects with different time horizons. This enables the firm to enjoy a steady stream of benefits from short term projects, which persuades executives to continue their support. A well-structured AI project portfolio consists of:", "Suppose a bank has an AI transformation vision to \u2018gain greater market share by streamline the entire customer journey with AI.\u2019 Projects should then make it easier for customers to sign up, help the bank provide a convenient and tailored customer service, which in turn convinces more people to sign up.", "Pilot projects are mainly for learning and concept validation. Their value comes from showing the firm where they are now, and what they need in terms of data, talent, and infrastructure in order to successfully deploy AI.", "Short term projects focus on generating \u2018quick wins\u2019 from single use cases. The bank might start with a project that automates Know Your Customer (KYC) processes during client on-boarding. AI-enabled automation tools are readily available and KYC processes are standardized, making this a shorter-term project that helps the bank cut costs and increase efficiency.", "Medium term projects can focus on higher value use cases that need more time to generate returns. After automating KYC, our bank might undertake a project to build a customer segmentation tool using unsupervised machine learning. This tool would place customers into clusters based on behavior and characteristics, enabling the bank to cross-sell more effectively and increase revenue.", "Long term projects provide the real value to the firm and its customers. These can be standalone projects or an initiative that combines smaller project implementations into a coherent solution. Our bank that wants to streamline the entire customer journey might create an app or web platform that handles customer on-boarding, provides tailored product recommendations, and provides customer service.", "A well-structured portfolio provides ROI in phases. In addition to the knowledge and insights from earlier phases, projects that generate ROI in phases can fund (and validate) future phases.", "Companies should aim to build AI internally in the long run. In the short run (and for specific use cases), buying AI tools from vendors can yield immediate returns.", "The case for buying AI. Partnering with AI vendors might speed up one-off AI projects, especially if the company is early on in its AI journey. An AI vendor might have the perfect tool for a use case, which saves the company time. Vendor expertise can also shorten the AI learning curve for a new internal AI team.", "The case for building AI. Internally built AI tools are more likely to satisfy business needs and mesh with data and workflows. Relying on vendor products for multiple AI initiatives isn\u2019t feasible in the long run. Vendors won\u2019t be familiar with the company\u2019s business needs, processes, and data. Off-the-shelf vendor tools may not integrate with the company\u2019s data and business processes. Companies also can\u2019t give vendors access to sensitive data. Crucially, building AI tools in-house allows the company to grow its AI capabilities and scale up.", "The hybrid approach. Partnering with an AI vendor to build customized AI tools is an option where a tailored solution is urgently needed. When internal staff can tell the vendor exactly what the tool should do, the tool is more likely to integrate with the company\u2019s processes and data. For instance, HSBC partnered with AI vendor Ayasdi to develop an AI-powered anti-money laundering tool. While HSBC undoubtedly has internal AI teams, they leveraged vendor expertise for quicker results.", "In addition to vendor partnerships, a good AI transformation vision calls for a centralized AI team that helps the entire company. This team will include data scientists, data engineers, machine learning engineers and AI product managers. Depending on the company\u2019s organizational structure, the team may report to the CTO, CIO, Chief Data Officer, or even a Chief AI Officer.", "The internal AI team\u2019s responsibilities will include:", "Which organizational model is best for deploying AI at scale? Where should AI talent reside within the firm? A Harvard Business Review feature on AI-powered organizations discusses three organizational models for scaling AI:", "Tasks related to AI strategy, projects, and adoption can be owned by any of three organizational layers: the Core, various business units, or a \u2018Grey Area\u2019 that works across the Core and business units.", "The Core is responsible for AI & data strategy, recruiting, governance, and partnering with AI & data vendors.", "The core creates AI standards, processes and best practices that help scale AI across the organization. This ensures that work isn\u2019t duplicated by business units and that AI deployments are seamless and in line with company standards.", "The Core should be in charge of data initiatives such as data cleaning, labeling and integration. These initiatives should be implemented gradually in concert with AI projects. There is no need to spend millions on company-wide data gathering and cleaning before business needs and AI use cases are identified \u2014 these data initiatives might be abandoned if management realizes that they don\u2019t fit AI project needs.", "Business units are responsible for adoption-related activities since they are the ultimate users of AI systems. These tasks include business analysis, encouraging adoption, training users, redesigning workflows, and measuring benefits.", "Business units must be ultimately accountable for the success of AI products. Since AI tools are designed to address business needs, leaders from business units, such as a regional manager, should be accountable for the AI product\u2019s success.", "Tasks that fall into the Grey Area can be owned by the Core or by individual business units. These tasks include project management, algorithm development, product design & testing, IT infrastructure, and change management.", "The choice of whether the Core or the Business units take ownership of these tasks depends on three factors:", "Firms should centralize AI talent & operations in the Core if they have low AI maturity, high urgency, and a simple business model. The opposite conditions call for decentralizing AI talent throughout the business units.", "AI maturity. A company starting its AI journey might centralize its data & analytics executives, data scientists, AI engineers, and supporting staff in the Core. This enables faster development of standardized tools, data processes, repositories, and infrastructure. Of course, these personnel can be deployed to the business units as needed.", "AI urgency. A company that needs to quickly deploy AI projects may choose to centralize its AI talent in the Core. This allows better monitoring of industry tech trends and easier coordination when building AI products.", "Business model. AI tools must sometimes support a large number of business units, geographies, or functions. In this case, the company\u2019s complex business model might convince executives to consolidate AI talent in the Core and assign them to other parts of the organization as needed.", "At the end of the day, this is more of an art than a science. A company that has to urgently deploy AI solutions and has a complex business model (suggesting centralization of AI talent) might have high AI maturity (which suggests decentralizing AI talent). In this case, executives should consider the relative importance of the three factors and determine whether AI talent will be most useful in the Core or in the business units.", "Suppose an AI project in a bank\u2019s portfolio involves building a KYC automation tool for a certain country. If the country\u2019s client relations team has previously deployed AI tools for client on-boarding, the team can take ownership of activities usually handled by the Core such as business case analysis and project implementation.", "AI should to improve daily operations by empowering people with data insights. Since operations are carried out by people, the firm must adopt a culture of data-driven decision making from the C-Suite to the trenches.", "When AI is adopted correctly, employees can augment their skills and judgement with algorithmic recommendations to achieve a better outcome than either humans or machines could on their own.", "This can only happen if employees can trust AI tools and feel empowered to make decisions. Trust is established through AI awareness (described above). Empowerment to make decisions happens when firms abandon the traditional top-down approach.", "Consider a national supermarket chain. Decisions about optimizing floor space and product placement are usually made by regional managers using historical data. For a supermarket chain with hundreds of stores, this type of top-down decision making may not result in the best outcomes for individual stores. In a data-driven decision making culture, local managers using an AI tool that tracks real-time in-store customer behavior are better placed to decide how a store displays products.", "AI needs lots of data from many parts of the organization. Many corporate departments store data in silos \u2014 systems that don\u2019t interface with each other and can only be accessed by specific teams. This is a barrier to AI adoption, but one that can be overcome.", "Large insurance companies are notorious for their data silos. Insurers tend to have dozens of standalone legacy (i.e. old) systems that are not connected to each other or to newer digital and cloud platforms. This isn\u2019t conducive to AI and digital initiatives that the industry is embarking upon.", "Insurers, like most data-heavy industries, are investing in either modernizing legacy systems or migrating data to digital systems, data lakes, and data warehouses. Data lakes and data warehouses both store big data. A data lake is a huge pool of raw data without structure or labels. A data warehouse stores structured, labeled data for specific purposes.", "Breaking down data silos isn\u2019t accomplished overnight. It is generally a bad idea to invest in expensive, large-scale data transformation before implementing AI. It is better to do both together so that data transformation is done according to the needs of your AI initiatives.", "AI pilot projects are helpful here \u2014 they reveal where the current data gaps are. With this knowledge, firms can start breaking down data silos intelligently.", "Business translators, described earlier, ensure that AI and data science solutions are designed with business needs in mind.", "Business and technical teams don\u2019t always speak the same language. A regional sales manager might know exactly what they want from an AI-powered customer segmentation tool \u2014 it should divide customers into buckets that represent which products they are interested in. However, the sales manager may not be able to communicate these requirements in technical terms to the data scientists or machine learning engineers actually building the tool.", "This is not a new problem in the corporate world. Companies that deploy internal IT systems or customer-facing mobile apps give ownership of these projects to IT-focused project managers and business analysts. IT project managers, for instance, understand the business objectives of the new IT system. They will also have a basic understanding of the technology and can oversee the technical staff that build the system.", "When it comes to AI initiatives, these business translators can be project managers, business analysts, or even internal consultants. They will need broad awareness of AI methods & capabilities so that they understand what the technical team is doing and give them direction.", "Business translators can use their awareness of business and AI to identify roadblocks to AI adoption. Early in the project, they can survey end-users, study workflows, speak with key stakeholders in the business and technical realms. This puts them in a position to diagnose and fix problems such as lack of employee buy-in or unreasonable expectations from end users.", "Identifying employees with business translator capabilities is essential. This role will soon be in high demand \u2014 and not too many people possess both AI awareness and business knowledge. The Deloitte AI in the Enterprise survey in 2019 found that business talent was almost as valued as AI talent, and even more so after companies implemented over 20 AI systems.", "AI awareness throughout the firm coupled with employee buy-in for AI initiatives lay the groundwork for AI adoption. However, these alone are not enough to ensure smooth AI integration with business processes. Firms must budget at least as much for adoption activities as they do for development.", "Integrating AI tools involves workflow redesign, training, and change management. These supporting activities should start well before deploying the AI solution. It helps prepare staff to work with the AI tool and avoid unpleasant surprises. It also ensures that staff are kept aware of, involved in, and supportive of, the AI journey.", "Starting early allows business translators and end-users to identify potential adoption issues before implementation. Perhaps the AI tool requires some workflow to be redesigned in a way that create more complications than benefits. Realizing this before deployment allows the technical team to modify the AI tool.", "AI is not easy. The ROI will take time. A company\u2019s AI journey is defined by its unique needs and situation \u2014 there will be uncharted territory to cross.", "Executives can prepare their companies for this journey by promoting a culture tailored to AI transformation. The 10-part AI transformation framework described above can help executives diagnose how the organization needs to change in order to deploy AI at scale.", "Scaling up AI takes time and knowing what to do is only the first step.
