the leadership of Dr. Maite Taboada), where we\u2019ve been actively developing and extending the Gender Gap Tracker, an automated Natural Language Processing (NLP) system that measures men and women\u2019s voices on seven major Canadian news outlets in real time. The Gender Gap Tracker is a collaboration between Informed Opinions, a non-profit dedicated to amplifying women\u2019s voices in the media and Simon Fraser University, through the Discourse Processing Lab and the Big Data Initiative.", "At a high level, we perform the following steps on a daily basis to generate statistics that allow us to quantify the number of men and women quoted in the news:", "Disclaimer: We acknowledge that gender is non-binary, and that there are different social, cultural, and linguistic conceptualizations of gender. For this project, we rely on name lookups from internal/external gender services in order to classify people mentioned and quoted as female, male, or other.", "In addition to our daily pipeline, we also run a monthly topic modelling pipeline that performs large-scale discovery of topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), on each month\u2019s English news articles. On average, we process 20,000\u201330,000 articles\u2019 worth of text per month to generate 15 topics (i.e., keyword distributions) for that month, that are then labelled by a human based on real-world knowledge of the month\u2019s events.", "All our NLP utilities (including the upstream tools that perform named entity recognition and quote extraction to extract gender statistics) are developed using Python and spaCy. Topic modelling, for reasons involving the sheer size of data being handled, is done using PySpark\u2019s scalable implementation of LDA.", "Although we do showcase our primary gender statistics (i.e., the proportion of female/male sources quoted by each outlet) on a live, interactive tracker website (hosted by Informed Opinions), we quickly realized the value of building our own custom dashboard for research and exploration purposes. The aim of our research dashboard (hosted here, on Simon Fraser University\u2019s servers) is to provide data scientists and software developers at the Discourse Processing Lab with the means to easily extend the existing data analysis framework, and to help answer new research questions that may arise in the future.", "We chose the Dash framework (by Plotly) to build our own custom interactive applications within a multi-page dashboard, all in Python. In this article, I\u2019ll highlight some of our results, design decisions, and why Dash is a great framework for tasks related to data science research and exploration.", "This section highlights a range of interactive tools implemented in the dashboard. Each high-level function is separated into its own application, accessible by clicking the respective button on the home page.", "This app takes in a user\u2019s input text, typically from a news article or blog post, and runs an NLP algorithm on the backend server to extract the text\u2019s quoted sources and people mentioned. The detected names are passed through our internal cache and gender service scripts to assign each name a gender (any one of \u2018female\u2019, \u2018male\u2019 or \u2018unknown\u2019). A doughnut chart showing the proportion of sources from each gender is displayed, along with the detected names and the quotes in the article/blog post.", "Because journalists employ a wide range of styles in naming the persons they quote, a naive system that simply looks for quotation marks in the text is nowhere near sufficient. The dependency-based parse tree of a text block, obtained using spaCy, plays a key role in our quote extraction system, locating the beginning and end of quotations using a sentence\u2019s syntactic structure. We first identify key verbs that are commonly used in quotation (defined using a custom, hand-curated verb list), and then locate the objects of each verb, i.e., clauses that are dependent on the verb, based on the parse tree. This allows us to find speakers of quotes regardless of the sentence structure and the presence of quotation marks.", "In addition, a coreference resolution algorithm (powered by neuralcoref) is used to link pronoun mentions (\u2018he\u2019 or \u2018she\u2019) to a prior named entity of the type \u2018PERSON\u2019. This allows us to capture quotes that do not directly name the speaker. The example snippet shown below highlights the range of quotes detected by our system.", "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that Canada will contribute $300 million towards the international effort to battle COVID-19.", "\u201cNone of us have been spared from the effects of COVID-19 and none of us can beat it alone.\u201d", "Canada will contribute $180 million to address the immediate humanitarian and development impacts of the pandemic, he said.", "\u201cWe are happy to see Minister Gould pushing for more investment because more is desperately needed,\u201d said Stuart Hickox, the Canadian director of the One Campaign.", "Try out your own custom news snippets on the text analyzer app to get the gender breakdown of the people quoted/mentioned!", "In this app, we showcase a new way to visualize the relationship between the topics covered in a news corpus and the gender of those quoted. Our primary goal through this app is to analyze whether female or male sources are more likely to be associated with specific topics in the news. As described earlier, we perform large-scale topic discovery on each month\u2019s data using an LDA algorithm implemented in Spark. The topic keywords discovered for that month, along with other relevant metadata, are written to a MongoDB database (which also hosts all the raw text data from the news articles). These keywords are then inspected by a human, at the start of each month, and labelled manually based on knowledge of the month\u2019s events.", "Because we store the topic distribution (as predicted by LDA) on a per-document basis, we can average these values based on the outlet that published the article. We plot the topic names, as labelled by a human, and these mean \u2018topic intensities\u2019 by outlet on a heat map, as shown below for the month of August 2019. The darker the colour, the more strongly that topic was covered, on average, by that outlet in that particular month.", "To study the relationship between topics and the gender of those quoted in articles pertaining to that topic, we first divide our article set for a given month into two subsets \u2014 those that quote a majority of female sources (i.e., at least one more female source quoted than male sources), and those that quote a majority of male sources. We then perform a similar averaging of topic intensities (i.e., the topic weights per article obtained from LDA) for each outlet. The results are once again plotted as a heat map, this time with a divergent colour scale from red to blue.", "The topic intensity plot (green) for August 2019 clearly shows that \u2018Sports\u2019 was a major topic that month, as were \u2018Crime and police investigations\u2019 and \u2018Business and consumer products\u2019. \u2018U.S. politics\u2019 was covered particularly extensively by Huffington Post Canada, in comparison to the other outlets. What is more interesting, however, is that in the second heat map, the \u2018Sports\u2019 and \u2018Healthcare & medical services\u2019 topics exhibit a strong female prominence, which is a term we use to describe topics that are strongly associated with women being quoted the majority of the time on average for that topic. The darker the red colour, the stronger the female prominence for a given topic and a given outlet. Conversely, the darker the blue colour, the stronger the male prominence for that topic.", "A deeper analysis on the \u2018Sports\u2019 topic for August 2019 showed that this was the period in the aftermath of the US women\u2019s soccer team winning the FIFA 2019 women\u2019s world cup. In addition, Canadian tennis player Bianca Andreescu had a dominant performance in the U.S. Open (which she later went on to win in September). As a result of numerous female players and coaches being quoted over the course of August 2019, the sports topic, which would normally be dominated by the quotes of male players and coaches, showed a strong female prominence in this particular month. Unsurprisingly, the \u2018U.S. politics\u2019 and Canadian \u2018Federal politics\u2019 topics exhibit strong male prominence, due to the sheer number of male politicians in both the U.S. and Canada being regularly quoted in articles pertaining to politics.", "Overall, we obtained some very interesting findings from the topic model app, which can be explored in more detail for all months dating back to October 2018.", "In this app, the quoted persons (male or female) from each article for are collected from our MongoDB database (after having been calculated independently by the NLP modules that run on a daily basis), and then aggregated to retrieve the number of quotes per person for any given month. These lists of top-quoted men and women are plotted as lollipops, the top 15 of which are shown below for the month of May 2020. Each dot represents the man/woman\u2019s quote count, and the length of the line connecting them represents the disparity in counts between either gender.", "It is very interesting that 10 of the top 15 quoted women in May 2020 are either medical officers or healthcare experts, as opposed to just 1 of the top 15 quoted men being from the healthcare domain. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many expert women (provincial/regional medical officers and physicians) holding prominent positions in various regions of Canada were brought to the forefront in the news. In fact, our data shows that Bonnie Henry, the Chief Provincial Health Officer of British Columbia, was the most quoted woman all through March-July 2020. The top-quoted men during the same period overwhelmingly tended to be politicians, both Canadian and American, presumably due to over-representation of men in this domain.", "Another interesting aspect of the lollipop plot shown above is its distribution \u2014 not only are men always quoted much more frequently than women, but also, the top-quoted people (both men and women) tend to be quoted far more often than people in the middle or bottom. This points to the Pareto principle, i.e., that a large proportion of resources is held by a small percentage of the population, also known as the 80/20 rule. While it is certainly possible that some people (especially politicians) get preferential treatment by the media because they already have a voice, recent evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that having more women in positions of power can increase the likelihood of journalists quoting them and improve gender parity overall.", "Similar trends and patterns can be explored in detail using the top-quoted sources app, for all months dating back to October 2018.", "This app visualizes a monthly time series of the number of quotes for a given person (male or female). Because of the size of our data (500,000+ articles with thousands of unique male/female sources over two years, and counting), we only display the names of prominent, public-facing men/women that appear in a month\u2019s top 50 quoted people. The trends are displayed using a line chart, as shown below.", "Exposing the number of quotes as a time series allows us to study interesting phenomena pertaining to individuals, such as \u201cthe rise of Bonnie Henry\u201d. In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-April 2020), a sharp increase was observed in the quote count for Bonnie Henry, the Chief Provincial Health Officer of British Columbia. Interestingly, her quote count is significantly higher than that of her federal counterparts (Theresa Tam, the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada and Patty Hajdu, the Federal Minister of Health), as well as that of Christine Elliott, Minister of Health for Ontario, a province with a much higher population than British Columbia. We think this could be due to two factors: 1) British Columbia was a success story in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to Bonnie Henry being talked about (and hence quoted) more frequently, and 2) both Ontario and Ottawa had multiple prominent public-facing women for journalists to quote, reducing each woman\u2019s overall share.", "Seeing whether the monthly trends app can help predict future outcomes, for example, the dominant players in elections, is a very interesting prospect, and we are keen to explore this further.", "In this section, I\u2019ll explain some of the technical details involved in building the dashboard, including some ideological and design decisions.", "In a research-focused environment such as ours, front-end web development skills (and knowledge of the associated JavaScript tools) are not easily available. Python is the natural choice of language for all aspects of this project, because of its massive, robust NLP and data science ecosystem. However, the Python visualization ecosystem is immensely complex, and it can quickly become overwhelming to decide between the multitude of options for the specific tasks at hand. There exist a number of great libraries for building dashboards and interactive visualizations in Python, such as Panel, Bokeh, Streamlit, and Dash.", "Panel is a novel, high-level dashboarding solution for Python that allows users to create interactive web apps and connect user-defined widgets to plots, images, tables or text. Unlike many other approaches, Panel attempts to be plotting library and environment-agnostic, i.e., it is designed to support nearly all Python plotting libraries, and work just as well in a Jupyter notebook or on a standalone web server. The key defining feature of Panel is that it allows users to separate their science/engineering/business logic from their GUI implementation, without getting tied to any particular GUI or web frameworks. Developed under the support of Anaconda Inc., Panel is an ambitious project that provides users the flexibility to move expensive computations and data processing between the server side and the client side, depending on the application\u2019s requirements and the size of the data. The Panel documentation contains a rich and detailed explanation of its features in comparison with other Python dashboarding frameworks.", "Streamlit is a light-weight, minimalistic framework to build dashboards in Python. The main focus of Streamlit is to provide users with the ability to rapidly prototype their UI designs using as few lines of code as possible. All the heavy lifting typically required to deploy a web application, such as defining the backend server and its routes, handling HTTP requests, etc., are abstracted away from the user. A certain degree of customizability is traded off for ease of use and rapid setup, making it ideal for early-stage interactive exploration of data and modelling results.", "Bokeh, also developed with the support of Anaconda Inc., is a visualization library that provides lower-level primitives for charts and widgets that can be used to power other higher-level charting libraries (such as Panel, or chartify). In Bokeh, high-level \u201cmodel objects\u201d (representing plots, axes, or other attributes related to plotting) are created in Python (or any other language), converted to JSON, and then consumed by a JavaScript client library, BokehJS. This decoupled architecture allows Bokeh to extend to other languages than Python, provide the backend code that runs the server, and ultimately power the UI event in the front-end (browser) via JavaScript.", "Dash is a powerful, highly customizable library for building dashboards in Python. It is written on top of Flask, Plotly.js and React.js, allowing for fluid, reactive web applications that scale well to multiple client sessions. In terms of its architecture and functionality, Dash is most similar to Bokeh, in that it allows users to define higher-level plot objects in Python (using an underlying Flask web server), whose underlying attributes are then consumed by a JavaScript library (Plotly.js) that fires events on the client side. Unlike Streamlit and Panel, Dash does require users to have some knowledge of the underlying HTML and CSS details, greatly increasing users\u2019 ability to customize the UI to their needs. Although Dash\u2019s web server can support other Python visualization libraries (such as Altair, Seaborn or matplotlib), it is still somewhat opinionated, with users encouraged to stick to the Plotly graph API for the most part, because this API has been tried and tested in production.", "As can be seen in the above figure, Dash provides the ideal combination of all our primary requirements. To start with, Dash uses a web server built on top of Flask (unlike the other three frameworks, which use Tornado), and is deployed just like traditional Flask servers using WSGI. Because we already had other dashboards and backend APIs based on Flask, it made more sense to build our new system with some level of compatibility. Dash is designed to store a session\u2019s state on a per-user basis, within the client (i.e., the browser). This is apt in terms of scalability for our use case, because we need a system where many simultaneous client sessions are able to view results from the database without necessarily using up server resources.", "We opt to work around any potential computational bottlenecks on the server side by designing our apps such that they never request huge amounts of data from the server at any one time. Any NLP computations (e.g., in our text analyzer app) only request highly specific data (such as gender values for a given name) and run in near real-time, so the server is unlikely to be bogged down due to compute-heavy requests by many simultaneous client sessions. To avoid repeating expensive calculations for each user, a number of options are available for caching intermediate results (on the client side) that can be reused within the session. Most importantly, Dash offers a great deal of freedom in terms of page design and layout\u2014 it allows the developer to directly modify the underlying HTML and CSS attributes, providing much greater flexibility in customizing the dashboard\u2019s appearance.", "The dashboard is deployed using a multi-page layout, to make it more extensible as time goes on. A simple, responsive HTML layout based on this CSS template is used to allow for flexible rearrangement of components based on the user device\u2019s display resolution. Each app\u2019s layout and source code is self-contained, in its own Python file, and within a clearly defined zone outside the sidebar as shown below. An arbitrary number of independent apps can be added using this structure.", "A Dash app can be conceptualized as being made of three main blocks of code. The first of these is the application layout, which contains the structure of the web page, including all the interactive widgets and core components (dropdowns, text inputs, etc.) required by the user to modify an app\u2019s state. All code is written in Python, using Dash\u2019s wrappers around Plotly\u2019s graph objects and generic HTML.", "The next block defines the callbacks for the app, which are functions (defined using Python\u2019s decorator syntax) that allow users to observe, modify and update the properties of any component in the UI. Because all Dash code is written in Python, it integrates very well with pandas, allowing specific results to be returned on the fly based on user input. In this example, a dropdown\u2019s selected value is passed as an input argument to a callback, which executes asynchronously to filter the contents of a preloaded pandas DataFrame, returning just the required data. This data is output as a Plotly figure object and rendered as a line chart on the browser.", "The third block contains user-defined, custom functions, primarily written to make the callbacks and the application layout more readable. For example, if we were performing a slightly more complicated action along with filtering the DataFrame, that portion of code could be factored out into a separate function, making the callback much more readable. The example below is the same as the one above, except that the filtering steps are factored out to an external function, greatly improving readability in complex cases.", "Using this 3-block structure, arbitrarily complex apps can be designed to perform data manipulation and NLP tasks on the fly.", "One common problem that arises when performing NLP tasks is that of expensive bottleneck computations that can increase an app\u2019s response time. For example, in the text analyzer app described earlier, we are required to perform named entity recognition, coreference resolution and gender prediction on a potentially large list of names, all in real time, based on arbitrary text input by the user. This is further complicated by the fact that multiple components in the app \u2014 the doughnut charts and multiple data tables \u2014 all need to access the same intermediate data.", "Rather than perform the same (potentially expensive) calculation multiple times for each callback, we apply Dash\u2019s inbuilt mechanisms to share state between callbacks. The simplest way to do this is to store expensive-to-compute intermediate data as in-memory JSON, that can be accessed by every subsequent callback without wasteful recomputation. An example is shown below.", "In the snippet shown above, a user first inputs a condition (e.g., a date filter), for which we read specific data from a MongoDB database using the pymongo library. Then, we perform some expensive calculation on this data (using the function expensive_calc) within the first callback. The data computed from this callback is stored as JSON and kept in memory on the client side, where it can then be accessed for free by the second callback. It is trivial to then transform the JSON data blob into a pandas DataFrame, following which it can be output to a Plotly figure object and rendered as a chart on the client side.", "In building each application for the Gender Gap Tracker research dashboard, design decisions were taken to minimize the amount of data being transferred between the server and the client. Because our primary data storage layer is in MongoDB, all data must be passed around as JSON. Due to the immense size of the data in this project (500,000+ news articles from over a two year period, and counting), we only work with aggregated quantities (precomputed through intermediate operations on these JSON objects) in all our visual components. All charts (heat maps, lollipop plots and line charts) display precomputed values that either sum up or average the individual values over a specified time period. This is mainly done to maintain reasonable response times and to provide a fluid run time experience.", "The Gender Gap Tracker is the result of many months\u2019 work by a team of eight at Simon Fraser University, whose findings draw from various fields, including big data, computer science, social science, media and linguistics. We are excited to present more nuanced results of this interdisciplinary work for consumption by the broader public, and are always open to feedback!", "We thank Alexandra Wilson at Simon Fraser University, who provided invaluable guidance on the design, layout and colour styles for the dashboard. We\u2019re also grateful to to Alexandre Lopes at SFU Research Computing, who built and maintains the database and server infrastructure for the Gender Gap Tracker.", "The research dashboard for the Gender Gap Tracker and our most recent results can be explored in detail here:", "The code for the dashboard and the NLP functionality described in this article is available on the project\u2019s GitHub repo, shown below.", "Engineer by training.
