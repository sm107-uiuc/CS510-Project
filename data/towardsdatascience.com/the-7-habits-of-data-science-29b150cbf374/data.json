Repeat.", "In the world of data science, most of the work I do is exploring unknown realms (read: data). The workflow is more or less similar to every project iteration. Data gathering \u2014 exploration \u2014 process\u2014modeling \u2014 test \u2014 deploy\u2014monitor \u2014 present \u2014 repeat. I wonder then, how can I make sure I\u2019m not just repeating the same cycle over and over again? How can I do better?", "The answer I found is: adapt my habit. How you:", "are habits that are often overlooked. Remember, data science isn\u2019t about building the best model but making positive impacts through data. Your habit affects your response to each problem.", "Inspired by Stephen R. Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People changed me. It\u2019s still a powerful book to read for me. Data science or not, applying these habits in my workflow boosts up my productivity. I want to share with you, these habits that have put me in a positive frame of mind.", "So here\u2019s my take on the 7 habits, seen through my lens of data science. As we go through it, ask yourself, do you need to work on these habits?", "Well, not that kind of active. Instead, take initiative for the greater good.", "Data science isn\u2019t about doing what stakeholders want. It\u2019s the tool to growth hack and solves business problems. No one understands the data more than you do. An effective data guy should recommend on how data can be utilized! People may not be aware of the power of data.", "Focus on what value the data can bring!", "\u201cReactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values \u2014 carefully thought about, selected and internalized values.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Covey", "Data science isn\u2019t about finishing your work but finding the best path to your goal.", "When answering business questions, figure out what the outcome will be. Without it, no project can be well-planned and well-executed. How can we work on something when we don\u2019t know the scope? An effective data guy should have a good idea of how the project will be done. Best practices for each project may differ.", "Whether it be a dashboard, a model, a data product, or a spreadsheet file; what\u2019s the best output and how to do it?", "\u201cTo begin with the end in mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination. It means to know where you\u2019re going so that you better understand where you are now and so that the steps you take are always in the right direction.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Covey", "Data science isn\u2019t about how many analysis you\u2019ve done.", "Tackling the most important and urgent problem must be prioritized. If a data science team is overwhelmed by the sheer number of requests, these 4 quadrants must be made clear. An effective data guy knows what should\u2019ve been done first. Why should we bother on insignificant things?", "To measure what\u2019s important, what\u2019s urgent, and always stick with the highest priority will pay off in the long run.", "\u201cThe key is not to prioritize what\u2019s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Covey", "Data science isn\u2019t about your work performance.", "Ever hit a roadblock with anyone and wanting to solve it your way? Great organization collaborates within (even outside). Thinking how both sides win is essential to gain trust and secure long term success. An effective data guy knows that everyone can win! If one can\u2019t win, think again.", "Focus on solutions that are not one-sided or even just a quick fix.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not your way or my way; it\u2019s a better way, a higher way.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Covey", "Data science isn\u2019t about how complex your project is.", "Most data people think numbers & logic-driven, while the rest majority don\u2019t. Not all problems can be explained by numbers though. The key to attaining a full understanding of people is empathy and open-mind. An effective data guy should understand first before making assumptions. False approach is less effective.", "Seeking another point of view may open up another better possibility. Let\u2019s listen more!", "\u201cMost people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Covey", "Data science isn\u2019t about your solo-work.", "For a well-built plan to be executed with perfection, teamwork is essential. Imagine this: data modeling without implementation; dashboard without user\u2019s defined metrics; analytics without data engineering. Useless. An effective data guy must be able to work in sync with others. Organization exists because everyone is in it.", "Seek collaboration! Each person may offer different and better alternatives.", "\u201cSynergy is better than my way or your way. It\u2019s our way.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Covey", "I have realized, data science is HUGE.", "A deeper understanding of data science can only be obtained through consistent learning. Strive for more knowledge and adapt to new problems. There\u2019s no one size fits all. An effective data guy is always ready to tackle any problem. Develop yourself and take on the challenge!", "Remember that you are your greatest asset!", "\u201cUnless you\u2019re continually improving your skills, you\u2019re quickly becoming irrelevant.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Covey", "I\u2019ve known these habits for around 5 years now, yet I\u2019m still working on it. Controlling habit is hard since they force you to get out of your comfort zone. But, instead of worrying over things you can\u2019t control, remember that you only have control over yourself.", "\u201cStart small, make a promise and keep it. Then, make larger promises and keep them.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Covey", "Going further, there\u2019s actually the 8th habit. Find your voice and inspire others to find theirs. The talk shifts from effectiveness to greatness. Expressing vision, discipline, passion, and conscience\u200a\u2014\u200ainto inspiration. Consider reading it if you\u2019re a data science leader!", "One step at a time! Stay safe and healthy, folks.", "Your home for data science.
