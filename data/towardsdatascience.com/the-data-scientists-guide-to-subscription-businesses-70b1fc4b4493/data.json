A data scientist is expected to understand the business in order to develop effective solutions. She must also be able to communicate her work effectively to stakeholders.", "There are various ways data science could impact the business. First, the product can be made more data-driven using techniques from data science. One example is recommender systems within the product to provide timely and related content to product users.", "Second, statistical models can directly optimize current internal processes, thereby making business and engineering processes more efficient and reducing operational costs. Statistical models can help in logistics by forecasting inventory levels at a warehouse, for example.", "Third, data science can help with marketing and product discoverability efforts, essentially getting the word out there to market segments that have yet to know of a business\u2019s product. Models that segment the customer base, predicting customer actions, and models that generate copywriting for call-to-action (CTA) dialogs come to mind. Something as minor as surfacing a product feature to a user based on their action on the platform helps with observability of said feature.", "These examples are a non-exhaustive list of data science applications, of course. All of these initiatives, however, ultimately affects a business\u2019s key metrics. There are many definitions of business metrics, some very specifically tailored to the individual business itself. Fortunately, many key business metrics are simple to understand and don\u2019t require an MBA.", "There are many business models out there, but in this article, we will focus on a dominant model: subscription-based businesses, with particular emphasis on how data science helps to optimize these businesses.", "A subscription-based business model, in simple terms, is a business that bills customers on a recurring interval, typically monthly or yearly, for access to products or services. The subscription-based model has become very popular with software businesses, particularly due to the rise of the cloud, resulting in many Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) businesses.", "Note that SaaS businesses may not necessarily be subscription-based businesses, as a pay-as-you-go models (such as Snowflake\u2019s) do exist. In the latter, a customer only pays for the amount used. However, it is often the case that a subscription-based business model is adopted.", "Examples of subscription businesses include Netflix\u2019s streaming service, newspaper and magazine subscriptions such as the New York Times, and Hello Fresh, which delivers preset meals to subscribers.", "Some older tech businesses are also adopting this model. Adobe, for example, has also been transitioning some of its well-known products such as Photoshop and Lightroom to the cloud via its Creative Cloud. Microsoft\u2019s Office Suite products have also been transitioning to a subscription-based model instead of a licensing one in the past.", "There are subscription businesses that have a large free user base and a small proportion of subscription (premium) users. The goal is to have a network of users who provide data that can be used to enhance user experience of the paid product. Free users can also be monetized via advertising, which also provides some amount of user friction, and can nudge them into paying for the paid product, which typically does not contain advertising.", "One prominent example is Spotify\u2019s free and Spotify Premium products which has elements of both.", "The success of such a business depends on how effective the business is at monetizing its user base as the user base grows. A business is considered good if about 5% of the user base are subscribers of the premium service\u00b9, although this proportion can be decreased with more expensive subscription rates.", "The success of a subscription-based business model is typically determined by two important metrics: annual recurring revenue (ARR) and churn rates of its subscription service.", "The ARR is defined as the total sum of all the annual value of every single subscription. It is typically better to normalize revenue over the subscriber base, since there may be different tiers of subscription plans. The average revenue per user (ARPU) is simply the average measure of revenue contribution on a per-user basis.", "A subscriber churns when the subscriber terminates her relationship with the business. The churn rate is simply the average number of subscribers that cancelled their subscription over the number of active subscribers in a fixed time period. Typically the period range are set to 7, 14, and 30 days. Longer ranges help smooth out irregularities due to inactivity from subscribers, for instance, due to seasonal effects such as holidays. However, this is a lagging metric since it can only be calculated retrospectively.", "A retention curve visualizes the churn rates. This is measured on a cohort and tracked over the months since the start of subscription. Ideally, we want retention to remain high more than a year after subscription with a flattening or better still, a smiling curve. The latter means that customers are returning months later. This can be seen in the graph I\u2019ve drawn below.", "As for a real world example, this article has retention curves for Blue Apron, Hello Fresh, the Dollar Shave Club and Netflix. Netflix has the best retention, while Hello Fresh has the worst.", "A final related measure, often used in SaaS businesses, that accounts for churn financially is the net revenue retention. Given a cohort, it is the monthly recurring revenue (MRR) of the cohort presently divided by its MRR a year ago. This metric not only captures the impact of revenue churn, but also the upside from other initiatives such as upgrades and cross-sells.", "In most SaaS businesses, there are free users and subscribers. The user base is important to the business as the user network builds a moat around other competitors. What\u2019s important isn\u2019t the number of users who have signed up. Instead, it is the number of active users of the product or service.", "An active user is a user who has engaged with the product, such as logging in and using features of the product. The very definition of an active user would be specific to the business. The daily active users (DAU) or monthly active users (MAU) would be key measures, depending on whether the product/service is a daily use one (such as NetFlix), or a monthly used one.", "Similarly, daily new users (DNU) or monthly new users (MNU) tracks new users. Separating new users from active users allow us to track how fast new users are being added to the business. It also be measures the effectiveness of marketing efforts.", "There are arguments that DAU and MAU are vanity metrics in that they provide no real value other than bragging rights. These metrics don\u2019t provide a measure of user satisfaction with the product/service, nor does it measure valuable the user is finding the product/service. On the flip side, it is a simple enough metric to track (provided the definition of what \u201cactive\u201d is solid), and gives stakeholders an idea of how much the business is growing.", "A related concept is the subscription\u2019s lifetime value (LTV). The LTV is a function of both the subscription\u2019s price and the churn rate. It also includes a discount rate, to discount the future value of the cash obtained from a subscription. Subscribers are not made equal: a small proportion will have a higher LTV than most, and these are the subscribers a business aims to keep happy.", "For simplicity, we assume a subscriber\u2019s (economic) lifetime to last forever. Then, the formula is", "where the retention rate is 1 minus the churn rate and the gross contribution is the gross revenue made per customer in a year. There are more sophisticated formulae that accounts for variable retention rates per month, for example.", "Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is the cost of sales and marketing per newly acquired user. It is a measure of efficiency of the marketing spend. It is clear that if we\u2019re spending too much acquiring a new customer, that\u2019s a bad thing.", "We can calculate the CAC on a per marketing channel basis in order to quantify the efficiency of the channel.", "A related measure is to take the ratio between the LTV and CAC. This measures how well marketing spend is, in bringing in high value subscribers to the business. A rule-of-thumb says that the LTV-CAC ratio should ideally be around 3:1. There is too much marketing spend at 1:1, and too little at 5:1. This would, again, be dependent on the objectives of the business.", "Data science itself plays a role in directly forecasting and optimizing these metrics through improving marketing and helping to convert customers to the subscription product. Here are some useful applications.", "Forecasts of the ARR and ARPU are used to know if the business is performing well.", "Time series analysis models are used to forecast the ARR and ARPU. Since revenue is subject to seasonal changes, the SARIMA (seasonal ARIMA) model and its variants would be used to make the forecast. These days, fortunately, a lot of the complexity for financial forecasting are handled by powerful libraries such as Facebook\u2019s Prophet.", "By far the most important area is churn prediction. It is well accepted that keeping a customer in a subscription product is better than acquiring new customers. The reason is simple: it costs a whole lot less to keep a customer happy, than it is to spend on marketing (affliates, SEO, growth tools) to attract new customers.", "Broadly speaking, we can think of the data science application to churn at the macro and micro level.", "At the macro level, we forecast churn over predefined cohorts of subscribers, like in the retention curve chart shown above. These are aggregated groups of subscribers, for instance, over a geographic region such as North America. Its purpose is to track churn rates of the business over time as product rollouts continue, to see if the product is providing more value to subscribers over time.", "Typically some form of modeling is used to compute the different plans to get an accurate metric. At a high level, there are model-based and non-parameteric techniques. The latter includes standard survival analysis techniques such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator.", "It is worth noting that the word \u201csubscription\u201d itself is a loaded term. It often belies the complexity of what exactly a subscription is. A subscription itself may be as simple as pay a set amount each month. It can also be as complex as having multiple types of \u201cstates\u201d: subscription holds, various discounts used based on payment method to incentivize signups, and different types of plans (e.g., single vs. family plans in Spotify). There may be different subscription plans and pricings for different geographic regions because of localization efforts.", "Subscriptions often have various states, so are amenable to model-based techniques. For instance, semi-Markov models can model the different subscription states, as well as the drop in subscriptions between state transitions. Semi-Markov models are used instead of Markov models because the duration between state transitions may follow arbitrary time duration distributions, which a Markov model cannot capture (a Markov model assumes time between state transitions are geometrically distributed).", "From my practical experience, use simple models to model and forecast churn rates. A chief reason for this is explainability: a data scientist would often have to explain how a churn forecast is made.", "The Fader-Hardie model is a simple yet very useful model for churn forecasts. The forecasts it produces are used to derive an estimate of subscriber LTV on various segments to give an idea what a high-value subscriber looks like. Moreover, it is simple enough to be explainable, since the beta distribution derived out of the model fitting stage gives a distribution of churn rates.", "The micro-level is where things get interesting. Here, machine learning models are developed to detect subscribers who are on the verge of churning. These models factor in various features about the subscriber to make a prediction of the subscriber churning.", "Features used come primarily from two sources: demographic and behavioral information. Demographic information, as the name suggests, are subscriber inherent information, such as where they come from, where they work, what age group and gender they are. Behavioral information are data gathered when the subscriber users the product, say login times and feature usage events.", "Demographic information is generally static, unlike behavioral information which changes as the product changes over time. Generally, a prediction model gets more information from behavioural information, because the subscriber may use the product in unintended ways. Moreover, the product/service changes often, especially with SaaS businesses where changes are as often as a new software release with near zero marginal distribution cost.", "The real goal of churn prediction is to intervene when a subscriber is likely to churn.", "Subscribers are ranked using their propensity to churn, and then intervention methods would be used on subscribers who \u201csitting on the fence\u201d about the product. The intervention methods used would largely be business specific. Some typical methods would include email, in-app notifications and discounted offers.", "Traditionally, the intervention process has been separate from the churn prediction component. There is now an emerging class of uplift models, which also accounts for the role the intervention method plays in churn. For instance, it is very possible that a subscriber churns when intervened, but retains when not (called the Do Not Disturbs). On the other hand, there are subscribers who would benefit from timely intervention, since the intervention method may be effective in proving the product\u2019s value (called the Persuadables). The goal then is to find the Persuadables out of a set of subscribers. The figure below presents these classes.", "Uplift modeling itself is a broad topic, outlined in a survey paper\u00b2.", "The goal of lead scoring is to find current free users who are likely to subscribe. Like churn prediction, both demographic and behavioral information of the free user are used for training a machine learning model to output a propensity score.", "Lead scoring is used to find potential converts to the product", "Users i.e., leads are then ranked from the most likely to convert to the lowest. Only the top proportion of users are nudged to convert to a subscription. If the leads are large businesses and enterprise potential customers, this ranked list of leads are passed on to a sales team.", "Again, uplift models can be used here in order to factor the cost of sales and marketing spend to nudge users to a subscription.", "We have only scratched the surface of what is a largely complex topic. There are many other business metrics, with some that are industry dependent. Data science has the potential to improve business efficiencies by directly targetting these business metrics, resulting in optimized revenue.", "I\u2019ll end on a caveat by quoting Goodhart\u2019s Law:", "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.", "Metrics are useful in that they provide a guidance on how well the business is performing. But it is important to not be obsessed with metrics. Any metric will not be able to capture subscriber experience, happiness with the product and ethics.", "[1] Eric Benjamin Seufert, \u201cFremium Economics: Leveraging Analytics and User Segmentation to Drive Revenue\u201d, Morgan Kaufmann, 2014.", "[2] Floris Devriendt, Jeroen Berrevoets, Wouter Verbeke, \u201cWhy you should stop predicting customer churn and start using uplift models\u201d, Information Sciences, December 2019.", "Your home for data science.
