A central paragraph by my own approximation reads:", "The democratizing power of the internet has been a tremendous boon for individuals, activists, and small businesses all over the world. But bad actors have long tried to use it for their own ends. White supremacists used electronic bulletin boards in the 1980s, and the first pro-al-Qaeda website was established in the mid-1990s. While the challenge of terrorism online isn\u2019t new, it has grown increasingly urgent as digital platforms become central to our lives. At Facebook, we recognize the importance of keeping people safe, and we use technology and our counterterrorism team to do it.

This post was made already on the 15th of June 2017.", "The top point of this post is Artificial Intelligence. We want to find terrorist content immediately, before people in our community have seen it. Facebook has clearly been using AI since at least 2017 to remove posts associated with terrorism (they claim it was recent at the time). At the time they seemed to focus their efforts on ISIS and Al-Qaeda.", "In the first quarter of 2018 they reported to have taken down 837 million pieces of spam and 2.5 million pieces of hate speech and disabled 583 million fake accounts globally. This was in relation to the statement saying it was assisted by using technology like: \u201c\u2026machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision..\u201d to detect \u2018bad actors\u2019 and move more quickly.

Understanding artificial intelligence in this context is of course not enough. Facebook has a community operations team that has to distinguish from a personal profile or a news story.

This article does of course describe the challenging conditions in which these moderators work, however it also mentions a stat of 15,000 moderators working around the world. It did seem rather a few of these were subcontracted through companies such as Cognizant having to sign NDAs, with secrecy supposedly protecting employees.", "\u201cCollectively, the employees described a workplace that is perpetually teetering on the brink of chaos. It is an environment where workers cope by telling dark jokes about committing suicide, then smoke weed during breaks to numb their emotions. It\u2019s a place where employees can be fired for making just a few errors a week \u2014 and where those who remain live in fear of the former colleagues who return seeking vengeance.\u201d", "It is perhaps ironic that in attempting to handling terror there is a degree of trauma caused to the handlers. Certain of they key findings by the report by The Verge seems interesting to stress or at least consider:", "According to the article these centres operate through accuracy standards which means posts reviewed are being reviewed. Facebook has set a goal of 95% accuracy, but Cognizant is usually never that high (closer to 80\u201392%). A moderator must suggest the correct community standard violation or risk loosing accuracy. The Verge article mentions a few different set of truths that a moderator has to consider.", "Further it is said that the challenge of keeping a job may be rather difficult: \u201cThe job resembles a high-stakes video game in which you start out with 100 points \u2014 a perfect accuracy score \u2014 and then scratch and claw to keep as many of those points as you can. Because once you fall below 95, your job is at risk.\u201d", "Fired employees regularly threatened to return to work and harm their old colleagues.

If there is no room for failure, then any smudge on the perfect surface can stain the image \u2014 of course this is important for Facebook.

The vast majority of these requests relate to criminal cases, such as robberies or kidnappings\u201d", "Facebook recently started partnering with ethics institutions focused on artificial intelligence. The focus of this partnership seem to be in the direction of safety, at least in Munich the Institute they have partnered with will address issues that affect the use and impact of artificial intelligence, such as safety, privacy, fairness and transparency. I have previously described that this can be problematic: an issue of self-policing ethical conduct.", "Facebook is creating a global oversight board. In a post by Nick Clegg, the new VP of Global Affairs and Communications in January 2019 a draft charter was released. The draft lists 11 questions alongside considerations and suggested approaches. More recently in late June 2019 another post was made by Facebook on this topic.", "It was stated they (Facebook) had traveled around the world hosting six in-depth workshops and 22 roundtables attended by more than 650 people from 88 different countries. They had personal discussions with more than 250 people and received over 1,200 public consultation submissions.", "Subsequently a 44-page report was released by Facebook called Global Feedback & Input on the Facebook Oversight Board for Content Decisions. This talks of a global constitution, board membership, content decisions and governance. Nick Clegg states in the introduction:", "\u201cOur task is to build systems that protect free expression, that help people connect with those they care about, while still staying safe online. We recognize the tremendous responsibility we have not only to fairly exercise our discretion but also to establish structures that will evolve with the times. Our challenge now, in creating this Oversight Board, is to shore up, balance, and safeguard free expression and safety for everyone on our platforms and those yet to come onto them, across the world.\u201d", "The report argues that there needs to be more democracy in Facebook. There needs to be a system to appeal decisions. The report gives different examples of moderation. It also states that Facebook undertook research to study the range of oversight models that exist globally which identified six \u201dfamilies\u201c of oversight design. The grid they presented looks like this.", "The Draft Charter suggests that Facebook will select the first cohort of members, with future selection to be taken over by the Board itself. The report stated that questioned were raised to this proposal of leaving future selection up to the Board itself, as this could result in both a \u201crecursion problem\u201d and possibly the \u201cperpetuation of bias.\u201d A few approaches were suggested for membership in the board:", "There was an agreed importance of diversity, though it was mentioned that perfect representation is not possible. It was mostly agreed that Facebook employees (current and former) should be excluded from the Board. It was suggested a fixed term of three years, renewable once.", "In the report it is suggested two ways to submit both for Facebook to send important or disputed content and for the users. Facebook has proposed that smaller panels, not the Board as a whole, will hear and deliberate on cases. It was clear that: \u201cA strong consensus emerged that the Board\u2019s decisions should influence Facebook\u2019s policy development.\u201d", "It was noted that Facebook was to establish an independent trust to remunerate (pay) board members. It was argued this board needed its own staff and that these be wholly independent of Facebook. The scope for the board will be content governance. However it was indicated that the board could hear other policy issues, such as: \u201c\u2026algorithmic ranking, privacy, local law, AI, monetization, political ads, and bias.\u201d", "Thus it can be said that Facebook and the field of artificial intelligence may be rather influenced by decisions made by this board in the future should it possibly be established. Indeed considering the scale of Facebook this can both influence private companies to adopt certain practices or nations to make legislation based on the decisions made by this semi-independent council. In the conclusion of the internal report it is stated:", "\u201cFacebook finds itself in a historically unique position. It cannot deprive or grant anyone the freedom of expression, and yet it is a conduit through which global freedom of expression is realized.\u201d", "In their Community Guidelines Snapchat does not define terrorism, yet they write: \u201cTerrorist organizations are prohibited from using our platform and we have no tolerance for content that advocates or advances terrorism.\u201d Yet we may ask ourselves two questions: what is a terrorist organisation and what does advocating terrorism mean in practice if it remains undefined? You could take the: \u201cI know terrorism when I see it\u201d-approach yet that leaves a lot up to ambiguous choices without transparency of decisions involved. This seems part of the wicked problem of terrorism: definitions.", "Terrorism in international politics is hard to define, and how you define it may also says a lot about how you think about politics more broadly. Although it is notoriously difficult to define it may be one of the future discussions to be undertaken should an oversight board from Facebook appear. The focus that Facebook has had on Islamic terror as opposed to right-wing extremism or gun violence in the United States is a worrying example. Yet their move to establish a board may be an appropriate response.", "The policing or ways that different governments request user data should continue to be under strong scrutiny with transparency. The state is an actor that can inflict violence; state-inflicted violence can be ambiguous, particularly when there are claims to state-sponsoring of terrorism. Most certainly the state can act using terror, and it is occurring, so does terrorist have to be in a minority group; is it genocide or terror; and does this distinction matter?", "Terror in some cases is about scaring people \u2014 violence is used in a restrictive case. Is it illegitimate use of violence by non-state actors aiming for the spread of ideology? If so whose ideology in a board run by Facebook, and the concerns of diversity is real. When to justify intervention and not alongside how it is justified may be important as pragmatic definitions arise as products of the prevailing interests.", "When is an act of violence a weapons of the weak in asymmetrical power distributions? What is the difference between narco traffickers and large resource interests that funds political power? The goals aspect is worth considering: knowing someone\u2019s intention, yet the environment that shapes this intention is equally as important. Moderating terror in terrible working conditions is just one example of many.", "If we take seriously that we are individuals with ideas, there are some patterns, but a lot of it is quite hard to predict. If it is hard to predict human behaviour then it is hard to know people\u2019s aims and quite difficult to see the people\u2019s intention.", "Where is the money coming from? We have data brokers and there is not currently enough regulation to ensure that the flow of data is responsible or is sold of unintentionally to groups intending to use the data for such purposes. Terrorism obscures \u2014 it is not a value-neutral term. Technology is not value-neutral at all. It ties into ideas of securitization and state powers alongside its ethical discourse of technological for good.", "Slapping the terrorist label puts it into a different category. Understanding can be an important tool in how to prevent it. Putting the T-word on it is tempting in a rapid pace of content moderation, yet we need to engage with it.", "As much as there is a need to be respectful of the way large companies are trying to moderate and cooperate with state institutions we need to be critical. Robert Cox said it well: \u201cTheory is always for someone or for something.\u201d In this respect perhaps technology is always for someone or something too. I will end with a video that was shared in my class today that proposes a critical view on the labelling of terrorism:", "I have been writing one article for every day for 50 days.
