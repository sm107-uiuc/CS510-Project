Data visualisation allows data scientists to communicate their findings and results to non-scientific readers, so this is a great tool to have if you are looking to get into data science!", "Let\u2019s start by loading up a real dataset on 2019 model-year vehicles, but first, we need to import the relevant packages!", "For this example, we want to look at the counts for number of gears in all vehicles.", "We can load up Seaborn, and just call set() on it to change matplotlib\u2019s default settings to something more visually pleasing.", "Now if we do the same plot command, it\u2019s a little more modern looking.", "Seaborn includes many types of plots that matplotlib doesn\u2019t offer. For example, \u201cdistplot\u201d can be used to plot a histogram together with a smooth distribution of that histogram overlaid on it. Let\u2019s plot the distribution of MPG values on the vehicles in this database as an example.", "Something you encounter pretty often is a \u201cpair plot\u201d from Seaborn. This lets you visualize plots of every combination of various attributes together, so you can look for interesting patterns between features.", "As an example, let us look for relationships between cylinders, city MPG rating, Highway MPG rating, and combined MPG rating.", "By studying the results above, you can see there is a relationship between number of cylinders and MPG, but MPG for 4-cylinder vehicles ranges really widely. There also appears to be a good linear relationship between the different ways of measuring MPG values, until you get into the higher MPG ratings.", "This plots individual data points across two axes of your choosing, so you can see how your data is distributed across those dimensions.", "A scatterplot arranges itself into columns when you have ordinal data like the engine displacement, but it tells us that there\u2019s a pretty wide range of MPG values for each value of engine displacement, although if you look at where the data points are clustered, you can sort of see a downward trend in MPG as the engine displacement increases.", "Seaborn also offers a \u201cjointplot\u201d, which combines a scatterplot with histograms on both axes. This lets you visualize both the individual data points and the distribution across both dimensions at the same time.", "The most common engine displacement seems to be 2, with 3 closely behind. And MPG ratings seem to roughly follow a bell curve centred at around 22 or so.", "The \u201clmplot\u201d gives us a linear regression of our data overlaid on the graph, and this makes the overall trend of lower MPG\u2019s with higher engine displacement more apparent. High engine displacement isn\u2019t better when it comes to efficiency, it seems.", "Next, let\u2019s look at a \u201cbox plot.\u201d This is what\u2019s called a \u201cbox and whiskers\u201d plot, which is useful for visualising typical values for a given category without getting distracted by outliers. Each box represents the range between the first and third quartiles of the data, with a line representing the median value. The \u201cwhiskers\u201d that extend from the box represent the spread of the remainder of the data, apart from clear outliers that are plotted as individual points outside of the whiskers.", "As an example, let\u2019s look at box plots for each vehicle manufacturer, visualising the miles-per-gallon ratings across the vehicles they produce. This lets us look at the spread of MPG ratings across all the vehicles each manufacturer offers.", "There are a lot of manufacturers, so to make the resulting graph readable we\u2019ll increase Seaborn\u2019s default figure size, and also use set_xticklabels to rotate the labels 45 degrees.", "The box plot shows us that the range of MPG values we see on each gearbox type aren\u2019t as crazily distributed as it seemed at first glance; many of the extreme values are in fact outliers that are best discarded when analysing the trends.", "Another way to visualize the same data is the \u201cswarm plot.\u201d Instead of boxes and whiskers, it plots each individual data point \u2014 but does so in such way that groups them together based on their distribution. It makes more sense when you look at it.", "Another tool is the \u201ccount plot.\u201d This is basically the same thing as a histogram, but for categorical data. It lets you count up how many times each given category on the X axis occurs in your data, and plot it. So for example, we can see that General Motors offers more vehicle models than anyone else, with BMW not far behind.", "A heat map allows you to plot tabular, 2D data of some sort, with colours representing the individual values in each cell of the 2D table.", "In this example, we\u2019ll create a pivot table from our original data frame, to create a 2D table that contains the average MPG ratings for every combination of number of cylinders and engine displacement.", "The resulting heat map shows all of the engine displacement values along the X axis, and all of the cylinder values along the Y axis. For each cell of the table, the actual average MPG rating for that combination of cylinders and engine displacement is represented not as a number, but as a colour that ranges from dark for small values, and light for larger values.", "And, this does allow you visualize a clear trend where things get progressively darker as we move from the top-left of the graph to the bottom-right. Which makes sense; higher MPG ratings are associated with lower numbers of cylinders, and lower engine displacement values. By the time we get to an 8-litre 16-cylinder engine, the average MPG is at its worst of about 12, represented by the colour black.", "This particular graph has a lot of missing data, but the heat map deals with that gracefully. A 3-cylinder 8-litre engine simply does not exist!", "This concludes my Seaborn tutorial. Hope this will be useful in your side projects as well as your work. Thank you!", "Your home for data science.
