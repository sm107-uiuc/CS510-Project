Additionally, the new data\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys", "anchor_text": "five whys", "paragraph_index": 25}], "all_paragraphs": ["I\u2019m sitting in my boss\u2019 office, briefing him on the roll-out of our new dashboard, which is going to greatly increase access to data for every member of the organization. Additionally, the new data is of a higher quality than ever before and the design will enable even the least tech-savvy user to have meaningful control over the data.", "Then, like a slap in the face, my boss told me his impression of our data team was that we couldn\u2019t get any meaningful data.", "To say that this caught me off guard was an understatement. I knew how hard the team was working. Moreover, they had designed and launched several other important and complex projects over the year.", "Yet here was my boss telling me he didn\u2019t have confidence in our data, or the team\u2019s ability to provide value in many instances requiring data and analysis.", "I couldn\u2019t let it go because I was genuinely confused. So I probed and learned that my boss\u2019 experience and perspective was unique and different than mine.", "His data needs often surrounded urgent reactive data requests to late-breaking external requirements. In almost every case that he could recount, he had gotten the response that we couldn\u2019t provide the data.", "The focus and priorities of the data team thus far had been on our business intelligence, machine learning, and forecasting tools and products. These were going to get us to where the organization needed to be and what had justified the recent increase is resources. Heck, we were following the organization\u2019s five year plan to a tee!", "This was a wake up call for me as a manager and as a member of a data science team.", "Delegating is an interesting proposition. As a supervisor, I usually found myself worrying whether I was micromanaging my staff.", "Why? Because everyone knows that your team doesn\u2019t want to be micromanaged. Of course not, you don\u2019t want to be micromanaged either.", "What usually happened though? I frequently found that projects did not get done. Or they got done in a way that didn\u2019t achieve what I had hoped.", "Upon reflection after the meeting with my boss, I realized that many of the tasks and projects that I delegated were determined \u201cnot possible\u201d by the team. This happened a lot with data requests and special analyses. This allowed me to spend more of my time focused on the other projects.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the data\u201d, \u201cthis isn\u2019t a report we can pull\u201d, and \u201cwe\u2019ve unsuccessfully tried this before\u201d were some of the typical responses I heard.", "I trusted the team on many of these. They had been together longer than I was supervising them. In fact, I learned from them and frequently found myself defending against tasks in the same way, explaining to colleagues what we couldn\u2019t do.", "I took some time reconstructing what had happened. What I learned took me in a very different direction and helped me understand my team and the needs of the organization much better.", "I had listened to the steady and regular reports from my team about the progress of our new dashboards, ML projects, and other long-term initiatives for months. The team\u2019s pride and excitement \u2014 as well as my own focus \u2014 fed off of each other.", "This built on itself until the point where adhoc data requests were not the priority. And only those requests where we had ready access to the data were fulfilled. Anything else would distract our finite and \u201cprecious\u201d resources from working on the truly \u201cimportant\u201d projects.", "When you are in a reactive organization, you need to devote resources to that mission.", "This meant the the difficult data tasks were denied\u2026usually with explanation that we didn\u2019t have the data.", "I was determined to change my boss\u2019 perception of our team and our ability to meet the demands that he had for data. It was clear that I had grown a blind-spot to the organization\u2019s short-term needs for data analysis that often outweighed leadership\u2019s long-term plans for our new products.", "When you are in a reactive organization, you need to devote resources to that mission. I also made sure that the entire team understood that I wanted to grow a culture of \u201cgetting to yes\u201d no matter what the effort. This absolutely meant re-prioritization of projects, but it also meant all of us holding each other accountable, and asking cutting questions of ourselves and the data if we were motivated to say no to a request.", "After some searching and few cases examples, I learned that the reality was that the team didn\u2019t always default to an exploration mindset. This was my fault. I had delegated specific tasks and requests without spending time with the team to also set the level of expectations for the tasks.", "Additionally, I trusted their expertise (correctly) but did not spend time with them exploring the \u201cwhy\u201d when they declined requests (incorrectly).", "As a leader, it isn\u2019t enough to build the right team. You also have to form the right attitude and culture of the team. And its your role to make certain that the needs of the organization are primary in setting the priorities.", "How to turn it around? As I look back now, it is not surprising to me that I found myself in this situation. Our data team was sequestered from much of the organization. While we recently increased it\u2019s resources, the vast majority were from outside the organization and were hired for their expertise in data science rather than expertise in the organization\u2019s sector. If this situation sounds at all familiar to the organization you work in, I recommend the following practices.", "Five Whys \u2014 One of my favorite tools has since become the \u201cfive whys\u201d. It might sometimes come off as annoying, but it has helped me learn a great deal about our team and organization, and it has allowed me to coach the team through some particularly complex requests \u2014 often turning them into manageable tasks that we can fulfill.", "Stakeholder Engagement\u2014We learned that in many cases we had to spend a lot of time with the people that made the requests to understand what exactly they needed and to engage a much larger stakeholder group to figure out how to get the data. In many instances these were not our normal reports, but if we took the time to delve in, we often found that we either did have the data or could get it with only a little extra work.", "Domain Knowledge \u2014 Because our team knew data science really well, but not the work of the organization, we had to make the discussions a two-way street. It helped us to be able to show domain experts our database tables and walk them through our query logic. It also helped us to have them walk us through the front-end systems so that we could build a shared understanding of what they were trying to achieve and so we could understand the policy and processes.", "External Awareness \u2014 This is crucial for every member of the team, especially the leader. Get out of your office, forget about your project charts and your scrums. Talk to the other offices in the organization to understand their needs and wants. Maybe the priorities of your team are going to meet those, maybe they won\u2019t. Maybe you are going to give them their perfect solution, but they need something imperfect for the immediate term while your development is still on-going.", "In organizations that are not built around data science, those doing to data work need to be especially careful to understand how our work contributes to the overall organization mission.", "We have to remember that we are a support role, not the core function. We have to take a genuine concern about the organizations needs and problems, and understand how our tools can provide solutions. We have to be able to balance long-term solutions with short-term needs.", "Its important to remember that today\u2019s problem matter much more than a problem a year from now.", "Your home for data science.
