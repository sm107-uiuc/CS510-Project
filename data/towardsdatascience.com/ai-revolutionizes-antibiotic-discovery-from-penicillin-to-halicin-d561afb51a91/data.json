Since its discovery in 1928 by the Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming, it has helped humans fight diseases caused by bacterial infections for almost 100 years. It\u2019s impossible to estimate how many millions of lives it has saved.", "However, having existed on earth for a couple of billion years, bacteria are smart enough to evade this attack by developing drug resistance after the extensive use of penicillin. In addition to the problem of resistant infections, penicillin doesn\u2019t work on all bacteria and can cause severe allergic reactions in some 10% of the population. Thus, scientists have been intensively developing other antibiotics for treating infections, in the hope of identifying novel antibiotics that have a broader spectrum of activity and better tolerability and safety.", "But how can we discover new antibiotics?", "Historically, scientists have mostly screened natural sources, such as moulds, soil-dwelling microbes, and plant extracts, to identify chemicals that possess antibiotic properties. With the advancement of synthetic chemistry, the modern approach to antibiotic discovery involves the screening of a library that can consist of tens to hundreds of thousands of synthetic compounds on top of natural chemicals and semi-synthetic derivatives of scaffolds with known antibacterial effects. The general work flow is summarized below.", "However, as noted by some MIT researchers in their recent published article on Cell \u2014 one of the most prestigious journals in life sciences, there are a few notable drawbacks in the conventional approach that prevents the breakthrough discovery of novel antibiotics .", "In light of these drawbacks in the conventional approach, researchers at the MIT have taken advantage of the drastic advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) to discover new antibiotics with potential clinical applicability. The following diagram shows how this AI approach works.", "Specifically, these researchers first built a training set of molecules that are able to inhibit the growth of a common bacteria E. coli. They augmented their model by specifying molecular features, optimizing hyperparameters, and ensembling, which led to the final deep neural network through iterative model re-training. Compared to the conventional approach, this AI approach allowed the researchers to analytically screen over a hundred million chemicals with many having molecular structures distinct from known antibiotics. The number of screened chemicals is about 100 times greater than that can be achieved by the conventional approach, which is much more expensive at this large scale.", "Using this model, these researchers were able to discover a kinase inhibitor originally called SU3327 in the Drug Repurposing Hub, for which they renamed as halicin. They found that halicin show broad-spectrum (i.e., kill a wide range of bacteria) antibiotic activities in mice, which suggests that it can be a promising drug candidate with possible clinical applicability. From the ZINC15 database, the researchers identified 23 candidate chemicals and 8 of them exerted antibacterial activity with two particularly powerful.", "Our lives depend on antibiotics, especially when many kinds of bacteria have evolved to have antibiotic-resistant strains. Thus, it\u2019s critical to discover novel antibiotics to further boost our antibiotic arsenal. This AI approach revolutionizes the discovery of antibiotics, allowing scientists to quickly screen many more chemicals with significantly high prediction accuracy. Like Halicin, more antibiotics will be discovered using this AI approach.", "I believe that it won\u2019t take long that we shall see that Halicin and other AI-discovered antibiotics can be used clinically.", "A Deep Learning Approach to Antibiotic Discovery", "Your home for data science.
