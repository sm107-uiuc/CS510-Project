It\u2019s content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless.", "I create flashcards about the concepts I find difficult to remember. For example, an explanation of regularization which I find very intuitive. When I need to explain the concept to someone, I don\u2019t need to think about analogies as I already have them in my mind.", "The downside of Anki is that you need to find a way to organize flashcards that suits you. There is no one pattern that fits all. It can get quickly cluttered with too many flashcards. So I use it only for the most important and hard to remember concepts.", "You can download and import my deck of 168 Data Science flashcards. I\u2019d still recommend you creating your own flashcards as this is the whole purpose of Anki.", "Podcasts are also a great way to learn about Machine Learning, but don\u2019t expect you\u2019ll learn it just by listening to podcasts.", "Podcast hosts explain complex ideas in a simple way because no one would understand them otherwise.
