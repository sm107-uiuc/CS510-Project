Specifically, the linear regression model uses p directly as the response variable.", "The problem of the linear regression is that its response value is not bounded. However, the binomial regression uses a link function (l) of p as the response variable.", "The link function maps the linear combination of xs to a value that is between 0 and 1 but never reaches 0 or 1. Based on such criteria, there are mainly three common choices:", "When the link function is the logit function, the binomial regression becomes the well-known logistic regression. As one of the most first examples of classifiers in data science books, logistic regression undoubtedly has become the spokesperson of binomial regression models. There are mainly three reasons for that.", "Let\u2019s go over them in detail.", "A major difference of the complementary log-log model is that probit and logit functions are symmetrical but the complementary log-log function is asymmetric.", "Specifically, we can see that the symmetric functions (logit and probit) cross at the position of p=0.5. However, the cloglog function has a different rate of approaching 0 and 1 on the probability. With such a feature, the cloglog link function is always used on extreme events where the probability of the event is close to either 0 or 1.", "In reality, it\u2019s nearly impossible for us to make the assumption of the extreme value distribution with a limited amount of data. Therefore, in most cases, the cloglog link function is not selected for the binomial regression model.", "In other words, the logit and probit model could be applied to more general cases than the cloglog model. Let\u2019s next look at the advantages of the logit model over the probit model.", "Logistic regression is more widely used than probit regression because of its easy interpretation, which benefits from the concept of odds.", "Interestingly, odds are sometimes more frequently used than probability in our daily life because of its better scale to represent chance, eg. the NBA playoffs bet. The relationship between the odds (o) and the probability (p) can be described in the following equation.", "And the logistic regression could be rewritten as,", "It is super easy to interpret the model above. For example, with all the other independent variables fixed, a unit increase in x1 increases the log-odds of success by \u03b21.", "However, the interpretation of the probit model is not straightforward. The probit link function calculates the Z-score of the probability. Therefore, the interpretation of the same example should be that with all the other independent variables fixed, a unit increase in x1 increases the Z-score by \u03b21.", "If the playoff bet website says that \u201cthe Z-score that Lakers wins the semi-final series is 1.65!\u201d, few basketball fans will praise the website runner for his/her profession in statistics.", "In most practical situations, the data comes from retrospective sampling instead of prospective sampling. In retrospective studies, the outcome is fixed and the predictors are observed and collected, however, the predictors are fixed and the outcome is observed in prospective studies.", "For example, if we are interested in the relationship between dog cancer and eating dog food only, we first collect 10 different breeds of dogs and feed half of the dogs with dog food only and the other half with mixed food. And then we track the health status of the dogs in five years from now. This type of study is a prospective study and it is very ideal but slow.", "However, a cheaper and faster way should be that we find a number of dogs with cancer, we check the record of feeding in the past five years, and we compare them with a group of healthy dogs in our binomial model. This type of study is a retrospective study.", "Assume \u03b11 is the probability that a dog is included in the retrospective study if they do not have cancer, while \u03b10 is the probability of inclusion if the dogs have cancer. We can always assume \u03b11 = \u03b10 in the prospective study because we have not seen the outcome yet.", "But it\u2019s not the case in the retrospective studies where \u03b11 is usually much larger than \u03b10.", "Let\u2019s use the Bayes theorem to describe the relationship between the conditional probability (p*)that a dog has cancer given that it is included in the study and the unconditional probability (p) that the dog has cancer.", "After applying the logit link function, we have", "This equation above shows clearly that the difference between the prospective and retrospective study is log(\u03b11/\u03b10) which only affects the intercept term of the binomial model.", "The advantage of the logit link function is that we don\u2019t need to worry about the intercept term even in a retrospective study because we are focused on the relative effect of the independent variables on the odds.", "In other words, even though it is impossible to know log(\u03b11/\u03b10) (or adjustment on \u03b20) in a retrospective study, it won\u2019t disable us from estimating the logistic model\u2019s coefficients (the other \u03b2s). This feature is not valid for the probit link function.", "Logistic regression is one of the binomial regression models, and it uses logit as its link function. It is preferred over the other link functions because of its easy interpretation and usefulness in the retrospective study.", "Are the other link functions useless? No, try the Challenger Disaster data using the code below, and you will find the cloglog model gains the smallest AIC among the binomial models with the link functions.", "I hope you enjoy reading this article.", "Faraway, Julian J.
