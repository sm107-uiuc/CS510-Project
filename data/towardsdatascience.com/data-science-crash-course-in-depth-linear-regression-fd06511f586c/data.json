If you find these articles helpful, check out the site for more lessons and practice problems!", "An algorithm is a set of rules that a computer can follow to solve a particular problem. In the context of modeling, each algorithm will use a different approach to obtain a function which best represents the target variable. Recall that regression algorithms explore the relationship between independent variable(s) and a continuous dependent variable.", "Linear regression models a linear relationship between the dependent variable and at least one independent/explanatory variable. A linear regression model with one explanatory variable is known as simple linear regression while one with multiple variables is known as multiple linear regression.", "When fitted over a training set, the linear regression model estimates unknown parameters to quantify how the average dependent variable is affected by linear movements in the independent variable(s).", "are the estimated parameters. With the coefficients, we can estimate the values of future observations so long as we know the explanatory variables.", "The \u03f5 (pronounced epsilon) is the error term, also known as residuals. The error is the difference between the true target variable and the predicted target variable.", "In a nutshell, we choose the \u201coptimal\u201d coefficients to minimize the error term.", "There are several different methods of doing this. One of the standard approaches is to use the Ordinary Least-Squares Estimation (OLS) method. The OLS method makes several assumptions:", "Under these assumptions, we can construct a closed form formula to calculate the coefficients that will minimize our error term.", "The derivation begins with a goal: to minimize the Sum of Squared Residuals.", "Recall that we can measure error as y\u2212X\u03b2", "The Sum of Squared error can be defined as a function of the coefficients. In matrix notation:", "The function S calculates the Sum of Squared error using our beta parameters.", "This is a quadratic function of \u03b2, so we can find the global minimum if we take the derivative with respect to \u03b2 . We can then solve for \u03b2^\u200b by setting that to zero.", "Set the left hand side to equal zero. Our OLS assumptions allows us to assume that X has full column rank, which makes X\u22a4X invertible.", "The simplicity of linear regression is a double edged sword. The linear model is incredibly easy to interpret and understand, but is also a simplification of real world complexity. Most datasets will also violate the assumptions made by the OLS method.", "The importance of model interpretation should not be underestimated. Being able to interpret the coefficients allows us to use the model to drive business strategy, quantify the effects of our efforts and also gives stakeholders trust in our algorithms.", "Let\u2019s demonstrate with an example. Real estate agent Jim trains a linear regression model to predict house prices as a function of square footage and age in years. Let y represent the price of a home and x1\u200b the square footage, x2\u200b the age in years.", "He calculates the coefficients using the formula described above and comes to this formula which he uses to predict house:", "Jim\u2019s model tells us a lot about house prices:", "This information can be leveraged to increase a home\u2019s valuation. The reality is not so simple, but if adding a square feet of extra space only costs $200, wouldn\u2019t you want to increase the size of your home to sell it for a higher value?", "Jim realizes that the interaction effect between size and age is very important. He adds that as a predictor and retrains his model. His new formula becomes:", "Jim decides that he wants to incorporate the type of home as a predictor to his model. Every house is either a townhouse, semi-detached or detached home. He decides to treat these as categorical variables.", "The new model will leverage these additional predictors:", "This tells us that, if all else equal, a detached home will be on average $4000 more expensive than a semi-detached home and $11,000 more expensive than a townhouse.", "Some other tidbits to think about:", "If you enjoyed this article, check out my other articles on Data Science, Math and Programming.
