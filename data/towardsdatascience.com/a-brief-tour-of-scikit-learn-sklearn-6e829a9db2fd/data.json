Scikit-learn is a python library that provides methods for data reading, data preparation, regression, classification, unsupervised clustering, and much more. In this post, we will go over some of the basic methods for building regression models. The documentation for this package is extensive and a fantastic resource for every data scientist. You can find the documentation here.", "For our regression problems, we will be working with weather data which can be found here.", "First, let\u2019s import the data and print the first five rows:", "Next, let\u2019s convert the date column into a pandas date-time object and create year, month, and day columns:", "Let\u2019s print the first five rows again to verify the creation of the new columns:", "Now, let\u2019s define our input and target variables. We will be using humidity, year, month, day, pressure, visibility, and wind bearing to predict temperature:", "We will then split our data for training and testing:", "Now all of our necessary variables are defined. Let\u2019s build some models!", "Let\u2019s start with linear regression. Linear regression fits a linear function with coefficients such that the residual sum of squares between targets and predictions is minimized.", "We import the LinearRegression package as follows:", "The error metric we will be using to evaluate the performance of our model is the mean squared error (MSE). MSE is defined by the following equation:", "Here, y is the actual value and y-tilde is the prediction.", "Let\u2019s define a linear regression object, fit our model, and evaluate performance:", "The performance isn\u2019t great. This simply means that the relationship between the input and target is not linear. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) may further inform smart feature selection and engineering which may improve performance.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at random forests. Random forest is a tree-based method that ensembles multiple individual decision trees.", "We import the RandomForestRegressor package as follows:", "Let\u2019s define a random forest regression object, fit our model, and evaluate performance:", "We can see that random forest performance is much better than linear regression.", "We can also print the feature importance. This allows us to see which variables are most significant for temperature prediction:", "We can see that month has the highest importance which makes sense.", "I\u2019d like to point out that by not passing any parameters, like max_depth and n_estimators, I selected default random forest values (which are n_estimators = 10 and max_depth = 10 ). We can further improve performance by optimizing parameters in random forests. This can be done manually or in an automated way using grid search techniques. I will leave the matter of parameter optimization for another post.", "The next method I\u2019ll discuss is called support vector regression. This is an extension of support vector machines (SVM). SVMs construct a set of hyperplanes in high dimensional feature space that can be used for regression and classification problems.", "We import the SVR package as follows:", "Since SVRs are slow to train, I will only select the first 100 records for training and testing. Feel free to train and test on the full data set for a more suitable comparison of performance between models.", "Let\u2019s define a support vector regression object, fit our model, and evaluate performance:", "We see that support vector regression performs better than linear regression but worse than random forests. Again, this comparison isn\u2019t exactly appropriate since we didn\u2019t train using the full data set.", "Similar to the random forest example, the support vector machine parameters can be optimized such that error is minimized.", "The final method I will discuss is k-nearest neighbors for regression. K-nearest neighbors use Euclidean distance calculations where the prediction is the average of the k nearest neighbors.", "We import the KNeighborsRegressor package as follows:", "Let\u2019s define a k-nearest neighbors regression object, fit our model, and evaluate performance:", "We see that k-nearest neighbors algorithm outperform linear regression when trained on the full data set.", "I will stop here but feel free to play around with model feature selection to see if you can improve the performance of some of these models.", "To recap, I outlined a brief introduction to the python machine learning library. I went over how to define model objects, fit models to data, and predict output using linear regression, random forest, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbor models. In addition, by exploring these different types of models we were able to peek under the hood of the machine learning library. Notice the four modules we used from the library :", "While we only looked at methods for regression, each of these modules has additional methods for classification. In another post, I will outline some of the classification methods that are most common in the python machine learning library.", "I hope this post was informative. The code from this post is available on GitHub. Thank you for reading and happy machine learning!", "Your home for data science.

D. in Chemical Physics."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
