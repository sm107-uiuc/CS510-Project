You can see the full R markdown notebook on my R-Pubs page and all the files and data on my GitHub.", "First, you should be aware: don\u2019t take this (or almost any other conclusion from observational data) as a causal inference. This wasn\u2019t an experiment and not rigorous enough to prove causation. Observations aren\u2019t matched between control and treatment groups or various subgroups of the data, and even after the regression, the variables\u2019 explanatory power isn\u2019t rigorous enough. The available numerical parameters I had in hand are not sufficient for that kind of a conclusion; I couldn\u2019t match the content that really matters to compare apples to apples, and even with controlling with multiple regression \u2014 not all things are equal (ceteris paribus assumption is still not met). However, I was able to get a decent predictor and understand which variables are most strongly associated with higher view counts.", "The dataset includes the name, title, description and URL of each of the 2550 talks, name and occupation of the main speaker, number of speakers, duration of the talk, the TED event and date it was filmed at, date it was published online, number of comments, languages translated and views. It also included a compressed form of arrays of associated tags, ratings, and related talks, but as inside arrays and these need transformations before they can be used. For a full list, see the dataset page on Kaggle.", "First, let\u2019s see how each variable is distributed with their histograms.", "Histograms are a way to represent the distribution of the values this variable takes; or intuitively representing: \u201chow many talks were there of 1 minute? 2 minutes? 3 minutes? etc\u2026\u201d. Formally, a histogram is a \u201cdiagram consisting of rectangles whose area is proportional to the frequency of a variable and whose width is equal to the class interval\u201d.", "See how our variables look like below.", "Duration of talks is closer to a normal distribution, but with a wide right-side tail of a few talks at longer duration, around a mean of 14 minutes and median of 12 minutes. Almost all talks range between 1\u201318 minutes (maximum length of a normal Ted talk).", "Number of comments is a Poisson distribution (visually resembling an exponential distribution, but it is not technically since comments are measured at discrete numbers) strongly skewed to the minimum of 0 comments for the unpopular videos.", "Number of views is also a Poisson like distribution skewed leftwards, With a Median number of views: 1124524, and Mean (average) number of views: 1698297", "Finally, an overall picture of our variables distributions:", "From these distributions we see that:", "Apparently, writer is the most common occupation for a TED speaker! followed by other creative occupations and number of speakers with that occupation:", "These occupations are very different! they are very skewed by the outliers of the most popular ted talks (for example, # [4] Vulnerability researcher refers solely to Bren\u00e9 Brown), and thus not a representative sample. Anyway, there are some surprising findings here:", "Let\u2019s look at the overall correlation pairs scatter-plot matrix between each pair of numerical variables;", "To complement this, see a correlation matrix with colors representing the intensity of the correlation from 0 (white) to dark blue (+1) or dark striped red (strong negative correlation, -1), and with asterisks (***) signifying significance by p-values.", "Most of the parameters don\u2019t have strong correlations.", "How do these variables correlate with views? Is it a linear relationship, nonlinear, or non? This is important to understand to know how to insert them into the regression if at all.", "Let\u2019s start with day of week the talk was published at.", "So, day of week does seem to have some association with average (mean) views! Ted Talks published on weekends seem to have much less views, with Saturday being the lowest, and Friday is the most popular day for ted talks published day.", "Below are scatter-plots with LOESS flexible regression in white and linear regression in pink, to see how different would a linear shape look from a flexible moving average. This shows us that usually, except for in the tales of the distributions of these variables, where there are only a couple of outliers\u2019 data, the linear model described the relationship somewhat well.", "Let\u2019s start with duration and number of tags:", "Surprisingly, duration had almost no consistent correlation with number of views; except for the fact that most popular talks were closer to 8\u201318 minutes. Number of tags seemed to be optimal between 3\u20138, which is also the more common number of tags; with some outliers of particularly popular talks.", "What about numbers of Comments and Translation Languages?", "Unsurprisingly, number of comments is, obviously, very well correlated with number of views, and so does number of languages \u2014 they all come from having many viewers. Thus, it is not \u201cfair\u201d to predict views based on these factors, and in the real world, we couldn\u2019t use these parameters to predict, since they are not causes for more views, but they are also a result of many views, and a cause in a reinforcing feedback loop: the more comments, the more engaged the community is around the talk and likelier to spread; the more languages, the more viewers can watch; and the more viewers, the more audience there is to comment and translate. The rest had a small linear effect, where that didn\u2019t deviate much, though small.", "The pink lines are linear regressions while the white lines are LOESS. It seems that none of these loose much information by a linear regression versus a LOESS regression, which is arbitrarily flexible and would reveal a clear non-linear shape. while some of them do have nonlinear shapes \u2014 from a closer look, it is only in the tail where data is scarce and it is biased by the few data points there and some outliers (as in the Comments correlation). Therefore, inputting the regressor as a linear fit might be sufficiently explanatory.", "I first ran a regression of number of views upon each variable of interest separately, which enabled to see which variables have explanatory power and how strong is it. Later, I included the better explaining ones, adding them one by one into a multiple regression, while checking that their addition actually improves our performance. The results are in the table below, where each column is a different model, for models (1) through (8).", "Chosen model is the last model since it had the best explanatory power in terms of R squared, adjusted R squared, p value and F-statistic, although it had only marginal improvements over model (5) with only comments and languages translated.", "For predicting purposes, I would choose model 8 with all variables. For explanatory purposes, I would choose model 5 to explain that comments and languages are by far the most correlated with views and explain most of its variance.", "Model 5 suggests that every additional comment is associated with 4,044 more views (p-value under 0.01) and that every additional language translated is associated with 60,650 more views (p-value under 0.01). However, the constant is negative (-733) views, which makes no sense, but that comes with the restriction of a linear model. These together explained 0.33 of the variance (both R-squared and adjusted R-squared).", "However, adding all the other variables into model 8 improved slightly the R-squared to 0.336 and Adjusted R-squared to 0.334. So, if we are after accuracy for prediction, I would use this last, full model:", "The results, and particularly model 8, show overall significance. Most variables show significance, although weekend does not, but adding it still improved the explanatory power slightly, so I\u2019m keeping it. F-statistic is relatively lower, and R and R-squared are not great at 0.336 and 0.334 respectively, but the best performance out of this set of models. The constant decreased much more, giving more power to the variables to raise the predicted view count. The coefficients (estimation of the effect) of comments decreased from 4044 to 3931 and was redistributed to higher coefficient for the number of languages and new coefficients for the newly added variables: 408 more views for every additional second, 26625 more views for every additional tag, and this is compensated by reducing the predicted number of views by 41407 if it was published on a weekend.", "To finish up, I ran a final regression with polynomials of number_of_tags and duration up to the third degree, and adding the interaction term between number of comments and number of languages made a significant contribution, improving the accuracy with an R-squared of 0.436 and Adjusted R-squared of 0.434. With a positive coefficient, this suggests that talks with many comments and many language translations together yield even more views than talks with just a high number of one of them. Yet, this model it is much less convenient for making general conclusions for, might be less generalizable and prone to over-fitting. Not all polynomials shows statistical significance, but they still improved results from when I dropped either of them. Therefore, I will not count heavily on its implications here, but it would be a slightly better prediction model for similar data. Here is how it performed (and how to run it):", "This limited model conveys correlation, not causation. It does not convey causal relationship well because the fundamental problem of causal inference is not well addressed with these variables, these predictors are not independent from the y variable, and they are highly correlated (mostly comments and number of languages which are the best predictors, naturally. I don\u2019t believe that with these available numerical predictors we could have reached a causal inference. Next attempts might use the transcription of the talk to analyze the content, or audio to analyze the level of clapping, or the visuals in the talk and the clothing of the speaker to better predict using the content of the talk.", "Recognizing that this is not causality, these correlations might help you to (1) better predict the number of views for a talk given these parameters, and (2) hypothesize on possible causation directions, and test them further.", "So, what would be features of a popular talk?", "Finally, now you may go on with your betting-on-view-counts TED binge-watching party with your friends and take some more educated guesses! You may also send me some token of appreciation if you win big-time.", "You can see the full R markdown notebook on my R-Pubs page and all the files and data on my GitHub.", "Have a great week, and make sure to check out a new TED talk with 3\u20138 tags, is 8\u201318 minutes long, has many comments and languages and which was uploaded on a Friday!", "Your home for data science.
