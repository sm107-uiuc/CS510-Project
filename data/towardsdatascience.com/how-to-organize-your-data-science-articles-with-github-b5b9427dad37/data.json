Many websites like Medium have an efficient recommendation system that does a good job of recommending the articles on which we cannot resist clicking. One article after another appears to be useful. So we keep reading, and either closing the tab or saving the article for future reference. Since we come across many articles every day, we must be informed by new information, right? Not quite so.", "Quality is more important than quantity. One home run is much better than two doubles. \u2014 Steve Jobs", "The best way for us to absorb new knowledge is to use it. No matter how many technical articles we read, if we don\u2019t apply the new knowledge, we will retain almost nothing. We might retain something now but will forget it a week later. But think about it. In a fast pace and overload society, what is our common strategy for reading an article?", "When we read a useful article, we don\u2019t often try out the codes, explore the tools, and deep down in the concepts right away but save it. Either because we are using our phones to read articles, or we want to try out the codes and tools when we need it. When we look back at the piles of articles we have saved, we are overwhelmed and find it time-consuming to go through those articles to find one useful article for our current project. So what is a solution?", "There are many tools out there that allow us to save your articles and organize them in categories. But there are a couple of drawbacks when using these tools to save the articles:", "The good news is that it does not take much for us to organize your articles! With Github and a little twist in the use of the platform, we can organize the articles efficiently.", "Github is a light-weight platform that brings together developers to discover, share codes and build better software. Github has an Issues tab that allows users to request an issue on the existing code. We will utilize this tab for another purpose: Organize and summarize our articles. Something like this:", "Explore this repository here. These are why you should start using and contributing to this repository:", "Yes of course! This repository is built so that it is easy for anyone to start with. Whenever you find an interesting article that you want to save, click on the Issues button on the top left corner next to Code, then click new Issue on the top right corner.", "A template will be shown. All you need to do is to fill in the template. Imagine this like your notebook, you want to quickly save the essential information of one article so it is easy for you to quickly retain the information in the future or for others to look at and know what that article about.", "These are quick descriptions of the sections in this template:", "This is how the template should look like after hitting \u201cSubmit new issue\u201d", "Feel free to skip any section that is not relevant to what you are looking for. Remember, regard this as your own folder. Just write down the things that you think will be useful for yourself to look back! If an article has many pieces of information, some of which you already know and too lazy to write down in the template. Just write down whatever you feel like writing. It is better to write something than give it up all the way.", "Last but not least, use the label to tag the category of the article accordingly.", "You can also use the comments section as a place to discuss, comment, ask questions or give feedback on the article.", "For every minute spent organizing, an hour is earned. \u2014 Benjamin Franklin", "In the society of overloaded information, we don\u2019t need to be one of those who get overwhelmed by new information and give it up all the way. We just need to twist our approach so that we can be more efficient at what we often do. Get started with this repository to organize and retain more information. I hope with this platform, we can together build a community where everybody is eager to learn and share useful knowledge.", "I like to write about basic data science concepts and play with different algorithms and data science tools. You could connect with me on LinkedIn and Twitter.", "Star this repo if you want to check out the codes for all of the articles I have written.
