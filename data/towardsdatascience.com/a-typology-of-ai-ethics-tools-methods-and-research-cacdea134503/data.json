NeurIPS is an annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems traditionally organised in Vancouver Canada. I would reccommend scrolling through the discussions on Twitter, reading the papers, or watching a few of the videos from the conference. In this article I will look post a few pictures of quotes out of context, and then talk about the paper called A Typology of AI Ethics Tools, Methods and Research to Translate Principles into Practices. This paper won the \u2018social good\u2019 track at NeurIPS, so it may be interesting to check out. However I would very much like to look at as many as possible as the submissions in this category later if I get the chance.", "Before I dive into a summary of the aforementioned article I thought it would be fun and easy to post a few pictures of a selection of different slides posted publicly on Twitter.", "Welcome to the land of quotes:", "However there was of course more than quotes at the conference. Yet I want to focus in on the paper written about \u2018social good\u2019.", "This paper was written by Jessica Morley and Luciano Floridi from the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, UK. It was co-written together with Libby Kinsey and Anat Elhalal from Digital Catapult, UK.", "In short it proposes that there is a: \u201c\u2026gap between aspiration and viability, and between principle and practice.\u201d Therefore we need to understand what tools that is available to developers in the different part of the process.", "The goals is to map typology that may help practically-minded developers \u2018apply ethics\u2019 at each stage of the AI development pipeline.", "However it is a signal as well that may show areas where further research is needed. They found that there is an: \u201c\u2026uneven distribution of effort in the applied AI ethics space, and that the stage of maturity (readiness for widespread use) of the identified tools is mostly low.\u201d", "According to the paper this approach is inspired by Saltz and Dewar (2019) who produced a framework that is meant to help data scientists consider ethical issues at each stage of a project. This was done with a grid for \u2018ethical principles\u2019 and the stage of the \u2018AI application lifecycle\u2019 on the other.", "84 ethical AI documents had been identified in a recent review with different themes. These were according to the paper themes that \u2018define\u2019 ethically-aligned AI as that which is", "(a) beneficial to, and respectful of, people and the environment (beneficence); (b) robust and secure (non-maleficence); (c) respectful of human values (autonomy); (d) fair (justice); and (e) explainable, accountable and understandable (explicability). Accordingly, these are the principles used in the typology.", "In this paper a total of 425 sources that provide a practical or theoretical contribution to the answer of the question: \u2018how to develop an ethical algorithmic system.\u2019 were reviewed.", "The fully populated typology can be found at:http://tinyurl.com/appliedAIethics", "They have a table in the paper with an Applied AI ethics typology with illustrative examples of where different tools and methods are plotted.", "They paper claims three inter-related findings:", "The stated goal of the paper was to give a snapshot of what tools are currently available to AI developers to encourage the progression of ethical AI from principles to practice and to signal clearly, to the \u2018ethical AI\u2019 community at large, where further work is needed.", "\u201cConstructive patience needs to be exercised, by society and by the ethical AI community, because such progress on the question of \u2018how\u2019 to meet the \u2018what\u2019 will not be quick, and there will definitely be mistakes along the way. Only by accepting this can society be positive about seizing the opportunities presented by AI, whilst remaining mindful of the potential costs to be avoided.\u201d", "I hope you liked this short summary, however I would of course recommend that you read the original paper. The information I have provided is only meant as encouragement to read further.", "This is #500daysofAI and you are reading article 196.
