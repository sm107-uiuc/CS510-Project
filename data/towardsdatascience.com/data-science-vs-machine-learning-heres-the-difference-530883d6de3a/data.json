I am here to shed some insight into why they are separated and where the roles can overlap.", "At first, studying to become a data scientist, I embarrassingly was unaware of what a machine learning engineer was. I quickly became to realize that the field is similar to data science but different enough to require a unique set of skills. Long story short, data science is the researching, building, and interpretation of the model you have built, while machine learning is the production of that model. Now that I have been in the field for a few years, gaining experience in both disciplines, I have developed an outline below on what is and what is not a data science and machine learning engineer role.", "A statistician? Kind of. Data science, in it\u2019s simplest terms, can be described as a field of automated statistics in the form of models that aide in classifying and predicting outcomes. Here are the top skills that are required to be a data scientist:", "Python \u2014 To expound on the skills above, I believe most companies are looking for Python more than R. Some job descriptions list both; however, most people you are working with like the machine learning engineers, data engineers, and software engineers will not have familiarity with R. Therefore, I believe, to be a more holistic data scientist, Python will be more beneficial for you.", "SQL, at first, can seem more like a data analyst skill \u2014 it is, but it should still be a skill you employ for data science. Most datasets are not given to you in the business setting (as opposed to academia), and you will have to make your own \u2014 via SQL. Now, there are plenty of subtypes of SQL; like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server T-SQL, and Oracle SQL. They are similar forms of the same querying language, hosted by different platforms. Because these are so similar, having any of these is useful and can be translated easily to a slightly different form of SQL.", "Jupyter Notebook could almost be the exact opposite of a machine learning engineer\u2019s toolkit. A Jupyter Notebook is a data scientist\u2019s playground for both coding and modeling. A research environment, if you will, allowing quick and easy Python coding that can incorporate commenting out of code, the code itself, and a platform to build and test models from useful libraries like sklearn, pandas, and numpy.", "Overall, a data scientist can be many things, but the main functions are to", "\u2014 meet with stakeholders to define the business problem", "\u2014 EDA, feature engineering, model building, & prediction (Python and Jupyter Notebook)", "\u2014 depending on workplace, compile code to .py format and/or pickled model", "To find out more information on what a data scientist is, how much they make, the outlook of the field, and more useful information, click this link here [3] from UC Berkeley.", "Now, after that last point above, is where a machine learning engineer comes in. The main function is to put that model into production. A data science model can be quite static sometimes, and an engineer can help to automatically train and evaluate that same model. They would then insert the predictions back into the data warehouse/SQL tables for your company. After that, a software engineer and UI/UX designer will display the predictions into a user interface \u2014 if necessary. As you can see, the whole process from business problem to solution in a visible, easy to use format, is not just the responsibility of a data scientist (however, yes, some data scientists can do all x amount of roles).", "The role of a machine learning engineer can be also named ML ops (machine learning operations). A summary of their workflow would be something like this:", "A. pkl_file of data science model", "B. storage bucket (GCP \u2014 Google Cloud Composer)", "C. DAG (for scheduling the trainer and evaluator of the model)", "D. Airflow (visualizes the process \u2014 ML pipeline)", "At first, perhaps data science and machine learning could be seen as interchangeable titles and fields; however, with a closer look, we realize machine learning is more-so a combination of software engineering and data engineering than data science. Below, I will outline where the fields do and do not cross over.", "To find out more information, visualizations, processes, click here [5], for a machine learning operations overview by Google", "Perhaps the most similar concept of data science and machine learning is that they both touch the model. The main skills that both fields share are:", "The comparisons are primarily in programming; the languages each person uses to perform their respective roles. Both positions perform some form of engineering, whether that be a data scientist querying a database using SQL or the machine learning engineer using SQL to insert the suggestions or predictions from the model back into a newly labeled column/field.", "Both fields require knowledge of Python (or R) and usually version control, code sharing, and pull requests through GitHub.", "A machine learning engineer can sometimes want to know learn how the algorithms work like XGBoost or Random Forest, for example, and will need to look at the model\u2019s hyperparameters for tuning in order to conduct research on memory and size constraints. While data scientists can build highly accurate models in academia or on the job, there can be more restrictions in the workplace due to time, money, and memory restraints.", "Some of the differences are already outlined in the above sections of data science and machine learning, but there are some key features of both careers and academic research that are important to point out:", "Not only can the two roles differ in the workplace, but in academia/education as well. There are different routes to becoming a data scientist and machine learning engineer. A data scientist might focus on that degree itself, statistics, mathematics, or actuarial science, whereas a machine learning engineer will have their main focus on software engineering (and some institutions do offer specifically machine learning as a certificate or degree). To learn more about becoming a data scientist online, you can read my other article here [6]:", "While different people, companies, and job descriptions have different versions or ideas of what each career is, I certainly believe that there is significant separation in the two positions. Some skills do indeed overlap, but in general, a data scientist focuses on statistics, model building, and interpretation of outcomes. The machine learning engineer will take that model, scale it, and deploy it into production. If you have come here to learn or make a decision about your career path, I hope this article helped.
