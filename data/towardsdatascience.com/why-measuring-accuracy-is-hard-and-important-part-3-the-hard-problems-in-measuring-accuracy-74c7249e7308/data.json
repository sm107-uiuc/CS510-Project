Check it out here: https://www.electricbrain.io/blog/why-measuring-accuracy-is-hard-and-very-important-part-1 A quick TLDR: measuring accuracy is important for two major reasons. The first is that it allows us to make our models better \u2014 and know how good they are currently. The second is that it allows us to communicate to stakeholders what their expectations of the model should be.", "In Part 2 of the series, we discussed the most common and typical problems that can get in the way of measuring accuracy. Check it out here if you have not read it: https://www.electricbrain.io/blog/-why-measuring-accuracy-is-hard-and-important-part-2 A quick TLDR: there are a whole host of things that get in the way of measuring accuracy, from our complex expectations of how we want our models to behave, to the complex nature of the data that it is expected to operate on, through to the complex ways we have to piece together multiple algorithms to form a complete system.", "In this article, Part 3 of the series, I will be discussing the more unusual, interesting, and difficult scenarios that come up in trying to measure accuracy for a model.", "This is probably the most difficult scenario to deal with in machine learning in general. You might ask, how can you possibly train a machine learning algorithm without any ground truth data? Isn\u2019t the data used to train the algorithm capable of being used for ground-truth?", "If you think about it more carefully, there are a variety of situations where we are applying machine learning without really having ground-truth data:", "The more that you work in machine learning, the more you will be operating in environments where there is no real ground-truth for the problem you need to solve, or at least there is so little of it that its barely useful.", "When you are doing really pioneering work in AI and data science, you may encounter situations where it\u2019s not really clear how to measure the performance of the model. It\u2019s not that the performance can\u2019t be measured, but there may be multiple seemingly equally valid ways of measuring that performance, but which say different things about the results. There may be obscure metrics and measurements that are buried deep within the research and literature, or even some more common metrics that you just aren\u2019t familiar with.", "I find this situation presents itself in a few different environments:", "I\u2019ll tell you where this came up for me recently, where I felt the need to really design a metric. I was working on a system for analyzing resumes. The basic premise of the system was as follows:", "Building and measuring this system presented several challenges. First was constructing appropriate test-cases that we could use to accurately measure the results of the system. The second was just picking what kind and form of metric made sense. The third was improving the result.", "The way we constructed the test cases was to create a set of \u201ctarget\u201d resumes that the algorithm was supposed to find. Then we would add in 25\u201350 \u201cnegative\u201d resumes for each target resume. The negatives were taken randomly from the dataset at large. We would then go through the test-case like it was any screening, reviewing 20\u201330 resumes with only a couple targets liked, and seeing how the system ranked the remaining resumes.", "Not being familiar with information retrieval research, I really didn\u2019t know what metric I should use here. A metric probably existed but I didn\u2019t want to delve deep and figure that out. Plus, this system was based on likes/dislikes rather then keyword matches, more like a recommendation system. In my mind, there were a few initial ideas:", "So eventually I had to come up with my own idea of what a metric would look like. It had to capture the ability of the algorithm to put target resumes at the top of the heap based on only a few learnings, and it had to be invariant to the size of the test-case and to the ratio of targets to negatives, and it needed to be resistant to noise if possible.", "So I formulated the mathematical properties I wanted from the metric as follows:", "So the formula that I came up with looks as follows (excuse my pythonic math):", "The equation basically uses the mean ranking of the target resumes within the overall ranking of resumes. These rankings are first normalized to be between 0 and 1, and then the mean ranking of all the targets is normalized to go between the best possible mean ranking and the worst possible mean ranking. The best possible mean ranking isn\u2019t actually 0 \u2014 since the target resumes are also sorted relative to each other. The best possible mean ranking is the ranking that would happen if all the target resumes are sorted at the top of the list. So if there are, say, 3 target resumes out of 10, then the best possible mean ranking is the average of 0.0, 0.1, and 0.2, for a overall best possible mean ranking of 0.1. The same is done with the worst-possible ranking, and the final score for a test-case is its normalized position between the best and worst possible mean rankings.", "With this custom score equation, I was able to create a metric which had a relatively consistent behavior with other types of metrics that I like, e.g. 1.0 is the best possible result, 0.0 is the worst possible result. It also has good behavior with respect to changes both in ratios between targets v.s. negatives, and in the overall size of the dataset. This allows us to compare the scores between different test-cases reasonably well, which then further allows us to compute a mean-score for all the test-cases.", "Engineering your own metric equation like this is an advanced technique, but it should be something you include in your arsenal of tools while developing measurements on a model.", "This challenge mostly comes up when your doing unsupervised learning, e.g. clustering and generative models, or some forms of reinforcement learning.", "If you\u2019re working on a clustering problem, you will ultimately come across the question of What is a good cluster? This question is non-obvious. There are definitely metrics that you can use to to define what are better or worse clusterings in a statistical way, such as:", "But using these metrics may fail to capture what you really want from the algorithm. If, for example, the algorithm is being deployed in a marketing environment to segment customers, then what you really want is to group people together by how well a specific marketing strategy is going to work on them, because ultimately this is the purpose that these clusters are used for. However, you may be clustering on data that is extremely noisy and may have only marginal predictive value for marketing strategy. Your there to exploit whatever value there is and move on. A measure like the above can totally mislead you in developing this algorithm to serve that purpose \u2014 creating effective clustering of the data but not ones which line up with similarity in effective marketing strategies to any extent.", "Another interesting case of this is generative models. What we care about is whether the model is capable of generating a healthy variety of realistic outputs. But what defines realistic? Its hard to measure the algorithm against the dataset it was trained on \u2014 if the algorithm only produced outputs highly similar to its training dataset, then it would be a very poor generative model. The techniques that are currently used for this, like the Inception-score (which uses a neural network along with statistical measures of entropy to score a model), are non-intuitive and have flaws. In some cases, like in natural-language synthesis, the most reliable technique for evaluating improvements remains a subjective scoring done by humans, e.g. scoring quality from 1 to 10. How else would you evaluate how good a general purpose chatbot can chat to you?", "In this situation, we might have some way of measuring the accuracy of our model, and we have reasonable expectation our metric should correlate with the real world performance of the model, in the sense that a higher metric likely means better real world performance. But the performance of the model in the real world might not be something you can actually measure easily and report back on. It might be very hard to determine how well your metric correlates with real world performance, and how much accuracy you have lost.", "I can think of a bunch of scenarios where this can occur:", "Some of the most difficult situations like this is where the choices that your algorithm can take years to resolve into good or bad choices. For example, if an algorithm predicts that you should buy a particular house or a particular stock because it appears to be undervalued in the long term. By the very definition of the problem, it may take years to determine if an algorithms guess turns into reality.", "In some cases, there are often perfectly reasonable ways to measure the accuracy of an algorithm. But it might be very computationally expensive to do so effectively, making partial measurements of accuracy necessary.", "I can think of a bunch of situations where this may come up:", "In these situations, we must be very careful in how we sample data out of the larger production dataset in order to measure our algorithm. We have to pick an appropriate sample size that is computationally tractable but also representative of the whole, and we must do random selection in a way that considers various possible class imbalances within the larger dataset.", "Probably the most benign of the hard-problems in measuring accuracy is when an algorithm is meant to work in combination with humans. In general, what we actually care about is the effectiveness of the human-machine combined system \u2014 that\u2019s ultimately what matters. Measuring the machine side might be easy \u2014 measuring the human side is often much more costly.", "The presence of humans in a solution often leads to better performance then just doing machine learning alone, if it is done correctly. Often-times it\u2019s just plain necessary when new AI products are being developed to keep humans in the loop to grow the dataset. But the presence of humans in the situation do complicate the measurement of accuracy.", "Humans are hard to measure. For example, how do we measure how much noise and mistakes there are in a dataset? When the dataset is being constructed by people, the only option is to compare one persons opinion to another. For example, a manager may examine a subset of the labelled data of their subordinates and compare it to their own opinion on the correct classification.", "Taken to the extreme, the technique becomes what I call double verification, where the same piece of data is sent to two different humans to be analyzed and classified. If the two humans disagree, it can be sent to a third, and a fourth, and a fifth, so on and so forth until a consensus is reached on the correct answer. This both produces high quality labelled data, and can give you great statistical clarity on the amount of mistakes in your dataset. But this process is expensive \u2014 greatly increasing the cost of the already pricey data labelling process.", "There are many things in life that are static, or at least evolve so slowly that it takes generations to change. There are other things that are rapidly changing, both in characteristic and form, from one year to the next and sometimes even from one month to the next. The same is true of datasets and machine learning problems.", "Here are some situations where we might find the problem we are working on to be evolving underneath our feet:", "In these situations, it can sometimes become necessary to continuously apply R&D to your core algorithm just to stay in the same place, let alone to improve it. As your ambitions for using machine learning grow and your dataset grows with it, so too do the challenges of maintaining such an ambitious system. The prime use for measuring accuracy, which is to understand how well your system is going to work in the real world, is challenged by the constantly changing definition of \u201creal world\u201d. Your measurements of accuracy might only be good for a few months before something changes and accuracy drops.", "This concept came to me recently when thinking about doing machine learning on data derived from complex databases with multiple tables being relevant to the prediction, and the dataset was fairly small, so generalization was important. After thinking about the problem, I came to realize it has actually presented itself in a bunch of different projects in my past.", "Consider the following example. You are building an algorithm to parse data out of documents. The documents you are parsing come in a number of different overarching formats, and within those overarching formats there can be different data within the documents. In your training dataset, you might have amassed documents in 50 different formats, and you have around 500 examples for each format of document. You reasonably believe that there is, at most, 100\u2013200 formats out there \u201cin the wild\u201d, and most of them will be at least similar to existing formats.", "Now if you just do a conventional 80/20 split on this data, you might get very good results, let\u2019s say you get a perfect training accuracy and above 99% validation accuracy. This is very possible in this situation (has happened to me), especially if the data presented in each format is very consistent and you have good data augmentation. You might go and put your model into production based on that validation accuracy. But what happens what you receive a document in the 51\u2019st format?", "There are in fact two dimensions along which your algorithm needed to generalize, and the second dimension is not captured by your basic 80/20 split of all samples. Your algorithm first needs to be able to learn from new examples of documents in the same format. That\u2019s dimension 1. Ideally though, your algorithm can also generalize to documents in new formats as well. That\u2019s dimension 2. If you have labels for the formats of the documents, you can also do an 80/20 split along the different formats (40/10 in this example). Both of these splits are important and tell you different things about the ability of your model to generalize to new examples.", "It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see that if you do an 80/20 split along your formats, your validation accuracy might look very different from 99%. If documents within a format are highly similar to each other, but formats are very different from each other, then it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see that a machine learning algorithm is unable to generalize to new formats when exposed to documents in only 40 existing formats, no matter how large your dataset or how many documents you have.", "The more I thought about it, the more I realized just how often this particular problem occurs. For example, if you are building a recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform, your algorithm needs to generalize across a bunch of dimensions:", "If you are training an algorithm from data derived from a complex database, involving joining a bunch of different tables representing tangibly different types of data, then its very reasonable that you do separate 80/20 splits for each of those tables, each yielding a different metric, or some combination thereof. E.g. imagine a real estate valuation system, which must combine geographic data, like market conditions in a particular area, with data on the specific property and data from recent sales transactions in the area that are relevant. You need the algorithm to generalize across all three different data sources, since all three are mixed and matched for doing predictions in a production environment, and all three are continuously growing and changing as the business grows. The model needs to be able to adapt.", "This is an unusual and nuanced scenario to deal with and it complicates the measurement of accuracy. No matter which way you do your 80/20 split, no single way fully captures the accuracy and behavior of the algorithm. Your algorithm may be generalizing well across the dimension that you measure, such as different buildings in your data set when predicting real estate valuations, but is not at generalizing across a different dimension, such as different geographies with their differing market conditions. You will invariably need multiple metrics in order to fully appreciate the behavior of your algorithm in these instances.", "In this article, we have discussed many of the more challenging and nuanced problems that get in the way of measuring accuracy effectively. Many of these challenges are inherently derived from the power of machine learning \u2014 its flexibility to be applied with imperfect data and in novel environments and situations and still get a reasonable result. Machine learning is powerful.", "If you have read all the way up to this point, and especially if you have been reading our previous articles in this series, then you might well conclude, as I have, that measuring accuracy is very hard. With so many ways that you can do it incorrectly, and so many issues that can prevent you from doing it well, it\u2019s pretty easy to just accept error as an unchangeable fact of life. Yet measuring accuracy is foundational to our work as the builders of models. So instead of just rolling over and accepting defeat, what can we do about it?", "In Part 4 of this series of articles, the last in the series, I will try to go over a framework for measuring accuracy better. This framework will try to give you a better way of thinking about choosing and designing metrics for your models. Our proposal will be simple. Instead of starting from your model and what it does, and going forward to a metric that can measure it and then the analysis of that metric, we will instead show you how to go in the reverse direction. Start from the question of what exactly you want your metric to tell you about your model and how you want to analyze it, and then move backwards to what kind of metrics might support telling you that information. Metrics are meant to serve a purpose, thus different metrics must be designed for different purposes \u2014 there is no one size fits all solution.", "Founder and CEO of Electric Brain
