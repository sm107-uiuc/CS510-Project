The results were often quite like how we expected, though there have been debates about the relationship between sleep and happiness. However, I was wondering if we could put it in the perspective of how we spend our time in general and seeing whether a balance of time spent in different aspects of our lives would influence our happiness levels.", "Rather than chasing after more sleep, or more exercise, how should we be spending our time across the board to increase our happiness?", "As a university student in Singapore, I decided to do a simple survey of my peers.", "Variables, keeping in mind that I am asking university students: \u2014 year of studies \u2014 gender \u2014 level of comfort around people (account for possible personality differences) \u2014 satisfaction (a good measure for happiness as it tends to be stable) \u2014 sleep hours (per day) \u2014 study hours (per day) \u2014 exercise hours (per week) \u2014 leisure hours (per week)", "Next, I\u2019ll be using Python through Jupyter Notebook to do some data cleaning. Starting with importing of the necessary packages and looking at the data.", "1) Renaming the column header for simplicity", "2) Converting from categorical to numerical by:", "3) drop the \u2018Timestamp\u2019 column and dividing \u2018exercise\u2019 and \u2018leisure\u2019 values by 7 to get a daily value", "4) Converting sleep, study, exercise and leisure to percentages.", "Now that we have the data in the form that we\u2019d like, we can start to create data visualizations. I\u2019ve decided to focus on personality, % of hours (sleep, study, exercise and leisure) and the happiness score.", "The following is the correlation heat map for those who rated themselves as being less comfortable around others (\u2018Being around others\u2019<=5).", "Mean for sleep=42.11%, mean for leisure=13.98%, mean happiness score=4.92. Notice that the correlation between happiness and sleep was the highest at 0.52, correlation between happiness and leisure was -0.37.", "Compare this to those who rated themselves as being more comfortable around others (\u2018Being around others\u2019>5).", "Every other correlation was surprisingly negative! Although I expected sleep to have a high correlation with happiness as people may prefer to be alone, activities like leisure having a negative correlation with happiness is quite unexpected. This seems to suggest that for people who are less comfortable around others are more likely to be influenced by the amount of time they spend sleeping, while the other factors do not seem to be an important factor that influences their happiness. At the same time, spending more time on leisure appears to have a negative correlation with their happiness, though this may not be as prominent in people who rated themselves as being more comfortable with others.", "If we take a look at the mean value for exercise and leisure, it appears that more time spent on sleeping might be beneficial to those who are less comfortable around others. Perhaps a further dissection and examination on personality might grant further insights into what makes us happy. Nonetheless, it appears that perhaps happiness and personality seems to have some correlation.", "Sleep is a more important factor in those who are less comfortable around others compared to their counterparts.", "Next, let\u2019s look at how spending different proportion of our time correlates with happiness scores.Balanced: all components <50%", "Happiness score: mean=5.60, sd=2.80. Correlation between sleep and happiness=0.7, correlation between study and happiness=-0.4. *those who entered the unbalanced group were due to study or sleep \u2265 50%", "Looking at the mean, it appears that ensuring that we have a balanced distribution of hours across the 4 factors correlates with higher levels of happiness. However, let\u2019s take a look at the regression line for happiness and sleep for unbalanced hours with correlation of 0.7!", "If i look at only data of those with \u2018Sleep\u2019 \u2265 50% of hours:Happiness mean=7.17, sd=1.22Maybe we all just need a higher % of time for sleep. When I relaxed the criteria to \u2265 40%, the mean happiness score fell to 6.49. Furthermore, it appears that it\u2019s spending >50% of our time on studying that brought down the mean (mean of those with \u2265 50% studying hours = 3.4285, sd=2.88).", "Those with \u226550% of hours spent on sleep across \u2018Sleep\u2019, \u2018Study\u2019, \u2018Exercise\u2019, \u2018Leisure\u2019 had a happiness mean score of 7.17.", "If you read all of the above, thank you so much because I spent a lot of time trying to code and getting the values I needed for analysis! Otherwise, here\u2019s a quick summary:Question that I wanted to answer: Does the proportion of time spent on different activities influence our happiness levels?", "Yes, it does! Students with a more balanced proportion of hours spent across activities appear to have a positive correlation with happiness levels.", "1) Positive correlation between sleep and happiness throughout 2) Personality has an influence on the types of activities that correlates with our happiness (e.g sleep and leisure) 3) Those who have a more balanced spread of hours seem to be happier than those who had unbalanced hours 4) Those with \u226550% of their time, across the variables, spent on sleeping had higher mean score for happiness 5) Those with \u226550% of their time, across the variables, spent on studying had lower mean score for happiness.", "Rather than chasing after more sleep, or more exercise, how should we be spending our time across the board to increase our happiness?", "Nonetheless, glad to have learnt a lot of python and data visualization from this mini-project and trying to milk all the information that it\u2019s trying to tell me! Do let me know if there are other areas I could look at or your thoughts on the results! Would try to get a larger data set the next time.", "Your home for data science.
