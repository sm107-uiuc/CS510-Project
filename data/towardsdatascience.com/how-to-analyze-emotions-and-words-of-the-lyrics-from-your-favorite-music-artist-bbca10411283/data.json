The different sounds, rhythms, and effects used in music are capable to modify our emotions for a moment, but there\u2019s a component that sometimes goes unnoticed when we are listening to music; The Lyrics of the songs.", "Lyrics are powerful texts who share the ideas that came from the mind of the author when the song was been created. That\u2019s why I decided to analyze the lyrics of one of my favorite bands; Metallica.", "Metallica has had a noticeable change of concepts and ideas on their song lyrics throughout their music career and considering they started playing music in the \u201980s until now, this band is a good option to study.", "In this article, I will expose and explain how I could achieve this idea using Word Clouds, a Statistics Table, Frequency Comparision Plot of Words, VADER Sentiment Analysis, and a cool Dataset provided by Genius. So with no more to say, let\u2019s start working!.", "Full code, scripts, notebooks, and data are on my Github Repository", "The first step is to obtain information on the most popular songs by the artist. to do that, I created a function called search_data() that helps to automatize the process to collect the attributes of each song. This function uses the library lyricsgenius to obtain the data and you must pass the parameters of the artist name, max number of songs to extract, and your client access token:", "As you may notice, the lyric column has a lot of words and symbols that are not important to study because they are used to explain the structure of the song, so I cleaned this information using the function clean_data() and also creating a new column to group songs by decade. This new column will help us to have a better understanding when analyzing the data. Finally, I filtered the information to just use songs that have lyrics because some artists have instrumental songs.", "Now we have a clean data frame to start creating our data frame of words. You can access the CSV file of this data clicking here.", "To have a complete analysis of Metallica lyrics I wanted to take a look at how they tend to use words on different decades. So I had to create a Dataframe of words based on the lyrics of each song. To do that, first I considered unique words by lyrics due to some of the songs repeat the same words on the chorus part. I defined a function called unique to do this process, the parameter corresponds to a list of words", "Then I use the following code to store the unique words of lyrics with the function defined above and another function called lyrics_to_words that you can find on the helpers script. I saved this information on a new column called words on the data frame of lyrics.", "As you may notice now we have a column that stores the unique words for each song used in lyrics.", "But this is the first step to create our data frame of words. The next step is to use this new words column, count how many times a unique word is used on songs lyrics by decade, and store all these results into a new data frame of 5 columns, one for words and the others for the frequency of occurrence by decade.", "It\u2019s important to consider remove your own stopwords depending on each data in case the clean function does not remove all of them. Stopwords are natural language words that have very little meaning, such as \u201cand\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, and similar words.", "you can access to look the code clicking here.", "This Data Frame is interesting and useful because it shows us how many times Metallica used a word on the lyrics of their songs depending on the decade the song was released. For instance, the word young was used in 1 song in the 1980s, 2 songs in the 1990s, and 0 times in the 2000s, and 2010s.", "You can access the CSV file of this data clicking here.", "To start analyzing the words used by Metallica to create their song lyrics, I wanted to answer a lot of questions that I had in mind. These questions are:", "Cited by Google a Word Cloud is \u201can image composed of words used in a particular text or subject, in which the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance\u201d. For this purpose, the Word Cloud is grouped by decade and will show us which are the most frequent words used in song lyrics of Metallica during the different decades.", "I used the libraries Matplotlib and Wordcloud to create this graph with a function where you must pass the data frame, the number of rows, and columns of the figure depending on the decades you want to plot. In my case, I have 4 decades (80s, 90s, 00s, 10s) and I want the graph in a 2x2 format.", "It\u2019s cool to observe the differences among the words used during the different decades of Metallica musical career. During the 80s words are focused on concepts related yo death and life and in the 10s words are about more deep concepts about feelings.", "I also defined a function to calculate some Stats for the number of words in the different periods of decades. You must pass as parameters, the data frame of lyrics, and the data frame of words. I used the following code to create the table:", "With this table, we can show a lot of information about the songs and the Lyrics of Metallica. For instance, the 1980s have more number of words and songs, and that\u2019s because the most famous songs were released during this decade. Word per song of the 2000s is less than the rest of the decades, maybe we can infer that during the 2000s songs are shorter in time than the other decades.", "Another cool analysis that can help us to understand this data is taking a look at the tendency among the most frequent words used in a decade compared to the frequency of the same words in other decades.", "Using the function below you can create a line plot to look the tendency for a set of common words in a specific decade. for instance, if I want to compare the 10 most common words of the 1980s to the other decades I must pass this information and the data frame of words as parameters to the function:", "As you may notice during the 1980s the first 2 most common words used in lyrics of Metallica are Life and Death with a frequency of 12 for both words. But during the 1990s just life was used only in 6 lyrics and Death in just 1 for the rest of the decades.", "VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) of the NLKT Python Library is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool. VADER uses a combination of A sentiment lexicon is a list of lexical features (e.g., words) which are generally labeled according to their semantic orientation as either positive or negative. VADER model uses 4 different Sentiment Metrics.", "If you want to read more information about the VADER metrics, click here.", "I used the following code to calculate the 4 metrics for the Songs Lyrics of the Data Frame.", "Now a good way to vizualize the results are plotting the songs and their respectives Sentiment Metrics on a Scatter Plot using Matplotlib Library. In this case I plotted the Negative Score and the Positive Score for each lyric grouped by decade.", "Analyzing this plot I can inferred that the Lyrics of Metallica\u2019s songs tends to have more Negative Valence, so for leading to generate a little more of negative feelings.", "I also wanted to analyze the sentiment but using the mean of scores by decade. so I just group by decade the main Data frame having this result.", "I realized that the 90s Songs Lyrics of Metallica tends to have more positive valence than the other decades. That\u2019s really insteresting considering the most famous exposition of Metallica in the mainstream music was during the 90s.", "To conclude this article we learnt how to use a new technique to analyze words and text sentiments applied to Music. The advantage that people have living in this modern decade rather the past decades are astonishing. I mean, using simple techniques in the comfort of your home to create amazing researchs and projects, it allows us keep growing as society and taking advantage of the technology to achieve our goals and enjoy the time doing interesting things.", "This article will have a second part where I will try to find which are the main Topics, Concepts and Ideas that Metallica expose on their songs lyrics.", "Your home for data science.
