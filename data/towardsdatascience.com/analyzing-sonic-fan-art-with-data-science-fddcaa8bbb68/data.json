The art is known for being distorted, disturbing and in many cases, explicit. In my latest Youtube video, I scraped DeviantArt to analyze fan art to determine whether or not it truly lives up to this reputation. This post will walk you through exactly how I did that.", "I first wanted to get a sense of how many Sonic artworks there are on DeviantArt, a fan art sharing website. No scraping required, here \u2014 I simply searched for \u201cSonic\u201d on DeviantArt and recorded how many results came up. I also did the same for similar characters, like Shrek and Pikachu. Here are those results, visualized:", "The amount of fan art dedicated to Sonic dwarfs that of the other characters, coming to around 1.4 million. Wow! Now that we\u2019ve seen there\u2019s a thriving Sonic culture on DeviantArt, it\u2019s time to move towards answering our research question: Is Sonic fan art really that disturbing?", "To start, I used BeautifulSoup to scrape the posts (the full code for this can be accessed here on Github). The following code scrapes the first 2200 links that came up when searching \u201csonic.\u201d", "I then retrieved several attributes from each of these urls, including the post\u2019s title, tags and the number of views, favorites and comments each post got. Here is the code for retrieving this data:", "Sometimes, the comments field was empty, hence the if/else condition.", "After doing this, you can now construct a dataframe of Sonic fan artworks for analysis! Yours might look different from mine because different art works might turn up for your query when scraping. But here is the resulting dataset from my scraper.", "Here\u2019s the distribution of years in which the artworks in my dataset were published. You can see that artworks from the 2010s represents the majority \u2014 perhaps people started posting more in this time, or perhaps those pieces are simply what came up first when I was scraping.", "I can\u2019t include any of the images from the dataset in this Medium post, because I do not have the right to republish them here. I do, however, react to the top 10 most viewed and most favorited pieces of fan art in my video.", "In my dataset, the two most viewed artworks were character makers (number one, and number two). This is not surprising, as a huge part of the Sonic fandom is to make original characters, or \u201cOCs,\u201d and write stories around these characters, like in any fandom. (The Sonic fandom, however, takes this pastime to a new level. Try googling your name + \u201cthe hedgehog\u201d sometime to see what I\u2019m talking about)", "Animated shorts, comics and character references were also popular.", "My ultimate goal was to analyze the tags that artists on DeviantArt use. Which tags are used with which? To do this, I took the \u201ctags\u201d column in my dataframe to create a correlation matrix. This was a somewhat involved process \u2014 the first step was to create a \u201ccorpus\u201d of the tags for parsing.", "After creating the corpus, I used scikit-learn to create the correlation matrix.", "And your resulting dataframe should look something like this (yes, it will be massive). Here, the number represents the amount of time both tags were used with one another.", "I first used Python libraries like networkx and matplotlib to visualize the network, but these were indiscernable messes. It was clear I needed a more powerful software.", "I saved the dataframe to a CSV and inputted it into gephi. In the network, the larger a word is, the more times it\u2019s used. And the closer a word is to another word, the more times those tags are used together. After fine tuning the network\u2019s features, this is what it ended up looking like:", "This network is obviously massive, but it\u2019s interesting to look around\u2014I suggest taking a few minutes to zoom in and around it to see the connections between certain words. Or, you can watch my YouTube video summarizing this analysis and see what I took out of the network.", "And that\u2019s the end! To conclude, while there are examples of disturbing or distorted Sonic fan art, I think my analysis shows that that is certainly not what\u2019s most popular in the community, or even the majority of the work. Much of it is, in fact, quite wholesome.", "If you think this article leaves much to be desired, please consider watching my video on the subject \u2014 I share more of my results, findings and key takeaways there. This post was more meant to explain how I did the analysis.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data Scientist at Thermo Fisher Scientific; I use data science and data visualization to answer questions I have about pop culture and Internet trends."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
