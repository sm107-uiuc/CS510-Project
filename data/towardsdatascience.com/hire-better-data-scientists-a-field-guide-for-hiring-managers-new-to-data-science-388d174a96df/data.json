Hiring is a huge responsibility and easily one of the most important things you do as a manager. Even a single bad hire can drag down your team\u2019s productivity, kill morale, decrease team retention, and generate a significant amount of work (and headache) for you as a manager. From the job description to the interview to the offer, this series of posts is intended to memorialize hard won wisdom in hiring data scientists over the last few years, focusing on how to enhance the candidate interview process and get less\u2026you know\u2026terrible.", "N.b., these are my opinions and not representative of those of my employer. This (these) posts are simply to memorialize some of the things that I\u2019ve learned in an informative manner. While I hope you find them useful, they\u2019re not official statements of any kind.", "Authors:Eli Goldberg, PhD, MSc, Director of Data Science in Clinical Analytics, Analytics and Behavior change at CVS-AetnaBenjamin Goldberg, PhD, Instructor in Humanities and Cultural Studies at USF, currently trapped in Bulgaria on a Fulbright.", "If you\u2019ve read the last post, it\u2019s possible that you\u2019re less terrible at crafting job descriptions. Let\u2019s keep your skillset monotonically increasing by taking the next step: Create a clear interview process.", "Here\u2019s some organization for these articles. I\u2019ve bolded the part you\u2019re on for convenience.", "Part 1. Creating better job descriptions brings in better talent.", "Part 2. Create a clear interviewing process.", "Part 3. Good interviews have structure.", "Part 4. Good companies respect their candidates time.", "Part 5. Don\u2019t get emotional about compensation.", "Congrats! You read the last article on how to craft a better data scientist job description and your dream data scientist is ready to interview. Now what? The interview process, that\u2019s what.", "An interview process can be intimidating and stressful for both candidates and hiring managers. For candidates, it can be a brutal and frustrating process filled with doubt and stress. For hiring managers (and the internal team), it can be exhausting, as you wade through an endless sea of CVs. By definition, you have more to do than the current team can support \u2014 a problem compounded by the time you and the team spend trying to hire.", "Given said stresses, and acknowledging you\u2019re terrible at hiring data scientists, here are 3 actionable principles to building high efficiency process:", "Principle 1: Make time for hiring and use your shift in priorities to your advantage.", "Principle 2. Don\u2019t wing it. Write your process down and engineer it to be data driven.", "Principle 3: Modify the process, not your adherence to it.", "I\u2019ll provide some guidance/thoughts for each principle, below.", "Particularly for managers that have recently been individual contributors, hiring can be viewed as a distraction or a burden. This couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. Yes, hiring is work. However, your job as a manager is to support the team. While hiring doesn\u2019t result in code, it is critical to the success of your team. Take it seriously and plan for success by doing the following from the get-go.", "If you clearly articulate (1) and \u2018tee up\u2019 (2) with your team, you\u2019ll find yourself with clear priorities, time and space to focus and execute, and your team stepping up to fill in the gaps to maintain momentum.", "This seems obvious, but you\u2019d be surprised at the number of hiring managers that I know who think they\u2019re some kind of Han Solo hiring manager. Odds are that you can\u2019t just show up on the death star and \u2018wing it\u2019. Also, and to unnecessarily continue this star wars metaphor, you don\u2019t want your hiring process to be the Millenium Falcon. You want consistent, predictable success. Be a tie Interceptor or X-wing.", "I\u2019m not super in to sports (shocking, I know), but hiring is a team sport. Socialize, and ask for feedback, on your process with the team. Once you\u2019re in agreement, make sure that folks know how to execute it in your absence.", "Some structure for this section:.. Subpart 1. Key components of a good hiring process. .. Subpart 2. A review of my hiring process.", "Subpart 1. Key components of a good hiring process.", "Here are a few \u2018must haves\u2019 when crafting a hiring process:", "Subpart 2. A review of my hiring process.", "Here\u2019s an example graphical abstract from my hiring process with commentary.", "All candidates start out with an HR screen to collect basic information. Between the HR screen and Step 2, all candidates get a short \u2018mission flyer\u2019. This flyer is, essentially, an extension of the job description. It dives a bit deeper into the mission and helps candidates overcome the question of \u2018why us\u2019?", "Controlling for my institution, and this pandemic, ~65% of all resumes are filtered out at this step.", "Step 2. Technical interview. I have a lot of thoughts (and guidance) on how to craft a technical interview for data scientists (see below). However, everyone must pass a technical interview. That\u2019s not to say that everyone should have the same level of difficulty \u2014 it should be matched to the candidates level and \u2018sphere\u2019. n.b., I use \u2018sphere\u2019 to describe the \u2018flavor\u2019 of data scientist I\u2019m looking for e.g., consultatory, heavy research and development, a clinical data expert, etc.", "Depending on the quality of the HR screening, and once again controlling for things, ~15% of my candidates are filtered out at this step. For my own technical interviews, I\u2019ve observed that only ~25% of candidates that I\u2019ve interviewed have passed their technical interview.", "Step 3. Make a go-no go decision. Good candidates do not struggle with the technical interview. If you\u2019re on the fence, it\u2019s a no. Your team\u2019s time is too valuable to put someone in the process that you don\u2019t think will make it. Also, don\u2019t forget about the \u2018soft\u2019 skills, as well. Do control for introversion, and don\u2019t be unnecessarily harsh, but confidence, poise, brevity, and clarity of communication are important.", "Step 4. Review the technical interview notes to confirm candidate level and \u2018sphere\u2019. Prior to inviting candidates for an onsite interview, make sure to review the level with respect to the strength of their technical interview. In contrast to the guidance above, it\u2019s possible that you could have \u2018mis-leveled\u2019 someone. As a consequence, they could have gotten a much harder technical interview. If you have a more junior level role open, it may be worth considering putting them in the process, only after clearly communicating to the candidate that you\u2019re modifying their expected role. It is rare, but sometimes the technical interview is so impressive that you may be tempted to \u2018bump up\u2019 the candidates level. Don\u2019t. On the margin, you want folks who cost one level and \u2018act\u2019 another level. This leads to more rapid advancement, which keeps people happy.", "Step 5. Provide a level and \u2018sphere\u2019 matched interview panel. If you\u2019re hiring a senior data scientists, make sure to setup the onsite interview to showcase the strength of the team and the vision of the company as a whole. Having a diverse team, including non data scientists, will help to sell the big impact and vision. I have a lot of thoughts here on how to make the best out of a candidates \u2018day of\u2019, but these will be embedded in the next article, specifically.", "Step 6. Review the onsite interview data and make a go/no-go decision. After all is said and done, you (the hiring manager) need to decide. Remember, people will forgive you for passing on a \u2018good candidate\u2019, but hate you for hiring a \u2018bad candidate\u2019. The contrapositive is fickle beast.", "If you live by the sword, you should die by the sword\u2026 more appropriately said, if you create a process follow it. Give it a chance to succeed, or fail, on its own merits. That said, make sure that you track critical aspects of your process. Here are some key performance metrics to track:", "Making a good interview process is iterative, but there are some key tenants to follow:", "Principle 1: Make time for hiring and use your shift in priorities to your advantage.", "Principle 2. Don\u2019t wing it. Write your process down and engineer it to be data driven.", "Principle 3: Modify the process, not your adherence to it.", "If you\u2019re interested in having me proof read your job descriptions, or review your hiring process, let me know!
