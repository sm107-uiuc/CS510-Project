[6]", "They may actively seek out investments \u2014 such as community development loan funds or clean tech portfolios \u2014 that are likely to provide important societal or environmental benefits.", "Some investors embrace sustainable investing strategies to manage risk and fulfill fiduciary duties; they review ESG criteria to assess the quality of management and the likely resilience of their portfolio companies in dealing with future challenges. Some are seeking financial outperformance over the long term; a growing body of academic research shows a strong link between ESG and financial performance. [1]", "Investments marketed as sustainable \u2014 meaning they focus on companies that incorporate environmental and social corporate-governance practices into long-term corporate strategies \u2014 are experiencing explosive growth.", "Although sustainable investing emerged in the 1970s, the movement has gained impressive traction in the last few years.", "Since 2012, total assets in sustainable investing have more than doubled. [2]", "As sustainable investing goes mainstream, it won\u2019t simply act as a niche in a broader strategy \u2014 instead, it\u2019ll be naturally integrated throughout a portfolio.", "\u201cWith the impact of sustainability on investment returns increasing, we believe that sustainable investing is the strongest foundation for client portfolios going forward.\u201d", "\u2014 Larry Fink, BlackRock Chairman, and CEO", "Sustainability is a global force that will continue to factor into everyday decisions.", "The current pool of data around sustainability relies too much on voluntary corporate disclosures, such as annual sustainability reports and company questionnaires put together by institutional investors \u2014 many of which ask different questions. [3]", "\u201cIndividual investors are quite challenged to obtain this type of information in a way that is easily available and informs investment decisions\u201d", "\u2014 Jean Rogers, CEO, and Founder of the nonprofit Sustainability Accounting Standards Board", "It\u2019s challenging for investors to make sustainable investment choices while relying solely on annual sustainability reports and such. They are often hundreds of pages long and take up huge amounts of human resources to analyze. This problem compounds itself over time as the number of sustainable assets increases. These reports are also never completely transparent. Companies may choose to leave certain things out of their annual reports.", "Annual sustainability reports and such are also very static. They do not reflect changes in the company in real-time, they only reflect an accumulation of changes over a fixed period. This approach misses out on all the changes happening in real-time that may be reflected in news articles.", "A more dynamic approach to sustainable investing would take real-time changes into account while also reducing the complexity of analyzing annual sustainability reports. This would make Sustainable Investing more scalable, increasing efficiency while reducing human prone errors.", "Natural Language Processing can be used to analyze sustainability reports and news articles extracting out important ESG centric insights. This reduces the complexity of analyzing reports manually, while also making the approach more dynamic by also looking at real-time changes in news articles.", "Let\u2019s take a look at an example:", "We are proud to have reached 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple facilities, and carbon neutrality for Apple\u2019s corporate emissions, including business travel and employee commute. We are embarking on a new goal to become carbon neutral for our entire carbon footprint by 2030.", "\u2014An excerpt from the 2020 Apple Sustainability Report [4]", "Rather than manually reading the report and analyzing it, an NLP model could perform downstream NLP tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis on the report, reducing the complexity of analyzing a report and making the whole process more time and resource-efficient. In this case, the NLP model would classify the excerpt as relating to \u201cClimate Change\u201d with a sentiment value of \u201cpositive\u201d.", "NLP empowers the investor to make a better and more efficient analysis of reports and articles, leading to a much more informed Sustainable Investment decision.", "At my internship at Parabole.ai, I was able to develop ESG-BERT by further pre-training Google\u2019s \u201cBERT\u201d language model on large unstructured Sustainability text corpora.", "I had tried approaching this problem using \u2018sci-kit learn\u2019 models and \u2018count-vectorizers\u2019. Given the nature of this domain and its unique vocabulary, traditional ML models did not yield satisfactory results. Deep Learning models, on the other hand, required large amounts of structured text data, which we were lacking in this case. There was an abundance of unstructured text data, but structured data was scarce.", "Having tried these approaches, I turned towards Google\u2019s BERT which is pre-trained on large unstructured text corpora and hence requires much less structured data for downstream NLP tasks, such as text classification. This seemed to fit our case quite perfectly. [5]", "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a technique developed by Google for pre-training of Natural Language Processing models. The official BERT repo contains different pre-trained models that can be trained on downstream NLP tasks with an added output layer. These models, however, are pre-trained on general English text corpora, and they are not capable of understanding domain-specific vocabulary.

ESG-BERT was further trained on unstructured text data with accuracies of 100% and 98% for Next Sentence Prediction and Masked Language Modelling tasks. Fine-tuning ESG-BERT for text classification yielded an F-1 score of 0.90. For comparison, the general BERT (BERT-base) model scored 0.79 after fine-tuning, and the sci-kit learn approach scored 0.67.", "The applications of ESG-BERT can be expanded way beyond just text classification. It can be fine-tuned to perform various other downstream NLP tasks in the domain of Sustainable Investing.", "The pre-trained domain-specific ESG-BERT model can be downloaded from the GitHub repository here. It can be fine-tuned to perform downstream NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, etc.", "ESG-BERT was also fine-tuned to perform text classification on Sustainable Investing text data. The fine-tuned model can be downloaded and served, as explained in the readme section of the GitHub repo.", "This is a substantial step towards text mining in Sustainable Investing.", "ESG-BERT can be used to make Sustainable Investing more accessible to investors. It makes Sustainability as a goal more attainable by bridging the gap between complex Sustainability data and investors. Its impacts, however, transcend just text mining. Sustainability Reports are often hundreds of pages long and filled with ESG jargon that most people would not understand. This tool makes these Sustainability reports more readable and accessible to everyone and therefore increasing the impact of Sustainable Investing. This moves us one step closer to a greener, safer, and more sustainable future.", "In the near future, I will be publishing tutorials on how I further pre-trained BERT to create ESG-BERT, how I Fine-Tuned BERT using PyTorch, and talk about the other NLP approaches using \u201ccount-vectorizers\u201d, and \u201cbag of word\u201d models.", "[1] \u2014 Sustainable Investing Basics, US SIF: The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment", "[2] \u2014 Iman Ghosh, Visualizing the Global Rise of Sustainable Investing (2020), Visual Capitalist", "[3] \u2014 Alex Davidson, A Guide to Sustainable Investing (2015), The Wall Street Journal", "[5] \u2014Jacob Devlin and Ming-Wei Chang, Open Sourcing BERT: State-of-the-Art Pre-training for Natural Language Processing (2018), Google AI Blog", "[6] \u2014 Karen Wallace, Interested in Sustainable Investing?
