In the world of data science, Hugging Face is a startup in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, offering its library of models for use by some of the A-listers including Apple and Bing.", "For those wondering why the focus of today\u2019s blog is on a startup, let me first take you through what Hugging Face is all about and why it matters for fellow data scientists.", "Hugging Face, a company that first built a chat app for bored teens provides open-source NLP technologies, and last year, it raised $15 million to build a definitive NLP library. From its chat app to this day, Hugging Face has been able to swiftly develop language processing expertise. The company\u2019s aim is to advance NLP and democratize it for use by everyone.", "In a bid to make it easier for humans to communicate with machines, technologies such as NLP are crucial. For instance, with NLP, it is possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment, and even determine which parts of the text or speech are important. As more companies increasingly add NLP technologies for enhanced interactions, it becomes imperative to have ready libraries on which language models can be trained, saving time and cost. This is where companies like Hugging Face come into play. Its BERT models are considered highly effective and you can see them everywhere.", "Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers or BERT is a technique used in NLP pre-training and is developed by Google. Hugging Face offers models based on Transformers for PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. There are thousands of pre-trained models to perform tasks such as text classification, extraction, question answering, and more. With its low compute costs, it is considered a low barrier entry for educators and practitioners. The company also offers inference API to use those models.", "Hugging Face provides a number of models popular for their effectiveness and seamless implementation. Now that we have a fair idea about Hugging Face and its BERT models, let me give you a brief overview of two of its popular models for language processing.", "One of the popular models by Hugging Face is the bert-base-uncased model, which is a pre-trained model in the English language that uses raw texts to generate inputs and labels from those texts. It was pre-trained with two objectives: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).", "In MLM objective, the model randomly masks 15% of the words in a sentence and then the masked sentence is run through the model to predict the masked words. It allows the model to learn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.", "In NSP objective, the model concatenates two masked sentences as inputs during pre-training. The model has to predict if two sentences were following each other or not. In this way, it learns an inner representation of the English language which can be leveraged for downstream tasks such as training a standard classifier if the dataset is of labeled sentences.", "This bert-base-uncased model is intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task, but it can be used for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction.", "You can use this model with a pipeline for masked language modeling:", "To use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:", "To use this model in TensorFlow:", "Another very popular model by Hugging Face is the xlm-roberta model. This is a multilingual model trained on 100 different languages, including Hindi, Japanese, Welsh, and Hebrew. It is capable of determining the correct language from input ids; all without requiring the use of lang tensors.", "Trained on 2.5T of filtered CommonCrawl data in different languages, the xlm-robeta model is capable of obtaining state-of-the-art results on many cross-lingual understanding benchmarks. It is also a PyTorch subclass model and you can use it as a regular PyTorch module.", "You can check the two pre-trained models here; one is the XLM-R using the BERT base architecture and the other is the XLM-R using the BERT large architecture.", "To use this model for PyTorch 1.0:", "Load XLM-R (for PyTorch 1.0 or custom models):", "To apply sentence-piece-model (SPM) encoding to input text:", "With companies such as Hugging Face providing their pre-trained language models, it becomes easier for businesses to extract easily decodable information on how well their product is functioning instead of deciphering graphs and reports. At the core of NLP is having the technology to understand the very language or inputs the human world functions upon and democratizing it only makes the process more seamless and effective.", "If you are interested in similar content do follow me on Twitter and Linkedin", "Your home for data science.
