A group of women from local Polish chapter of Women in Machine Learning & Data Science (WiMLDS) organization not only thought about it but also decided to create a solution, on their own, to be able to detect birds species \u2014 based on the sound they make.", "This project was designed to be a collaboration on a real-life problem which machine learning can help to solve with a typical structure of a data science project including data research and analysis, data preparation, creation of models, analysis of results (or model improvement) and the final presentation.", "After the weeks of work, the group has managed to build a solution that predicts the right bird\u2019s name with 87% accuracy on the test sample.", "Are you curious about the solution that has been built? We invite you to travel into a world of birds songs.", "The birdsong analysis and classification is a very interesting problem to tackle.", "Birds have many types of voices and the different types have different functions. The most common are song and \u2018other voices\u2019 (e.g. call-type).", "The song is the \u201cprettier\u201d \u2014 melodic type of voice, thanks to which the birds mark their territory and get partners. It is usually much more complex and longer than \u201ccall\u201d.", "Call-type voices include contact, enticing and alarm voices. Contact and attracting calls are used to keep birds in a group during flight or foraging, for example in the treetops, alarm ones to alert (e.g. when a predator arrives). Most often these are short and simple voices.", "Why can sound-based bird classification be a challenging task?", "There are many problems you can encounter:", "So, how were the problems solved in the past?", "Recognizing birds just by their songs might be a difficult task but it does not mean it is not possible. But how to handle those problems?", "To find the answer there was a need to dive into research papers and discovered that most of the work happened to be initiated by the various AI challenges, such as BirdCLEF and DCASE. Fortunately, winners of those challenges usually describe their approaches, so after checking the leader boards some interesting insights were obtained:", "But how to apply CNNs, neural networks designed to extract features from images to classify or segment them, when we only have sound recordings? Mel-frequency cepstrum (MFCC) is the answer.", "But what is it and how does it work?", "Each sound we hear is composed of multiple sound frequencies at the same time. That is what makes the audio sound \u201cdeep\u201d.", "The trick of a spectrogram is to visualize also those frequencies in one plot, instead of visualizing only the amplitude as in the waveform. Mel scale is known as an audio scale of sound pitches that seem to be in equal distance from each other for listeners. The idea behind that is connected with the way how humans hear. When we connect those two ideas we get a modified spectrogram (mel-frequency cepstrum) that simply ignores the sounds humans do not hear and plot the most important parts.", "The longer the length of the audio from which a spectrogram is created, the more information you get on an image but also the more overfitting your model can become. If your data has a lot of noise or silence, there is a chance that 5 seconds lasting audios will not catch the needed information. Therefore it was decided to create images out of 10s lasting audios (and it increased final model accuracy by 10%!). Since the birds sing in high frequencies, high pass filter was applied to remove useless noise.", "After the creation of mel-spectrograms with high pass filter out of 10s lasting audio files, data were split it into train (90%), validation (10%), and test set (10%).", "Built-in Keras library data generators take care of data augmentation and normalization of all spectrograms.", "The final model was built on EfficientNetB3 and on 27 different classes (bird species) with Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss function and balanced class weights. Learning rate was reduced on plateau.", "Finally, the solution predicted the right bird\u2019s name with 87% accuracy on the test sample with:", "If you are interested in seeing the code in a jupyter notebook, you can find it here:", "Your home for data science.
