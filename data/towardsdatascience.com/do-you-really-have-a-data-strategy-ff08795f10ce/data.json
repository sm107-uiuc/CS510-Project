Duplication of data, an overlap of roles and costly data lakes are still the reality in some companies.", "How can we be sure to have a robust data strategy?", "I try to adapt a strategy model coming from Prof. Hambrick (Columbia University) and Prof. Fredrickson (Texas University) to see how can we easily check if we are moving in the right direction. You can see the model in the chart here below.", "Defining a strategy means making clear and visible decisions.", "If we talk about data, it means defining what data we need, which ones we have and how to use them. The amount of data has grown exponentially over the last years in every company. Most of it resides in systems dated back 20 or more years ago, not even designed for data management. And this is a clear challenge to overcome.", "If we have a solid data strategy, we have decided what business needs we want to address with data. We have identified which data we can use and which data we can\u2019t (i.e. due to poor quality or lack of them). We have chosen in which arenas we want to compete and prioritized them based on their contribution to the overall company strategy.", "2. A strategy needs to show the way to get there.", "Being disruptive, being digital, being agile are all fantastic and cheap slogans.", "To make them real, it will cost some more effort.", "If you have a real data strategy, choices have been made on how to materialize the value of data to foster the business needs. You may take a decision to focus on improving the quality of your data before using them or maybe buying the same data externally (i.e. customer information to derive a credit rating risk) to get speed and accuracy in one go.", "You may also have decided clear governance and ownership of data, starting from Master Data. In an article from McKinsey, it is clearly stated how robust governance is key to ensure data quality. But it is also clear, based on my experience, as data ownership cannot be delegated only to the IT department.", "It must sit close to those who care for those data, meaning the function or the business which is more affected by them. Only by doing this, we can make sure strategy is executed properly focusing on what makes sense.", "The challenge here is in transforming data into information. To do this, three things are needed in my view: data need to be available, have decent quality and some intelligence needs to be added to it.", "And to do these three things, you need to know what\u2019s behind your data.", "The question to answer here is how we will win, what will make us successful in implementing the data strategy. Every data strategy must be tailor-made on the business needs and deeply connected to the business strategy.", "Most probably the way we will win with our data strategy will rely on a combination of factors.", "One example, in my experience, maybe overcoming the ERP complexity by creating layers on top of them to collect and aggregate data in an easy and cheaper way than changing all ERPs globally.", "Another way can be to rationalize the applications and build a data lake with enough data to then be able to work on it. This potentially means moving budget from the applications to these layers, reducing the investments done on obsolete applications or limiting their usage to the core functionality. I.e. you can decide to use SAP to manage your financial and logistic process and leave to other tools the role of modeling, forecasting and deep data analysis.", "\u201cThe most value comes from being able to collect and correlate information from different kind of systems\u201d \u2014 Anil Chakravarthy \u2014 ex CEO of Informatica", "4. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day.", "Speed and sequence of events are two components of any strategy. You must have a clear sequence of events/projects and also define the speed of execution.", "Depending on the organization\u2019s culture, you may go faster, in parallel or first create a sense of urgency for a change. Maybe piloting solutions in one business and then showcasing and creating appetite in all others.", "Start executing a data project without a clear sequence and holistic plan may cost you even more. Many companies begin the data lake journey without a clear vision of where to do: this translates into additional costs & complexity to be maintained.", "Part of the strategy must be, in my view, the people component. A strong data strategy must professionalize jobs related to data: both data stewards and data scientists. One cannot exist without the other. You can have the best data scientist in the company but if data stewards are lost and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s the usage of their data, the quality will still be not good enough to run any accurate analysis. If you have the best data stewards but lack data scientists you sit on a gold mountain for nothing.", "5. What do I get out of it?", "This is the typical question many business leaders will ask you when implementing a data strategy.", "While it\u2019s easier to get a price tag to the investment needed for executing a data strategy, it may be more difficult to quantify the benefit of it.", "However, in my view, this is crucial. You must spend time identifying capacity free up, reduction of resources, savings in hardware, reduction of cost of poor quality, increase in the speed of decision.", "All these dimensions, with some proper knowledge, can and must be quantified. In this way you can excite your management every time you go live with a project, putting on the table the savings or the complexity reduction you are driving.", "By doing so, the level of acceptance and buy-in will grow.", "I\u2019ve seen cases of digital strategy done for the sake of putting the word digital on a website. But I also have seen successful implementation with strong financial value coming with it.", "These five items, in my experience, are a good sanity check to validate your data strategy and understand if it is solid enough to move forward full speed.", "\u201cWithout data you\u2019re just another person with an opinion\u201d \u2014 W. Edward Deming", "Luca Condosta(Ph.D.) is a finance professional with global experience in multinational businesses. Passionate for data, leadership, strategy and people.
