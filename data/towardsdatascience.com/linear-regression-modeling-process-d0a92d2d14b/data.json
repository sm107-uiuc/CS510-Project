We\u2019ll do that by taking a look at King County, Washington \u2014 the area around the Puget Sound and east of Seattle. We are going to try and predict the price using a host of parameters that were included in the dataset. This article is going to be a step-by-step instructional on my modeling process. Our process is:", "The first thing we should do is examine a portion of the dataframe, which gives us the output below.", "We are going to refer to the columns of the dataframe as \u2018features\u2019 from now on. The features of the houses include the number of bathrooms and bedrooms, the amount of square footage the house takes up, the size of a second floor and basement (if applicable), the size of the plot of land, and various measures of age and location.", "A good way to get a look at the data is to map it out. Below is a plot of King County with all of the houses. When the data allows for it, this an amazing way to get a feel for your observations.", "The spatial graphs were done with code highlighted here.", "Our next step is to dive deeper into the data \u2014 mainly, we\u2019ll focus on the distribution of the prices and keep an eye out for outliers. The code below sets up the distribution of the prices and also informs the viewer of the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution.", "As you can see from the graph, the distribution is not normal. It is clustered around the left end of the scale with many observations occurring far beyond the peak. I\u2019ve also coded into the graph the skewness and kurtosis of the plot. For more information on skewness and kurtosis, please read the information included here.", "This distribution doesn\u2019t work so now we can take a look at the natural log form of the normal distribution.", "These observations are normally distributed and the skewness and kurtosis are well within normal ranges. We will keep the price in log form for the rest of EDA for visual purposes only. At the end, we will convert the price back to its original form for our results.", "Next, we take a peak for any trends, anomalies, outliers, and possible errors in the data. This takes domain knowledge about house hunting. Anyone looking into a house will look into how many bedrooms and bathrooms it has, the footprint of the house, and how much of the surrounding land comes with the house \u2014 so this is where we will start.", "First, we look at the bedrooms.", "Immediately, we can see that there are some anomalies in the data. We have a number of houses that have no bedrooms that are inexpensive. This goes against the main function of a house so we will have to investigate further. On the other extreme, we have a reasonably priced home that has a dataset leading 33 bedrooms. We will come back to cross-reference these homes after we\u2019ve done a little more EDA.", "Next, we move on to bathrooms.", "It is just as clear here that the data has errors. A house needs a bathroom in order to be considered habitable and a 7.5 bathroom home for less than half a million dollars is suspicious. We will have to clean up the entries but to do so one by one would too inefficient. We will do so in the next section for data cleaning.", "Data cleaning is probably the most important task we have for modeling \u2014 more so than feature engineering. You can make all the features you want, code the most sophisticated model, and even do all the data analysis you can \u2014 none of it means anything if your data is still dirty.", "That's not to say that you will ever get your data completely clean. You will have to make judgement calls that can influence some points, but the point is to fill in the blanks with your best-educated guesses.", "First, we try to clean up the bedroom anomalies.", "Using a vectorization technique np.select(), we try to generalize a cleanup of the bedrooms. This is aimed at the entries with zero bedrooms that deserve more.", "I eventually declined to fix the bedrooms because it would be based on the bathrooms. And imputing data once is acceptable but to impute data with imputed data is a big no-no.", "Creating features will help the model be able to determine the price. The more worthwhile the features, the better the model. I will go over each feature I create \u2014 giving you the reasoning and the code for each of them.", "First, I went with establishing whether a listing is a residence or not. When I loaded the data above, you can see that two of the features are sqft_living and sqft_lot. This is the size of the house and the size of the land it is situated on.", "In the readout above, you can see that the lot sizes are much bigger than the houses \u2014 which is to be expected, but none of the top lot sizes were listed as the top house sizes. So we investigate further.", "Now, we make ratios of the living space with the lot size.", "I simply used the .head() method to call the below readout. As you can see, there are some properties that have very small ratios \u2014 meaning they have lots of land when compared to the size of the house.", "Next, we moved on to the age of the house. Most houses had an entry of zero for yr_renovated. I took this to mean that they were never renovated. The rest had a year entry. So I wanted to make it plain how old the current layout of the house was with a yr_old feature.", "Using the code above, it\u2019s easy to see that for any house that was renovated I subtracted the year it was from the year the data was collected (2015). If it was never renovated, I just subtracted the year it was built from the year the data was collected.", "And lastly, I noticed early that some observations were not homes at all. There were barns, apartment buildings, and even a small airport. So, then I decided to create a binary feature named residence.", "This gave all houses that I thought should be classified as single family residences a value of one \u2014 all others were given a value of zero.", "An important facet for any data science project is the domain knowledge of a given topic. Domain knowledge is the amount of information you have about the topic you are exploring. In this case, domain knowledge would include information about the house market, Seattle and the surrounding suburbs, and central Washington State.", "One facet I used is my domain knowledge of downtown Seattle. Using Pike Place Market as a center point of downtown Seattle, I calculated the distance from each observation to Pike Place. I never said my domain knowledge was all encompassing.", "The geopy package comes with a handy sub-package called geodesic. As we all know, using coordinates to determine distance is tricky because we live on a semi-globe. Meaning that lines of longitude are farther apart the closer you get to the equator. However, this package takes that into account and offers up a distance between two points.", "In the code above, I make tuples out of the latitude and longitude in order to run the geodesic function. I chose kilometers because I have a preference for SI units but that is a choice you can make. After we have a new column that had the distance to Pike Place Market, we strip the km from the column and change it to a float so it can be used in the model.", "Let\u2019s move on to the modeling phase of the project. Our metric is going to be root mean squared error (RMSE). For more information about RMSE, look here. First, we have to load all of the packages.", "Then we divide our data into the features and the target.", "Now, we are ready to run some models. I chose to run just three models for this project:", "Linear Regression is meant to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.", "ElasticNetCV is a model that looks at the data with iterative fitting along a regularization path. The best model is then selected by cross-validation.", "The Gradient Boosting Regressor is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.", "Polynomials were introduced to see if the combination of features would help with the modeling.", "Some models did better than others. Overall, the polynomial dataframe performed worse than the normal dataframe.", "For linear regression, the polynomial dataframe experienced what I can only describe as a fatal malfunction when running on the test data \u2014 except in the case of the ElasticNetCV. That is where it gave the most consistent score between the train and test models.", "However, the model that did the best on the metric that we were following was the Gradient Boosting Regressor working on the normal dataframe. Using 3000 estimators, the model was able to grind down the RMSE on the testing data. But it is interesting to note that the training data had a far lower RMSE \u2014 indicating that the model was overfit for the training data.", "If you\u2019d like to talk more about this, you can contact me on LinkedIn.", "Or if you would like to see this repo on Github, click this link.", "Data Scientist with a Physicist\u2019s heart.
