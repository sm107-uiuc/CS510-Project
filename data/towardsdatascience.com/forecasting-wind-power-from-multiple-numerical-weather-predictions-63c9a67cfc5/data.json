While moderate variation is tolerable, poor predictability is unacceptable and can result in huge revenue loss.", "Wind energy variability is due to strong dependence on weather which changes during the day and seasonally. So, accurate weather prediction is necessary to achieve useful wind power forecasts.", "It is well known that the accuracy of weather predictions improves with a shorter forecast horizon. In addition, combining predictions from models using different numerical techniques can be beneficial. Hence, wind farms rely on multiple sources of weather predictions across models generated at different times of day or days of the week.", "Although the weather cannot be controlled, the wind industry can tap into the advancement of artificial intelligence technologies to improve the predictability of the energy resource.", "Challenges of using multiple weather predictionsLet\u2019s discuss some challenges encountered when using multiple weather predictions for wind power forecasts.", "Tips for handling messy weather dataSome tips for processing weather data from multiple models and at different times are outlined below.", "Feature engineeringBased on domain knowledge, the magnitude of wind velocity computed from horizontal and vertical components is very important for wind power forecasts. This variable should be calculated for each model.", "Adding features such as standard deviation of velocity magnitude at different heights may improve forecast accuracy. In addition, training a model on one-hot-encoded data from multiple wind farms may yield better results than separately training on fewer datasets from each farm.", "Important features relating to wind farm operations such as the fraction of turbines in service could boost forecast performance. This feature is not available for the forecast example in this article. As a result, some power forecasts were obtained even when a wind farm appears to be shut down.", "Sweetviz library was used to explore the variable distributions and relationships between variables. The distributions can be found here and associations between variables are shown below:", "Velocity magnitude shows the strongest association with the target variable (produced power) as expected based on scientific knowledge from the field of fluid dynamics. This emphasizes the importance of physics when applying data-driven solutions to engineering problems.", "Non-time series approach to predicting wind powerAlthough the wind power produced from a turbine or wind farm is a time series with some seasonality, the forecast can be made without using lag features from the target variable. In addition, this method is robust and simpler to implement than the time series approach.", "Power production corresponding to the test set is not available. Hence, a validation set is created from the training data to evaluate model performance. The new training set is 80 percent of the original training data and each observation in the data represents an hourly report indexed by the feature named ID.", "XGBoost algorithm is used to forecast hourly wind power (MW) produced at six wind farms. Cumulative absolute percentage error (CAPE) is used to assess model performance.", "The plots of wind power (MW) versus ID (index of hourly wind power produced) are displayed below for six different wind farms considered.", "The performance of the model varies tangibly across wind farms suggesting that there are some missing wind farm-specific variables that could improve the forecast. Examples of such variables include the fraction of wind turbines in service at the time of forecast and total installed capacity.", "The best performance was obtained for wind farm 6 with a CAPE value of 21.7 percent. The Jupyter lab code for this forecast example including messy weather data cleaning can be found here.", "Next stepsAn artificial neural network algorithm will be implemented using the non-time series approach described here and compared with the XGBoost results. In addition, the time series approach using the long-short term memory (LSTM) algorithm will be investigated. Furthermore, all models from the time series and non-time series approaches will be evaluated using the CAPE metric.", "ConclusionsVariability and predictability of wind energy and the basis for using multiple numerical weather predictions in wind power forecasts were discussed.", "Massive missing data and mismatches in the height at which a variable is predicted need to be handled carefully and some tips were provided for tackling the challenges.", "In addition, knowledge of relevant physics is critical when applying data-driven solutions to engineering problems.", "Finally, wind power was forecasted using numerical weather predictions and wind farm-specific variables without using lag features based on the target.", "What\u2019s more interesting?
