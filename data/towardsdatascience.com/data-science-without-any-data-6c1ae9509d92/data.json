Alas, this is not an isolated incident.", "Data science doesn\u2019t make any sense without data.", "So, let me go ahead and say what so many ambitious data scientists (and their would-be employers) really seem to need to hear.", "If data science is the discipline of making data useful, then you can think of data engineering as the discipline of making data usable. Data engineers are the heroes who provide behind-the-scenes infrastructure support that makes machine logs and colossal data stores compatible with data science toolkits.", "If data science is the discipline of making data useful, then data engineering is the discipline of making data usable.", "Unlike data scientists, data engineers tend not to spend much time looking at data. Instead, they look at and work with the infrastructure that holds the data. Data scientists are the data-wranglers, while data engineers are the data-pipeline-wranglers.", "Data scientists are the data-wranglers, while data engineers are the data-pipeline-wranglers.", "Data engineering work comes in three main flavors:", "You can\u2019t do data science if there\u2019s no data. If you get hired to be head of data science in an organization where there\u2019s no data and no data engineering, guess who\u2019s going to be the data engineer\u2026? You!", "Grocery shopping is easy if you\u2019re just cooking something for your own dinner, but large scale turns the trivial into the Herculean \u2014 how do you acquire, store, and process 20 tons of ice cream\u2026 without letting any of it melt?", "Similarly, \u201cdata engineering\u201d is fairly easy when you\u2019re downloading a little spreadsheet for your school project but dizzying when you\u2019re handling data at petabyte scale. Scale makes it a sophisticated engineering discipline in its own right.", "Scale makes it a sophisticated engineering discipline in its own right.", "Unfortunately, knowing one of these disciplines in no way implies that you know anything about the other.", "If you\u2019ve just felt the urge to run off and study both disciplines, you might be a victim of the (stressful and self-defeating) belief that data professionals have to know the everything of data. The data universe is expanding rapidly \u2014 it\u2019s time we started recognizing just how big this field is and that working in one part of it doesn\u2019t automatically require us to be experts of all of it. I\u2019d go so far as to say that it\u2019s too big for even the most determined genius to swallow whole.", "Working in one part of the data universe doesn\u2019t automatically require us to be experts of all of it.", "Instead of expecting data people to be able to do all of it, let\u2019s start asking one another (and ourselves), \u201cWhich kind are you?\u201d Let\u2019s embrace working together instead of trying to go it alone.", "Maybe. It depends how much you love the discipline you already know. Data engineering and data science are different, so if you\u2019re a data scientist who didn\u2019t train for data engineering, you are going to have to start from scratch.", "Building your data engineering team could take years.", "This might be exactly the kind of fun you want \u2014 as long as you\u2019re going in with open eyes. Building your data engineering team could take years. Sure, it\u2019s nice to have an excuse to learn something new, but in all likelihood, your data science muscles will atrophy as a result.", "As an analogy, imagine you\u2019re a translator who is fluent in Japanese and English. You\u2019re offered a job called \u201ctranslator\u201d (so far, so good) but when you arrive at work, you discover that you were hired to translate from Mandarin to Swahili, neither of which you speak. It might be stimulating and rewarding to take the opportunity to become quadrilingual, but do be realistic about how efficiently you\u2019ll be using your primary training (and how terrifying your first performance review may be).", "In other words, if a company doesn\u2019t have any data or data engineers, then accepting a role as Chief Data Scientist means putting your data science career on hold for a few years in favor of a data engineering career \u2014 that you might not be qualified for \u2014 while you build a data engineering team. Eventually, you\u2019ll gaze proudly at the team you\u2019ve built and realize that it no longer makes sense for you to do the nitty-gritty yourself. By the time your team is ripe for those cool neural networks or fancy Bayesian inference that you did your PhD on, you have to sit back and watch someone else score the goal.", "If you\u2019re considering taking a job as a head of data science, your first question should always be, \u201cWho is responsible for making sure my team has data?\u201d If the answer is YOU, well, at least you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re signing up for.", "Before taking a data science job, always ask about the *who* of data engineering.", "Since data science is at the mercy of data, merely having data engineering colleagues might not be enough. You might face an uphill struggle if those colleagues fail to recognize you as a key customer for their work. It\u2019s a bad sign if their attitude reminds you more of museum curators, preserving data for its own sake.", "While it\u2019s true that you\u2019re a key customer for data engineering, you\u2019re probably not the only customer. Modern businesses use data to fuel operations, often in ways that can hum along nicely enough without your interference. When your contribution to the business is a nice-to-have (and not a matter of your company\u2019s survival), it\u2019s unwise to behave as if the world revolves around you and your team. A healthy balance is healthy.", "Position yourself to have some influence over data engineering decisions.", "Before signing up for your new gig, consider negotiating for ways to hold your data engineering colleagues accountable for collaborating with you. If there are no repercussions to shutting you out, your organization is unlikely to thrive.", "If you\u2019re keen to read more of my writing, most of the links in this article take you to my other musings.
