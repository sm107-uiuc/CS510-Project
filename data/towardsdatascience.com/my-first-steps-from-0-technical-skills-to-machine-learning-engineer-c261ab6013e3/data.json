Here, I talk about my introduction to data as an analyst intern, and how I got started on the path to becoming a machine learning engineer at a fortune 500 company. Tips and FAQ getting started in data science at the bottom.", "I get a fair number of requests asking about my journey into the world of data science and advice I can offer, so much so that I figured I might as well use it as fuel for a column of self-indulgent content. From my humble beginnings in data back in 2015 to my current position as a machine learning engineer at Pfizer in 2019, I want to tell you about my experience \u2014 triumphs, challenges and helpful things I\u2019ve picked up along the way in my first TDS column: ky=mx+b (terrible I know).", "In 2015, I had just finished undergrad and was starting an MS in Molecular and Cellular Biology at Quinnipiac University. Rent ain\u2019t cheap, so I began searching for part-time jobs in my field. I was accepted as a Data Analyst Intern at biotechnology company in Branford, CT. My job was pretty straightforward: conduct research and input data within the field of novel immunological therapies. Cool, I thought. Definitely not curing cancer here but it\u2019s great experience at a good company.", "However, as time passed, the company began to generate more and more data from its novel biological assay. My boss (the lead software engineer at the company) came to me with additional asks: \u201cHave you taken any programming courses? We\u2019re interested in analyzing our data using a statistical programming language like R or Python.\u201d", "I had taken two programming courses before; one in Matlab (which I sucked at) and one in Scala (which was fun but didn\u2019t apply here). Still, you can\u2019t ask for a much better deal than getting paid to learn how to code, so I thought, screw it\u2026 let\u2019s give this a shot.", "I began spending time on massive open online course (MOOC) sites like Datacamp.com, making slow but noticeable progress with basic commands and statistical analysis in R. I started to run statistical tests like Mann-Whitney and t-tests and even began to conduct dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA) to report back to my boss.", "Now, keep in mind \u2014 and I cannot stress this enough \u2014 the code I was writing was terrible. I was basically keeping templates for all these commands in sticky notes on my computer, changing variables by hand instead of writing functions, and copy/pasting wherever I could. But even with a minimal understanding of statistics, machine learning, and programming, I was beginning to cultivate an interest in basic data science.", "Over time, I started to develop a better ritual on Datacamp, moving through more and more lectures each day. As I finished up an MS in an entirely unrelated field, I learned more about the world of data science and the career opportunities that existed within it. I started Python classes too \u2014 and allowed my online course achievements to inflate my ego a bit as I traversed lists, assigned variables, and printed \u201dHello, World!\u201d", "This is around the time I heard about the rise of these things called \u201cdata science bootcamps.\u201d", "After three months of full-time training, you could get a certificate proving your worth in data science using R and Python. These bootcamps even offered career support through their enterprise connections, attempting to quell the gross lack of qualified industry professionals in the wake of the data science boom. However, I had my reservations\u2026", "1. These bootcamps were relatively new and \u00adexpensive. Did I want to spend that much money on a flop? On something that, in retrospect, I didn\u2019t really even know all that well? Why not do the safe bet and go with another MS from an accredited institution?", "2. I was just about to finish my MS. Did I really want to start more school now?", "3. My company, knowing my bootcamp considerations and graduation date, had made me an offer to start as a full-time data analyst. I could immediately have a stable position and job security at a company I knew in CT .", "After running through my options, I made a decision. As I was finishing my MS in late 2016, I began to apply to data science bootcamps. Although I was interested in a few, I looked most closely at the New York City Data Science Academy. I completed the online application and was called for an in-person interview in New York City. I took the train in and prepared to be interviewed by bootcamp instructors.", "This, for me, is one of the more notable moments in my data science journey. You don\u2019t know much you don\u2019t know until you\u2019re being interviewed by someone who knows a lot more than you. Sure, I had been using Python and R in some, very specific capacities \u2014 but I didn\u2019t yet understand them. I had been doing machine learning\u2026but copying and pasting code certainly didn\u2019t make me an expert. As I was asked questions about my work, I realized how much further I had to go \u2014 and that I was going to need some kind of education and support system to get there.", "I answered questions well enough in the interview (at least well enough to be accepted), but the realization of how little I actually knew made an impression \u2014 I was going to need some kind of formal education and support system to improve my skillset here. As my ego, inflated from arbitrary online successes began to shrink (and this is not the last time this would happen), I made the decision to go all in \u2014 to move to NYC and attend the bootcamp full-time.", "There are so many sites and courses for getting started with the basics of data science\u2026which one should I pick?", "I get this question a lot. In my honest opinion, it doesn\u2019t really matter too much. The basics for these disciplines are consistent and pretty standardized. I picked Datacamp at the time, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it was the only right choice \u2014 I just liked the UX. Don\u2019t rule out the cheap courses. Just get yourself started in a way that feels right for your learning style. In fact, it\u2019s probably best to go to multiple sources for a wider breadth of perspective.", "Should I attend a bootcamp or think about a higher education degree?", "A full-time bootcamp was attractive to me at the time because I was impatient, just finishing one MS, and data science/machine learning degrees were not widely offered. As I have no MS in data science, I can\u2019t speak to that experience. An accredited degree might make your resume more competitive if you have no data science background, but full-time bootcamps are still very comprehensive in terms of content (although it\u2019s covered in 3 months versus 2 years). I\u2019ve also heard qualms about real world experience in MS programs. They have the theoretical content, but are less in touch with industry. Bootcamps are more agile and geared towards enterprise data science roles in nature given their size and ability to adapt the curriculum to the rapid market and technological changes.", "Do I need any kind of formal education at all with all the resources online?", "Technically speaking, there\u2019s probably enough open source and cheap content online for you to become a full-fledged data scientist without ever having taken a course. However, unless you\u2019re the kind of person who can teach yourself an entire degree\u2019s worth of material with little to no support (I most certainly am not), I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. You\u2019re likely going to run into issues and misjudge your capability without a more intensive education and peers to collaborate with. Additionally, it\u2019ll probably be tough to get your foot in the door for employment if you don\u2019t have any work experience or formal education. As this person says (and similar to my experience), your first interview is going to be a real wake up call if you rely only on MOOCs. Finally, learning data science is like going to the gym \u2014 if you\u2019re paying for a membership, you\u2019re that much more likely to make yourself get up and go at it.", "Python. I like R for statistics and visualization, but Python for literally everything else. It\u2019s a stronger engineering language with a larger community, and is probably going to be a must have skill for a lot of jobs in the 2020s.", "Are there things I should learn besides Python, R, SQL and machine learning?", "There are a ton of things you could learn. Linux/Unix, Docker, Kubernetes, Spark, various Apache frameworks\u2026the list goes on and on. Don\u2019t let it overwhelm you. Start with the basics and branch out.", "There\u2019s so much out there, where do I even get started?", "Google around for the basics in Python, watch some Youtube videos on machine learning, and look at some boiler plate SQL. Play around a bit, see if you like it. If your interest is piqued, the rest will take care of itself.", "The next time I write, it\u2019ll likely be about my bootcamp experience and career journey. For now, feel free to follow me on medium or connect with me on LinkedIn! I\u2019m also trying to do a bit more on Twitter, but we\u2019ll see how that goes.
