Luckily, I\u2019m a big fan of my name and its uniqueness here in the states. Despite what the Freakonomists say, I\u2019d like to believe that the uniqueness of my name has helped me in my life or at the very least made it more interesting.", "Wanting to quantify how unique my name is, I discovered I\u2019m part of an exclusive club of 101 boys named Jan in the US on my birth year. Simply said, my name is not very common at less than 0.005% of all baby boys born that year. So far, I have yet to meet one of the 100 other elusive Jans.", "I found this data from the US baby name data set from the Social Security Administration (SSA) website www.ssa.gov. While they have some great views (like the most popular names in a given period) to find the above statistic, I needed to download the data and play around with it myself. I uploaded it to Tableau and found myself discovering many names and trends much more interesting than my own.", "Before launching into the visualizations, it\u2019s always smart to make sure you understand how the data is generated. After reading the SSA documentation and discovering that the data set purposefully excludes some births, I hunted down a second source of data. Plotting the total US births for comparison (brown line below) against the number of births per year from the baby name data set (gray line below) I could visualize how much data was missing.", "The SSA docs explained that many people born before 1937 never applied for a social security card, so their names are not included in the baby name data set. This explains the large yet narrowing difference we see between the two lines before this date. (Moving forward we will remove this incomplete data.)", "In recent years the difference between the two lines increases. Again the documentation tells us that for anonymity reasons any name with less than 5 occurrences in a given year isn\u2019t recorded. So, this gap actually informs us of the number of births with very unique names (<5 occurrences) and indicates that recently there are more very unique names per year than a few decades ago.", "This caught my curiosity and I decided to dig into the idea of name uniqueness and name commonality over time.", "When looking at the number of unique names in any given year (that occurred 5 or more times) we see large changes across the decades. The below plot shows that there were fewer than 10k unique names in the 1940s which more than tripled to over 30k in the 2000s. Additionally, baby girl names have always had more variety than baby boy names.", "Traveling through time to the late 1960s we start to see an acceleration in the number of unique names and continues through the start of the new millennium. The mid 1960s marks the end of the Baby Boomer Generation and the start of Generation X and, while US history isn\u2019t my strength, I hypothesize that the large cultural shift of the time (in part due to the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights Movement, the British Invasion, etc.) plays a factor in the trend we see.", "Continuing on our journey through time, we start to see this acceleration reverse in the late 2000s. This time around, the generation transition doesn\u2019t line up cleanly with the trends we see in the plot. Wikipedia pegs the end of the Millennial Generation (aka Gen Y) somewhere between the mid-1990s and the early 2000s. This transition is smack dab in the middle of some of the steepest increases in unique names. By the time we see the downward trend, we are well into Gen Z.", "The macro downwards trend seems to be driven by a reduction in unique girl names (as boy names are flat/slightly down). Why this reversal is happening is hard to say and I don\u2019t have a good hypothesis as to why. Based on my digging, the following hypotheses are unlikely to be the cause.", "While we still don\u2019t have a good hypothesis on why baby girl name uniqueness is on the decline for the first time in decades, it appears that baby boy name uniqueness is still increasing \u2014 just at smaller rates than before. If you have another hypothesis please share it in the responses (bonus points if you support it with evidence from this data set or elsewhere).", "As a side note, the rather interesting trend in the above plot during the 1970s aligns with the increasing trend we saw back in Visualization 1 and adds color to what was happening. The uniqueness of names that represent more than 10k births started decreasing as the growth of all other buckets started accelerating. The more unique the name, the larger the growth.", "While we have learned a lot by looking at name uniqueness over the years, we are missing something very important: the distribution of births.", "The distribution is important as without it we can\u2019t be certain whether the majority of births are concentrated with only a small percentage of those unique names or uniformly distributed across all names. Take a quick guess as to which it is.", "Leveraging the Pareto Principle (or better known as the 80/20 rule), let\u2019s look into how many births the most common names capture. Simply said the 80/20 rule states that 80% of the effects can be contributed to 20% of the causes. If this holds in the name world, we should discover that about 200 names in the 1940s and about 600 names in the 2000s should account for about 80% of births (see our learnings in the first section).", "When running the numbers we find that 20% of the unique names in the 1940s account for about 64% of the births and 60% in the 2000s. While we don\u2019t quite hit that mythical 80/20 ratio, the theory still holds where a smaller portion of the name contributes to many of the births. The below plot looks at the contribution of the top 100 most common names over time but by sex.", "We see baby boy names are much more common than baby girl names (78% to 70% at the peak in 1947). This isn\u2019t surprising based on what we found earlier \u2014 there are less unique boy names and the common ones are more popular than baby girl names.", "Name commonness starts to decrease in the late 1940s. This decease is very steep for baby girls, while for baby boys we see a more gradual decrease. By 2010, we see the top 100 boy and girl names only represent 11% and 5% respectively. For boys this went from about 4 in 5 babies in the top 100 name club to only about 1 in 10.", "When looking at the top names In 1947, 23% of baby boys were named either James, Robert, John, William, or Richard. The top 5 Girl names (see below), however, only represented about 17% of all baby girl births. For girls, name commonality dropped so quickly that in 1975 the top five girl names only contributed to 2% where for boys it was still as 10%.", "Looking at these names over time, we see that many of them peaked in 1947, the beginning of the Baby Boomer Generation. Just look at Linda! The name was super popular for less than a decade and then quickly and sharply declined. While Linda\u2019s change was the most dramatic, many of these names are seriously less popular nowadays than during the Baby Boomer Generation.", "What could have influenced some of these spikes? What names are popular now? Are there any old names that made a resurgence recently?
