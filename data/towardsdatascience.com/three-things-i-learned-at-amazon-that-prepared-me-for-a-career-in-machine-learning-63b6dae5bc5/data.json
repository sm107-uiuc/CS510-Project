While there are lots of stories out there about working at Amazon, I felt like the culture there did more to prepare me for my job switch from game development to machine learning than any tutorial ever could.", "If you don\u2019t know much about Amazon\u2019s culture, it\u2019s worth a quick Google search. Moreover, while I could probably write an entire book covering my experience there, I thought I\u2019d focus on three things I learned that prepared me for this new career move: being data-driven, writing 6-pagers, and being resourceful. Amazon has a set of tenets, called the leadership principles, that contribute to its unique culture. This same culture has allowed Amazon to grow since I joined back in 2014 exponentially. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ve applied some of this knowledge to my new adventure in machine learning.", "Perhaps the most significant part of Amazon\u2019s corporate culture is the concept of being data-driven.", "While many companies I\u2019ve worked at say they practice this, I\u2019ve yet to find one like Amazon. Every planning or strategy meeting is a delicate balancing act between reviewing historical data, live data, and future data predictions. Amazon has this down to a science.", "From the WBR (weekly business reports) that attempt to distill vast amounts of data into digestible forms that can be used to course-correct at any time, to the fact that most groups had dedicated data analysts. An analyst\u2019s sole job is to help build weekly reports, connect reporting systems across different business units, and mostly automate as much data collecting as possible so we can always have a snapshot of the state of the business unit.", "The backbone of machine learning is the data itself. Without useful, clean, reliable data, there is no way to train, test, and validate a model accurately. Moreover, while a lot of time and effort goes into the actual process around building the model, understanding the data itself is a critical skill to have. For example, I did a talk at ODSC East, specifically around the challenges of managing large sets of data used to detect cancer such as the ChestXray14 dataset.", "The title of the workshop was called \u201cPutting the \u2018data\u2019 in data science,\u201d and it focuses entirely on the challenges around using medical data for deep learning. A critical skill anyone interested in machine learning should have is the ability not only to understand how to manage and process the data, but also how to segment, validate, and sanitize it. Your experiments are only as good as the data you have, and knowing how to manage it is just as critical. I learned a lot at Amazon on the importance of data and how to properly use it.", "Amazon is notoriously known for its writing culture. While they tell you in the orientation that anyone can suggest an idea and create a new business from scratch, such as the myth around how AWS came about, but the way this happens is through 6-pagers. These are detailed documents that not only explain a strategy or initiative, but it also has to be written as a narrative. There are no powerpoint presentations in Amazon meetings.", "Most meetings involved spending the first half reading the document and the second half poking holes in it. To be successful at Amazon requires you to be able to use data to prove your point, articulate your ideas in a way that others can understand, and create a document that anyone, regardless if they were in your meeting or not, could pick up and understand.", "The most critical skills any data scientist or engineer working in the machine learning space should have; being able to communicate what they are doing, how to reproduce it, and the value it provides.", "A large part of the data science community revolves around writing and reading research papers. So while this is an easy analogy to the importance of how 6-pagers work at Amazon, since writing one feels like creating a Ph.D. thesis document, in reality, data scientists should be documenting their research for multiple reasons. Usually, they are working in teams, so being able to track the steps taken to arrive at a solution is crucial. Being able to capture and share this knowledge with others on the team or outside of the company is not a skill everyone has without lots of practice.", "I\u2019d argue that this alone is one of the most critical skills any data scientist or engineer working in the machine learning space should have; being able to communicate what they are doing, how to reproduce it, and the value it provides.", "On the outside, Amazon appears to be a large organization with almost limitless resources; the reality is that groups in each department are usually tiny. So small in fact that they are borderline understaffed at times. Besides, groups are expected to run lean, manage limited resources accordingly, and most of the time, you end up wearing multiple hats.", "While a group can get more resources, a core Amazon tenet is to be frugal. To be successful at Amazon requires you to do the best with what you have and be creative to achieve your end goals. There is even a tenet called bias for action that allows you to bend the rules to get something done regardless of the limitations as long as it\u2019s for the good of the end goal.", "I wasn\u2019t expecting the amount of time it takes between each training or the GPU resources needed to speed this up.", "As I dig deeper into machine learning, it\u2019s clear to me how managing resources plays a critical role in every experiment I run. I wasn\u2019t expecting the amount of time it takes between each training or the GPU resources needed to speed this up. Plus as I run more and more experiments, I need to find creative ways to balance scaling in the cloud and leveraging local resources.", "Most of the time, I\u2019ll do as much local testing as I can, then concurrently run my experiment in the cloud on multiple computers with different modifications to better assist which solution is the best. Currently, data scientists are hard to hire so chances are you\u2019ll end up working in smaller teams and need to figure out how to share the resources between everyone and speed up the time between training models while keeping the costs down. It\u2019s a delicate balancing act.", "People ask me why I made the shift from game development to machine learning, and one of the things that I was most interested in was how to solve a lot of the problems I see data scientists struggle with daily. How do you manage multiple experiments at the same time, deal with large datasets, and scale the workload to be more productive? These are all the things I learned doing Web development years before I got into the games industry and felt like I can help contribute what I know back to the machine learning community.", "Recently I\u2019ve been doing talks around the idea of DeepOps \u2014 or deep learning operations. It\u2019s a concept, borrowed from DevOps, to automate all the pain points of deep learning. These happen to be some of the skills I learned at Amazon as well. I find it interesting just how much overlap there is between what made me successful at Amazon and what is currently helping me get better at machine learning. It\u2019s incredible what you can accomplish when you build these kinds of practices into the culture of a company and hopefully, with enough time, DeepOps can be its own culture too. However, that\u2019s an article for another time.", "Your home for data science.
