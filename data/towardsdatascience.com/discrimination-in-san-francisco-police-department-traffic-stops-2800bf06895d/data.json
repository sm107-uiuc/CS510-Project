Now, I\u2019m not writing to convince you that there is systemic racism in our policing system: here\u2019s an article to help you get started. Rather, instead of focusing on policing as a whole, I aim to investigate racial discrimination in traffic stops conducted by police departments through data science, mainly by using hypothesis testing. While there is already well-researched evidence of racial bias in police traffic stops, I wanted to explore racial discrimination in traffic stops conducted by the San Francisco Police Department. I decided to study the SFPD because San Francisco is regarded as a liberal city, and I wanted to understand what being \u201cliberal\u201d really means in regards to racism in a city\u2019s police department. Therefore, the question I posed as I started working on this project is as follows:", "Is there evidence of discrimination against Black people in regards to the outcome of traffic stops conducted by the San Francisco Police Department?", "To acquire traffic stop data, I used data compiled by the Stanford Open Policing Project, a team of researchers and journalists at Stanford University who collected and standardized vehicle and pedestrian stop data from law enforcement departments across the country. More information about the structure of their data can be found here.", "After importing the data for traffic stops in San Francisco into Python, I began cleaning and preparing the data for the next step of my analysis. I first visualized the NA values in the dataset through a heat map (shown below) using the Seaborn Python package.", "In this heat map, the red color indicates the presence of an NA value. Since the \u201ccontraband_found\u201d and \u201csearch_basis\u201d columns have far too many NA values to solve through imputation, I simply removed these columns from the dataset. To deal with the remaining NA values, any row containing an NA value was also dropped from the dataset.", "Finally, the last step of preparing the data is making sure each column has an appropriate data type. For this dataset, I only needed to change the \u201cdate\u201d column to a datetime object.", "Now that the data has been prepared, it\u2019s time to move onto the exploratory data analysis. The first step in this process was showing the counts of each value in the categorical columns of the dataset using the Pandas value_counts function. During this step, I noticed that there was a problem in the \u201creason_for_stop\u201d column, as some rows were labelled with a new reason although an established category already existed for that reason. For example, while there were already many stops that occurred as a result of a \u201cDUI Check\u201d, a few stops had \u201cMoving Violation|DUI Check\u201d listed as their \u201creason_for_stop\u201d. Taking a step back, I returned to the data cleaning and preparation step to fix all occurrences of this error.", "This situation illustrates a key aspect of the data science process; while it is easier to view the data science process as a linear series of steps from data preprocessing to EDA to data analysis/modeling, the reality is that most of the time, you have to take a step back to deal with previously unforeseen problems in your data.", "Next, I defined a function that builds on Pandas\u2019 crosstab function to construct a cross tabulation of proportions across two factors. Using this function, I generated a table that compares the racial proportion of people who were arrested as a result of a traffic stop for each unique reason of the traffic stop. This table was then visualized as a bar chart such that for each reason of the stop, the proportions of each racial group that were arrested as a result of the traffic stop can be compared.", "Already, it appears that Black individuals are arrested at higher rates than the rest of the population, specifically when the reason for the stop is \u201cMPC Violation\u201d and \u201cBOLO/APB/Warrant\u201d.", "To answer my question, I\u2019m going to need some concrete evidence, not just a bar chart. To that extent, I will be utilizing hypothesis testing, which is when an analyst tests an assumption using sample data to make a statement about the population the sample is supposed to represent. Of the many specific tests I can use, I used a two-proportion Z-test, which can be used to determine whether the difference between two sample proportions is significant.", "When conducting a hypothesis test, it is crucial to state your null hypothesis, which is a statement about your population parameter, and your alternative hypothesis, which directly contradicts your null hypothesis. For example, my null hypothesis states that the proportion of Black people arrested as a result of an SFPD traffic stop is less than or equal to the proportion of people of all other races arrested as a result of an SFPD traffic stop. On the other hand, my alternative hypothesis argues that the proportion of Black people arrested as a result of an SFPD traffic stop is greater than the proportion of people of all other races arrested as a result of an SFPD traffic stop.", "The next step is to decide on a significance level. Conducting hypothesis test allows you to calculate a p-value using your test statistic, and if your p-value is less than your significance level, you reject the null hypothesis, and vice versa. For the my Z-test, I set my significance level to 0.01.", "Now, it\u2019s time for the Z-test. Using the statsmodels proportions_ztest function, I calculated the Z-score and p-value comparing the proportion of Black people arrested for an SFPD traffic stop and proportion of people of all other races arrested for an SFPD traffic stop. When considering the entire dataset, with the previously mentioned null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, and significance level, the results of my Z-test led me to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that Black people are arrested at higher rates than people of other races as a result of an SFPD traffic stop. I then repeated this process, this time subsetting the dataset for each \u201creason_for_stop\u201d before conducting my Z-test. The results of this step are shown below.", "Therefore, while Black people are arrested at higher rates than people of other races across the entire dataset, this difference in arrest rates is only consistent when considering traffic stops due to \u201cMechanical or Non-Moving Violation (V.C.)\u201d, \u201cBOLO/APB/Warrant\u201d, \u201cMoving Violation\u201d, and \u201cMPC Violation\u201d.", "While playing around with the dataset, I grew curious about the relation between the ongoing gentrification of San Francisco county and the number of traffic stops. As a result, I decided to take my project a step further and see if there was a correlation between gentrification and traffic stops.", "First, I had to identify what metrics I would use to define gentrification. Inspired by this article, I decided that I would use income and level of educational attainment to define gentrification.", "Next, I had to figure out how I would acquire this data for San Francisco specifically. Luckily, the CensusData Python package provides access to American Community Survey data. Along with the official United States Census Bureau documentation, I found the aggregate household wage or salary income and highest level of educational attainment for residents of San Francisco County from 2009 to 2015.", "To compare these metrics to the number of traffic stops conducted by SFPD each year between 2009\u20132015, I had to first re-scale the data to range between 0 and 1 to better visually compare how these metrics change:", "Assuming that the increasing aggregate household income due to wage or salary and increasing proportion of residents with a graduate or professional degree indicate an increase in gentrification, it appears that the number of traffic stops conducted by the SFPD each year drops with gentrification (barring a large increase in traffic stops from 2014 to 2015). To find concrete evidence for this claim, I found the correlation between the levels of highest educational attainment, aggregate household income due to wage or salary, and number of stops in a year:", "From the above heat map, we can definitively conclude that there is a moderate negative correlation between our two metrics for gentrification and the number of traffic stops each year. Of course, this conclusion should be taken with a grain of salt, as gentrification is much more complicated than the two metrics I used.", "Through this project, I identified racial discrimination in traffic stops conducted by the San Francisco Police Department. Specifically, Black people are arrested as a result of a traffic stop in San Francisco at higher rates than people of all other races.", "Furthermore, I found that there is a moderate negative correlation between gentrification in San Francisco and number of traffic stops conducted by SFPD between 2009 and 2015. This means that as San Francisco grows increasingly gentrified, the number of traffic stops conducted drops.", "The code used for this project can be found here.", "As a disclaimer, being employed by the SFPD does not make an individual racist. The SFPD, as an organization, shows patterns of racism, which can stem from a variety of sources such as police training, department culture, etc. but this doesn\u2019t vindicate SFPD officers as racists.", "Your home for data science.
