After all, its the dream job sector with sky-high salary, all hype about Artificial General Intelligence, Cognitive Machine Learning, etc. Popular media is obsessed with every breakthrough by so-called AI powerhouses. It\u2019s not just sexy but immensely glamorous to have Artificial Intelligence, Data Scientist, or Machine Learning tag with one\u2019s career.", "But the sexiest job does not mean everything is hot. Many aspects of Data science are gruesome and sometimes even scary.", "In this article, I will use Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence interchangeably.", "Don\u2019t go by the look, if you are serious better know what you are going to face for the rest of your professional life if you are starting your journey in Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence.", "I hear every day, \u201cyou guys are so lucky. Just write a few lines python code with fit/predict, and your model is ready\u201d. I wish it were so simple. As Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence relies heavily on Mathematics, a deep understanding (indeed its deep learning for anyone who wants to build a career in data science) of Mathematics is needed. Linear Algebra, Statistics, Calculus, etc. with an advanced level of application is necessary not just for Ph.D. holders, but for those who want to do a more high-end (or maybe \u201csexy\u201d) areas of data science. Thus, if you don\u2019t like a complex equation or scary, notations better start loving it for now on.", "Data science is a field with knowledge areas from multiple disciplines. New fields are getting included either as inspiration or expansion of ideas and applications. With interest from Government, Companies, and researchers, this field is booming with extraordinary advancement in recent years. The number of research work going on is mind-boggling. The area is progressing very fast and keep up with changes; the practitioner needs to upgrade their skill and knowledge continually. Every day new papers are coming out, and some are improving previous state-of-the-art by a significant proportion. Thus we have no choice but to learn about the new change and adopt it in a job or research or application. You need to engage in real \u2018Deep Learning\u2019 of the subject every day.", "This one I am sure well known, but still, I want to make sure you don\u2019t have any misconception. Data cleaning and data pre-processing is the most unsexy annoying part of Data Science but no escape from it. Don\u2019t assume, if you are in a world-famous leading AI firm, you won\u2019t require to do this dirty job. Only top few % are exempted from this routine torture and if you are not in those top few % then make up your mind that you have to run this dirty task of cleaning the dirt, scratch all short or long hair to have some more data from some new source that you heard during your lunch break food table. It is very repetitive like handling missing data, converting data, combining data, managing different pipeline to bring all in a consistent format that your model understand, basically infinite list of BORING work. But YOU HAVE TO DO IT, no escape. Just get used to it.", "You might have been a superstar in Kaggle where you came in the top 5 in many competitions, but sorry, you will find real-life projects 10\u201330 times harder than any Kaggle competition. Mostly you will have a struggle in how to gather data, define a clear scope and way of measuring success. You may not have to compete with 100 others where every time you submit, you know where you stand, but in real life, there is no competition other than your group competing for a slice of corporate budget or meeting a target. If you have a model that is running in production, then you are lucky as you know there is a baseline, and you are trying to improve. Kaggle is good for your foundation and fame but does remember real-world problems are much harder and success is", "Machine Learning model training takes time, and most of the time, multiple iterations. In this age of Deep Learning with 100+ hidden layers, thousands of features, and millions of records, the model takes a very long time to train even that with hundreds of GPU/TPU units. Thus you have to learn how to live through these iterations as many occasions you have to restart again.", "If you dream of being a top data scientist, you have to get used to reading the latest research paper submitted by experts in the archive. There is an explosion of the research paper, and the majority of the paper\u2019s claim can not be replicated as they don\u2019t provide specifics or code to perform the test based on a new algorithm that the author has advocated. Still, exceptional new ideas are coming out, and the only source to keep yourself updated or adopt the proposed architecture is through a deeper understanding of the paper. You have to make a habit as well as find a way to focus only on what relevant.", "This may not be surprising as in many other departments, too, the business has no clue what they need or also want. Requirements will be so vague that even lawyers will have trouble interpreting what those few lines (if at all exist) means. Most of the organizations have business leaders who don\u2019t understand the technical part of Data science or AI, but they would pretend to know everything (just like many of the patients think they know more than their doctor). A statement like we want to revolutionize the way we do our current business through this AI project, we want to see a 30% adoption increase, etc. Just get used to it as you might have to deal with, these very high expectations, or you may have to explain the outcome of a model with lots of visual explanation and data which your business department still may not understand. If you are lucky and in a start-up or a technology-first company, then you might not face this struggle but, in general, get used to this situation, which is very common in many industries where AI and ML adoption has just started.", "Yes, the role of a data scientist is quite demanding, and in many organizations, you need to be a jack of all trade in Data science. You need to know how the end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline works. How train and test pipelines need to be planned. You have to get involved in the engineering side of the data science team with involvement in server/storage configuration, container management, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, front end web interface building with Django, may have to play the role of full stack developer. You need to do a cleanup job for the productization of your model. It is like wearing many hats at the same time, thus get used to these challenging parts of the data science role.", "You might be working in a team that is working on a mission-critical project using the latest state-of-the-art NLP architecture. Still, your project is running late due to multiple reasons beyond anyone\u2019s control. By the time you reached acceptance testing level after three months of struggle, you had realized there is a new state of the art that Google has just made open-source, and your competitor has already started working on it. Welcome to supersonic change in the data science field. What is new today, becoming obsolete soon. Get used to this new usual way of your professional life.", "You will see, in many projects or decision points, you have to try out multiple ways before something clicks. Data science is not just science but also a form of art. Many of these black Art is more like a trial and error method with or without theoretical backing. You have to do lots of R&D before making a small step as there are multiple ways to accomplish the same task, but each one gives a slightly different result. What worked for project X may not work for project Y. Here re-inventing the wheel is required if your loss function or optimizer is not giving the desired outcome or the speed. You might have to try out a few of them with the smaller dataset and see which one works. You need to experiment with few strategies, and if none works then, you may need to change the course of action altogether. The bottom line is data science is a field that is quite similar to the R&D field, and you need to get used to this work culture.", "Many things make the life of data scientists extraordinarily demanding, and in times it feels how to get out of it. But do remember once you master the survival game, you are doing the sexiest job. Many people are successful only because they take all these challenges, the shortcoming to become successful.", "I look forward to your comment and share if you have any unique experience related to challenges in this profession.
