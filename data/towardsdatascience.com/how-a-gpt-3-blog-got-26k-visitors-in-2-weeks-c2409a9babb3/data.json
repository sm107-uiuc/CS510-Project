It is currently deemed as the state-of-the-art for NLP-related tasks, achieving better results than its predecessors.", "GPT-3 is not yet publicly available. However, OpenAI have allowed access of the model\u2019s API for beta testers, letting people experiment with the model.", "As it turns out, the model can even create codes in various languages just by processing descriptions in natural language. Here is one of the examples posted in Twitter.", "These kind of tweets about GPT-3\u2019s capabilities have sparked a lot of reactions. An article titled \u201cWill The Latest AI Kill Coding?\u201d entertained the idea of AI taking over programming jobs, followed promptly by another article \u201cGPT-3 Will Not Take Your Programming Job\u201d", "In the tweet\u2019s video, the model would process prompts such as \u201ca button for every colour of the rainbow\u201d and correctly creates 7 buttons, each representing one colour of the rainbow.", "At around the 50 seconds mark, you would notice that the model generates a code with syntax error. It actually worked after a bit of a tweak by the creator, which is quite amazing. However, I don\u2019t think it would make programmers obsolete in the near future.", "While creating programming scripts may not be GPT-3\u2019s strongest domain, a college student would go on to demonstrate where the model could take on humans. Blogging.", "GPT-3 isn\u2019t great with logic, so inspirational posts would probably be best, maybe some pieces on productivity too. (source)", "In his own blog, Liam Porr said that he chose self-help theme because \u201cGPT-3 is great at creating beautiful language that touches emotion, not hard logic and rational thinking.\u201d", "Liam created the substack page Adolos, a clever wordplay on the name of Greek\u2019s God of deception Dolos. He defined the headline and introductions for each article, and let the model create its content based on them. After a bit of grammar and fact correction, he posted the articles.", "The very first post, \u201cFeeling unproductive? Maybe you should stop overthinking.\u201d, ended up at the top of Hacker News. Here\u2019s a couple paragraphs from the said article.", "Definition #1: Creative Thinking (CT) is the act of using your mind to come up with ideas that are not already present in reality or that have never existed before. It is a form of mental activity that involves the use of logic and reason.", "Definition #2: Over-Thinking (OT) is the act of trying to come up with ideas that have already been thought through by someone else. OT usually results in ideas that are impractical, impossible, or even stupid.", "Now, how do these two concepts relate to each other? Well, if you\u2019re like me then you probably find yourself doing both at times. You might be working on a project all day long, but you still feel as though you\u2019re just going through the motions. This is because you\u2019re thinking too much!", "Halfway through the articles, I had a hard time believing that it is not written by human. I had read some articles generated by GPT-2, and it will go off-topic after a while, but this is not the case with GPT-3.", "What gives it away for me is these two paragraphs.", "For example, if you\u2019re writing a story about a character in a desert and you draw a picture of that character, your brain will make a connection and give you ideas on what to have that character do next in your story. Or if you\u2019re drawing a picture of a character from a story and you write a poem about their feelings, your brain will make a connection and give you ideas on how to draw that character better.", "For example, if you\u2019re writing a story about a character in a desert and you draw a picture of that character, you could write a poem about the feelings that the character has while they\u2019re in the desert.", "These paragraphs are very similar, and I thought there is no way a writer would blatantly repeats the same paragraph in one post.", "Then the realisation came to me. I already knew that the article is written by GPT-3.", "If I did not have that information when I read it the first time, I might have believed that it was really something written by a human writer. The repetition was there because the writer wanted to put in more words into the story. It makes sense, right?", "One particularly critical person commented in the Hacker News page that the article is likely written by GPT-3. However, he got downvoted because the comment insults the writer\u2019s ability.", "If you dive deeper and read the other articles, you would come across some interesting excerpts. Here\u2019s one from a post titled \u201cWhat I learned from trying to be too productive\u201d", "I want to live the simple life. Another bit of marketing caught my eye, this time it was a good copy instead of a bad one. What caught my attention is that I actually read it. What I got out of it is we can\u2019t take things too seriously. Our biggest headaches come from taking everything to heart. There was some advocacy about being free from popular culture, but I don\u2019t necessarily care for that message. I prefer to not take outsider criticism to heart. I want to soak in the music that I love in spite of what they\u2019re saying on MTV or to hell with whatever the paleo diet faddists are screaming about. I preferred to be in the season of my life where I could live the simple life.", "Under closer inspection, the sentences are not really coherent. They don\u2019t really makes much sense together. However, these articles written by GPT-3 managed to successfully evoke the same \u201cmotivated\u201d feeling you would get from reading an inspirational articles written by humans.", "Imagine if Liam did not confess to using GPT-3 to create these articles. I think it would take a while for the readers to catch on, if ever.", "This should be a concerning sign for bloggers, especially those who are exclusively writing inspirational, feel-good stories.", "When you write an article every day, some writers even publish 2 or more articles every day (!), you will run out of ideas sooner or later. A lot of writers out there have resorted to the self-help and productivity topic. Perhaps because it\u2019s the one that need the least effort? You don\u2019t need to do research or fact check for this kind of articles.", "We need to give credits to GPT-3 for its performance in imitating writers. It certainly could not completely replace human writers for now, but it may act as a tool to help writers write or overcome the writer\u2019s block.", "On the other hand, we also need to reevaluate the quality of articles we read and clap for. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s completely the writers fault for pumping out these vapid inspirational articles. What would you do if you wrote a piece on productivity with minimum effort and got the same recognition as something you spent one week on?", "Furthermore, a lot of these self-help and productivity articles felt like you have read it somewhere before. I\u2019m not sure if this is because most of them are recycled articles, or because reading them gave me the same, familiar emotions.", "The current feedback loop needs to stop and it could be fixed by rewarding more meaningful articles instead of a spin on old posts you have read three times over.", "Learning Machine is a series of stories about things happening in the world of Machine Learning that I found interesting enough to share.
