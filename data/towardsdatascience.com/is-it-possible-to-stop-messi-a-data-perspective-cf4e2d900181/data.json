For a football passionate data analyst/scientist, more and more datasets are getting freely accessible, driving opportunities for football data exploration. As a football fan, I was quite excited when Statsbomb released in 2019 the complete Messi Data Biography dataset. With the recent quarantine imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I had some free time that I have decided to put into good use. This is my story deep down the Messi rabbit hole.", "All the relevant code, interactive visualization, and more, is available on my github project.", "TL;DR: Messi is a genius, you can\u2019t stop him. Or can you?", "One may wonder why write yet another piece about Lionel Messi. Well, first because thanks to Statsbomb his entire La Liga career is freely available in one single dataset. To this day, it\u2019s the only complete dataset on a single player (considering players reaching the end of their careers).", "Second, because I\u2019m convinced we don\u2019t know everything about Messi. A lot has already been written about him: scoring skills, play-maker, extensive comparaison with C. Ronaldo, etc. Maybe you already read that Messi is impossible, or that he walks better than most players run.", "But to the best of my knowledge, the defensive side has not been extensively explored. And as I dived in the data biography, I started to wonder if it was possible to stop Messi? And if so, how to describe it with only data?", "As event data in football leans toward the attacking side of the game, because defense has a lot more \u2018off-ball\u2019 events, it\u2019s more difficult to analyze. It\u2019s much more easy with tracking data (assuming the data is accurate enough) as we know the players position at all time, but it does not mean nothing can be found with event data. Defensive actions, pressure events, together with advanced metrics such as Expected goals, PPDA, or VAEP are enough material to get its hands dirty on the \u201cStopping Messi\u201d quest.", "The million dollar question that made every coach facing him tear their hair out. He\u2019s (one of) the greatest player of all time, tearing defense apart with FC Barcelona since 2004.", "Just look at his Win/draw/loss distribution:", "And if we consider only open play goals:", "Just for fun, here is his (open play) goal with the smallest xG value (of the all dataset): 0.024. Weirdly enough, it does not look like the hardest goal Messi scored but he shot from quite far and there is a lot of opponents in front of him.", "These stats alone show how great Messi is as a goal scorer, and it\u2019s only a small part of what he can do. If you want even more (advanced) stats about Messi, especially his dribbling skills, you can look at Statsbomb articles:", "You can also find my own data crunching inside this notebook (see also the associated figures folder).", "So, to sum-up, and stating the obvious: it is HARD to defend against a player like Messi.", "No matter how great Messi is, sometimes he can have a bad game. For example, from 2004 to 2019 he had some games without goals or assists. Which does not mean it was a bad game, but at least Messi was not directly decisive.", "To illustrate this, we can look at the percentage of games where Messi did not scored or assisted.", "As you can see, it\u2019s not that often that Messi does not increase his stats line. It\u2019s not always bad, but it has an effect on Messi\u2019s results:", "It\u2019s true that it\u2019s not all about Messi, and this graph lacks some context (strength of opponents, quality of teammates that day, game\u2019s stake, etc.), but it is still a huge drop in winning percentage.", "If we consider xG, there is of course a big difference too, as you can see in the next graph. Games without goals or assists are showing a much slower xG output with an average of 0.33 compared to 0.89 when he scored or assisted. Which means that he had fewer scoring opportunities, but mainly he was (on average) in worse positions to score. And well, sometimes he was just unlucky, like that game were he outputted 1.35xG without scoring.", "This shows that it is possible, sometimes, to reduce Messi\u2019s influence.", "In order to analyze how to defend against Messi, I choose to focus on one game: it\u2019s much easier to visualize and it gives some ideas for future analysis in a larger scale.", "How did I choose such a game? I decided to focus on the 2009/10 season:", "Starting from this, I choose the match with the smallest Messi xG output throughout the entire season. Enter:", "It was also a duel between Guardiola and Pochettino, which makes things even more interesting.", "Before going into how Messi was stopped in this game, a bit of context. The game was a derby, hence not at all a friendly game. It ended up (Spoiler Alert!) in a tie: 0 - 0.", "But it was not a boring game, even though:", "I did not see this game at the time (and I still haven\u2019t), but I\u2019m sure Mauricio Pochettino had a plan. The following data analysis will try to uncover his plan.", "The first thing we can ask about this game is: Was there an anti-Messi plan?", "If we look at Messi\u2019s heatmap and Espanyol\u2019s defensive map\u00b9, we can see that Espanyol did defend more in their left flank (and especially they pressed more there), where Messi likes to be, but also where Daniel Alves spends most of his time.", "It looks like Messi was purposely targeted.", "Second, was Messi able to do what he usually does ? And by that, I mean insane dribbles, out of the world shots, and impossible passes. Well, looking at his passmap, we can see that it was not business as usual:", "As we can see in the above figure:", "The Barcelona passmap (before Dani Alves\u2019s red card) corroborates this. We can see how little the front three (Messi, Pedro, and Maxwell (?)) was involved.", "By constrast, Espanyol pass network shows that they try to attack from both flanks, avoiding the Busquets/Yaya Tour\u00e9/Xavi triangle, and that there were some passing options to Verdu.", "To go further, some advance metric is needed. I choose to turn to Valuing Actions by Estimating Probabilities (VAEP). I will not detailed what VAEP is as it\u2019s out of the scope of this article, but you can find the original paper here.", "In a nutshell, it\u2019s a way of assigning a probability value to each action in football, not just shots and goals\u00b3. For example, a successful clearance can have a VAEP value of +0.3, while a failed pass can have a VAEP value of -0.19.", "VAEP is a great tool (among others, see the American soccer analysis article for a comparison of such tools) to analyze players\u2019contribution in games as it takes all actions into account, even defensive ones. The KU Leuven team even released an alternative version of their Soccer Player Action Description Language (SPADL) called atomic SPADL. This alternative has two main advantages:", "Last but not least, this entire project is openly accessible on github. The Socceraction package has a master branch with SPADL alongside with an atomic branch for atomic-SPADL.", "After fitting a model with atomic SPADL, we can explore the Messi dataset through the lens of VAEP. For example, here is the average VAEP (per 90) of Messi season by season.", "If we look specifically at the 2009/10 season, we can see the distribution of Messi\u2019s VAEP values and where the derby is situated. Which confirm it was not \u201cone of those nights\u201d for La Pulga.", "VAEP is not just for Messi. Here is the list of all derby players, ranked by VAEP values (per 90):", "Considering the highest VAEP value is from Victor Vald\u00e9s, we can safely say that not only Espanyol did a great defensive job, they also had some good attacking phases.", "From this analysis, we have some key ingredients of Espanyol successfully stopping Messi:", "This Messi analysis is a first step towards better understanding of the defensive side of football with respect to event data.", "It shows that it is possible to derive defensive insights, with \u2018basic\u2019 stats as well as more advanced tools (VAEP). A lot can be done from here:", "And even if it was just for fun, this kind of analysis can be useful in a real life context.", "1- The defensive map shows how much more in this game a team had defensive actions, compared to the average of the season 2009/10 for all team facing FC Barcelona.", "3- To explore VAEP, you can try the authors\u2019interactive tool.", "Your home for data science.
