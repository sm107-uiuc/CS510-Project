By the end of this post you\u2019ll have an good understanding about the intuition of SVMs, what is happening under the hood of linear SVMs, and how to implement one in Python.", "To see the full Algorithms from Scratch Series click on the link below.", "In classification problems the objective of the SVM is to fit the largest possible margin between the 2 classes. On the contrary, regression task flips the objective of classification task and attempts to fit as many instances as possible within the margin \u2014 We will first focus on classification.", "If we focus solely on the extremes of the data (the observations that are on the edges of the cluster) and we define a threshold to be the mid-point between the two extremes, we are left with a margin that we use to sepereate the two classes \u2014 this is often referred to as a hyperplane. When we apply a threshold that gives us the largest margin (meaning that we are strict to ensure that no instances land within the margin) to make classifications this is called Hard Margin Classification (some text refer to this as Maximal Margin Classification).", "When detailing hard margin classification it always helps to see what is happening visually, hence Figure 2 is an example of a hard margin classification. To do this we will use the iris dataset from scikit-learn and utility function plot_svm() which you can find when you access the full code on github \u2014 link below.", "Note: This story was written straight from jupyter notebooks using python package jupyter_to_medium \u2014 for more information on this package click here \u2014 and the committed version on github is a first draft hence you may notice some alterations to this post.", "Figure 2 displays how the Linear SVM uses hard margin classification to ensure that no instances falls within the margin. Although this looks good for our current scenario, we must be careful to take into account the pitfalls that come with performing hard margin classification:", "A more flexible alternative to hard margin classification is soft margin classification which is a good solution to overcome the pitfalls listed above when doing hard margin classification \u2014 mainly with solving the issue of sensitivity to outliers. When we allow for there to be some misclassifications (meaning that some negative observations may be classified as positive and vice versa), the distance from the threshold to the observations is called soft margin. In soft margin classification we aim to achieve a good balance between maximizing the size of the margin and limiting the amount of violations in the margin (the number of observations that land in the margin).", "Yes, Linear SVM classifiers (hard-margin and soft-margin) are quite efficient and work really well in many cases, but when the dataset is not linearly separable, as if often the case with many datasets, a better solution is to make use of the SVMs kernel trick (once you understand the kernel trick you may notice that it is not exclusive to SVMs). The kernel trick maps non-linearly separable data into a higher dimension then uses a hyperplane to separate the classes. What makes this trick so exciting is that the mapping of the data into higher dimensions does not actually add the new features, but we still get the same results as if we did. Since we do not have to add the new features to our data, our model is much more computationally effieicent and works ust as good.", "You\u2019ll see an example of this phenomena below.", "Note: We applied a polynomial kernel to this dataset, however RBF is also a very popular kernel that is applied in many Machine Learning problems and is often used as a default when data is not linearly separable.", "Now that we have built up our conceptual understanding of what SVM is doing, lets understand what is happening under the hood of the model. The linear SVM classifier computes the decision function w.T * x + b and predicts the positive class for results that are positive or else it is the negative class. Training a Linear SVM classifier means finding the values w and b that make the margin as wide as possible whilst avoiding margin violations (hard margin classification) or limiting them (soft margin classification)", "The slope of the decision function is equal to the norm of the weight vector hence for us to achieve the largest possible margin we want to minimize the norm of the weight vector. However, there are ways to go about this for us to achieve hard margin classification and soft margin classification.", "The hard margin optimization problem is as follows:", "Note: For this Implementation I will be doing hard margin classification, however further work will consist of Python implementations of soft-margin and the kernel trick performed to different datasets including regression based task \u2014 to be notified of these post you can follow me on Github.", "The SVM is quite a tricky algorithm to code and is a good reminder as to why we should be grateful for Machine Learning libraries that allow us to implement them with few lines of code. In this post I did not go into the full detail of SVMs and there are still quite a few gaps that you may want to read up on such as computing the support vector machine and empirical risk minimization.", "Additionally, it may be worth watch Andrew Ng\u2019s lectures on SVMs \u2014 Click Here", "Thank you for taking the time to read through this story (as it\u2019s called on Medium).
