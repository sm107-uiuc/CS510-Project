Code examples will be shown to demonstrate certain techniques.", "Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that is used to find underlying patterns in data and is often used in exploratory data analysis. Unsupervised learning does not use labeled data like supervised learning, but instead focuses on the data\u2019s features. Labeled training data has a corresponding output for each input. When using unsupervised learning, we are not concerned with the targeted outputs because the goal of the algorithm is to find relationships within the data and group data points based on the input data alone. Supervised learning is concerned with labeled data in order to make predictions, but unsupervised learning is not.", "The goal of unsupervised learning algorithms is to analyze data and find important features. Unsupervised learning will often find subgroups or hidden patterns within the dataset that a human observer may not pick up on. This is shown in the figure above. With the given image, you can probably pick out the subgroups, but with a more complex dataset, these subgroups may not be so easy to find. This is where unsupervised learning can help us.", "Clustering is the simplest and among the most common applications of unsupervised learning. Clustering aims to discover \u201cclusters\u201d, or subgroups within unlabeled data. Clusters will contain data points that are as similar as possible to each other, and as dissimilar as possible to data points in other clusters. Clustering helps find underlying patterns within the data that may not be noticeable to a human observer.", "The two basic types of clustering that will be covered are partitional clustering and hierarchical clustering.", "Partitional clustering refers to a set of clustering algorithms where each data point in a dataset can only belong to one cluster. An example of this would be the k-means algorithm.", "In k-means clustering, the goal is to partition, or divide, the data into a predetermined value for K, the number of clusters. Each data point will fall into only one cluster of the K clusters, and therefore the clusters will not overlap like they would in hierarchical clustering.", "Hierarchical clustering finds clusters by a system of hierarchies (clusters within clusters).", "Every data points can belong to multiple clusters, some clusters will contain smaller clusters within it. This hierarchy system can be organized as a tree diagram.", "Hierarchical clustering can be done in two ways: top-down (whole cluster to single points), or bottom-up (single points to big clusters).", "Unlike k-means clustering, with hierarchical clustering, the number of clusters in unknown beforehand.", "Below is an example of k-means clustering using scikit-learn, a high level machine learning library for Python.", "First, we must import the necessary imports. Using scikit-learn allows us to import .make_blobs() to create multiple data points to use for our clustering algorithm. Scikit-learn also allows us to simply import the k-means algorithm.", "Using sklearn.datasets.make_blobs(), we can create example data points. The number of points will be set to 1,000. Our data points will be equally divided and centered around 3 areas, this means we should find three main clusters when we apply the k-means algorithm. The cluster_std = 1.2 parameter will set the standard deviation of the clusters. The random_state parameter will make the data points consistent every time we run that line of code. This is useful when playing with parameters and comparing the end results.", "We can then use Matplotlib, a Python plotting library, to plot the data points that we generated. We can set the edge colors and widths to make each point more visible.", "The plot shows three very distinct groups of data that we will want the algorithm to find.", "We can now create the k-means algorithm and set the desired number of clusters to three, then we can train the algorithm on the data points we generated earlier. After training, we can call the .predict() function to solidify the algorithms decisions. Finally, we can plot the clusters just like we did before, but we can add a color sequence that will represent the clusters that were found.", "It looks like the k-means clustering algorithm did pretty well! Unsupervised learning is a very interesting field of study and can get pretty complicated, but have proven to be extremely useful. Unsupervised learning techniques such as principal component analysis and t-SNE are used for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. PCA, for example, can be used to reduce the dimensions of the data to help with further analysis of the data. Therefore, unsupervised learning can be very beneficial for making other machine learning techniques more efficient.", "Try finding some classification problems on Kaggle and try it out yourself!", "MIT 9.54 Class 13, Unsupervised Learning: Clustering", "David Arthur and Sergei Vassilvitskii: Clustering: Partitional Clustering", "Your home for data science.
