It can either be used for data exploration or communicate the result of the analysis. During data exploration, visualization can reveal hidden information in your data. Presenting your project result with a chart is an excellent way to communicate your findings.", "There are many data visualization libraries in Python you can choose from. One such library that is plotly express.", "Plotly Express is the easy-to-use, high-level interface to Plotly, which operates on \u201ctidy\u201d data and produces easy-to-style figures \u2014 Plotly", "In this article, we will explore and visualize Spotify Top Song dataset from Kaggle using plotly express library.", "First, we need to install plotly into our environment using pip or conda. You can check the complete documentation to install this library on the plotly site. The Plotly Express library comes together with the plotly library.", "Once the library installed, we can import the library into our notebook.", "In this article, we use Top Spotify Music Dataset from Kaggle. To get this dataset, we can download the dataset here. This data set consists of the most popular Spotify songs in the world and an additional 13 variables from 2010 to 2019. However, we will only use the subset from this data that started in 2015.", "Let\u2019s create a basic visualization with plotly express. First, we will see the top 5 genres that appear more frequently in the billboard with a bar chart.", "Dance-pop was the genre that showed up more often in the Spotify billboard from 2015 to 2019.", "Second, let say we want to know how was the average popularity of these genres each year. We can create a line chart to see that trend.", "By looking at the chart, even if the dance-pop genre song showed up most frequently in the billboard, it\u2019s average popularity was still below the other top 5 genres. However, it always increases consistently year by year.", "Next, let see who was the most famous artist during this period. We will use the column chart to answer this.", "These five artists contribute the most top song in Spotify compared to others.", "To see the distribution of the popularity of each song they sing, we can use the box plot.", "Among the other songs, Memories from Maroon 5 have the highest popularity. However, in average median song\u2019s popularity across these five artists quite similar between 70 to 80.", "Each of these songs has a parameter like beats per minute, energy, danceability, loudness, loveness, length, etc. We can check the correlation between one variable with the other by making a scatter plot for popularity vs. beats per minute.", "We also can make a scatter matrix to see a correlation for all variables we want in the form of a scatter plot.", "By doing data exploration, we know dance-pop was the genre that showed up the most in billboard. Even if this genre did not show the highest popularity score, there was a constant increase in the popularity of this genre from 2015 to 2019. On the other hand, the most known artist was Justin Bieber. He showed up on the billboard for 12 times. Then the song with the highest popularity score was memories from Maroon 5.", "Visualizing with plotly express is pretty straightforward, especially when we are working with the panda data frame. We only need to call which chart we want, select the data frame, and choose the columns, then config the customizable items or let it use default values.
