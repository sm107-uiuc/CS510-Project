This time to the paper written about AI Safety published on the OpenAI page on June 2016 called Concrete Problems in AI Safety. It is now July the 26th at the time of writing. However I have great doubts as to whether I understand any more now than this collection of thinkers did then. Yet I will try my best to examine this paper.", "\u201cRapid progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) has brought increasing attention to the potential impacts of AI technologies on society. In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems.\u201d", "With this they list five practical problems related to AI risk categorised by", "I will look briefly at the two outlined in bold.", "They review previous work in these areas and suggest research directions with relevance to \u2018cutting-edge\u2019 AI systems. They do however make these into specific case examples such as robot arms knocking down a vase; a mischievous cleaning robot; evaluation during training; wet mop in electrical outlet; different environments. As we go along I will reflect freely, apologies if it is unclear what the article proposes and my own thoughts in this regard.", "At the time of writing they point to three trends which makes AI Safety important in this [shortened somewhat] they claim:", "They talk of \u201cnegative side effects\u201d. In the article they question what they call \u2018formal objective function\u2019 and whether it is possible that the wrong one has been chosen. The objective function is in linear programming the function that it is desired to maximize or minimize. In plain English, perhaps too simplified, we may ask: did we do the right thing? If we maximised value of mineral resource extraction yet forgot possible environmental externalities (read: damage) this could be an example. In this they define an accident as:", "\u201cVery broadly, an accident can be described as a situation where a human designer had in mind a certain (perhaps informally specified) objective or task, but the system that was designed and deployed for that task produced harmful and unexpected results.\u201d", "If potentially very large environment issues are ignored there is an issue with the safety. Even in the limit of \u2018perfect learning and infinite data\u2019 an objective function can lead to harmful results. These thoughts have been carried forward, but can be said not to be particularly unique to the field of AI. Still, the fact that it is considered is important, what seems obvious is not always the most apparent course of action.", "I recently summarised a paper by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) called Data quality and artificial intelligence \u2014 mitigating bias and error to protect fundamental rights. In this paper I saw an interesting statement that I again would like to emphasise. Is the data \u201cfit for purpose\u201d, this in relation to data quality, but apparently in AI Safety it could relate equally to the question of the formal objective function:", "\u201cConsequently, the quality of data depends strongly on the purpose of their use.\u201d", "Going back to the paper from OpenAI. Further they describe that the: \u201cIn \u201creward hacking\u201d, the objective function that the designer writes down admits of some clever \u2018easy\u2019 solution that formally maximizes it but perverts the spirit of the designer\u2019s intent (i.e. the objective function can be \u201cgamed\u201d), a generalization of the wireheading problem.\u201d [bold added] So what is the wireheading problem?", "\u201cWireheading is the artificial stimulation of the brain to experience pleasure, usually through the direct stimulation of an individual\u2019s brain\u2019s reward or pleasure center with electrical current. It can also be used in a more expanded sense, to refer to any kind of method that produces a form of counterfeit utility by directly maximizing a good feeling, but that fails to realize what we value.\u201d-LessWrongWiki", "How do they propose to solve this negative side effects?", "They have additionally suggested a few pointers to avoid reward hacking:", "As per usual there is of course far more to be said and I have only taken a short excerpt from the larger text of which these thoughts are embedded.", "I do however hope this was helpful and sparked your interest.", "I have been writing one article for every day for 50 days. These articles have been general in their approach exploring the intersection of social science and computer science in the field of artificial intelligence.
