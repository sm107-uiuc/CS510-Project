I, therefore, became very interested in how we can improve this collaboration and started documenting myself on other processes that can improve the teamwork. Consequently, this article presents multiple organizations between the Data Engineer and the Data Scientist, each with its benefits and its downfalls.", "When the Data Scientists and the Data Engineer are not using the same coding language and the Data Engineer is the one responsible for production code, everything has to be re-coded.", "Of course, after re-coding the data science project, the Data Engineer would have some additionals tasks like scheduling, building the deployment part and assuring himself that the monitoring features are created.", "When there is a common coding language used by Data Engineers and Data Scientists, the former can be spared of re-coding everything. The re-coding part will be replaced by optional optimizations.", "Of course, to limit the number of technologies that the Data Scientist needs to learn, the Data Engineer can create a Data Science framework that will hide/abstract the architecture complexity and the deployment complexity.", "However, creating this framework doesn\u2019t mean that the Data Scientists will do every project on their own, there are still tasks like monitoring features, optimizations and building the needed APIs that should be done by the Data Engineer.", "Nevertheless, this kind of organization is giving more autonomy to the data scientist since there are changes that will not require the data engineer.", "This kind of organization is used at Dailymotion, for more details I suggest this article wrote by Germain Tanguy.", "When there is no common coding language used by Data Engineers and Data Scientists you can try to use Data & SQL as a common language for peer programming as suggested by Chris Liu, a Coursera Data Engineer.", "If there are some Data Science parts where SQL can\u2019t be used as a common language, then you can use packages for communicating between the different Data Science phases and the Data Engineer.", "This Xebia book describes the fact that we could create three packages:", "The packages can take different kinds of forms depending on your architecture: docker images, messages in a Kafka Queue, etc.", "In this collaboration process, the Data Engineer will be mostly responsible for deploying the model, monitoring features and help in tests and optimizations during the peer programming part.", "A friend of mine told me that he considers himself a \u201cData Guy\u201d. In fact, from a certain point, we are all learning different skills, therefore you can find persons who have both Data Engineering and Data Scientists skils.", "There is no perfect collaboration process, there are some drawbacks and some benefits in each cooperation schema; it is up to you and your team to choose the best organization for your company depending on your context and of course on the competences that your Data Engineers and Data Scientists have or want to develop!", "Your home for data science.
