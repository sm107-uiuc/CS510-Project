The task was to predict the financial product the customer is complaining about only using the text narratives. It\u2019s a fairly straightforward supervised problem since the training data had labels, and a simple logistic regression classifier could give an accuracy of 0.80. While I was browsing through the incorrectly classified complaints, I was struck by how lengthy they were. Here is the start of a complaint about a mortgage product:", "The whole complaint is about 2000 words long, contains quotes from the US Treasury, federal and state government policies, intermingled with the actions of the company and specific persons involved. Having seen this, I gained a real appreciation of the machine learning algorithm that will classify this complaint without human effort. For this task, the frequent appearance of the word \u2018mortgage\u2019 would suggest to a human that we are dealing with a mortgage product. But if we want to go down to the issues level and understand what the complaint is about, then we\u2019d need to read this essay \u2014 not a task most people would relish.", "Fortunately, we can use machine learning to reduce the effort of understanding text, through automatic text summarisation.", "A good definition of automatic text summarisation is \u201cthe task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information content and overall meaning\u201d. There are two different approaches, extractive summarisation and abstractive summarisation.", "We are going to concern ourselves with only extractive summarisation algorithms here. The one we\u2019ll look at is known as TextRank.", "The TextRank algorithm is an extractive unsupervised text summarisation algorithm. It is a fairly old method, being first proposed in 2004. As its name suggests, it bears similarity to the famous PageRank algorithm used to rank websites in order of importance.", "First, the text is split into sentences. We compute the similarity between each pair of sentences. This builds up a complete weighted graph, i.e. each vertex (sentence) is connected to all other vertices, and each edge is the similarity score between two vertices it connects. The value of the edges basically like \u2018casting a vote\u2019 for the other vertex \u2014 higher votes results in higher importance for the vertex (sentence). However, just as in PageRank, who voted also matters: important sentences have a higher contribution when voting. In the old days they calculated similarity between sentences using overlaps, but now we can just use sentence embedding and compute the cosine similarity.", "Below is an example paragraph divided into sentences and the similarity matrix between the sentence embeddings.", "We run the PageRank algorithm using this matrix (PageRank is available as a method in networkx) and take the top five sentences as the text summary.", "In the corpus used to carry out the experiment, the median number of words is 51, with a maximum of 2643 words. After summarisation, the median number of words dropped slightly to 40, but we have essentially eliminated the long tail, with the maximum number of words in a complaint now standing at 482.", "You can go to my Github repo to see some examples of summarised pieces of text, but here\u2019s a quick example here. This is a complaint filed under \u2018Debt collection\u2019 and the specific issue is \u2018written notification about debt\u2019.", "The summary seem to make sense, but it\u2019s not perfect since the sentences come from the original text and no attempts have been made to ensure coherence or grammar.", "Having removed so many words from the complaints, I wanted to check how the classification task would now perform. Using the same methods as with the full text \u2014 tokenization, tf-idf vectorization then applying a linear SVC classifier, we get an accuracy of 0.80, which is the same as what I got with the full text! The recall matrix as below:", "While building a product classifier for consumer complaints I noticed that long complaints make human validation of results a particularly arduous task and researched into ways to summarise the text without losing critical information. We used an unsupervised method called TextRank, which can be run quickly. It produces reasonable summaries and when using the summarised text as the input for classification instead of the original full text, we find that the algorithm has suffered no loss in performance. The method, of course, suffers from the shortcoming that all the text in the summary come from the original text.", "Your home for data science.
