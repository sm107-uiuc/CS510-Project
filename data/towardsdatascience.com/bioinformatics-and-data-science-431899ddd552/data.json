The researchers from these fields are generating massive amounts of data and naturally, as any field that has access to large data sets, people are interested in what \u201cdata science\u201d can offer. The hope is that data scientists will process and filter these large data sets and produce meaningful biological/medical insights by application of statistics and machine-learning models. When I hear such things, I say \u201cWait!! Isn\u2019t this what we have been doing in bioinformatics all these years ?\u201d. The short answer is \u201cpartially\u201d. In medical science as a whole, researchers have much more diverse data sets (imaging, patient records, etc.) than the ones we deal with on a daily basis but the core of the data analysis methods, the scale of the data and the approach are similar no matter the data set. In this respect, I have always seen \u201cdata science\u201d as a generalized version of what I call \u201cbioinformatics\u201d. If that\u2019s true, can bioinformaticians easily switch to data science roles? What kind of challenges should they expect? And most importantly, is their skill set adequate for data science roles? To answer these questions, I talked to data scientists in addition to extensive google-fu and personal experience.", "I should first clarify what I mean by bioinformatics. For me, the following terms describe very similar if not identical fields: \u201cBioinformatics\u201d, \u201ccomputational genomics\u201d and \u201cgenomic data science\u201d. Although there will be attempts to differentiate these terms, they represent similar things for me. The fields require you to process and analyze large-scale genomics datasets and come up with biological insights. In order to perform in these fields, you need to be able process large-scale raw data ( usually sequencing or some form of omics data), quality check and transform the processed data. Then, you will need to apply machine-learning or statistical models depending on your problem. You will mostly likely do some dimension reduction and clustering followed by visualization. You may need to repeat all these steps or take different approaches depending on the initial outcome of your analysis. You will write reports and do presentations in order to transmit your data-driven story. On top of these, they need to adapt to ever changing data generation technologies, file formats and new statistical and machine-learning approaches. A similar point of view on the definition of bioinformatics is taken by the instructors of \u201cGenomic Data Science\u201d course on Coursera.", "Now, let me describe the skill set for bioinformatics. These skill set expectations apply to our lab. The tasks and requirements for bioinformaticians may vary across the board. Apart from the technical skills, people need to have the scientific curiosity, mindset and drive to work on problems relating to biology and medicine. But these are more of traits rather than skills. That\u2019s why they are not in the list. In my opinion, bioinformaticians need to have the following knowledge and skills, or at least they acquire these by the time they finish. They do not need to be experts in everything but should at least have some practical experience.", "According to udacity the essential skills of a data scientist are :", "Other lists you might see online could list big data processing tech stack (Hadoop, spark, etc.) or in depth understanding of linear algebra and calculus. But those skills, especially the tech stack, are most likely organization specific. \u201cData intuition\u201d is probably something you develop over the years working on data analysis problems. Since the definition is vague, I\u2019m making an assumption here. We can also look at the data scientist job ads and derive a similar list of skills required.", "I realize that to be experts in all these areas are quite difficult and it is clear companies have different roles that are lumped under \u201cdata science\u201d and they are not always looking to hire jack-of-all-trades, but they would expect certain degree of proficiency in each area mentioned above.", "If you remove the domain specific requirements from bioinformatics skill set, you are left with most of the data science skill set and some more. People who make the switch from bioinformatics to data science will most likely need to adapt to the data organization and distribution environment of their employer. The problems will be from a different domain, so they would need to adapt to that as well. But the same would be true, at least to some degree, for the data scientists switching jobs between different employers.", "In my opinion, a bioinformatician who has regularly done end-to-end data analysis from raw data to insight will have no trouble performing in a \u201cdata science\u201d position, I should emphasize that I\u2019m not saying any bioinformatician can perform in data science roles. They may have to learn new domain specific knowledge or tech stack (hadoop, spark, etc.) relevant to the data organization of the company, but learning new approaches and implementing them is what they routinely do during their PhD training and postdoctoral work. I think if you have the core skills mentioned above with willingness to adapt and learn you can perform in any data analysis related domain.", "There are a dozen people in my network who has made the switch from bioinformatics to data science. I asked some of them about their experiences. One contact says people who are switching to data science should be aware of that the priorities and the culture are different from academia in industry. In industry, there is more of a customer and product oriented thinking. The fail-safety, scalability and robustness of your method might be equally or more important than coming up with the coolest method. He also adds there is a lot more teamwork, and inter-team and client interaction. Communication and establishing protocols of interaction is very important. So, the switch also requires adjustment of the mindset.", "Another contact, Markus Sch\u00fcler, current data science lead and former bioinformatician, agrees that mindset in industry is different. He also acknowledges the need for product oriented thinking. The models will need to be robust and maintained. It is not that you make one model and you let it be. In addition, he shares the idea that you don\u2019t always go for the coolest and the best models, other factors like running time, implementation requirements, scalability and architecture fit and also interpretability of the model itself will be as important in product oriented thinking. But in terms of skills, he adds that bioinformatics and data science is very similar if not identical. Although in industry, the larger the data sets get the more specialized and faster tools are needed for data processing such as Spark.", "If the argument of core skill similarity holds true people from data science should be able to perform in bioinformatics positions after acquiring some domain specific skills and knowledge. And that I have first account knowledge. A former data scientist and a current bioinformatics PhD student, Jonathan Ronen, in our lab is doing very well in this new domain, applying his skills to problems on single-cell genomics and cancer genomics.", "All in all, the skills required by these two fields are similar, and bioinformaticians with the skill set I described above can perform in data science roles in industry, provided that they can adjust their mindsets to industry.", "Your home for data science.
