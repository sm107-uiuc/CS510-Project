This story is an extension of this article.", "The expectation is a value from the random variables whose chance of occurrence is high when we conduct a certain experiment.", "Anything can be an experiment or a random process: from reading a book to writing a blog, from having breakfast to working out, and from movement of clouds to shedding of leaves, anything can be considered as our subject and carefully monitor the outcomes of every action.", "For simplicity let us keep tossing of coins or rolling of dice as our subject for statistical experiment. Here what could be the possible outcomes if we toss a coin and roll a die? The outcome is either Head or Tail for the coin, and either 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 for the die.", "In simple terms, quantifying a random process is defined as Random Variable. A random variable can be counting (quantifying) how many footsteps (random process ) we walked in a single day for the whole month, or how many times we saw our beautiful and magnificent face on the mirror every day for the whole month, etc.", "Often random variables are denoted as X. For simplicity, let us keep the outcomes (quantified values) of tossing a coin and rolling a die (random process) as our random variables.", "This is simply known as Probability. Some real-life examples can be, the chance of honey-bee visiting the Lily flower or the Jasmine flower or both, the chance of Leafcutter ant colony winning the war against Yellow Crazy ant colony or vice-versa.", "Let us imagine there are sparrows in our home. The sparrow couple happily builds the nest and lays an egg. Now, what is the probability of that egg to become a baby sparrow? Well, there are two possibilities or outcomes for this problem, either the egg might hatch and become baby sparrow (happy outcome) or the egg would fall down, break and lose the essence of life (this really happened several times in my home and is the tragic outcome).", "We all need a happy outcome. Here, in this case, the sparrows need their egg to evolve as a baby sparrow but not break down and lose life mysteriously in the above tragic outcome.", "But how do we precisely quantify this? Our brains understand numbers. To fill this gap, mathematicians came up with an idea called Probability.", "Probability refers to the chance of happening or not happening of an event. Here chance represents the presence of uncertainty (meaning it might occur or not occur) of any event in the observable Universe. So, probability gives a numerical measure of the element of uncertainty.", "The value of probability ranges between 0 and 1. If we know for sure that a particular event is certain then the probability of that event is 1, for example, the Sun rises every day, no matter what the season is. Similarly, if we are not sure that an event is certain then the probability of that event is not 1.", "In the above observation, the probability of an egg to become a baby sparrow is 1/2 and the probability of an egg to face a tragic end is also 1/2. And the sum of the probabilities of certain and uncertain outcomes is P + Q = 1.", "Let us connect the dots, this time with a flow diagram.", "So, we have a Random Process, from it, we extract a Random Variable X and with that, we construct a Probability Distribution Table and we take the total sum of XP(X) and finally, we calculate the Expectation i.e., E(X).", "The plot clearly shows the expectation E(X)is 4. There is a high probability for 4 to occur. What did we do in the code? Well, randomly we got 8 coins and if we toss these 8 coins at the same time, the outcomes would be as,", "and this forms our sample space. Once we have the sample space, we now count for each H or T, this selection would be random (defined in Line 34 of the code). Here, the count is basically our Random Variable. Finally, we calculate the probability of the count. As per our results, we have 4, as most probable occurrence and even probability bar graph clearly depicts 4 which has greater height.", "The plot clearly shows the expectation E(X)is 21. There is a high probability for 21 to occur. Let\u2019s understand the code, we have got 6 dice randomly and they are being rolled out all at a time. So we have total outcomes like this,", "The L.H.S of the above result is our Random Variables that is, we are quantifying the dice outcomes with sum (defined in Line 40 of the code). Finally, we calculate the probability of the sum. As per our results, we have 21, as most probable occurrence and even probability bar graph clearly depicts 21 which has greater height.", "One thing we all need to notice, from the above graphs (for both coins and dice) that we observed, 4 and 21 have greater heights. This also means 4 and 21 are the most expected outcomes from the experiment that we conducted. And the exciting thing is 4 and 21are in the center of the graphs. What does this imply? It implies that the Expectation of any random variable is a central measure of that distribution. Thus, the expectation is one of the measures of central tendencies.", "Let us focus on coins for a moment. Below are the outcomes of 8 coins tossed at the same time.", "For now, let us assume we are interested in H. So, this gives us a simple understanding, Count(H) is a quantifying criterion for tossing 8 coins (random process). Hence, we can now say, Count(H) = X. The below table has the X which is represented in four different columns (this is done for readability of the table).", "We got our random variable X and now we can calculate probabilities individually. According to the definition above, we get the probabilities below.", "Wonder why 256 as the denominator? 256 is the total number of outcomes produced by 8 coins when tossed at the same time.", "The magic happens when we calculate X P(X). Let\u2019s quickly calculate that.", "We shall now take a crude look at the total outcomes without probability.", "We shall now make a frequency of these above numbers.", "If we observe, the frequency above is matching the numerator of P(X) Table of P(X) column. If we calculate the mean of the outcomes it will be 4, the one which has a high frequency.", "It is clear now that the expectation is simply the Mean of the total outcomes. Hence, by looking at the probability distribution plot, one can find out what the expectation of that distribution is.", "Whenever we conduct an experiment, in the long run, most of the outcomes will be centered and hence they are highly expected.", "Your home for data science.
