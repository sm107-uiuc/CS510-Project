On the one hand, you are releasing a new version that is geared towards yielding better results and making a greater impact; on the other, this is a rather scary and tense time. Your new shiny version may contain flaws that you will only be able to detect after they have had a negative impact.", "ML is as complex as orchestrating different instruments", "Replacing or publishing a new version to production touches upon the core decision making logic of your business process. With AI adoption rising, the necessity to automatically publish and update models is becoming a common and frequent task, which makes it a top concern for data science teams.", "In this article, I will review what makes the rollout of a new version so sensitive, what precautions are required, and how to leverage monitoring to optimize your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, as well as your Continuous Deployment (CD) one to safely achieve your goals.", "ML systems are composed of multiple moving and independent parts of software that need to work in tune with each other:", "Training pipeline: Includes all processing steps that leverage your historical dataset to produce a working model: data pre-processing, such as embeddings, scaling, feature engineering, feature selection or dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using cross-validation or hold out sets.", "Given this relatively high-level and complex orchestration, many things can get out of sync and lead us to deploy an underperforming model. Some of the most common culprits are:", "Most organizations are still manually updating their models. Whether it is the training pipeline or parts of it, such as features selection, or the delivery and promotion of the newly created model by the serving layer; doing so manually can lead to errors and unnecessary overheads.", "As a plurality of stakeholders and experts are involved, there are more handovers and thus more room for misunderstandings and integration issues. While the data scientists design the flows, the ML Engineers are usually doing the coding \u2014 and without being fully aligned (e.g. using different scaling methods), this may result in having unintentional behaviors.", "The empirical research is done in an offline lab environment, with historical datasets, and by simulating hold out testings. Needless to say, these environments are very different from the production one, for which only parts of the data are actually available. This might lead to data leakages or wrong assumptions that lead to bad performance, bias, or problematic code behavior once the model is in production and needs to serve live data streams. For instance, the newly deployed version\u2019s inability to handle new values in a categorical feature while pre-processing it into an embedded vector during the inference phase.", "Monitoring ML is more complex than monitoring traditional software \u2014 the fact that the entire system is working doesn\u2019t mean it actually does what it should do. Without proper dedicated ml monitoring service in place, such failures can go \u201csilently\u201d and \u201cunder the radar\u201d until the business damage was already done. You can read more on what does it take to monitor ml models and whether you should build it yourself.", "CI practices are about frequently testing the code bases of each of the software units, and the integrity of the different software artifacts working together by using unit/integration/system tests.", "A new model version should be considered and treated as a software artifact", "The creation of a new model requires a set of unit and integration tests to ensure that the new \u201ccandidate\u201d model is valid before it is committed into the model registry. But in the ML realms, CI is not only about testing and validating code and components, but also testing and validating data, data schemas, and model quality. While the focus of CI is to maintain valid code bases and modules\u2019 artifacts, before building new artifacts for each module, the CD process handles the phase of actually deploying the artifacts (in our case, the new model version) into production.", "Here are some of the main best practices for the CI phase that impact the safe rollout of model/new version implementations:", "Models are retrained/produced using historical data. For the model to be relevant in production, the training data set should adequately represent the data distribution that currently appears in production. This will avoid selection bias or simply irrelevance. To do so, before even starting the training pipeline, the distribution of the training set should be tested to ensure that it is fit for the task. At this stage, the monitoring solution can be leveraged to provide detailed reports on the distributions of the last production cases, and by using data testing tools such as deequ or TDDA, this type of data verification constraints can be automatically added to the CI process.", "When executing the training pipeline and before submitting the new model as a \u201ccandidate\u201d model into the registry, ensure that the new training process undergoes a healthy fit verification.", "Even if the training pipeline is fully automated, it should include a hold-out/cross-validation model evaluation step.", "Given the selected validation method, one should apply tests to validate that the fitted model convergence doesn\u2019t indicate overfitting, i.e.: seeing a reduced loss on the training dataset, while it\u2019s increasing on the validation set. The performance should also be above a certain minimal rate \u2014 based on a hardcoded threshold, naive model as a baseline, or calculated dynamically by leveraging the monitoring service and extracting the rates of the production model during the used validation set.", "Once the model quality validation phase is completed, one should perform integration tests to see how the serving layer integrates with the new version, and whether it successfully serves predictions for specific edge cases. For instance: handling null values in the features that could be nullable, handling new categorical levels in categorical features, working on different lengths of text for text inputs, or even working for different image size/resolution,\u2026 Here also, the examples can be synthesized manually or taken from the monitoring solution, whose capabilities include identifying and saving valid inputs with data integrity issues.", "Changing the model, or changing its pre-processing steps or packages could also impact the model\u2019s operational performance. In many use cases such as real time-bidding increasing the latency of the model serving might impact dramatically the business. Therefore, as a final step in the model CI process, a stress test should be performed to measure the operational aspects, such as average response time. Such a metric can be evaluated relative to a business constraint or relative to the current production operational model latency, calculated by the monitoring solution.", "The CD phase is the process of actually deploying the code to replace the previous versions. In traditional software engineering, this is usually carried out through a \u201cBlue-green\u201d or a \u201ccanary\u201d deployment \u2014 a methodology for gradually rolling out releases. First, the change is deployed to a small subset of cases, usually rolling out gradually to a subset of servers. Once it is established that the functionality works well, the change is then rolled out to the rest of the servers.", "Applying it to ML models, the CD process should basically be a gradual one to validate the model correctness and quality on live data, using production systems, before letting it kick in and take real automated decisions. Such evaluation is often called \u201conline evaluation\u201d, as opposed to the tests achieved during the CI phase which are based on historical datasets and may be considered to be \u201coffline evaluation\u201d.", "Such model online evaluation may involve a few basic strategies:", "Shadow evaluation (or often called \u201cDark launch\u201d) is a very intuitive and safe strategy. In shadow mode, the new model is added to the registry as a \u201ccandidate model\u201d. Any new prediction request is inferred both by the model versions, the one that currently used in production, and the new candidate version in shadow mode.", "In shadow mode the new version is tested using a new stream of production data, but only the predictions of the latest \u201cproduction model\u201d version are being used and returned to the user/business.", "With shadow mode, there is no risk of exposure until the new version is indeed approved and works as expected. The benefits of the shadow mode are twofold:", "With this method, the monitoring service should persist through both sets of predictions \u2014 and continuously monitor both models until the new model is stable enough to be promoted as the new \u201cproduction version\u201d. Once the new version is ready, the monitoring service signals to the serving layer that it needs to upgrade the model version. Technically this \u201cpromotion\u201d can be done by updating a tag of \u201clatest\u201d for the new version and making the serving layer always work with the \u201clatest\u201d model version tag (similar to the \u201clatest\u201d concept in docker images). Or by working with an explicit model version tag, but this will require the serving layer to always check first what is the latest production-ready version tag, and only then to reload the relevant version and use it to perform predictions.", "We should compare the new \u201cshadow\u201d version to the current latest production model, using statistical hypothesis", "Such a test should verify that the performance of the new version has the required effect size, a.k.a: the difference between the two version performance metrics, under a specific statistical power, a.k.a.: the probability of correctly identifying an effect when there is one. For example: If the latest version had a precision level of 91% in the past week, the new candidate version must have a 0 or more effect size so the new precision rate will be 91% at least.", "The overall performance level is not the only metric to look at", "Before promoting the model though, additional factors could be important to monitor: the performance stability, meaning determining the variance in the daily precision performance in our last example, or checking performance constraints for specific sub-population. E.g. the model must have a 95% precision level at least for our \u201cVIP customers. When the label collection takes time or might be missing completely, other KPIs can be used to test the new model as a proxy for its quality \u2014 i.e.: in loan approval use cases, where such feedback loops might take longer than 3\u20136 months. In these cases, the level of correlation between the predictions of the two versions can be used, as a new version should have a relatively high level of correlation relative to its predecessor. Another option is to test the level of distribution shift in the production data relative to its training dataset to ensure that the new version was trained on a relevant dataset relative to the current production distribution.", "Aside from all its benefits, shadow evaluation has limitations and is only partially practical. This is what we will analyze below, as well as review alternative solutions.", "In many ML scenarios, the predictions of the model actually impact the surrounding environment it operates in. Let\u2019s take a recommendation model responsible for ranking the top 5 movie suggestions to offer. In most cases, the label depends on whether or not the user indeed watched one of the movies suggested. Here, the model\u2019s prediction impacted the user\u2019s behavior, and therefore the collected data. If a candidate shadow model outputs 5 very different movies, the fact that the user doesn\u2019t select them doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they were bad recommendations \u2014 only the fact that the model was in shadow mode, and didn\u2019t take any real-life action, made it impossible for the user to actually see these movies. In this scenario, the performance success cannot be compared. This is when an online A/B test evaluation is required.", "In an A/B setup, both the current latest version and the new candidate version, which may be referred to as model A / \u201ccontrol\u201d group and model B / \u201ctreatment\u201d group, are actually active in production. Each new request is routed to one of the models, according to a specific logic, and only the selected model is used for prediction.", "These evaluations can be carried out for a certain amount of time, predictions, or until the statistical hypothesis \u2014 whether the new version is at least as good as the previous one \u2014 is validated. Similar to the shadow strategy, the KPIs to test can be the performance, stability or some other proxy,\u2026It is important to note though, that the monitoring service should be in charge of the management and evaluation of the A/B tests.", "The success of this method highly depends on the ability to split the A/B test groups correctly and carefully.", "A good practice for it is to do a random sample for a specific portion to get the \u201ctreatment\u201d, meaning the prediction from the new version. For example, with the movie recommendation use case, any new request should have X (e.g. 10%) chance to be served by the new model version, until the test is done. Usually, the exposure factor is relatively low, as this strategy actually \u201cexposes\u201d the new model even before the qualitative tests are completed.", "Such A/B configuration can be generalized also to A/B/C/\u2026 setups \u2014 where multiple models are compared simultaneously. Keep in mind though that testing a few models together side-by-side can increase the chances for False-Positive outcome, due to the higher number of tests. Besides, given the fact that we are testing a smaller amount of samples in each group, the statistical power of \u201csmall effect size\u201d is reduced, and therefore should be considered carefully.", "Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is actually a more \u201cdynamic\u201d kind of A/B test experimentation, but also a more complex one to measure and operate. It\u2019s a classical reinforcement learning where one tries to \u201cexplore\u201d (try a new model version) while \u201cexploiting\u201d and optimizing the defined performance KPI. Such configuration is based on the implementation of the exploration/exploitation tradeoff inside the monitoring service. The traffic is being dynamically allocated between the two (or more) versions, according to the collected performance KPI \u2014 or other proxies as described earlier.", "In this situation, the new version is exposed to a certain amount of cases. The more it equals or surpasses the previous version, and based on its performance KPI, more and more traffic will be directed to it.", "Such configuration seems ideal, as we try to optimize the \u201cexposure\u201d dynamically while optimizing our main metric. However, it requires advanced monitoring and automation capabilities to implement the multi-armed bandit solution, and adjust the traffic dynamically based on its results. Especially given the difficulties related to the definition of one clear KPI to be exploited by the system \u2014 performance, stability,...", "By looking at the examples used in traditional software and implementing that onto our own ML paradigm, CI/CD best practices, we learn that there are many steps to be taken to have a better \u201croll out day\u201d. All of these strategies rely on a strong monitoring component to make the processes more data-driven.", "Safely rolling out models is about monitoring the orchestration of all the pieces of the ML infrastructure together", "Below we can see the safe delivery of a new version (V2, marked as a blue dot), yielding an improved ROC AUC performance in production.", "Looking beyond, the health of your models in production also requires a thorough, and data-driven retraining strategy. While, the CI/CD paradigms address the \u201cwhat\u201d and the \u201chow\u201d of new models roll-out, the \u201cwhen\u201d is covered by the CT (Continuous Training) paradigm. This will be the focus in the next post of my colleague Or Itzahary, so stay tuned!", "From CI/CD to CT (Continuous training).
