These stages are:", "The main component of a deep learning project is typically a model that takes an input \u2018X\u2019 and provides an output \u2018Y\u2019. The output result shares some form of correlation with the original input.", "The generic description of a deep learning model above does not meet the minimal requirement to begin model implementation in most cases.", "Before we can dive into the model implementation or any of the other stages within a project lifecycle, it\u2019s sensible to take several steps back and systematically conduct a problem and solution analysis. This is achieved by completing tasks associated with previous actions and processes taken in any deep learning project.", "The first significant step/process in a deep learning project is the problem definition.", "Problem Definition: A clear statement describing the initial state of a problem that's to be solved. The statement indicates problem properties such as the task to be solved, the current performance of existing systems and experience with the current system.", "Conducting a successful problem definition process within a deep learning project involves a fundamental analysis and evaluation of what, why and how aspects associated with the problem.", "Coming up with a good problem definition is usually an iterative process. It can reveal more questions and items to consider that would have gone neglected without going through a problem definition process.", "The questions included below act as guiding beacons that enable a thorough analysis of a problem and surrounding topics.", "Just by taking the time to answer the questions below could save weeks and months of tackling problems that turn out to not be feasible for previously unseen reasons.", "Well written problem definitions are free of ambiguous statements and are not subject to misinterpretations due to the clear and concise description of the problem.", "Below are some examples of problem definitions associated with tasks solved through deep learning techniques.", "Example 1: \u201cReduce the time taken to come up with a creative and original image caption that goes with an Instagram image post.\u201d", "Example 2: \u201cAutomate the generation of stock recommendations and price predictions for investors based on the previously recorded historic 5-year price movement of stocks within the SNP 500.\u201d", "In this section, we\u2019ll take a deeper dive into the guiding questions presented earlier in this article.", "A better understanding of the applicability and importance of the guiding questions is realised when exploration of scenarios reveal considerations to take when tackling a problem that requires a deep learning-based solution.", "Understanding the nature of a problem provides insight into components and attributes of the yet to be implemented solutions.", "A good understanding of a problem guides future decisions to make at the later project stages, especially decisions such as determining if a deep learning solution is even feasible.", "In example 1, one can understand the nature of the problem by looking into the environment the problem resides in (Instagram). Awareness of any technical mentions (Image captioning) or phrases that describe existing processes associated with the problem also provides an insight into the nature of the problem.", "Example 1\u2019s defined problem is concerned with mainly the reduction of the time(\u201cReduce the time\u201d) it takes to complete a task (Image captioning).", "Answering these guiding questions will require more than just problem statements.", "To answer why a problem requires a solution will involve a dialogue with project stakeholders, more specifically, the individual(s) that are currently experiencing the problem.", "Understanding why a problem requires a solution will indicate the urgency and importance of a solution.", "Knowing how urgent a solution is required for a problem can direct the approach of solution implementation. Deep Learning approaches are notorious for having extensive training and evaluation times.", "It might be more useful to implement a heuristic-based approach to solving a problem that takes hours to implement and test as opposed to spending days or weeks training and fine-tuning the machine/deep learning model.", "Likely, the answer to this question is already becoming more evident from answering \u2018why a solution is required\u2019 in the first place.", "There is more than one way to approach a deep learning-based solution.", "At a high level, most machine learning practitioners understand that ML models can be classified based on the following categories: supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning approaches.", "Although this article focuses on deep learning-based projects or solutions, it is always necessary and useful to explore alternative methods of solving problems that do not conform to specific domain assumptions or expertise.", "At times it is more pragmatic to implement a solution with a simple ML model and iteratively improve on the model after the user has a version of a proposed solution in hand.", "When exploring this question is always good to understand the limitations of deep learning-based solutions. Deep learning is good, but it can\u2019t be leveraged to solve every problem.", "Deep learning solutions are well suited for problems that involve a quantifiable form of data in a repeating pattern; typically, these are in the form of text, images, audio or numeric data.", "In many cases, deep learning models are simply a smaller part to a more comprehensive solution. When thinking of solutions, it is common to make the assumptions of a single application that solves a problem.", "In more established domains and businesses, it is typical to find an ecosystem of applications and hardware devices communicating and operating in either a synchronous or asynchronous manner, to achieve a specific task.", "Understanding what aspect of a problem deep learning techniques will solve enables the scoping of the technical and time resource to allocate to a specific project, from a deep learning perspective.", "Websites, mobile applications, desktop applications, these are various software forms that deep learning solutions can reside in, and each form requires a different level of interaction.", "Before diving solution delivery and deployment, it is essential to understand how interactions with the solution are conducted.", "Here are some key areas to focus on when answering this question:", "Conducting problem definition within a deep learning project, or any machine learning project is usually an involved process that embodies several tasks such as problem scoping, user interviews, technical specifications etc.", "The benefits of having a well-defined problem, along with all other details surrounding the problem to be solved, is that there is a higher chance of success for the later processes within a deep learning project.", "The bullet points below provide a further understanding of the key benefits of a well-defined problem:", "Going through the processes identified in this article might seem long-winded.", "Still, it\u2019s advantageous to ensure that both yourself and team members understand aspects of a problem before diving into solution implementation.", "Even when working on a solo project, you can scheme through the questions and processes presented in this article.", "We\u2019ve all heard countless recollections of startups, companies and organisation that look to leverage deep learning to solve a problem only to find out that a solution can not be implemented after months or even years of working on a problem.", "Conducting a short problem definition phase within a project lifecycle can save money and time, two primary resources that determine the success of most projects.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
