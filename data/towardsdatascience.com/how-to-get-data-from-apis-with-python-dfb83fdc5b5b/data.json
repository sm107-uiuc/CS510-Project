To avoid going over these limits, you can use the Python time library and put your request into a loop. For example, here\u2019s a brief snippet of code that waits for five seconds between requests.", "The point of this code is to show you how you can use time.sleep() to avoid nonstop API endpoint pings that might push you over a rate limit. In a real use case, you would probably want to save your data in some way and use a try\u2026except block.", "This is a guide for using Python with APIs, but you should know that you can query an API from the command line with the popular cURL program. cURL is included on Macs and machines running recent Windows 10 versions by default.
