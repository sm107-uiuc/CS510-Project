In 1985, researchers in linguistic and psychology at Princeton University produced a semantic lexicon for the English language called WordNet that has been largely used for natural language processing tasks. Based on WordNet, MIT scientists released Tiny Images in 2006, a dataset of images compiled from an image search on the internet associated with WordNet words. Since WordNet was originally gender-based and racially biased, so were the Tiny Images labels associated with the collected images.", "Just a few weeks ago, Pulse, a generative model for self-supervised photo upsampling, made a lot of noise and concerns over bias in AI models, as a pixelated image of former president of the United States Barack Obama was transformed by Pulse into a high-resolution image of a white man.", "These two examples amongst many are the embodiment of the bias problem in AI and show the complexity of this issue that extends further than data and models. It is a global issue that needs to be tackled from many angles, not just technical fixes.", "The start of the art is moving fast, but it is safe to say that minimizing the effect of bias in data can be performed in many ways. There is no magic pill.", "Yann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist at Facebook, explains that the most straightforward way to deal with bias is to be aware of the imbalance in the data, and fix it with equalizing the frequencies of samples from the distinct categories. According to LeCun, this is the method used by Facebook in its face recognition system. To illustrate this, LeCun likes to use this analogy:", "\u201c If you go to medical school, you don\u2019t spend time studying the common flu and some rare disease in proportion to their frequencies in patients. You spend comparatively more time on rare diseases because you need to develop the \u201cfeatures\u201d for them.\u201c \u2014 Yann LeCun", "Bias in Deep Learning systems is such a concern because due to the non-convexity of the loss, they do not learn and create features for rare categories, whereas this does not occur with logistic regression for instance.", "A recent paper proposes a new way to identify and minimize bias with \u201cInvariant Risk Minimization\u201d. In a nutshell, this method aims to train the machine learning model to estimate invariant correlations across multiple training distributions.", "These recent events have reopened the debate on trustworthy AI: institutions and individuals working with AI models have to reconsider the way they craft, develop, and deploy AI. Consumers and citizens require the same level of rights and security whether an AI-based system or not. Today, AI is not naturally adopted by the population, there is most of the time a mistrust hovering around it. The ethical use of AI becomes a prerequisite for trust.", "It\u2019s time to break those worries and change the way we make IA.", "In Europe, the regulators are working on the subject and they have released in April 2019 a set of ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI.", "According to the Guidelines, trustworthy AI should be built around 3 pillars:", "Around these pillars, the EU regulators have defined seven practical key requirements that any AI system should meet to be labeled as trustworthy.", "\u201c Based on this work we can now move forward with creating a regulatory framework where everyone can reap the benefits of trustworthy AI.\u201d \u2014 Commissioner for Internal Market, Thierry Breton", "These 7 key principles can be used as an entry point to audit the value chain of AI systems, from conception to deployment and maintenance.", "The major added value of this document issued by the European Commission is that it comes with a list of practical questions to implement the key principles I have already mentioned.", "This trustworthy AI assessment list, ALTAI, is a great initiative for any company or individual who wants to make its first steps and move forward to solve the AI trust crisis we face today. It transposes the guidelines into an accessible and practical checklist that sponsors, developers, and deployers of AI can use to quickly audit their AI system. ALTAI is available in a document version and as a web-based tool (prototype version).", "Technical and non-technical methods are suggested to ensure Trustworthy AI incorporation in the design, development, and rolling phases of an AI system.", "The starting point for any company is to define its ethical values and responsibility in the use of AI and state it in a Code of Conduct. This should be translated into governance principles and the key principles should be anchored in the AI system\u2019s architecture design. A critical point is to identify, assess, and manage risk through AI risk management tools and protocols. Rules, processes, and control procedures will set up the trustworthy AI framework. The monitoring of models and KPIs over time well help to detect data or performance drifts and raise flags for potential bias.", "The ecosystem will also evolve, with emphasis on regulation, standardization, and certification of AI systems, but also with education and awareness to foster an ethical mindset, with all stakeholders participation and social dialogue, diversity, and inclusive design teams.", "AI audits methodology and will flourish in the next coming years and surely companies specialized in AI audits and certification will pop on the market. There is without a doubt a huge market around trustworthy AI, and companies will thrive to use it as a differentiating feature to stand out from their competitors.", "I really hope this post will raise awareness on how important and urgent it is to move forward and start thinking, designing, and implementing these ethical recommendations into our daily AI practitioners\u2019 jobs.", "Your home for data science.
