In other words, it can also be called as Image Style Transfer.", "In this article, we are going to apply the Deep Learning method of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to create an image effect in which the design or style of one image can be applied onto another Image to see creative effects.", "The above shared picture is the one that shows the implementation of Style Transfer of Images using CNN.", "For our experiment, we will be using the following \u2018Original Image\u2019 and \u2018Style Image\u2019 shared below.", "From the above shared images, the \u2018Original Image\u2019 is the one on which we will apply the design of the \u2018Style Image\u2019 to get the final main output. The detailed code for the entire program is available at the end of this article.", "In the initial steps of the program code, we resize both the Original Image and the Style Image to a size of 512X512. The output size will be (512,512,3). Where 3 denoted that the image is an RGB or Color Image.", "The next step is to reshape the image to a 4D- Tensor of shape (1, 512, 512, 3) by using expand_dims. We then create a new variable \u2018final_image\u2019 which will be our final output image.", "In this method, we will be applying the pre-trained VGG16 CNN Model by utilizing the concept of Transfer Learning.", "According to a source Johnson et al. , to extract the features for the main image content layer we should select block1_conv2 And for the style layers we need to choose block1_conv2, block2_conv2, block3_conv3, block4_conv3, block5_conv3. These are the layers that can accurately extract the features from the two images.", "As given in the paper, this combination of layers chosen is working correctly to get the required style transfer. However, you can try different combinations to get more accurate Style Transfer.", "Once we have finalized on the CNN model, we can now define a main loss function. It is the distance between the main image and our output image.", "The style loss is similar to the main loss as it is the distance between the style image and our output image.", "Finally, we will define another loss called as the final loss which will regularize the final image.", "Once we define the three losses, we can state the Style Transfer as an optimization problem in which we aim to minimize all the three losses define above which is collectively called as global loss.", "After this, we define a class Evaluator() in which we collectively combine all the above defined functions and use it in the main iteration for Style Transfer.", "In this, we will use the Limited-memory BFGS which is an optimization algorithm to perform the Style Transfer for 10 iterations.", "On visualizing the results with the L-BFGS algorithm we get the following image.", "From this above image, we can see that the Style of the \u2018Style Image\u2019 has successfully been imposed on the \u2018Original Image\u2019. Thus, we have successfully implemented the Image Style Transfer using CNN.", "I am sharing the link to my github repository where you can find the entire code available for your reference.", "Here are some more examples of Image Style Transfer which have been implemented using this program.", "From this article, we have been able to utilize Deep Learning and CNN in particular, to create amazing Style Transfer Effects.
