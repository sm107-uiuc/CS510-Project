And there\u2019s still limited widespread knowledge on how to avoid AI pitfalls.", "Many are technical, but some aren\u2019t. Businesspeople can play a valuable role in flagging risks, especially those with significant business impact.", "This article lists some important AI pitfalls relevant to AI business stakeholders, with tips to steer around them. They\u2019re a result of the anecdotal, personal and published experience of AI projects that could have gone better.", "If things go wrong with an AI project, the best case is usually wasted investment or missed opportunity. For example, failing to keep up with competitors. In worse cases, AI may inflict damage to some aspect of your business. Casualties can include sales growth, customer satisfaction, brand or operational efficiency.", "Business members of the AI team can\u2019t do much about many AI project problems. That\u2019s because they require data science or technical expertise. But it\u2019s valid for them to be involved \u2014 or at least aware \u2014 of those that have significant business impact.", "Asking the right questions may be enough to reduce the likelihood of many problems happening. However, it\u2019s easy to bog down your project with excessive caution or irrelevant concerns if the questions are uninformed. Educating yourself on the kinds of things that can go wrong, and why, is a good way of remaining constructive.", "Below is an overview of 5 common AI pitfalls that businesspeople should be aware of. They directly relate to business aspects of the work, and overall business success.", "A common AI pitfall is drawing incorrect, inappropriate or invalid conclusions from the results of AI work. As with all statistics and data science work, there is interpretation required to ascribe meaning to data. If that isn\u2019t done well, the results are vulnerable to misinterpretation and inappropriate use. That\u2019s particularly prevalent where business leaders have pre-existing decisions or instincts they\u2019re looking to justify with data.", "This isn\u2019t usually a wilful result. It could well happen because of haste, ambiguity or misunderstanding around the business question(s) being asked of the AI solution.", "If there\u2019s pressure to produce results quickly, it\u2019s easy to over-simplify what you ask AI to do. Initially, it\u2019s usually possible to distil a project to one overarching goal and associated AI \u201cbig question(s)\u201d. But as you drop into detail, the complexity can become daunting.", "Assuming everyone is sincerely seeking the \u201cright\u201d answer, there are two main project steps where this AI pitfall appears:", "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re struggling with customer retention. It\u2019s tempting to ask your AI team to identify customers who are going to leave. It seems reasonable that if you know that, you could do something to prevent them going.", "When they ask how accurately you want to identify them, a natural answer might be \u201cas accurately as possible\u201d, ideally 100%.", "The flaw here is that if customers leave because of unhappiness, the likelihood of leaving increases with dissatisfaction. The more accurately you want to predict a customer will leave, the later in their lifecycle the answer appears.", "In other words, you can best predict they\u2019ll leave when they\u2019re most dissatisfied. Unfortunately, it\u2019s likely to be too late to do much about it by then.", "Looking again at the \u201cbig picture\u201d question, it would be more useful to uncover earlier signs of increasing dissatisfaction. This translates into using AI to \u201cscore\u201d how likely customers are to leave in the future. Knowing this, you could try different interventions earlier to change minds.", "With the second type of \u201cwrong question\u201d AI pitfall, the pitfall doesn\u2019t appear initially. That\u2019s because the solution initially yields useful results. It\u2019s only with longer-term validation, testing or use that the flaws appear.", "A painful, well-documented example from recruitment is using AI to screen CVs or assess candidates.", "The problem arises by using AI to infer characteristics of ideal candidates from employees who\u2019ve succeeded in the past. This will encourage the firm to hire future staff \u201cin its own image\u201d. New hires should do well, because they\u2019re similar to those who already do well.", "The pitfall is that the AI logic won\u2019t just replicate what\u2019s good about existing employees. It may also reinforce less desirable behaviours. Firms falling foul of this inadvertently embedded pre-existing biases and prejudices into their hiring process. In the worst cases, this included illegal ones related to race or gender.", "The root cause here also lies with the question asked of the AI team by business. It appears in its implications for AI solution design, and longer term results. A typical flawed question might be \u201cidentify candidates who will succeed in our organisation\u201d. Without further qualification and constraint, it leads to this kind of problem. But the problem won\u2019t appear until much later than the first type. It will initially appear to work well, picking candidates who fit comfortably into the firm.", "One mitigation is allowing enough time to model different data science approaches to generate possible answers. Also, make sure you understand the underlying logic and assumptions in business terms. Involve business in evaluating interim results and \u201csense-checking\u201d them from a business perspective.", "Another way to avoid these kinds of difficulty is to play out how the AI results will be used in business terms. This should continue all the way through to realising the benefits. It\u2019s also worth trying to extrapolate into the longer term. This means visualising what will be different in the business with the solution in place for a few quarters, and then a few years.", "There are useful techniques to use in AI solution design that help sidestep this. These include business prototyping and scenario planning.", "There are plenty of articles, conference sessions and books describing how AI can help business. But there\u2019s much less about how to quantify those benefits. When people talk or write publicly about their AI benefits, numbers aren\u2019t mentioned very often.", "This leads to a dilemma for businesses spending on AI. Without benchmarks and quantifiable benefits, AI business cases are unlikely to meet the same standards as other budgets. But when everyone seems to be talking about how AI will transform business, not doing AI work seems questionable. Even if the numbers are vague or don\u2019t quite stack up.", "Even if the reasons for the dilemma are known, the response can be less understandable. When the topic is AI, some businesses embark on potentially expensive work, without clarity on what they hope to achieve from it. Some justify this because AI is likely to be strategically important in the future. But arguably, that makes setting a destination even more important.", "Yet the experience of many AI practitioners is that quite a few firms do this. Unsurprisingly, this can cause disappointment or scepticism about AI, and the pausing of nascent AI plans.", "There are several ways of working around this. One is grouping the spend with existing investments and cost centres, such as R&D or capability building. Another is setting \u201csoft\u201d business goals, consciously accepting more latitude on measuring results. A third is using initial projects to creating a baseline of relevant metrics for future business cases.", "There are two parts to addressing this pitfall, which should be treated separately:", "Both can be tricky, and there are few useful industry reports or benchmarks available yet to provide quick answers. But each is achievable, and those who persevere will find themselves ahead of most of their competitors.", "AI business projects create outputs for business people to use to solve a business problem or improve a business activity.", "To solve the problem or improve the activity, you\u2019ll need to modify day-to-day work to make use of the AI output. So it seems obvious that deciding how a business will use the AI output should be part of the AI work.", "Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t necessarily work that way in practice.", "It\u2019s not that AI teams don\u2019t recognise business changes need to happen. In many organisations, it\u2019s not part of their responsibility. In others, AI teams don\u2019t have the knowledge or authority to do anything meaningful about it. Of course, sometimes AI teams just don\u2019t take an interest. Or they know it\u2019s difficult, so leave it to someone else.", "As with other aspects of AI work, there\u2019s a good analogy with regular IT work. In both, it\u2019s not uncommon to find business teams and IT teams appearing to work against each other. The reasons may be political, human or historical, but the result is teams that don\u2019t seem to be working for the same organisation. It doesn\u2019t help that AI technical work is harder to understand, and its long-term implications less clear. So this divide can be much more stark in AI projects, especially if business teams feel threatened by AI.", "It\u2019s not possible to prescribe generically how your AI projects should handle business implementation. It varies by organisation, solution type and even department. But you can establish some principles for AI business implementation across your organisation. These can then become part of your approach to all AI work.", "The aim is not to do AI business implementation perfectly. It\u2019s to make sure you don\u2019t overlook business implementation or relegate it to an afterthought.", "Deciding what skills to employ or engage for your AI work is difficult if your organisation doesn\u2019t really understand AI. Also, deciding what skills you need is a function of strategic decisions you may not yet have made.", "These factors lead to two types of AI pitfall related to skills:", "If you plan to use third parties for AI work, you\u2019ll need in-house AI skills to commission and manage work. You\u2019ll also need them to assess those you pay to do that work. Conversely, if you keep AI work in-house, you\u2019ll need an in-house AI team, with very different profiles.", "If you haven\u2019t decided between the two, it\u2019s hard to know what skills you\u2019ll need. A possible exception is an AI leader to make such decisions and plan accordingly.", "AI hiring is even trickier, because there\u2019s little consensus on what an AI team or department should look like. There\u2019s even debate about where in a firm AI should sit.", "One mitigation option early on in your AI skills building is to focus on broader AI knowledge for your initial hires. This allows you to avoid over-specialising permanent hires until you have clarity on longer term skills needs. While building that clarity, use contract or cross-trained existing IT staff for the more detailed roles, especially technical development.", "Just like any other specialisation, high level labels (e.g. data scientist or data engineer) are often meaningless without context. Assessing someone\u2019s capabilities is tricky if you don\u2019t have the knowledge to distinguish fact from exaggeration from fiction. Similar challenges exist when selecting AI vendors to build your AI solutions.", "It will be risky to delegate AI hiring or procurement to people without sufficient AI knowledge to overcome these challenges. You will also need to give them sufficient guidance to evaluate and compare candidates.", "An easy AI pitfall to fall foul of is starting AI work primarily because of a desire to use AI. This usually goes hand-in-hand with insufficient thought on the kind of problem to solve with it.", "This leads to AI projects without business focus, or that are trying to solve the \u201cwrong\u201d kind of problem. This includes problems for which AI is not suitable, or unable to help resolve.", "I\u2019m not elaborating here on what makes for the right kind of problem for AI. There are checklists and other resources to help you identify what to look for in a problem to assess its suitability for AI. The emphasis here is on making sure you\u2019ve considered carefully your choice of AI project and problem. The important point is that someone has looked at \u201cwhy AI\u201d for the problem at hand. If they believe it\u2019s a valid match, the explanation should be understandable by business leadership, not only AI specialists.", "Ideally, you\u2019ll choose the right kind of problem, and things will go well. But don\u2019t be disheartened if, despite trying, they don\u2019t. Teams make mistakes choosing the right business problem, particularly early in an organisation\u2019s adoption of AI. But that improves over time. It\u2019s an almost inevitable part of converting AI information into knowledge.", "To avoid this pitfall, look for symptoms that a desire to use AI is driving a project. Alternatively, it may be easier to spot the lack of a suitable business problem.", "AI for its own sake is a pitfall. However, it\u2019s worth noting that an AI project as a learning exercise can have benefits. These may be strong enough by themselves to justify this approach.", "If you\u2019re following that path, it should be an explicit decision to invest in AI project for learning. The business case for such investments is very different, as is what to measure and achieve for success.", "It\u2019s still early days for AI in business, and the industry is still figuring out answers to fundamental questions. One is the best way to consistently build effective AI business solutions. Another is how to achieve measurable business improvements from AI work. A third is deciding the skills your business needs to compete in an AI world. Bear in mind that fitting those skills into an existing organisation structure isn\u2019t necessarily straightforward.", "As a result, many AI projects don\u2019t \u201csucceed\u201d, perhaps the majority. So today, knowing how to avoid AI pitfalls is arguably as important as knowing how to build AI business solutions.", "Many pitfalls are technical in nature, and businesspeople have limited opportunity to do much about them. But others relate directly to business aspects of AI work, and business stakeholders can influence them strongly.", "We\u2019ve discussed five here. Four are about doing AI work for the right business reasons, and ensuring AI work results in measurable business results. The fifth is about the significant organisational implication on the AI skills a business needs.", "It\u2019s usually a given that businesses do AI work for business gain. But that\u2019s not always the focus of an AI team, especially if grappling with technical and data problems. Teams may even treat business issues as an unwelcome distraction.", "As an AI business stakeholder, a key responsibility is to ensure appropriate business focus in AI projects. This should be in place from the outset, and remain sharp throughout \u2014 including after the project ends. Attention to the pitfalls discussed here should help achieve this.", "This article was first published on www.aiprescience.com", "CEO of AI research & consulting firm AI Prescience.
