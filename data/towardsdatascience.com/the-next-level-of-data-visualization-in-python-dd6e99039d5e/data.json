It refers to our tendency to continue to devote time and resources to a lost cause because we have already spent \u2014 sunk \u2014 so much time in the pursuit. The sunk-cost fallacy applies to staying in bad jobs longer than we should, slaving away at a project even when it\u2019s clear it won\u2019t work, and yes, continuing to use a tedious, outdated plotting library \u2014 matplotlib \u2014 when more efficient, interactive, and better-looking alternatives exist.", "Over the past few months, I\u2019ve realized the only reason I use matplotlib is the hundreds of hours I\u2019ve sunk into learning the convoluted syntax. This complication leads to hours of frustration on StackOverflow figuring out how to format dates or add a second y-axis. Fortunately, this is a great time for Python plotting, and after exploring the options, a clear winner \u2014 in terms of ease-of-use, documentation, and functionality \u2014 is the plotly Python library. In this article, we\u2019ll dive right into plotly, learning how to make better plots in less time \u2014 often with one line of code.", "All of the code for this article is available on GitHub. The charts are all interactive and can be viewed on NBViewer here.", "The plotly Python package is an open-source library built on plotly.js which in turn is built on d3.js. We\u2019ll be using a wrapper on plotly called cufflinks designed to work with Pandas dataframes. So, our entire stack is cufflinks > plotly > plotly.js > d3.js which means we get the efficiency of coding in Python with the incredible interactive graphics capabilities of d3.", "(Plotly itself is a graphics company with several products and open-source tools. The Python library is free to use, and we can make unlimited charts in offline mode plus up to 25 charts in online mode to share with the world.)", "All the work in this article was done in a Jupyter Notebook with plotly + cufflinks running in offline mode. After installing plotly and cufflinks with pip install cufflinks plotly import the following to run in Jupyter:", "Single variable \u2014 univariate \u2014 plots are a standard way to start an analysis and the histogram is a go-to plot (although it has some issues) for graphing a distribution. Here, using my Medium article statistics (you can see how to get your own stats here or use mine here) let\u2019s make an interactive histogram of the number of claps for articles ( df is a standard Pandas dataframe):", "For those used to matplotlib, all we have to do is add one more letter ( iplot instead of plot) and we get a much better-looking and interactive chart! We can click on the data to get more details, zoom into sections of the plot, and as we\u2019ll see later, select different categories to highlight.", "If we want to plot overlaid histograms, that\u2019s just as simple:", "With a little bit of pandas manipulation, we can do a barplot:", "s we saw, we can combine the power of pandas with plotly + cufflinks. For a boxplot of the fans per story by publication, we use a pivot and then plot:", "The benefits of interactivity are that we can explore and subset the data as we like. There\u2019s a lot of information in a boxplot, and without the ability to see the numbers, we\u2019ll miss most of it!", "The scatterplot is the heart of most analyses. It allows us to see the evolution of a variable over time or the relationship between two (or more) variables.", "A considerable portion of real-world data has a time element. Luckily, plotly + cufflinks was designed with time-series visualizations in mind. Let\u2019s make a dataframe of my TDS articles and look at how the trends have changed.", "Here we are doing quite a few different things all in one line:", "For more information, we can also add in text annotations quite easily:", "For a two-variable scatter plot colored by a third categorical variable we use:", "Let\u2019s get a little more sophisticated by using a log axis \u2014 specified as a plotly layout \u2014 (see the Plotly documentation for the layout specifics) and sizing the bubbles by a numeric variable:", "With a little more work (see notebook for details), we can even put four variables (this is not advised) on one graph!", "As before, we can combine pandas with plotly+cufflinks for useful plots", "See the notebook or the documentation for more examples of added functionality. We can add in text annotations, reference lines, and best-fit lines to our plots with a single line of code, and still with all the interaction.", "Now we\u2019ll get into a few plots that you probably won\u2019t use all that often, but which can be quite impressive.

Cufflinks also has several themes we can use to get completely different styling with no effort. For example, below we have a ratio plot in the \u201cspace\u201d theme and a spread plot in \u201cggplot\u201d:", "We also get 3D plots (surface and bubble):", "For those who are so inclined, you can even make a pie chart:", "When you make these plots in the notebook, you\u2019ll notice a small link on the lower right-hand side on the graph that says \u201cExport to plot.ly\u201d. If you click that link, you are then taken to the chart studio where you can touch up your plot for a final presentation. You can add annotations, specify the colors, and generally clean everything up for a great figure. Then, you can publish your figure online so anyone can find it with the link.", "Below are two charts I touched up in Chart Studio:", "With everything mentioned here, we are still not exploring the full capabilities of the library! I\u2019d encourage you to check out both the plotly and the cufflinks documentation for more incredible graphics.", "The worst part about the sunk cost fallacy is you only realize how much time you\u2019ve wasted after you\u2019ve quit the endeavor. Fortunately, now that I\u2019ve made the mistake of sticking with matploblib for too long, you don\u2019t have to!", "When thinking about plotting libraries, there are a few things we want:", "As of right now, the best option for doing all of these in Python is plotly. Plotly allows us to make visualizations quickly and helps us get better insight into our data through interactivity. Also, let\u2019s admit it, plotting should be one of the most enjoyable parts of data science! With other libraries, plotting turned into a tedious task, but with plotly, there is again joy in making a great figure!", "Now that it\u2019s 2019, it is time to upgrade your Python plotting library for better efficiency, functionality, and aesthetics in your data science visualizations.", "As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.
