Basic lexical processing techniques cannot make this distinction. Therefore, more sophisticated syntax processing techniques are needed to understand the relationship between individual words in a sentence.", "Syntactical analysis looks at the following aspects in the sentence which lexical doesn\u2019t :", "Now that we have the basic idea of syntactic processing, let\u2019s understand it in detail.", "One of the most important parts of syntactic processing is parsing. It means to break down a given sentence into its \u2018grammatical constituents\u2019. Let\u2019s understand through an example.", "Suppose you ask a question to a question-answering (QA) system, such as Siri or Alexa, the following question: \u201cWho won the Formula 1 championship in 2019?\u201d", "The QA system can meaningfully respond only if it can understand that the phrase \u2018Formula 1 championship\u2019 relates to the phrase \u2018in 2019\u2019. The phrase \u2018in 2019\u2019 refers to a specific time frame, and thus significantly revises the question. Finding such dependencies or relationships between the phrases of a sentence can be achieved through parsing techniques.", "Let\u2019s take another sentence to understand how a parsed sentence looks like: \u201cThe quick brown fox jumps over the table\u201d.The sentence is divided into three main constituents:", "Now, let us understand the different levels of syntactic analysis that we apply to any given text.", "Let\u2019s start with the first level of syntactic analysis-POS (speech of parts) tagging. A word can be tagged as a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, etc. depending on its role in the sentence. Assigning correct tags such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. is one of the most fundamental functions in syntactic analysis.", "For example, you ask Alexa or google home a question \u2014 \u201cOk Google, where can I get a permit to travel between different states?\u201d. Now, the word \u2018permit\u2019 may possibly have two POS tags \u2014 a noun and a verb. In the phrase \u2018I need a work permit\u2019, the correct tag of \u2018permit\u2019 is \u2018noun\u2019. On the other hand, in the phrase \u201cPlease permit me to go outside.\u201d, The word \u2018permit\u2019 is a \u2018verb\u2019.", "Assigning the correct POS tag helps us to better understand the intended meaning of a phrase or sentence and is thus an important part of syntactic processing. In fact, all subsequent parsing techniques (constituency parsing, dependency parsing, etc.) use part-of-speech tags to parse a sentence.", "Note that the set of POS tags is not standard \u2014 some books/applications may use only the base forms such as NN, VB, JJ etc without using granular forms, though NLTK uses this set of tags.", "Although POS tagging helps us in identifying the linguistic role of the word in a sentence, it wouldn\u2019t enable us to understand how these words are related to each other in a sentence. Hence the next level of syntactic analysis is required.", "To deal with the complexity and ambiguity of natural language, we first need to identify and define commonly seen grammatical patterns. The first step in understanding grammar is to divide words into groups, called constituents, based on their grammatical role in the sentence.", "Let\u2019s take an example to understand constituents in detail. Consider a sentence \u2018Ishan \u2014 read \u2014 an article on Syntactic Analysis\u2019. The group of words separated by the hyphen form a constituent (or a phrase).The justification for placing these words in a unit is provided by the notion of substitution, that is, a component can be replaced with another equivalent component, keeping the sentence syntactically valid.", "For example, replacing the constituency \u2018an article on Syntactic Analysis\u2019 (a noun phrase) with \u2018lunch\u2019 (another noun phrase) doesn\u2019t affect the syntax of the sentence, though the resultant sentence \u201cIshan read lunch\u201d is semantically meaningless.", "The most common constituencies in English are Noun Phrases (NP), Verb Phrases (VP), and Prepositional Phrases (PP). There are various other types of phrases, such as an adverbial phrase, a nominal (N), etc., though in most cases we work with only the above three phrases along with the nominal.", "Lastly, the free word order languages such as Hindi are difficult to parse using constituency parsing techniques. This is because, in such free-word-order languages, the order of words/constituents may change significantly while keeping the meaning exactly the same. Thus, we need dependency parsing for such languages.", "In dependency grammar, constituencies (such as NP, VP, etc.) do not form the main elements of grammar, but dependencies are established between words themselves.", "Let\u2019s take an example sentence \u2018man saw dog\u2019.The dependencies can be said as follows: \u2018man\u2019 is the subject of the sentence (the one who is doing something); \u2018saw\u2019 is the main verb (something that is being done); while \u2018dogs\u2019 is the object of \u2018saw\u2019 (to whom something is being done).", "So, the basic idea of \u200b\u200bdependency parsing is based on the fact that each sentence is about something, and usually involves a subject (the doer), a verb (what is being done) and an object (to whom something is being done).", "In general, Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) is the basic word order in current English (called \u2018rigid word order\u2019). Of course, many sentences are more complex to fall into this simple SVO structure, although sophisticated dependency parsing techniques are able to handle most of them.", "Dependency parsing is a fairly advanced topic whose study involves a much deeper understanding of English grammar and parsing algorithms. Therefore we will not go in much detail here and will leave it upon you to explore further on this.", "That\u2019s it for this article folks. If you did not understand anything in this article or need more details on any topic, feel free to add a response. And if you learned something new from this article, please show your support.", "Take care of yourself and the people around you in these trying times. Cheers!", "Your home for data science.
