That\u2019s where the bias-variance tradeoff comes into play.", "In this article, we\u2019re going to look into what bias and variance mean in the context of machine learning models, and what you can do to minimize them.", "To build a supervised machine learning model you take a dataset that looks somewhat like this.", "It\u2019s a series of data records, each one with several features and a target, the thing you want to learn to predict. But before getting started and building the model, you split the dataset into two distinct subsets:", "You typically select 20% percent of the data records at random and set it aside as the testing set, leaving the remaining 80% of the dataset to train the model. This is commonly referred to as the 80/20 split, but it\u2019s only a rule-of-thumb.", "Training and testing sets have different purposes.", "The training set teaches the model how to predict the target values. As for the testing set, the name gives it away, it\u2019s used to test the quality of the learning if the model is good at predicting beyond the data is used in the learning process.", "With the testing set you\u2019ll see if the model generalizes its predictions beyond the training data.", "We can measure the quality of the two phases in this process, learning and prediction, with the:", "A good model has low training error. But you have to be careful not to drive the training error so low, that the model overfits the training data. When the model overfits the data, it captures the patterns of the training set so perfectly that it becomes an expert at predicting only the results of the training set.", "At first glance, this sounds great, but it has a downside. If the model is an expert at predicting the targets in the training set it will not be so good at predicting other data.", "To understand this tradeoff first we need to look at the error of a model. In practice, we can split model error into three different components.", "Model Error = Irreducible error + Bias + Variance", "The irreducible error is independent of Bias and Variance. But the last two are inversely correlated, whenever you lower bias, variance will increase. Just like the training error and testing error.", "This error is out of the control of the machine learning engineer who is building the model. It\u2019s an error caused by noise in the data, random variations that don\u2019t represent a real pattern in the data, or the influence of variables that are not yet captured as features.", "One way to reduce this type of error is to identify the variables that have impact on the problem we\u2019re modeling and turn them into features.", "Bias is about the ability to capture the true patterns in the dataset.", "It is mathematically expressed as the squared difference between the expected predicted target values and the true target values.", "So, when you have an unbiased model, you know the difference between the average predictions, as in the expected predicted target values, and the true values is zero. And it is squared to penalize more heavily the predictions that are farther from the true of the target.", "A model with high bias will underfit the data. In other words, it will take a simplistic approach to model the true patterns in the data.", "But a model with low bias is more complex than it should. It will overfit to the data it utilized to learn, because it will capture as much detail as it can. As a consequence, it will do a poor job generalizing beyond the training data.", "You can spot bias by looking at the training error. When the model has a high training error, it\u2019s a sign of high bias.", "To control bias you can add more features and build a more complex model, always finding a balance between underfitting and overfitting the data.", "Variance captures the range of predictions for each data record.", "It\u2019s a measure of how far off each prediction is from the average of all predictions for that testing set record. And it is also squared to penalize predictions that are farther from the average prediction of the target.", "Even though each model you build outputs a slightly different prediction value, you don\u2019t want those predictions to span a big range of values.", "You can also spot variance in your model by looking at the test error. When the model has high test error, it\u2019s a sign of high variance.", "One way to reduce variance is to build the model with more training data. The model will have more examples to learn from and improve its ability generalize its predictions.", "If building a model with more training data is not possible you can , for instance, build a model that incorporates bootstrap aggregating, usually called bagging.", "Other methods to lower variance include reducing the number of features, using feature selection techniques, and reducing the dimensionality of the dataset with techniques like Principal Component Analysis.", "I\u2019ve created a random dataset that follows a fourth degree polynomial with coefficients -5, -3, 10 and 2.5, from highest to lowest order.", "Since we're going to fit models to this data, I split it into training and test sets. The training data looks like this.", "We can start by checking how the complexity of the model impacts bias.", "We\u2019ll be fitting gradually more complex models to this data, starting with a simple linear regression.", "This type of model is definitely too simple, it doesn\u2019t follow the patterns of the data at all.", "We\u2019ll quantify the fit of this model with training and test errors, calculated using mean squared error, and looking at bias and variance.", "Let\u2019s see if using a model complex model really helps drive down bias. We\u2019re going to fit a second order polynomial to this data.", "It makes sense that a second degree polynomial reduces bias, because it is getting closer to the true patterns of the data.", "And we also see the inverse relationship between bias and variance.", "As we increase the complexity of the model again, to a third degree polynomial, we see a slight improve in bias. But variance increased again.", "The plot didn\u2019t change much, but it\u2019s clear when we look at the metrics.", "To summarize this experiment, we could really see the bias-variance tradeoff in action. As we increased the complexity of a model bias kept decreasing, while variance increased.", "Hope you got a better idea of the role bias and variance play when building a machine learning model.", "Your home for data science.
