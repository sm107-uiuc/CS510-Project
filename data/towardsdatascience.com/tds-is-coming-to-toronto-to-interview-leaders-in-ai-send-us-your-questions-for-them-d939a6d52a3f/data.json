We are amping up the series, while opening up the space for the TDS audience to send questions for the upcoming interviewers.", "These can be questions on hiring, day-to-day workflow, internal company projects, or other data topics important to you. that we will collect and curate for the interview day.", "Please list down the questions in the comments section or send them directly to haebichan@towardsdatascience.com.", "Here are four confirmed speakers to be interviewed:", "Azalia is a Senior Research Scientist at Google Brain. Specifically, she\u2019s the co-founder/lead of the Machine Learning for Systems Moonshot at the Brain where she focuses on deep reinforcement learning based approaches to solve problems in computer systems and meta-learning.", "Azalia is an expert on deep learning, with thorough knowledge on newest studies related to neural networks and deep reinforcement models. She has made great contributions to the AI field, particularly through her work on trainable gating networks (Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer) that address the limitations of neural nets to absorb information by the number of parameters.", "During the conference, Azalia will talk about these issues of model capacity, as well as challenges related to deep reinforcement models that learn to do resource allocation.", "Shreyansh is an AI Research Scientist and Technologist at NASA (Computer Vision Group \u2014 Autonomous Systems Division). He helps develop the next generation of intelligent and autonomous robots for Mars and beyond. He does this by building complex yet scalable algorithms that function as the \u201cbrain\u201d of the robots.", "He works with challenging issues of radiation, small amounts of data in machine learning, and dealing with unexpected environments and situations for machines that must adapt to them.", "For his presentation at the Toronto ML Conference, Shreyansh will talk about how machine learning is used for space exploration and the lessons he learned along the way.", "Patrick is the Tech Lead for the ML Engineering team at Zynga, one the largest mobile video game companies in the world. He\u2019s an an expert in the field of reinforcement learning, the algorithm which he uses at Zynga to personalize game experiences. His expertise also lies in distributed computing systems like Apache Spark that support these complicated algorithms.", "For instance, Zynga has utilized Spark to improve internal data pipeline to generate thousands of correctly formatted features without manual input. This is an important accomplishment, as game data (clickstream data) can be extremely messy with different OS from the same game generating their own data schemas.", "Patrick will speak during the conference on how reinforcement learning can solve many business problems, as well as the challenges of using RL in production.", "Chanchal leads the AI team at Google Cloud. He focuses on Financial Services, addressing hundreds of machine learning issues related to top 100 banks, many of whom are Google\u2019s clients.", "These issues include fraud, risk (mitigation, quantifying risks), redacting sensitive data in the Cloud, conversational agents (Google Home), ads and recommendation, and model explainability, which he sees as extremely important from consumer, management, and regulator standpoint.", "For his talk, Chanchal will go into how Deep Learning AI capabilities power many of Google\u2019s key decisions as a secret sauce for improving digital marketing, customer care, manufacturing operations, and many more.", "Again, feel free to write down the questions on the comment section or email them directly to haebichan@towardsdatascience.com!
