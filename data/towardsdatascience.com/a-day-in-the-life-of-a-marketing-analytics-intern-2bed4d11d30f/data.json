I\u2019m over halfway through my summer internship as a marketing automation and analytics intern at a company in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. I\u2019ve had a lot of my fellow peers ask me what it\u2019s really like because many of them had their internships cancelled or moved to an online format.", "The skills I\u2019ve acquired during this internship have been amazing! I did a lot of research beforehand however, and honestly didn\u2019t find that much information on what it\u2019s like to really be in marketing analytics during the day-to-day operations. I\u2019ve enjoyed talking about my experience with my peers, however, I wanted to put my experience on a platform where more people who are curious about what it is like can see for themselves, and show what it is like from the very beginning to the very end of my day. So, let\u2019s get ready to wake up!", "Disclaimer: I am not a full time marketing analytics professional, I am simply relaying my observations of what I did and saw. This is not meant to teach you all the skills and tools used in marketing analytics, as I am still learning. For this information, please check out Towards Data Science. If you are interested in what it\u2019s like to be in a marketing analytics intern or entry-level role, keep reading!", "I typically will wake up around 6:15 AM every morning before the workday. This gives me about an hour to read Medium articles from other amazing writers, and gives me some things to learn in small, manageable chunks! Other than the basic morning routine that we all do, I also make a cup of coffee, because this is a role that requires you to think critically most of the day, and I promise you will get tired at some point! After some coffee, I get changed, pack my bag, and head to work!", "I walk through the doors, find my way to my desk, and get ready for the work day! Here are a couple things that I do at the very beginning of the day:", "In the midst of COVID-19, email and video calls are now the primary method of communication, even while in the office. We are required to wear masks and social distance, but we also try our best to stick to email and video calls if at all possible. During the summer, interns are given two major projects for the whole summer, one in teams where you present a solution to a problem that the executive team gives you, and one where you do a project on your own and present it to your department, which in my case is marketing. I also always try to spend some time with the marketing analyst, and watch him work through a problem and how he approaches it.", "After I\u2019m finished getting ready for the day, I will typically spend some time practicing my Python and analytical skills by applying them to a dataset that the marketing analyst gives me. This is not meant for a client or stakeholder, but is rather a way to solidify what I\u2019ve learned from the marketing analyst that morning. I might whip up a linear regression model using sklearn, try to make my data cleaning more efficient with Pandas, or create quick visualizations with matplotlib. What I\u2019ve noticed is that it doesn\u2019t really matter how you get the job done. It is perfectly acceptable to have Stack Overflow opened on my left screen and a Jupyter Notebook on my right. I have found that analysts are always working on so many different projects, that knowing how to be efficient in your code is the skill to refine as you move through your internship or entry-level position.", "Normally around the middle of the morning, all of the interns will meet via a Zoom call, or a very large conference room that allows for social distancing, and will listen to different speakers from within the company. These speakers are typically Vice Presidents or Senior Vice Presidents, and will talk about their experiences, offer their advice, and allow time for questions. For an entry-level position, the next part of the day would normally start around this time!", "The last thing I will do before lunch is start working on my projects. This is time I cherish because I have found that analysts have lots of meetings and other business to attend to, that when you get to sit down and analyze a project you love, is a very calming part of the day! Today during this time, I began putting a project plan together for my department presentation using the CRISP-DM methodology. I looked at how my project could be of value to the organization, how I will work with the marketing analyst to pull the data from our automation tools, and what the timeline will look like to make sure I get the project done on time.", "We made it to lunch! I include this section in this article because lunch is the only time of day when you get to rest. Being a marketing analytics intern is very fast-paced because we are learning, listening, and also working on our own projects. Lunch is also a great time to meet with the other interns in a casual environment. Many of the interns in the program have become close because we have really built our relationships during times like lunch!", "When I get back from lunch, sometimes I will work on projects, but most of the time, I will touch base with one or multiple members of my intern project team. Today, we finished the last steps of getting our survey data ready for me to analyze. We also talked about how we want to present our data, what interesting things we found just at first glance, and how we can communicate the data we are finding.", "The next thing I will do is spend some more time on my personal projects. During this phase, I spend more time on projects that are in the later stages, as opposed to earlier stages. I try to spend my mornings on planning and executing early-stage tasks, like pulling and cleaning data, and spending my afternoon on late-stage tasks, like analyzing and documenting my work. I do this because I personally have more energy in the mornings, and can do higher-level thinking tasks for longer periods of time, like planning and cleaning, in the morning as opposed to the afternoon. As an intern, I will also help out with any other floating tasks that need to be done for the marketing automation team. This could be anything from pulling basic reports, fixing up email campaigns, or taking some work off the marketing analyst so that they can breathe.", "Marketing automation will typically meet in the late afternoons, so this is when we will do strategy or analytics meetings. Today, we met to discuss our subscribers who have very low activity rates, and how we can further engage them and have them interacting with our content. We will typically have the marketing automation manager, marketing analyst, marketing strategist, and myself, all discussing ways to fix the problem we are trying to tackle.", "At the very end of the work day, I will typically check any last minute emails, check up on my coworkers, and put a plan together for the following day. An important detail about being a marketing analytics intern, or really any analyst, is that you will hardly ever have the same day as the day before. At the company I intern at, there is only one marketing analyst for the whole sixty person department. He is working on everything from content analytics, email performance, social media engagement, or new product strategy. Taking some time at the end of the day to plan for the next is crucial!", "After I get back from work, I will typically spend some extra time working on my own personal analytics skills. This is when I will try to learn new parts of different languages and tools, such as learning new Python packages or SQL functions, reading up on new modeling tools from other Medium writers, or learning new mathematical theories to help better understand the work that I do.", "After I am finished with my personal work, I will spend the rest of the evening relaxing or participating in leisure activities. Contrary to popular belief, being a marketing analyst requires just as much creativity as it does analytical prowess. Giving your brain a break is important to keep the creativity flowing!", "If this was helpful, please let me know! I really enjoy writing about data, and would love to write another article on some of the key takeaways of what I\u2019ve learned from a technical perspective, what you should know if you want to go into an entry-level marketing analytics position or internship, how to snag an internship, and so much more! Stay safe everyone, and have a great day!", "To contact me or recieve more content, follow me on Twitter @BMNAnalytics!", "Your home for data science.
