I\u2019ve spent that 14 months at one company, News UK. I\u2019m now about to embark on a new journey at Deliveroo as a consumer and growth algorithms data scientist, so I thought now would be a good time to reflect on the things that I\u2019ve learned during my time at News UK.", "I can honestly say that I\u2019ve learned loads. Given that it\u2019s my first job outside of academia, this statement may be obvious. But the surprising thing (at least surprising to me) is that the most important things I\u2019ve learned haven\u2019t been the \u201chard skills\u201d in data science. Instead, I\u2019ve found that the most valuable things I\u2019ve learned have been the \u201csoft skills\u201d. I have begun to appreciate that to succeed in any role in a large corporate company like News UK, not just in data science, you have to master the soft skills.", "To illustrate how important I believe these soft skills are:", "I honestly believe that if I worked at News UK only equipped with the skills of SQL, data preparation, linear regression and a logistic classifier, I could be a successful data scientist provided that I completely mastered the soft skills.\u200a\u2014\u200aMe", "Now I know that\u2019s a huge statement but even if you don\u2019t agree with me, you may be able to understand my point of view after reading\u00a0my\u00a0post.", "Being able to communicate with everyone around you is the most important skill for success, no matter how good you are at your craft. Communication is the first step to building a rapport with your team and your stakeholders. Once you have built a rapport with the relevant people it\u2019s much easier to manage expectations,\u00a0get\u00a0requests/favours\u00a0done quickly and many other benefits.", "Things won\u2019t always go smoothly. It\u2019s inevitable that something will go wrong. An example that I experienced was when the analytics dashboard that we had made wasn\u2019t presenting any data for certain articles (this happened more frequently than we\u2019d like). When the stakeholders found out before us it caused problems because the perception was that we didn\u2019t know what the problem was. However, on the occasions that we found out first and let the stakeholders know before they found out, they never got angry. The only request was that we let them know when things would be working properly.", "This doesn\u2019t only apply to stakeholders. Within the data technology team, I found that many of my team members loved when I explained complex data science methods in an easy to understand manner. This isn\u2019t just about being able to explain parameter estimation\u00a0or\u00a0how\u00a0a\u00a0random\u00a0forest\u00a0classifier\u00a0works, but it also includes understanding what is important to the other members. When talking about a data science project it\u2019s important to start by motivating the project with the business problem. This allows you to bring everyone on the same journey of thought you\u2019ve.", "I wouldn\u2019t have had the success that I had at News UK if I wasn\u2019t able to communicate as well as I did and I\u2019ll make sure to improve on this as I continue in my career.", "There\u2019s already been comprehensive research into what makes teams successful. The number one thing being this concept of psychological safety. However, another factor that I feel is very important is empathy.", "I remember having an entire section of a lecture during my data science bootcamp dedicated to empathy. At the time I didn\u2019t really take it in. But now I feel like I can truly appreciate its importance.", "Empathy not only allows you understand your colleagues but also respond to their pain points. And it\u2019s this that can make you a better colleague.", "A simple example of someone not empathising with you as a data scientist would be that a colleague asks you to do some analysis really quickly from a long, unstructured PDF document despite you having a deadline with some other piece of work at the end of the day. This person clearly doesn\u2019t understand the process of analysis, why unstructured PDF documents aren\u2019t necessarily optimal for data analysis, nor do they respect the other bits of work that you have to do. This misunderstanding can lead to frictions in teams.", "There are many different ways that frustrations can arise within teams too. This article titled: Engineers shouldn\u2019t write ETL: A guide to building a high functioning data science department highlights some of the frustrations that can occur between data scientists, data engineers and infrastructure engineers. For example, data scientists write bad code which they expect the engineer to productionise right away. I\u2019ve seen (and done) this several times in my role at News UK. This happens because of a lack of empathy\u00a0and\u00a0understanding.", "Take some time to understand your colleagues. Find out what they do and what their pain points are. Find out what their level of experience is. Knowing these things will help you understand your colleagues. You may be able to proactively help when certain bits of work come your way that will also involve them. Perhaps the data engineer can sit with the data scientist and discuss what good, productionisable code looks like before the data scientist starts writing. The engineer can also explain their process and deadlines so that they set realistic expectations for\u00a0the\u00a0completion\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0work. This is especially useful when senior employees work with junior employees. Notice that good communication leads to empathy.", "I think the majority of people will tell you that if you\u2019re going to develop a product you\u2019ll need to define a metric by which success can be measured. Typically this involves an A/B test to causally determine if the inclusion of the new product/feature has had a positive impact.", "However, despite the fact that the majority of products and algorithms that were produced by the data technology team at News UK didn\u2019t go through this process, the products were still considered successful.", "This is because the products were driving a cultural shift within the company. People had a positive perception of the data technology team and saw us as a team that could create products that would accelerate their progress in achieving their goals.", "I didn\u2019t appreciate this enough\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0time. When the senior members of the company are bought-in it makes the team\u2019s life so much easier. For example, it makes securing funding much easier. Remember, you\u2019ve still gotta play the game of politics.", "There are many more important things that I\u2019ve learned over the past year but I feel these are the most important ones.", "What do you think? Are there important lessons that I\u2019m missing? Do you disagree with any of these? Feel free to continue the discussion in the comments.
