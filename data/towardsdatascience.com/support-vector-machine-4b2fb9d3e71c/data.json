It gives us a better way to understand a non-linear decision boundary.", "Let\u2019s begin by considering a scenario where one might want to classify the following data \u2014", "It is quite evident that the data can be separated into their respective classes using a simple linear decision boundary. However, there are multiple such decision boundaries that can be used to separate the two classes. In fact, there are an infinite number of linear decision boundaries that can be drawn to separate the red and the blue class. Consider the following decision boundaries \u2014", "From the above discussion, we may conclude that we want a decision boundary that is not too close to either of the two classes. To help us find such a line, SVM is used.", "Support vector machine learning algorithm concentrates on those points of both the classes that are close to each other. The idea being that if a classifier does a good job of classifying challenging points it is likely to perform better on the data. SVM does this by looking up for the closest points from both the classes called the support vectors. Once SVM has found its support vectors it will try to find a line that is at maximal distance from these points. In case of two points the perpendicular bisector is the line that is equidistant and therefore at maximal distance from the two points. Any other line will be closer to one point than the other one.", "We can also say that given the support vectors and multiple lines we will choose that line as our decision boundary whose distance is as large as possible from all support vectors.", "So the take away is that SVM tries to find a hyper plane that separates the data into two classes, and while doing so it tries to maximise the distance between the hyper plane and the support vectors of the classes.", "A hyper plane in an n-dimensional space is a n-1 dimensional subset of that space. It divides the space into two separate parts. In case of 1-D space a point is a hyper plane, in case of 2-D space a line is a hyper plane and in case of 3-D space a plane is a hyper plane and so on.", "In a practical scenario data is not as simple as to fit a linear decision boundary to it. Take a look at the following data set\u200a\u2014", "Using line as a decision boundary is definitely a bad choice for the data set.", "The solution here is to transform our 2 dimensional data to a higher 3 dimensional data so as to make it separable. Let\u2019s add a third dimension z as z=x*y.", "The transformation applied here maps a 2 dimensional dataset to a higher 3 dimensional dataset to find an optimal hyper plane. These transformations are called as the SVM\u2019s Kernel Trick. In kernel trick a function is used map data to higher dimension so that the data becomes separable and a decision boundary is found.", "Observe that by applying the kernel all the points of blue class have been confined to the x-y plane and all the points of green class are elevated to the x-y-z space thereby giving us a plane as our optimal hyper plane.", "For the sake of simplicity let\u2019s assume z=1 is the optimal decision boundary. However, SVM will output a hyperplane such that it is at maximal distance from the support vectors of either classes.", "We mapped our 2D data to 3D data by using the transformation z=x*y. Now we will map the decision boundary z=1 from the 3D space to the 2D space. This gives us x*y=1. This is how SVM transforms data and outputs a decision boundary.", "Linear, Radial Basis Filter, Polynomial, Sigmoid, and Laplace are few common used SVM kernels.", "A detailed discussion of kernels is outside the scope of the article. However, lets briefly address the two basic parameters of a SVM model \u2014", "The regularisation parameter addresses the question, how much do you want to avoid misclassifying the training data. A higher value and the misclassification of the training data will be lesser. However, the model may overfit. It is represented by C in sklearn.", "Gamma decides how many examples are to be taken as support vectors. A smaller value means only instances that are closer to the probable hyper plane will be used to further fit it. However, a large value means that the instances which are far from the hyperplane are also used while fitting it.", "At first glance you might think that SVM is similar to logistic regression however the optimal hyperplane is governed by support vectors in SVM as opposed to all the data points which are taken into consideration in logistic regression. Moreover, logistic regression follows statistical approach and outputs probabilities however SVM is backed up by geometric approach. SVM aims at outputing the optimal hyperplane by maximizing distance between support vectors which reduces the error rate.", "It is advisiable to start with logistic regression and then proceed to SVM with linear kernel. Other kernels such as RBF can be tried out further while keeping the track of selected performance metric.", "Here is an example which classifies cancer as either malignant or benign. The example uses SVM with linear kernel and uses accuracy as performance metric. Feel free to try out different kernels and experiment with the hyper parameters of the model.", "SVM has been discussed in detail in the following documentation \u2014", "I hope that the article helped you to develop a fair understanding of the intuition behind SVM and related parameters such as Kernel, Regularisation and Gamma.", "Your home for data science.
