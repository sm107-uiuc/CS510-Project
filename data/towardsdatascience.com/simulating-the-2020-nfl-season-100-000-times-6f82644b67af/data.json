On Thursday night, the NFL returns with the defending champions Kansas City Chiefs taking on the Houston Texans. It is the beginning of a season that many thought we would not see given how this year has played out. But nevertheless, football is back, and we are going to attempt to simulate and predict the outcomes of the entire 2020 NFL season.", "If you\u2019re familiar with how players are ranked in chess then you're familiar with Elo ratings. Elo rating is a simple system that judges teams or players based on head-to-head results, and is the model we used to simulate NFL games for the 2020 season. These Elo ratings are able to forecast the outcome of every game, and generate win probabilities for each team.", "How the Elo model works is that it assigns every team a power rating. Those ratings are used to generate win probabilities based on the difference between the two team\u2019s Elo ratings. Teams increase their Elo rating by winning games and decrease by losing, but by how much depends on the expected result of the game.", "For example, let's take two teams and give them each an Elo rating. Let's say the Dallas Cowboys are versing the New York Giants. The Dallas Cowboys have an Elo rating of 1650 and the New York Giants have a rating of 1400. Since Dallas\u2019s rating is higher we know they have won more games than New York and should be favored in this game. In fact, I can tell you, the Elo model gives them a win probability of 80%.", "Since Dallas is favored to win by a large margin, if they do win their Elo rating will only increase about 5 points. However if New York wins, their Elo rating will increase by roughly 17 points. Elo takes in the level of the opponents and rewards more to the underdogs and less to the favorites. This is to ensure teams with high Elo ratings are winning against teams of their caliber and not just against below average teams.", "If you want to learn more about the in and outs of the Elo model, check out my other article where I actually improved this model that was made famous by the team at FiveThirtyEight.", "With Elo ratings it\u2019s easy to tell the strength of any given team and predict a winner. The Elo model also comes with adjustments that help these predictions become even more accurate by dealing with situations in and outside of the direct game. These certain situations may include; is a team playing at home or away, are they coming off a bye week, how far have they travelled, or are there changes at starting quarterback. Since the schedule for the 2020 season is out, we have all the info we need to predict what will happen over the entire season.", "The NFL season isn\u2019t always definite, teams that should typically blow out others teams sometimes lose. This infers there\u2019s randomness in an NFL season. To integrate this randomness into the Elo model, we use the Monte Carlo Method and simulate the 2020 NFL season 100,000 times, tracking how often each simulated universe yields a given outcome for each team.", "In the end the simulations will show a team\u2019s expected Elo rating, point differential, full-season record and it\u2019s odds of winning its division, making the playoffs, getting a first round bye, and even winning the Super Bowl.", "Find you favorite team down below, and see what the Elo model predicts will happen for your team next season.", "Comment down below your favorite team, and let me know if you think the Elo model got your team\u2019s expected 2020 record correct.", "Your home for data science.
