two things:", "This article will explore DARPA\u2019s AlphaDogFights and the considerable role AI is playing within the highly awaited AlphaDogFight that took place between 18th and 20th Aug 2020.", "Let\u2019s start with a brief background on DARPA.", "DARPA(Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) is a US Department of Defence agency created in 1958.", "The agency focuses on the utilization and implementation of advanced technologies for military purposes.", "Although the DARPA primarily focuses on military tech, the agency has also impacted several widely used technologies such as networking systems and the internet.", "A \u2018dogfight\u2019 is a battle between two or more fighter aircraft and involves strategical manoeuvring, combat and planning.", "Dogfights were widespread in WW1, and the first scenario that involved combat between two aircraft was in Mexico in 1913.", "The DARPA AlphaDogFight is a series of trials that tested the capabilities of AI algorithms executing dogfight manoeuvres, combat and strategies.", "These AI algorithms performance were evaluated in a highly sophisticated simulated aerial environment.", "The first trial of the series was held last year November and the second took place on January 2020.", "Eight teams have taken part in the previous two trials, and the third trial of the series is the final trial that took place this week. The last trial involved each team\u2019s AI agent controlling an F-16 fighter jet in a simulated environment.", "First, it\u2019s a face-off against other AI algorithms, on the second day, the team\u2019s AI agent then face each other. The final day of the third trial saw a simulated dogfight between the top team\u2019s AI agents and a human-controlled F-16 jet, all in a simulated environment.", "The AlphaDogFight is held to find methodologies of developing AI systems that can shift the responsibilities of aerial combat and manoeuvring from the human pilot to the AI system.", "To achieve this grand aim, there has to be a high level of trust in the developed AI controlling system.", "Major industries have transformed through the advent of recent developments in AI.", "Over the decade, there\u2019s been a considerable increase in the automation of systems and vehicles, which have all been enabled through the advancement of fields such as deep learning and reinforcement learning.", "It\u2019s no surprise that we are currently seeing more efforts to direct the promise of AI towards defensive and military programs.", "Let\u2019s dive briefly into how AI is utilized in dogfights.", "Most of the team involved in the DARPA AlphaDogFight trials are developing their AI agents by employing a combination of novel machine learning techniques and knowledge-based algorithms at varying levels.", "Although the internal details of the AI system each team within the AlphaDogFight are not made public, we can deduce the techniques that are utilized by referring to research within the areas of using machine learning and neural networks for air combat and simulations.", "Since the early 90s, we\u2019ve seen research that explored the utilization of neural networks for the task of decision making.", "In the case of dogfights, there have been efforts that have explored the use of neural networks for fighter jets path prediction in aerial based combat.", "In the previous decade, neural networks have been shown to have the capability to learn manoeuvres when equipped with a set of heuristic-based knowledge and expertise.", "More recently, deep learning techniques have provided the capability to solve computer vision task such as object detection, object recognition and tracking in a real-time environment, with high accuracy.", "AI agent within dogfights can be equipped with deep learning techniques that enable the detection and monitoring of an opponent agent.", "Perception within AI agents can be achieved through the utilization of deep learning techniques that can identify and track objects within a stream of pixels from the simulated environment.", "Some AI agent can even be equipped with obstacle avoiding procedures if the environment is perceived through methods such as raycasting.", "Teams within the DARPA\u2019s AlphaDogfight have built an end to end system for their solution; this means that they have developed not only an AI agent that can fly an F-16, but they\u2019ve also developed the simulation environment the AI-agent is trained and developed, amongst other components.", "There was a research conducted in 2014 by academics based in the Netherlands. This research explored the utilization of a machine learning technique known as dynamic Scripting for the development of opponent agent behavioural systems within air combat simulation.", "Dynamic Scripting(DS) is typically found in gaming environments. DS is derived from reinforcement learning, where agents adaptively navigate through a set of predefined behaviours and rules until a goal is achieved.", "Within an air combat simulated environment, you could have enemy fighter jets (Computer Generated Forces) that have the goal of evading or shooting down other agents. These enemy fighter jets will traverse through a set of actions and rules that are have assigned weights which enables the AI agents to learn the optimal behaviours within a scenario.", "Neural networks have proven to be very useful in the development of AI-based systems that can handle the navigation and control systems of aircraft.", "A large portion of the capabilities of AI systems developed for the AlphaDogFight will be around manoeuvres. Artificial Neural Networks have been applied to the creation of AI agents that have adaptive manoeuvring capabilities through the utilization of self-organizing neural networks (Self Organizing feature maps).", "Research conducted by academics Xianbing Zhang et al. showcased the use of Q-networks (derived from Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm) to optimize the search for manoeuvre decisions within air combat systems.", "One of the critical aims of AlphaDogFight is to increase trust in AI-based systems in air combat.", "Shifting the responsibilities of decision making in-flight scenarios from the human pilot to an automated intelligent system is one method of developing trust in AI.", "A pilot has to make high cognitive decisions when flying F-16 or other jet fighters, and there are some notable benefits in reducing or completely relieving the pilot of decision-making responsibilities.", "There are significant efforts within the academic and industrial sectors that are exploring the full applicability of AI systems within autonomous flight systems and air combat systems.", "Regardless of the outcome of AlphaDogFight, you should be aware of the amount of effort and resources that are directed at developing intelligent AI systems for combat.", "There are already some proven methods that depict a future where AI systems can at least handle a significant portion of the roles and decisions that are involved in flight control and air combat systems.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
