Two years ago when I entered graduate school, I never thought I would be able to find a job in the US let alone at FAANG.", "I spent my first 20 years growing up in China and everything was so smooth and as planned. In high school, so many people told me that \u201cwork hard now for the college entrance exam and you\u2019ll be free in college\u201d. That was my only goal and no wonder I panicked when it came to picking a major even if I nailed the exam. In college, I majored in statistics and spent 2 years exploring my interests but still had no idea what I wanted to do. Summer 2016, I took a biostatistics course at UC Berkeley and that\u2019s when the story began. I still remember the day when the Uber driver pointed to me the Facebook campus and the \u201cThumbs Up\u201d sign after we crossed the bay via Dumbarton Bridge. In junior year, I met my then and now mentor who told me the importance of internships. I did two internships as a data analyst before I attended a one-year visiting program in Wisconsin for my senior year and did one more internship as a data scientist after that. I didn\u2019t even know how to code in Python until I went to Madison and that\u2019s when I decided to join engineering school at USC. I started job hunting even before school started and signed an offer in October. Full-time job search this year was so much easier than the internship job search last year since I learned some lessons.", "I\u2019ve been mentoring several undergraduate and first-year masters students. I know most job postings require some years of experience and how hard it is to land a job as a new grad. Here are some tips which could be helpful.", "First things first. I cannot address this enough. \u201cStart early and finish early. Start late and you might never finish it.\u201d This is what I tell my mentees all the time. \u201cThe early bird gets the worm\u201d. Some companies open their internship positions for the next year in the summer nowadays. And they close the opening when it\u2019s filled up. You know internships can lead to full-time positions. Not prepared is not an excuse to procrastinate. Nobody is ever prepared.", "Feeling of achievement, childhood dream, student loans, whatever it is, find something that motivates you. Set goals and crush them.", "After I scheduled the first interview with Facebook last year, I didn\u2019t hang out have fun with friends until it\u2019s done. Because you know how precious opportunities are you don\u2019t want to waste them. As new grads, getting an interview is more difficult than nailing it.", "Make sure you practice interview questions every day. Ask a friend or a professional to help you do a mock interview and ask for feedback. You might find something unexpected you could work on.", "I\u2019m grateful for all the people who have helped me especially my mentor. Industry professionals are the best people who could point out your mistakes and lead your way. In the very early stage, they are not necessarily in your exact role but must be familiar with this industry and willing to help you.", "I know it\u2019s tempting to look at different roles but keep in mind, it\u2019s easier to get one thing done when you focus on it. I used to consider switching to software engineering when people told me it\u2019s the easiest way to find a job in the states. There are also people telling me that whatever career path you pick you would see the brightness in the end. I was confused but then I realized they were not me. I am the one who knows me the best. Switching to CS is not necessarily an easier path although there are times more openings. I should stick to the path I have more confidence and experience in.", "Secondly, data science can be so many things. Business intelligence can be data science, machine learning can also be data science. What is your interest? Make sure you meet the requirements in the job posting.", "In my first internship ever, my everyday tool was Excel and photoshop (Yes. I know). I was scared when I was preparing for SQL which I used a lot in my second job at DiDi. But so what? When I got to know that I needed to do data engineering and UI for my project this summer I actually saw it as a good opportunity to learn new stuff. Who said a data scientist cannot be something more? Learning more outside your comfort zone is always good and sometimes opportunities select you because of it.", "At Facebook and many other companies, it\u2019s required to indicate how the person knows the person they are referring. It makes sense since people tend to hire candidates they are more familiar with and trust. Companies are also more interested in candidates who take initiative and show more passion in them.", "Sign up for LinkedIn if you haven\u2019t done so yet. Keep your profile updated and professional. Headline introduces you in the newsfeed posts which you definitely should expect to hook the readers and make them click to know more about you. Browse your profile as if it\u2019s not yours. Is the headline appealing to you? Are the experience descriptions detailed?", "Other than connecting with recruiters or employees from your dream companies, networking also includes involving in the community. Get surrounded by people who are in the same boat and encourage each other.", "In the era of the internet, you can almost find everything online. Nobody will hand it to you though. On my campus, the career center invites companies to give talks and info sessions every week but only a few students show up. This is associated with tip number 2. As long as you are motivated, you are also thirsty for resources.", "A resume is not a portfolio.", "Python, SQL, Tableau, some of the most common skills listed on a data scientist\u2019s resume. What makes you stand out? Well, showcase your projects and \u201cprove\u201d that you are capable of handling a data scientist role. Without work experience or other evidence, your portfolio speaks for itself. And don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s totally fine to use a website builder if you know nothing about web programming. Last but not least, promote your portfolio. I added two QR codes on the back of my resume, one to my portfolio, the other to my LinkedIn profile.", "I used OneNote to track every job I applied for, every interview I had and every career event I attended. After an interview, write down what you did well, what you could have done better and what was new to you. Don\u2019t blame yourself for the mistakes and move on.", "\u201cLearn from the past, live in the present, prepare for the future.\u201d", "Job search is sometimes a bit of luck. So is everything. As a data nerd, I see it as a game of probabilities. Work towards your goal, increase both \u201cn\u201d and \u201cp\u201d, and never give up!", "Your home for data science.
