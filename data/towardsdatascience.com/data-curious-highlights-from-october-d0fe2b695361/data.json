Each week I found and posted my favourite data-driven stories, datasets and visualisations that I found online (usually via Twitter). My thought was this: if I spend half my day looking for visual inspiration online, then maybe other people would benefit from it too.", "To some degree, I think this hunch was correct. I got some great feedback from Medium readers over the 20+ editions I published, and stored up an extensive archive of creative references in the process. Then I took a break\u2026", "And now it\u2019s back! But in a different format. Data Curious has moved to a weekly newsletter, and it is now more balanced between two things: data things to be inspired by and articles/tutorials to learn from. In both cases, I\u2019m usually looking for things that raise interesting questions.", "We\u2019re a few issues in now, but to commemorate a new beginning I wanted to round up some of the top highlights from October as a sampler. If you want to receive the full weekly edition, sign up here (unsubscribe whenever it stops being useful to you).", "Articles and interesting words on data", "Uzma Barlaskar thinks yes. And by the end of her piece, I think I agree with her. Data should be one of many variables, not the only variable.", "I rediscovered this great write-up from Andy Cotgreave on the inevitable criticism within the data viz community. He sums it up nicely with a universal law:", "\u201cThe longer an innovative visualization exists, the probability someone says it should have been a line/bar chart approaches.\u201d", "So true. But beauty plays an important role in getting people to engage with the data. The key is finding a balance.", "It\u2019s ok to ask \u2014 I still ask most weeks. The trouble with new technologies is that they are plagued with jargon. Consider this article an intro-friendly, jargon-busting explainer.", "\u201cThe purpose of a machine learning algorithm is to pick the most sensible place to put a fence in your data.\u201d", "Data visualisations to be inspired by", "This scrollable data viz seeks to find the impact of social media activity in a beautiful way.", "Here. The NYT broke data viz ground and mapped every single one of them in a series of beautiful, black and white interactive maps.", "Nathan Yau of Flowing Data has come out with a stellar new analysis on the growth in comments on subreddits.", "This exploration of overnight visits to parks is absolutely beautiful. I love the colour choice in this data visualisation, as well as the radial line graphs that capture multiple variables in the data.", "The NYT recently released an article to commemorate the 3rd ever woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics. Take a dive into this dataset to practice some newsworthy analysis.", "This dataset from the Planetary Habitability Laboratory has all the info you could want. You can also check out their page on possibly habitable planets\u2026could make for some interesting visualisations.", "What Works Wellbeing posted an analysis of life satisfaction by occupation. Most surprising finding? Clergy are happiest, despite not making nearly as much as finance professionals. You can download the data with occupation names, mean satisfaction rates and gross annual salary here for further analysis.", "Avid reader? Dive into this dataset of bestsellers from 2011 to 2018 to find the recurring trends in top selling books.", "This comprehensive database from the USDA contains nutrient info on raw, processed and prepared foods. Could be interesting for some analysis on related food groups and nutrients.", "Tutorials and walkthroughs (usually Python related, but not always)", "Chatbots are all the rage. But you don\u2019t have to have all the skills of a full stack data scientist to get started. Just some basic Python and NLTK.", "\u201cDrop that bad data like Obama drops mics.\u201d George Seif has got your back with a nice intro tutorial on cleaning data with pandas.", "This tutorial from the Quant Institute is a helpful starter if you\u2019re starting from scratch.", "This is one of the best starting points I have found for diving in to some tutorials on NLP methods. It includes links to resources on sentiment analysis, tokenization, parts-of-speech tagging and more. Plus it\u2019s written by a dude from IBM\u2019s Natural Language Understanding team, so seems legit.", "That\u2019s it for October.
