Some of the common applications are Image Classification, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, etc. Hence, it is imperative to have a strong knowledge of image processing techniques like image enhancements that include cropping the image, removing the noise present in the image, or rotating the image, etc., to build a better training dataset.", "Image processing techniques are equally helpful for Optical Character Recognition(OCR)", "Image processing techniques increase the interpretability of the image to classify or detect objects present in the image by helping to identify key features or to read text from images.", "Let\u2019s first display the image using OpenCV and PIL", "Reading and Displaying the Image using OpenCV", "If the image is too big, then the window in which the image is displayed will not fit the screen.", "So how do I display the full image on the screen?", "By default, you get a cropped display when displaying an oversized image. To view the full image, you will use OpenCV\u2019s namedWindow(name, flag) to create a new window. The first parameter, name, is the caption for the window and will be used as an identifier. When you set the flag to cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL, then the full image is displayed, and you can resize the window. There are other options for the flag parameter.", "When we resize the image, we change the height or width or both of the image and maintain the aspect ratio. The aspect ratio of the image is the ratio of the image\u2019s width to its height.", "Reading and Displaying the Image using PIL", "You will load the image using open() and then use show() to display.", "image. show() creates a temporary file.", "What if you are interested in identifying edges or other features in an image?", "A grayscale image is used to identify edges. Grayscale images are also helpful to understand contrast or shading gradients present in an image and understand their role to analyze the features of an image.", "RGB images have three channels Red, Green, and Blue, compared to a 2D channel for the grayscale image. There will be less information per pixel for the grayscale image compared to a color image, and hence the processing time for the grayscale image will be faster.", "We are converting a color image to grayscale using cvtColor(), which will save an image from one color space to another.", "convert() returns a converted copy of this image; you use an \u201cL\u201d mode for grayscale and \u201cRGB\u201d mode for color.", "Edge in an image is detected using a canny edge detector. A Canny edge detector uses a grayscale image using a multi-stage algorithm.", "Canny(): the first argument is the input image, and the second and third arguments are threshold1 and threshold2 values.", "Edges with intensity gradient more than threshold2 are considered as the edge and those below threshold1 as non-edges. Non-edges will be removed. Any gradient intensity value between the two thresholds is classified as edges or non-edges based on their connectivity.", "What if the image is skewed or slightly rotated, and you want to deskew the image?", "OCR on skewed text does not work well, and hence we need to deskew. Images can be deskewed using rotate() of OpenCV and PIL.", "rotate() will rotate the image based on the rotationCode, which is specified as the second parameter to the rotate function.", "What if I want to rotate the image by only a specific angle?", "Rotating image based on a specific angle", "In the code below, the image is rotated in increments of 60-degrees using rotate() of imutils", "Here the image is rotated by 110 degrees using PIL", "How to enhance the image quality when it is deteriorated by the presence of noise and impacts the image analysis?", "Noise is an unwanted signal, and in terms of an image, it is a random variation of color.", "Minimizing the noise present in an image using OpenCV.", "There are different methods in OpenCV to remove noise from images.

The threshold for the match is set to 0.95. It localizes the location with a higher matching probability greater than 95% and then draws a rectangle around the area corresponding to the match.", "We have discussed the most common image processing techniques that can be used to analyze images for Image classification, Object detection, as well as OCR.", "Your home for data science.
