Data science blogs are filled with articles about how to handle imbalanced data sets, balance precision and recall, and explain F1 score. These topics are critical for fraud detection systems, but they are well researched and are arguably overcrowded. Seriously, there are enough articles about how to handle an imbalanced data set. Data scientists that are looking for a new challenge should consider some of these less-explored but equally important problems facing large-scale fraud prevention systems. This article will focus on three challenges facing these systems and how data scientists can help.", "Fraud is a moving target. Once you deploy a model, fraudsters will find a loophole. And while you may think that this can just be solved with a better model, it\u2019s important to remember that data scientists are up against sophisticated organizations. For example, this 18-member fraud organization stole $200 million using an elaborate network of e-commerce accounts. These fraud organizations have the time and resources to find a loophole. It is not a matter of if, but when.", "Fraud is a moving target. Once you deploy a model, fraudsters will find a loophole.", "Instead of focusing on building the perfect model, data scientists should focus on identifying when a loophole has been found as quickly as possible. They should focus on building new models as quickly as possible. This is one of the reasons that many large e-commerce companies are still using archaic rule-based systems instead of more sophisticated machine-learning models (check out this list of companies using Accertify, a primarily rule-based fraud management platform). Rule-based models are excellent at handling incremental changes whereas one minor change in a random forest, logistic-regression, or deep neural network can produce entirely different results than the original model.", "Data scientists learn about missed fraud, or false-negatives, in the form of chargebacks. That is, the victim of fraud files a report with their credit card company claiming that there is an unauthorized purchase on their account. The credit card company then informs that merchant of this fraudulent activity.", "By the time data scientists receives feedback on their model, months have gone by and millions of dollars in fraudulent transactions have already been lost.", "However, payment processors such as visa allow their customers 120 days to file a chargeback. By the time data scientists receives feedback on their model, months have gone by and millions of dollars in fraudulent transactions have already been lost. Therefore, data scientists need to find more creative ways to identify missed fraud more quickly.", "When an e-commerce company classifies a credit card transaction as fraudulent, they cancel it. If that transaction was a false-positive, then the company missed out on legitimate revenue and inconvenienced their customer. E-commerce sites like Airbnb are looking for ways to reduce the cost of a false positive for their fraud models.", "The cost of a false-positive is lost revenue and an inconvenienced customer", "One method of reducing the cost of a false positive is to prevent upstream fraudulent behavior. That is, develop classification models that identify fraudulent users before they have the opportunity to complete a transaction. Predicting fraudulent behavior earlier usually comes at the cost of lower precision. However, instead of cancelling a transaction, you are asking the customer to verify their account or reset their password. So the cost of a false positive is not a cancelled transaction, just an inconvenienced customer.", "In order for data scientists to protect companies from financial fraud, they need to do much more than build a model. They need to accept that their model will be broken and when it is, they need to act quickly. In order for sophisticated machine-learning techniques to be widely adapted in the fraud-prevention space, data scientists need to learn how to make incremental changes gracefully.", "Your home for data science.
