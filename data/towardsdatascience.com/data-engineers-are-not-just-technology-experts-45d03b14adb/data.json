However, if this is true, what technology should a Data Engineer focus on? and how does this role survive the evolution of technology?", "Well, I would argue that it\u2019s not so simple, that this role is not just \u201ctechnology-focused\u201d, that there are some core aspects of this role that remained the same over time even though the technologies didn\u2019t remain.", "Data Engineering can involve different technologies depending on the company/team you work and the spectrum can be quite large: Spark, Apache Beam, Step functions, Airflow, Google Dataprep, Kafka, Hive, Python, Java, Scala, Oozie, HBase, Cassandra, Spring \u2026", "For demonstration purposes, I will take two job postings with the title Data Engineer at Amazon, from Linkedin Jobs, and I\u2019ll emphasize the needed technologies in yellow.", "If I were to continue with more examples I could probably fill in the Data & AI Landscape", "As you could guess, nobody, no data engineer could have all these technologies on his CV. Even if somebody did have one-third of them on his CV, would you think that he is an expert on all of them? and if he is not an expert in all these technologies, how can he be technology-focused?", "There are some core software engineering aspects that are shared between different technologies that can help one switch from one to another.", "For instance, both airflow and spark can be written in the same language, python, even though they don\u2019t have the same purpose: spark is used for data processing and airflow is used for workflow management.", "Another language-based example would be the SQL-like language that is used in Hive, Presto, Athena, Postgres, InfluxDB, Impala, BigQuery and SparkSQL\u2026", "Technologies don\u2019t share only languages but core concepts as well, for example:", "Having common links between languages/frameworks/technologies helps engineers switch to newer, more efficient technologies. It is just like using and android phone, if you learned how to use an android one, you will easily figure out how to use an iPhone.", "Technologies, like any other commercial product, appear until a better one comes up and then, if no innovation comes up, they slowly disappear.", "In the data processing field, if we look up the technologies used in 2010\u20132014 for data processing we will see mostly platforms/ERPs like SAP or Oracle.", "Nowadays, data processing is more often done with technologies like spark, hive, kafka and other \u201cbig data\u201d technologies that are running on platforms like AWS or Google. These technologies, allow us to process the data just like before but let us be more flexible, treat more data at a lower cost, process data in real-time, do machine learning in a click, A/B testing and so on.", "Data roles or terms used for people processing and analyzing the data also followed the same \u201clifecycle\u201d: if before we were speaking about ETL developer or Data Integration specialist we are now talking about Data Engineers.", "What changed for this \u201ctechnology-focused\u201d role? The tools have changed, they evolved, they followed the technology lifecycle, but the core aspects of this role remained. The ETL Developer as the Data Engineer has to process the data, do quality checks on the data processing pipeline, extract the data and make it available for other platforms. In terms of coding languages, yes the data engineer has to know at least one programming language but he still has to have an in-depth knowledge of SQL.", "With more data processing tools that a human can handle, a continuously evolving technological stack the Data Engineer is still considered \u201ctechnology-focused\u201d. Of course, the Data Engineer has to use technology to get things done but he doesn\u2019t use technology just for fun, he uses it to collect, store and process the data for a certain use case in an industrialized manner.", "The use case, the data volume and it\u2019s velocity, the data collection frequency, and the data delivery method will help you define the used technologies. For example, a real-time visualization can\u2019t be based on a Hive table, other databases and data processing frameworks are suited for such a use case.", "An industrialized manner implies the fact that a data engineer is usually not responsible for ad-hoc analyses, he is however involved in creating/setting up a platform for people responsible for ad-hoc analyses.", "Last but not least, processing data is done for a specific use case. Therefore the Data Engineer has to understand the business need if you want to avoid the tree-swing case.", "Your home for data science.
