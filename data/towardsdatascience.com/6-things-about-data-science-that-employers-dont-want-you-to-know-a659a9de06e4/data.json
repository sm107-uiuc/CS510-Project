This article is not meant to discourage you, but like any other job, data science as a career has its downfalls. What I believe is important is that you\u2019re made aware of these things so that when you encounter them in your life, it doesn\u2019t hit you like a truck (like it did for me!).", "And depending on your personality and interests, you might not find any of these much of a downfall at all which is a good thing! So with that being said, here are 6 things about data science that employers don\u2019t want you to know.", "The more you read about data science, the more you\u2019ll realize how broad data science. In fact, it\u2019s so broad that there are articles specifically on the different types of data science jobs out there (data scientist, data analyst, decision scientist, research scientist, applied scientist, data engineer, data specialist\u2026 you get the point).", "Furthermore, as it\u2019s a multi-disciplinary field, the term \u201cdata science\u201d covers a wide variety of skills, most likely more than you\u2019ll be able to perfect in your lifetime.", "TLDR: Have an open mind when navigating through your data science journey. It\u2019s not only going to be about building models.", "When I first started my career, I always thought that SQL was a skill that only data analysts used. And because I had that mindset initially, I never appreciated my developed knowledge in SQL.", "This is not the way that you should think about SQL, ever!", "If you are working in a data-related role, whether it\u2019s a data science role or not, SQL is never going to leave you.", "As a data scientist, you\u2019ll need data if you want to build machine learning models, which means you\u2019re either going to have to query your data or you\u2019ll have to build pipelines if the data doesn\u2019t exist yet. And it\u2019s extremely important that you know SQL well so that your data is robust and scalable.", "TLDR: SQL will always be your best friend, so make sure you take the time to be proficient in it.", "If you\u2019ve ever worked with data on Kaggle, the real world is nothing like it. On Kaggle, the data is typically clean, descriptions are provided for each table, and each column and feature names are fairly intuitive.", "This is not the case in the real world. Not only will you not likely have any of the things that I listed above, but you probably won\u2019t have reliable data to start with.", "I wrote an article on 10 times that I had to work with really messy data, but just to give a couple of examples:", "TLDR: A majority of your time is going to be spent on cleaning your data. It\u2019s very unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to jump straight into modelling.", "Whether you like it or not, a data scientist is very much a business analyst. Why? Because you need to have a full understanding of the domain that you\u2019re working in and the business problem at hand. Without this, you\u2019ll miss out on key relationships, assumptions, and variables that could be the difference between a 65% accurate model and a 95% accurate model.", "For example, if you\u2019re a data scientist in the marketing department, it is essential that you fully understand every type of marketing channel, what purpose it serves, where it lies in the marketing funnel, what type of users it typically attracts, and what metrics are used to evaluate that given channel.", "To give an example, trade shows are generally much more expensive than affiliate marketing (CAC\u2019s are higher). However, the LTV of customers acquired from trade shows is also higher. Had you built a model only focused on CAC\u2019s, you may have given incomplete information resulting in no longer marketing through trade shows.", "TLDR: A significant portion of time should be spent understanding the business problem and the domain that you\u2019re working in before diving into any model building.", "In a previous article, I said that it\u2019s better to focus on a few tools and be really good at them. I still stand by that statement, but the sad reality is that your employer(s) will most likely expect you to evolve and learn more tools as you go.", "You should definitely know your basic tools well. This means Python, SQL, and Git, as well as several Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, scipy, scikit-learn, etc\u2026", "However, don\u2019t be surprised if your employers throw new tools for you to learn asap, like Airflow, Hadoop, Spark, TensorFlow, Kubernetes, the list goes on.", "Also, if you switch employers in your career, you\u2019ll likely have to learn a new set of tools because every company has its own desired tech stack, so be wary of this when choosing new employers.", "TLDR: The learning never ends. If you don\u2019t like the sound of that, data science might not be for you.", "This one is more for those who think that being a data scientist means that you can hide in a room building models all day. No matter what any employer tells you, even if they say you can work at home 24/7 or work as a team of one, you\u2019ll be required to collaborate and communicate with other stakeholders.", "Even if you\u2019re a team of one, you\u2019re going to have to communicate with upper management about the work that you\u2019re doing and the tangible business impact that it\u2019s having. You\u2019ll also likely have to collaborate with other teams and business analysts to build that domain knowledge that we talked about a few points earlier.", "TLDR: Data Science requires a lot more communication than you think, and it\u2019s instrumental in being a successful data scientist.", "Through reading this, I hope that I was able to give you some (more) insights and useful advice that will help clear some of the misconceptions you have and also make your data science journey a lot smoother than mine!", "I\u2019ve received really good feedback for my more opinionated data science articles, which is why I wrote this. Like always, take this with a grain of salt if you disagree with anything that I said. But if you enjoyed it, please let me know what else you\u2019d like me to write about.", "I wish you guys the best in your data science journey as always!", "Not sure what to read next? I\u2019ve picked another article for you:", "Your home for data science.
