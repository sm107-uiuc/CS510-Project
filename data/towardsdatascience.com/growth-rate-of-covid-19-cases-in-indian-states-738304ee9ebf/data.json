We are not health professionals or epidemiologists, and the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice. To learn more about the coronavirus pandemic, you can click here.", "The global pandemic due to Covid-19 has now stretched beyond the first half of 2020, with several countries still reporting thousands of cases every day. Data Science enthusiasts across the world have come up with several predictions, dashboards, and visualizations for the same, many of which have been immensely helpful in these unprecedented times.", "Here, I have attempted a state-wise comparison of the rate of positive cases, i.e. to try and detect which states were progressing from a relatively safe zone to a dangerous one (a potential hotspot) and vice-versa.", "An important initial step is to choose an accurate metric of comparison. Simply the number of cases in each state doesn\u2019t make sense:", "However, we should not overlook the possibility of a scenario where a more populous state is conducting a similar number of tests as a much smaller one and thus likely, a similar number of cases too. In such instances, the number of cases/100K population would not be a very suitable metric representative of the true state of affairs, particularly since the scenario of there being a significant difference in testing in different states is pretty much relevant in our country.", "What I have discussed above were only my intuitions and it is not fair to choose or discard influencing variables solely based on that. A regression analysis was done for this purpose:", "\u201cNumber of daily tests\u201d and \u201cPopulation\u201d were the two regressor variables while the number of daily cases reported was the predictor variable. Comparing the R-Squared values after taking the variables into account individually and jointly revealed that \u201cNumber of daily tests\u201d accounted for around 63% of the variation, while \u201cPopulation\u201d accounted for around 11% variation. This is clear evidence that \u201cNumber of daily tests\u201d is the more influential variable (as had been my intuition :D ). Nevertheless, it is advisable not to discard the other factor completely. Instead, giving suitable weights to both of them is the best way: 0.84 and 0.16 respectively (based on the R-squared comparison) and thus combining them into a single new variable.", "Also, I will carry out 3 different visualizations (1 each based on the independent visualizations) and a final one using the weighted variable.", "The source of our data is the following GitHub repository, which is devoted to regularly updating records pertaining to Covid-19 in India: https://github.com/imdevskp/covid-19-india-data", "However, not all the states had sufficient information related to both testing and reporting. Therefore, I chose only those 16 states which had rigid information as well as enough cases to carry out the study. Even in the filtered ones, some of the values were inaccurate or absurd (eg. a negative number of cases; positive cases despite 0 tests, etc). They have been replaced by interpolation techniques.", "The code for the entire process including the visualization (to be shown next), has been documented here: https://github.com/ViperVille007/Growth-rate-of-Covid-19-cases-in-Indian-states", "Choice of date: 22nd April has been chosen as the starting point. From then on, we have access to concrete information regarding the tests conducted as well as the confirmed cases. Moreover, it is a month since lockdown was imposed and by then, there were enough facilities in nearly all the chosen states for testing, thus ensuring homogeneity.", "Smoothing: There are nearly 90 timestamps on offer, and plotting all of them would make things look unnecessarily clumsy and hard to interpret. Also, a few outliers are very much a possibility if we focus on each and every day. I have added mean smoothing to the data on a 7-day window to take care of these issues. 7 seems a reasonable choice because you would expect seasonality to exist on a weekly basis, if it does at all.", "Note: Clicking on the pictures will give you an option of viewing it in higher clarity.", "This is the first of the 3 visualizations we did (the one based solely on the % rate of positive cases with respect to tests conducted).", "The accompanying legend based on the colour scheme pretty much sums things up: In layman\u2019s terms, the closer it is to black, the safer is the condition of that state at that point of time (axis below the plot for reference) and yellow indicates high danger.", "So, this is the one based solely on the number of cases/100K population of each state.", "As you might have already guessed, this plot alone is not a very apt indicator of things (it explained merely 11% of the relationship as we had seen before).", "Without putting much stress on this one, let\u2019s quickly move on to the final plot (which is based on the modified variable I created).", "This is the final visualization plot based on the modified variable (with apt weights from the previous 2 ones).", "Now, let us try and draw some conclusions from this:", "I have now made a bar chart race for the chosen states that show the progress in the form of a video. You can check it out here: https://app.flourish.studio/story/489625/editHere\u2019s a snapshot of the same:", "We can only hope that more and more regions start showing a similar trend as in the aforementioned second point.", "A big thanks to you if you have been patient enough to read through the entire piece.
