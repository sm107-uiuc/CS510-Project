I\u2019m going to start from absolute scratch to show you that you can make data anytime, anywhere.", "Here are some perennial denizens of my larder, arranged on my floor.", "This photograph is data \u2014 it\u2019s stored as information that your device uses to show you pretty colors.

That\u2019s pretty much the reason we collect data. If we could remember and process it flawlessly in our heads, there\u2019d be no need. The internet could be one hermit in a cave, recounting all the tweets of humankind and perfectly rendering each of our billions of cat photos.", "Because human memory is a leaky bucket, it would be an improvement to jot the information down the way we used to when I went to school for statistics, back in the dark ages. That\u2019s right, my friends, I still have paper around here somewhere!

Take a moment to realize how glorious it is to have a universal system of writing that stores numbers better than our brains do. When we record\u00a0data, we produce an unfaithful corruption of our richly perceived realities, but after that we can transfer uncorrupted copies of the result to other members of our species\u00a0with\u00a0perfect\u00a0fidelity. Writing is amazing! Little bits of mind and memory that get to live outside our bodies.", "When we analyze data, we\u2019re accessing someone else\u2019s memories.", "Worried about machines outperforming our brains? Even paper can do that! These 27 little numbers are a big lift for your brain to store, but durability is guaranteed if you have a writing implement at hand.", "While this is a durability win, working with paper is annoying.

The abracadabra actually works! So let\u2019s upgrade from paper to a computer.", "Spreadsheets leave me lukewarm. They\u2019re very limited compared with modern data science tools. I prefer to oscillate between R and Python, so let\u2019s give R a whirl this time around.

You only know those things because you were exposed to them, not because they\u2019re universal laws.

One reason I love programming is that it\u2019s a cross between magic spells and LEGO.", "If you\u2019ve ever wished you could do magic, just learn to write code.", "Here\u2019s programming in a nutshell: ask the internet how to do something, take the magic words you just learned, see what happens when you adjust them, then put them together like LEGO blocks to do your bidding.", "The trouble with these 27 numbers is that even if they\u2019re sorted, they don\u2019t mean much to us. As we read them, we forget what we just read a second ago. That\u2019s human brains for you; tell us to read a sorted list of a million numbers and at best we\u2019ll remember the last few. We need a quick way to sort and summarize so we can get a handle on what we\u2019re looking at.", "With the right incantation, we can instantly know what the median weight is.

There are all kinds of summary options: min(), max(), mean(), median(), mode(), variance()\u2026 try them all! Or try this single magic word to find out what happens.", "By the way, these things are called statistics. A statistic is any way of mushing up your data. That\u2019s not what the field of statistics is about \u2014 here\u2019s an 8min intro to the academic discipline.", "This section isn\u2019t about the kind of plotting that involves world domination (stay tuned for that article). It\u2019s about summarizing data with pictures. Turns out a picture can be worth more than a thousand words \u2014 one per datapoint and then some. (In this case we\u2019ll make one that\u2019s only worth 27 weights.)", "If we want to know how the weights are distributed in our data \u2014 for example, are there more items between 0 and 200g or between 600g and 800g? \u2014 a histogram is our best friend.", "Histograms are one way (among many) of summarizing and displaying our sample data. Their blocks are taller for more popular values of the data.", "Think of bar charts and histograms as popularity contests.", "To make one in spreadsheet software, the magic spell is a long series of clicking on various menus. In R, it\u2019s faster:", "Here\u2019s what our one-liner got us:", "On the horizontal axis, we have bins (or tip jars, if you prefer). They\u2019re set to 200g increments by default, but we\u2019ll change that in a moment. On the vertical axis are the counts: how many times did we see a weight between 0g and 200g? The plot says 11. How about between 600g and 800g? Only one (that\u2019s the table salt, if memory serves).", "We can choose our bin size \u2014 the default we got without fiddling with code is 200g bins, but maybe we want to use 100g bins instead. No problem! Magicians-in-training can tinker with my incantation to discover how it works.", "Now we can clearly see that the two most common categories are 100\u2013200 and 400\u2013500. Does anybody care? Probably not. We only did this because we could. A real analyst, on the other hand, excels at the science of looking at data quickly and the art of looking where the interesting nuggets lie. If they\u2019re good their craft, they\u2019re worth their weight in gold.", "If these 27 items are the everything we care about, then this sample histogram I\u2019ve just made also happens to be the population distribution.", "That\u2019s pretty much what a distribution is: it\u2019s the histogram you\u2019d get if you applied hist() to the whole population\u00a0(all the\u00a0information you care about), not just the sample (the data you happen to have on hand). There are a few footnotes, such as the scale on the y-axis, but we\u2019ll leave those for another blog post\u200a\u2014\u200aplease don\u2019t hurt me, mathematicians!", "If our population is all packaged foods ever, the distribution would be shaped like the histogram of all their weights. That distribution exists only in our imaginations as a theoretical idea \u2014 some packaged food products are lost to the mists of time. We can\u2019t make that dataset even if we wanted to, so the best we can do is make guesses about it using a good sample.", "There\u2019s a variety of opinions, but the definition I favor is this one: \u201cData science is the discipline of making data useful.\u201d Its three subfields involve mining large amounts of information for inspiration (analytics), making decisions wisely based on limited information (statistics), and using patterns in data to automate tasks (ML/AI).", "All of data science boils down to this: knowledge is power.", "The universe is full of information waiting to be harvested and put to good use. While our brains are amazing at navigating our realities, they\u2019re not so good at storing and processing some types of very useful information.", "That\u2019s why humanity turned first to clay tablets, then to paper, and eventually to silicon for help. We developed software for looking at information quickly and these days the people who know how to use it call themselves data scientists or data analysts. The real heroes are those who build the tools that allow these practitioners to get a grip on information better and faster. By the way, even the internet is an analytics tool \u2014 we just rarely think of it that way because even children can do that kind of data analysis.", "Everything we perceive is stored somewhere, at least temporarily. There\u2019s nothing magical about data except that it\u2019s written down more reliably\u00a0than\u00a0brains\u00a0manage. Some information is useful, some is misleading, the rest is in the middle. The same goes for data.", "We\u2019re all data analysts and always have been.", "We take our amazing biological capabilities for granted and exaggerate the difference between our innate information processing and the machine-assisted variety. The difference is durability, speed, and scale\u2026 but the same rules of common sense apply in both. Why do those rules go out the window at the first sign of an equation?", "I\u2019m glad we celebrate information as fuel for progress, but worshipping data as something mystical makes no sense to me. It\u2019s better to speak about data simply, since we\u2019re all data analysts and always have been.
