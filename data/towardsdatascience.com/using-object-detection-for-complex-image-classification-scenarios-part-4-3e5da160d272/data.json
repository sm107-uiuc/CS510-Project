Traditionally this is a very manually intensive task, the ideal pipeline couples tagging with model training to enable active learning.", "The Visual Object Tagging tool VoTT provides end to end support for generating datasets and validating object detection models from video and image assets.", "The section below will briefly highlight the progression of Region Proposal Object Detection that will be used for this task. For a more in depth tutorial I strongly recommend the following Medium Series by Jonathan Hui", "The last two posts in this series dealt with image classification. The simplest way to transform an image classifier into an object detector is to use a series of sliding windows of different dimensions across a given image.", "If we classify that there is an object we are looking for in a given window, then we can return the dimensions of the captured object.", "Unfortunately the sliding window approach, while simple, has a couple of drawbacks. It is slow to evaluate multiple window sizes and it is imprecise since we don\u2019t know in advance what the correct window size should be for each object in our image.", "Instead of using sliding windows across an entire image what if we could perform classifications only on the regions of interest that may contain an object. This is the main intuition behind region proposal object detectors. Traditionally we use an algorithm called selective search to propose thes Regions of interests.", "While the traditional RCNN approach works well in terms of accuracy, it is very costly to compute since the Neural Network has to be evaluated for each region of interest.", "Fast R-CNN addresses this drawback by only evaluating most of the network (to be specific: the convolution layers) a single time per image. According to the authors, this leads to a 213 times speed-up during testing and a 9x speed-up during training without loss of accuracy.", "Faster R-CNN builds on previous work to efficiently classify object proposals using deep convolutional networks. Compared to previous work, Faster R-CNN employs a region proposal network which does not require selective search for candidate region proposals.", "RetinaNet is an object detector that builds off the intuition of Faster RCNN it provides feature pyramids and on optimized focal loss that enables faster evaluation time than FasterRCNN and provides a focal loss that helps prevent overfitting the background class. At the time of this article RetinaNet is the current state of the art region proposal network.", "VoTT can be used to generate direct datasets that can be used with Azure Machine Learning to train custom object detection models.", "However since training RetinaNet requires access to N-Series GPU machines, for the purpose of time and to ensure that this tutorial is CPU only, I have taken the liberty of pretraining models. In the next post we will discuss how to train these models with the Azure Machine Learning Service.", "Challenge: Can you think of way we could use these boxes to tell that the policy is invalid?", "Now that we have an object detection model for finding bottles lets develop a heuristic to determine whether a shelf is properly stocked and test it on two sample images.", "Our heuristic will work as follows:", "Normally to apply this to our entire dataset we would use batches since we are trying to save memory we will evaluate one image at a time.", "We can see that using object detection with a good heuristic can out perform the Custom Vision Service for certain tasks. However it\u2019s important to think about the trade offs and work required to annotate our data and build an object detection model.", "The next post in this series will review how to train your own object detection model the Cloud using Azure ML Service with subsequent posts will address deployment.", "If you have any questions, comments, or topics you would like me to discuss feel free to follow me on Twitter if there is a milestone you feel I missed please let me know.", "Aaron (Ari) Bornstein is an avid AI enthusiast with a passion for history, engaging with new technologies and computational medicine.
