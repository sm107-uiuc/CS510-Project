Kubernetes is used to automate deployment, scaling and management of containerized apps \u2014 most commonly Docker containers.", "It offers many features critical to stability, security, performance, and scalability, like:", "Kubernetes has become the standard for infrastructure management in the traditional software development world. But Kubernetes isn\u2019t as popular in the big data scene which is too often stuck with older technologies like Hadoop YARN. Until Spark-on-Kubernetes joined the game!", "When support for natively running Spark on Kubernetes was added in Apache Spark 2.3, many companies decided to switch to it. The main reasons for this popularity include:", "On top of this, there is no setup penalty for running on Kubernetes compared to YARN (as shown by benchmarks), and Spark 3.0 brought many additional improvements to Spark-on-Kubernetes like support for dynamic allocation. Since Spark 3.1 (March 2021), Spark on Kubernetes has been officially declared as generally available and production-ready!", "Read our previous post on the Pros and Cons of Running Spark on Kubernetes for more details on this topic and comparison with main alternatives.", "You submit a Spark application by talking directly to Kubernetes (precisely to the Kubernetes API server on the master node) which will then schedule a pod (simply put, a container) for the Spark driver. Once the Spark driver is up, it will communicate directly with Kubernetes to request Spark executors, which will also be scheduled on pods (one pod per executor). If dynamic allocation is enabled the number of Spark executors dynamically evolves based on load, otherwise it\u2019s a static number.", "This is a high-level choice you need to do early on. There are two ways to submit Spark applications to Kubernetes:", "We recommend working with the spark-operator as it\u2019s much more easy-to-use.", "The steps below will vary depending on your current infrastructure and your cloud provider (or on-premise setup). But at the high-level, here are the main things you need to setup to get started with Spark on Kubernetes entirely by yourself:", "As you see, this is a lot of work, and a lot of moving open-source projects to maintain if you do this in-house.", "This is the reason why we built our managed Spark platform (Data Mechanics), to make Spark on Kubernetes as easy and accessible as it should be. Our platform takes care of this setup and offers additional integrations (e.g. Jupyter, Airflow, IDEs) as well as powerful optimizations on top to make your Spark apps faster and reduce your cloud costs.", "Shuffles are the expensive all-to-all data exchanges steps that often occur with Spark. They can take up a large portion of your entire Spark job and therefore optimizing Spark shuffle performance matters. We\u2019ve already covered this topic in our YARN vs Kubernetes performance benchmarks article, (read \u201cHow to optimize shuffle with Spark on Kubernetes\u201d) so we\u2019ll just give our high-level tips here:", "Let\u2019s go through an example. Suppose:", "Then you would submit your Spark apps with the configuration spark.executor.cores=4 right? Wrong. Your Spark app will get stuck because executors cannot fit on your nodes. You should account for overheads described in the graph below.", "Typically node allocatable represents 95% of the node capacity. The resources reserved to DaemonSets depends on your setup, but note that DaemonSets are popular for log and metrics collection, networking, and security. Let\u2019s assume that this leaves you with 90% of node capacity available to your Spark executors, so 3.6 CPUs.", "This means you could submit a Spark application with the configuration spark.executor.cores=3. But this will reserve only 3 CPUs and some capacity will be wasted.", "Therefore in this case we recommend the following configuration:", "This means your Spark executors will request exactly the 3.6 CPUs available, and Spark will schedule up to 4 tasks in parallel on this executor.", "Advanced tip:Setting spark.executor.cores greater (typically 2x or 3x greater) than spark.kubernetes.executor.request.cores is called oversubscription and can yield a significant performance boost for workloads where CPU usage is low.", "In this example we\u2019ve shown you how to size your Spark executor pods so they fit tightly into your nodes (1 pod per node). Companies also commonly choose to use larger nodes and fit multiple pods per node. In this case you should still pay attention to your Spark CPU and memory requests to make sure the bin-packing of executors on nodes is efficient. This is one of the dynamic optimizations provided by the Data Mechanics platform.", "This is an absolute must-have if you\u2019re running in the cloud and want to make your data infrastructure reactive and cost efficient. There are two level of dynamic scaling:", "Together, these two settings will make your entire data infrastructure dynamically scale when Spark apps can benefit from new resources and scale back down when these resources are unused. In practice, starting a Spark pod takes just a few seconds when there is capacity in the cluster. If a new node must first be acquired from the cloud provider, you typically have to wait 1\u20132 minutes (depending on the cloud provider, region, and type of instance).", "If you want to guarantee that your applications always start in seconds, you can oversize your Kubernetes cluster by scheduling what is called \u201cpause pods\u201d on it. These are low-priority pods which basically do nothing. When a Spark app requires space to run, Kubernetes will delete these lower priority pods, and then reschedule them (causing the cluster to scale up in the background).", "Spot (also known as preemptible) nodes typically cost around 75% less than on-demand machines, in exchange for lower availability (when you ask for Spot nodes there is no guarantee that you will get them) and unpredictable interruptions (these nodes can go away at any time).", "Spark workloads work really well on spot nodes as long as you make sure that only Spark executors get placed on spot while the Spark driver runs on an on-demand machine. Indeed Spark can recover from losing an executor (a new executor will be placed on an on-demand node and rerun the lost computations) but not from losing its driver.", "To enable spot nodes in Kubernetes you should create multiple node pools (some on-demand and some spot) and then use node-selectors and node affinities to put the driver on an on-demand node and executors preferably on spot nodes.", "The Kubernetes Dashboard is an open-source general purpose web-based monitoring UI for Kubernetes. It will give you visibility over the apps running on your clusters with essential metrics to troubleshoot their performance like memory usage, CPU utilization, I/O, disks, etc.", "The main issues with this project is that it\u2019s cumbersome to reconcile these metrics with actual Spark jobs/stages, and that most of these metrics are lost when a Spark application finishes. Persisting these metrics is a bit challenging but possible for example using Prometheus (with a built-in servlet since Spark 3.0) or InfluxDB.", "The Spark UI is the essential monitoring tool built-in with Spark. It\u2019s a different way to access it whether the app is live or not:", "The main issue with the Spark UI is that it\u2019s hard to find the information you\u2019re looking for, and it lacks the system metrics (CPU, Memory, IO usage) from the previous tools.", "Since March 2021 and the Apache Spark 3.1 release, Spark on Kubernetes has been officially declared as production-ready and generally available.", "The most exciting feature is the ability for Spark to anticipate executor spot kills (by listening to the termination notice cloud providers give ahead of time) and migrate shuffle files and cached data from the executor which is about to die to an executor which is going to survive. This feature is called [SPARK-20624] Better handling for node shutdown. and it is illustrated in the GIF below.", "The second main improvement is the ability to mount shared NFS volumes in Kubernetes (a network-backed storage that can be shared by all your Spark apps and be pre-populated with data), and the ability to dynamically provision PersistentVolumeClaims (instead of statically), which is particularly useful if you\u2019re trying to run Spark apps with dynamic allocation enabled.", "Check out our blog post covering Spark 3.1 release to dive deeper into these improvements, and a general tour of the new Spark 3.1 features.", "We hope this article has given you useful insights into Spark-on-Kubernetes and how to be successful with it.", "If you\u2019d like to get started with Spark-on-Kubernetes the easy way, book a time with us, our team at Data Mechanics will be more than happy to help you deliver on your use case.
