This scholarly data can be in the form of scientific publications, books, teaching materials, and many other scholarly sources of information. Over the course of time, these information sources start to build complex relationships among them through citation, co-authorship, and lead to the formation of Big Scholarly Networks which become increasingly challenging to decode.", "In this context, Scholarly Network Analysis (SNA) is the study of this scientific research network aiming to discover meaningful insights to implement data-driven research decisions.", "Important points of analysis in a Scholarly Network", "Considering SNA on raw graphs as depicted in Figure 2, there are at least seven points of interest:", "Co-authorship\u00b2 network analysis can be used to find the scientific collaboration between authors, depicting how individual scientific ideas of authors can get together through collaboration to cause an explosion of scientific findings.", "2. Documents referencing each other (Citation networks)", "3. Documents cited together (Co-citation networks)", "Citation and co-citation network analysis are used to find relationships between cited papers and a set of papers which cite those papers. This proves useful in community detection which is one of the fundamental tasks of network analysis\u00b3.", "4. Documents citing other documents in a similar way (Bibliographical coupling)", "Bibliographic coupling also consists of citation analysis to find documents which refer to a common third cited work in their bibliography\u2074.", "5. Content clusters in document sets (Topic networks)", "Extracting topics from the underlying network are useful to discover the current research areas as well as their evolution through time.", "6. Word clusters occurring together (Co-words)", "Co-word analysis\u2075 helps to identify the relationships between topics in the specific research field through finding the co-occurrence of key-words.", "7. Diversity of types and relationships (Heterogeneous networks)", "Heterogeneous network analysis\u2076,\u2077 involves the study of two or more coupled networks. Eg. Discovering citation evolution over time or future citation through coupling co-authorship and citation networks.", "So how can one start with Scholarly Network Analysis?", "Based on the divide and conquer approach, the first starting point for SNA is to narrow down and create a manageable scholarly network graph from the Big publication network. This scholarly graph can be created with a focus on our current research field Eg. Databases, Data Science, Robotics, Energy, based on the information curated from scholarly databases, available academic graphs Eg. DBLP\u2078 as the bibliographic database for computer science, Microsoft Academic Graph\u2079. This further requires a formulated designed approach to curate the final scholarly graph to be analyzed. One can consider a starting point which may include beginning from a foundational research paper node, transitively crawl the related nodes to form the scholarly graph.", "Once we have created the final graph, the next step includes formulating the research questions to be answered and correspondingly designing the entry point for the analysis. There can be various entry points based on the information required from the data. Some of them include discovering the underlying topics in the networks, analysis based on citation counts or the author\u2019s affiliation information.", "Figure 3 depicts an overview of one such SNA carried out on a subset of database publication network named as Codd\u2019s World, with the scholarly graph created starting from the foundational paper of Edgar Codd on relational databases\u00b9\u2070 and utilizes the entry point to discover underlying topics in the network (Topic Modeling) to drive further analysis based on the topics and their evolution in the database community publication graph. Additionally, some other example SNA studies utilizing different entry points include analyzing the citation relationships to evaluate the impact of a given paper or an author\u00b9\u00b9 or studying co-author behaviour to identify the scientific community distribution\u00b9\u00b2.", "This article serves as an introductory article to the topic of Scholarly Network Analysis with insights shared from the scientific SNA research work publication Codd\u2019s World: Topics and their Evolution in the Database Community Publication Graph authored by Rutuja Shivraj Pawar, Sepideh Sobhgol, Gabriel Campero Durand, Marcus Pinnecke, David Broneske and Gunter Saake, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg Germany", "[2] Tze-Haw Huang and Mao Lin Huang.
