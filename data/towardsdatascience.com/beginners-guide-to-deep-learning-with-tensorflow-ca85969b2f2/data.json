This is largely due to its support for multiple languages, Tensorflow is written in C++, but you can interact with it through Python, Javascript, Go and R. In addition to its flexible architecture and scalability (models can be trained on both GPU\u2019s and CPU\u2019s and deployed through a web service, desktop application or on a mobile device).", "This article is a complete beginners guide to this tool. It is not meant as an in-depth introduction but instead is designed to get you up and running to develop your first deep learning model.", "In my opinion, it is difficult to find deep learning tutorials that don\u2019t include a lot of complexity and heavy math. I personally learn best by acquiring enough knowledge to build a model that works and then learning more of the complexity as I use the method to solve more complex problems.", "This tutorial is designed to demonstrate basic usage of TensorFlow with a not overly simplistic data set (to demonstrate some of the complexities encountered in a real-world machine learning problem) and give enough theory to be able to build something yourself and then develop that knowledge further with more complex articles and courses.", "Before we start building a model with TensorFlow I will briefly introduce the concept of neural network-based algorithms as it is a good idea to have a basic understanding of this concept first.", "TensorFlow was primarily built to develop very scalable neural network-based models. Neural networks, often known as artificial neural networks (ANN\u2019s), are a subset of machine learning (known as deep learning) loosely based on the way that biological information processing and communication nodes work.", "A deep neural network (DNN) is a specific form of artificial neural network, used within Tensorflow, consisting of a number of layers between an input (features) and an output (target or predictor). As the model is trained mathematical computations are performed through each layer calculating a probability that the features represent a specific output or label.", "In the rest of the article, we are going to walk through an example of using TensorFlow for a classification task. We are going to use a data set taken from the openml.org website called \u2018credit-g\u2019. This consists of a number of features of customers for a banking company and a class which denotes if the customer is found to be a good or bad credit risk.", "We can use another machine learning library, Scikit-learn to directly import the data set into a Python development environment. I am using Jupyter Lab. In the code below we also rename the column labelled \u2018class\u2019 to \u2018target\u2019 to be more consistent with TensorFlow naming conventions and convert this to numeric data as TensorFlow cannot process string data for the target variable.", "Data sets from Openml.org tend to use the Pandas specific data type \u2018category\u2019 for categorical columns. As TensorFlow will not recognise this data type we need to perform one additional step to convert the columns with the data type \u2018category\u2019 to \u2018object\u2019.", "Next, we split the data into a train, test and validation set.", "TensorFlow cannot take a Pandas dataframe directly. Instead, we need to map the columns in the dataframe to features that can be used to train the model. TensorFlow has a method known as tf.data which is used to build input pipelines for different data types.", "In TensorFlow you will often work with batches, which are relatively small samples of data to be processed. The below code creates a function to map the dataframe to a tf.data object in batches (this is taken from the TensorFlow documentation).", "The data set we are working with contains a number of different feature types that will need different transformations. For example, we have some categorical features such as the \u2018personal_status\u2019 column and some numeric columns.", "In TensorFlow, we can apply the necessary transformations and encode them as feature_columns which are fed to a feature layer which will become the first layer of our neural network. This layer will convert each example of this training data into a single Tensor as a first step in the network.", "To use columns as features in a Tensorflow model we need to use the feature_columns methods. There are a number of different feature_column methods that will perform different transformations and feed the transformed features to the model.", "For our data set, we will use three different transformations.", "The code below starts by creating an empty list called feature_columns to which we will append the different feature column types. The first transformation uses one-hot-encoding via the feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list method to transform the categorical features.", "We then use the feature_column.bucketized_column method to transform the \u2018age\u2019 column to bucketed groups.", "Finally, we use feature_column.numeric_column to create the feature columns for the remaining numerical data.", "Now we can use the feature_columns to create the feature layer to use in our neural network.", "We can now build the neural network and train and evaluate the model with data in the feature layer. In the code below we are building one of the most common types of models called a sequential model. This is a stack of layers starting with the feature layer.", "The second and third layers are known as activation layers. On a basic level, each activation layer takes the inputs from the feature layer and multiplies them by the weights in each node. The most commonly used type of activation function is known as a rectified linear activation unit (ReLU) which is specified in each activation layer in the code below.", "In the model.compile code we specify the algorithm type as \u2018adam\u2019, other available optimizers can be found here.", "The performance output from the trained model is shown below.", "Both the number of layers in the network and the number of nodes within each layer (the number 128 in the two activation layers in the above model) affect the performance of the model. One way to enhance the performance is, therefore, to experiment with different numbers for these elements. Additionally, as with other machine learning algorithms, other optimisations include hyperparameter tuning, feature selection and enhanced feature transformations.", "This article gives a basic introduction to using TensorFlow to solve a classification task. If you want to explore some of the concepts discussed the fastai course practical deep learning course for coders is very good and free.", "The complete notebook for this tutorial can be found here.", "I send out a monthly newsletter if you would like to join please sign up via this link.
