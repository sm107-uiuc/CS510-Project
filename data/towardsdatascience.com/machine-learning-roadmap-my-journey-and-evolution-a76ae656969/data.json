If someone in the strategy, business or IT consulting, doesn\u2019t know at least the basics of it then I guess they are pretty much redundant.", "To keep up with the waves two years back, I decided to get acquainted with machine learning and deep learning.", "Many of us want to make a career change to machine learning/AI or come from non-science background hence find it challenging to gain the requisite knowledge. In this article, I am going to share my journey and evolution with resources which helped me to gain knowledge in this area. I hope it will provide insight and help you to structure your learning path.", "I studied mechanical engineering 20 years ago. Engineering degree prepared me to think systematically in a rational way. I did advanced calculus and linear algebra in my engineering my I forgot most of the concepts over the years. It became evident very soon that I need to learn a number of things as a pre-requisite even before starting to learn ABC of the machine or deep learning.", "I didn\u2019t have the energy to read the mathematics textbooks, hence to revise I watched the videos on linear algebra, calculus and probability on Khan Academy and MIT open courseware. I will especially recommend the lectures by Prof. Gilbert Strang.", "I zeroed down to python as my primary programming language because of the vast libraries and developer support.", "Once I have revised the mathematical concepts, then I started with Python. I have done programming before with C language, and I was already aware of the concept of looping, conditional statement etc.", "I found the book \u201cPython Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming \u201c by Eric Matthes very helpful to get a grasp on syntax and basic concepts. The other book which I used to hone my basic python skill is \u201cAutomate the Boring Stuff with Python, 2nd Edition: Practical Programming for Total Beginners\u201d by Al Sweigart.", "After gaining a sound footing on python, I focussed on the trinity of python package for machine learning, i.e. NumPy, pandas and matplotlib/seaborn.", "All three packages official documentation are very well written and easy to understand even for beginners. I started by NumPy and then moved to Pandas and finally to matplotlib/seaborn to get an idea on data visualisation.", "It took me around 2 months with approx.3 hours reading to come until this point. I have never learnt statistics before that point, and my entire knowledge of statistics was limited to mean median and mode.", "I found the book \u201cThe Art of Statistics: Learning from Data\u201d by David Spiegelhalter very helpful. It not only helped me to know statistics in a non-mathematical way but also helped a lot in term of data science visualisation. It taught me the way we can communicate different messages based on the same data points based on varying data visualisation.", "Armed with the conceptual understanding of basic statistics, I read the book \u201cPractical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python\u201d to build programmatic hands-on knowledge.", "After three months of studying the pre-requisites finally, I was ready to start learning machine learning. If I can name one book which has accelerated my learning and explains the concepts from beginners to advanced level, then it is \u201cHands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems\u201d by Aurelien Geron.", "Once you follow the learning path as I mentioned above from python to pandas and matplotlib, then there is not a single line in this book which you cannot understand. The complete hands-on approach in this book without the mathematical jargon is very helpful for people who do not have advanced mathematical knowledge.", "It took me a total of six months to reach the intermediate level machine learning proficiency and another two months to understand the basics of deep learning.", "Key takeaways and learning from my journey", "Machine learning and data science stands proficiency stands on the firm knowledge of the following areas", "Do not be on haste to start machine learning libraries and books without having a firm grasp in these libraries. Thorough knowledge in these areas will make your machine learning swift and enjoying.", "Start your machine learning with easier and well-known algorithms like linear regression. Do not try with a most complex less known algorithm to appear knowledgable and impress others.", "Scikit-learn is a very powerful and versatile machine learning library. It is also very userfriendly from a beginner perspective and one of the most well-documented libraries available. I will strongly recommend to start with Scikit-learn and spend a considerable amount of time to get acquainted before moving to other libraries.", "Get yourself acquainted with machine learning before dipping your toes into the deep learning world. Rushing to deep learning without having a good understanding of machine learning is not going to help in the long run.", "Start with Keras library for deep learning and you can park the TensorFlow for later.", "Finally, make use of free learning resources available on Coursera and Edx on the machine and deep learning.", "I hope readers who are staring their machine and deep learning journey gain some insight on the learning approach from my journey outlined in this article and would be able to structure their learning path.", "I am interested to know the learning maps, key resources and approach of other proficient and student of machine learning.", "Your home for data science.
