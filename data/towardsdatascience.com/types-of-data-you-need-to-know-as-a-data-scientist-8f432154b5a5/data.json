Like biological sciences is a study of biology, physical sciences, it\u2019s the study of physical reactions. It is the process of using data to understand different things, to understand the world. Data science is a field about manners to extract data from various forms of whether it is unstructured or structured form. It\u2019s a multi-disciplinary field that brings together concepts from computer science, mathematics/ statistics, and data analysis.", "The heart of data science is to always ask questions. Data Scientist is always in need to be curious about the world.", "\u201cIn the next 10 years, data science and software will do more for medicine than all of the biological sciences together\u201d. Vinod Khosla", "Back in the years following World War II, there was a rise in the number of deaths because of lung cancer, scientists and doctors did not agree on a specific reason, and no one considered the hypothesis of cigarettes can be the reason because at that time everyone smoke. In Britain, the data and details of all the doctors were written in a central register (including: Smoker?; Alive/death?, and if he\u2019s dead, the reason of death?) so unintentionally, we have huge data that they can manipulate to predict and understand this phenomenon. So Bradford Hill and Richard Doll started to manipulate this data, extracting the doctors who died from lung cancer, and see if they were smokers. The result was so clear, 100% of people who died from lung cancer, during the past 29 months, were smokers. So Data Science isn\u2019t new, what is new is the vast quantity of data available from massively varied sources.", "There are many paths to a career in data science; most, but not all, involve a little math, a little science, and a lot of curiosity about data.", "Big Data: No precise or universal definition can be given to Big Data ...

It is also classified based on its source:", "Semi-Structured Data: The line between unstructured data and semi-structured data has always been unclear since most of the semi-structured data appear to be unstructured at a glance. Information that is not in the traditional database format as structured data, but contains some organizational properties which make it easier to process. For example, NoSQL documents are considered to be semi-structured, since they contain keywords that can be used to process the document easily.", "Quantitative Data: Numerical.
