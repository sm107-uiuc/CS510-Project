Since then, I\u2019ve navigated my career via trial and error. Today, I\u2019m sharing the below data science career ladders (linked to at the bottom of this article), a culmination of my hard-knock learnings and research, with the hope that they are useful to the broader community, leaders, and new data scientists. These have been battle-tested at companies, and pressure-tested by peers and Human Resources.", "To date, and to my knowledge, they are the first set of publicly-available data science career ladders.", "As an end-to-end data scientist, now running product on a data science platform, I\u2019ve often found myself in conversations with peers on the meta evolution of data science. And, as someone navigating the rapidly-changing field early in her career, the lack of publicly-available resources felt almost personal. I took the unanswered question with me from industry to grad school and then to business school, hoping I\u2019d put the issue to rest in conversations with peers from other industries. Instead, I found that my gnawing need was a pervasive gap across the broader data science industry.", "Last year, I spent a couple hundred hours reading tens of career pathways in engineering and product, studied books and blogs on how the field had evolved in the last two-and-half years, and iterated half a dozen times on the below set of career ladders.", "These draw upon a wide range of other available ladders, including twelve engineering career pathways from tech organizations like Rent the Runway and Google. In particular, I owe a huge shout-out to the excellent thought leadership from Etsy on this topic. These ladders have been pressure-tested with my peers in data science, refined with four human resources employees, and battle-tested at my own organization for over a year and a half. Happily, I\u2019ve also seen them used as a launching pad for a number of professional mobility conversations.", "The ladders here fill four specific needs that exist in data science today:", "Measuring progress and success after you implement these ladders will be determined, in part, by your organizational structure (upon which a good deal has been written).", "Beyond this, success of these ladders will roughly fall into three areas: 1) retention, 2) hiring, 3) mobility, proxied through manager-report conversations on career growth and development plans. Metrics in each of these will not tell a full picture, and it\u2019s worth noting that nearly all are longer-term, lagged indicators.", "There are three salient challenges worth flagging upfront. The first, addressed above, is the lagging \u2014 and often nebulous \u2014 nature of measuring success in implementing these ladders. Culture shifts are inherently hard to measure.", "Second, the category of \u201cImpact and Influence\u201d can be difficult to track, with individuals\u2019 impact not necessarily mapping nicely to levels. This is where creative alternatives will be most useful: SquareSpace, for instance, uses project management and domain knowledge as a close analog.", "Finally, implementation in non-tech-first companies will be difficult. But this, I postulate, is a necessary process change. Firms that are pivoting towards tech (but are not quite there yet) provide opportunities for disruptive innovation, and have become increasingly attractive to data scientists looking to leave their mark or create impact beyond the world of high-tech. In these environments, a core component of what an individual\u2019s \u201ccareer success\u201d looks like is likely still inextricably tied to the company\u2019s \u201cold\u201d ladder.", "To me, this is a worthwhile hurdle for leaders to dedicate their time and energy towards overcoming. Separating people processes and supporting mobility and growth is a key step in enabling such companies to become truly data-driven. Though difficult, this challenge is not insurmountable; these ladders should help.", "You can find the ladders here.", "*A special thank you to Josh Laurito and Jeremy Singer-Vine for their encouragement and feedback in getting this piece off the ground!", "Your home for data science.
