While governments take action to flatten the curve, statisticians and epidemiologists take up the task of predicting how far it will spread. A survey of experts conducted on March 30th and 31st included estimates between 141,000 and 1,000,000 total cases by April 5th. But why was the gap in the estimates so wide?", "This article explores the basic concepts behind models used in forecasting the spread of infectious diseases, like COVID-19 (no background in math required).", "Every predictive model comes with a set of assumptions. We\u2019ll call these the basic set-up of the model. Here, we\u2019ll take the SIR model as our example. The rules are:", "Rule #1: We model the infection in a population of size N, where N does not change.", "Rule #2: Each person in our population can only be in one of three states at a time:", "Rule #3: People can only transition through these three states in order. From S, to I, to R.", "We will use these letters as a short-hand for the number of people in the population that belong to each category. For example, if we are modelling a population of 100 people, and we assume that on day one only one person is infected, we would describe this as:", "The shorthand above could be an accurate description of the current situation. However, the number of people in each group changes over time. Take the following graph as an example of how an infection might spread through our hypothetical population of 100:", "Our previous short-hand notation for the number of people in each category doesn\u2019t tell us much without a reference to time. We make a minor improvement to add clarity:", "In general, we note this down as I(t), where t stands for time (a number of days, in this case). We can describe the number of susceptible and recovered people in the same way:", "Normally, we plot all three lines on the same chart and present our model like so:", "Now that we have the basic set-up of our model, how can we use it to make predictions? Put another way, what makes the difference between the following two models?", "The difference can be explained by two main factors:", "There are two parts to determining how quickly a disease will spread.", "The first is how contagious the disease is. Think of this as the chance that a susceptible person will become infected if they are exposed to an infected person. This is referred to as the transmissibility of the infection. If the transmissibility is 0.5, that means that there is a 50/50 chance. If it\u2019s 0.25, then there is a 1 in 4 chance, and so on.", "The second is how often people in the population come in contact with each other. The more frequently an infected and susceptible person come in contact with each other, the more likely it is that the susceptible person will become infected. This is referred to as the \u201caverage rate of contact\u201d.", "How fast the infection spreads depends on the transmissibility and the average rate of contact. When we put these together, we get the transmission rate. Infectious disease will spread faster if the transmission rate is high.", "transmission rate = transmissibility * average rate of contact", "While a person is infected, they can infect others. Once they have recovered, they can no longer infect anyone or get reinfected (remember the rules of our set-up?). A long recovery time has two main consequences. The first is that each infected person will have a longer time to infect others. The second is that it will be more likely for many people to be infected at the same time.", "Take the following example. Let\u2019s assume that each infected person comes in contact with 10 susceptible people per day. If it only takes one day to recover, that\u2019s only 10 chances to infect another person. If it takes 10 days, that\u2019s 100 chances to spread the infection. Now, let\u2019s assume that there are 50 people in the infected group at the same time. There are now 5,000 chances per day to spread the disease.", "How long it takes a person to recover is referred to as the \u201crecovery rate\u201d. An infectious disease will spread faster if the recovery rate is lower (i.e. if it takes longer for a person to recover).", "Now we have all the pieces to put a working model together.", "With this information, we can make our predictions for how many people will fall in each group, and how this will change over time.", "As the infectious disease spreads, the number of susceptible people will decrease. We model this with the following formula:", "There are two changes to the number of infected people with time. The number grows as more people move from susceptible, and it shrinks as people recover. We need to model both parts here.", "If you\u2019ve made it this far, take a brief moment to reflect on what you have just covered. Introducing the math for a brief moment:", "Remember, each predictive model comes with a set of assumptions. There is no perfect model. While SIR has its strengths and forms the root of many other compartmental models, it also has its limitations. Here are a few to bear in mind:", "The transmission and recovery rates define the basic reproduction number \u2014 a key variable in these compartmental models.
