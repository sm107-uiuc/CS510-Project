All of them nice and bold, just like us skimmers like it.", "If you have a couple of minutes to spare, though, I think there\u2019s some relatability to be found in these words. I\u2019ll try making it as light a read as possible. I can be funny. People trying to sell me stuff find me hilarious. Keep in mind this is a life story of sorts, so bear with me a little.", "\u201cJust give me what I want and nobody gets hurt\u201d", "- VOX, Bono. And probably you right now.", "The practical advice can be found under What I learned and Job seeking resources I used. You\u2019ll find these things that worked for me:", "To know oneself is probably one of the greatest, most rewarding challenges we get to face through life. The sooner we truly understand all of us are constant working drafts, the sooner a lot of pressure is taken off our shoulders. You won\u2019t be immune to comparing yourself to others, but at the very least you\u2019ll remember that fact fast enough to make an easier transition to caring less and being kinder to yourself.", "I\u2019m not trying to be Dalai Lama here, but the true, ground-breaking discovery I made in my life was myself. I was lucky in finding my better half and life partner that catalyzed it, but it is through therapy that I\u2019m constantly rediscovering myself.", "As an introvert, I have unknowingly and criminally undervalued the power of true communication for 27 years of my life. The price I paid for not telling others who I am was my understanding of myself, even though I was completely oblivious to this very fact.", "Let\u2019s roll back 16 years to a 13-year-old, very skinny Rodrigo. My dad worked in IT infrastructure. He came home one day, installed a very early version of Visual Studio (a sort of platform for developing applications) on our computer, taught me some programming logic, and told me to have fun with it.", "I have no idea what kind of kid that made me, but hell, did I have fun with it.", "Programming is an art form. You have ideas, you write code. That code doesn\u2019t work, so you swear under your breath and seek answers until you correct that. Then, you move to the next piece of code. You get stuck. You cuss louder this time. Repeat the process quite a few times and you have yourself a small fortune in a swear jar and, luckily, a piece of working software. And maybe a neighbor telling you to shut up. You get the point. It feels like magic, and I was hooked.", "I liked coding so much I managed to learn it before StackOverflow even existed. StackOverflow to programmers is pretty much what Wikipedia is to students or drunk people trying to prove a point during an argument. Imagine that.", "Two years later, I was in a technical, IT-focused high school having a blast with 4 or 5 programming languages. I was eager for an opportunity to start working, and it helped that having an internship counted points towards my technical diploma. A chance to work in one of the country\u2019s biggest banks came my way, so I took it. The only problem was that it wasn\u2019t anywhere in the IT ballpark \u2014 it counted credit towards my diploma anyway, don\u2019t ask me why.", "I worked there for 2 or 3 years. Then another bank realized I had banking experience and offered me a temporary job when I got in college. I took it. Then another company looked at what I\u2019d done and thought I could be smart, and brought me in an analytical role. This was kind of the logic for the next 10 years. I embraced data analytics. I did code, create things, redesign processes, but it was mostly all on the side. The important thing in those jobs was crunching numbers and making fancy PowerPoints that sought to diplomatically relay the message that the fiscal year\u2019s sales targets were doomed.", "I was invited to create the analytics department at a multinational company at one point. In a given year, I delivered an average of 4 reports and macroeconomic studies a week to people in 7 countries. I\u2019d be in the office by 7 AM and back home by 10 PM after a 90-minute commute. I drove pretty big projects that ended up generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue that wouldn\u2019t otherwise exist \u2014 and even got a couple of pats in the back for them.", "A huge part of my personality is about creating things. Building applications, exploring new possibilities, driving intelligence in new ways. On at least a couple of occasions, I developed data applications only to have it shot down with office politics, right before it came up and running in another country, under another flag, and someone else taking credit for it.", "My region, even with what I\u2019d consider expressive numbers for a regular company, represented less than 1% of the worldwide revenue. I\u2019d work 12 hours a day for a few kind words and an underwhelming paycheck, best-case scenario ending the year with half a month\u2019s salary that they\u2019d call a performance bonus. I\u2019d be drilled weekly on at least four different occasions for the sales performance, even though I had no part in it. At one point, my job became Excel filling and PowerPoint creating more than anything else, and I would bend myself backward to make the local story fit the global story for the sake of politics. I had to relay messages I did not believe in all day long.", "After a while, believe it or not, I burned out.", "\u201cHello, my new manager! This is what I do, this is how the company works. Now, will you please fire me?\u201d", "This pretty much summed my first conversation with my new manager, assigned to my team in early 2019. I was straightforward. I wanted to dive deeper into Data Science, to which I needed full-time dedication if I wanted to get anywhere, and I needed my severance package to do it. That part was a no-go because of a thousand company policies \u2014 hey, at least I tried.", "I hit the breaks on over-delivery. I did what I had to do and that was it. My mental exhaustion and the feeling of underappreciation made it really hard to get out of bed some mornings. The new manager was easily among the top 3 best professionals I worked with in 12 years, which made things a little easier, but the damage was already done. It was a fact that I needed to get out of there eventually.", "I got in a 5-month data science boot camp. I started doing data science stuff for work even though it wasn\u2019t quite ready for it.", "Revenue planning is made with a global Excel template! What do you mean there are better ways to get results than just pretending we know how things are? Just sell what I tell you to sell!", "Welp, I did it, anyway. I worked on classification models, revenue models. I even programmed a bot in Python to scrape the web for some information I\u2019d use in my weekly reports. I had a ton of fun doing that, but it didn\u2019t match my job description at all. On second thought, it kind of did, but the status quo reigned supreme. I just had to take the experience somewhere that actually liked doing greater things rather than say it\u2019s part of their culture.", "I know I\u2019m coming strong here. I don\u2019t wish to seem ungrateful for all the great things I was enabled to do by great managers and a culture that actually gave me the freedom to do what I felt was right, but eventually, I got too overworked creating improvements that would be shut down for no reason other than \u201clet\u2019s keep things how they are\u201d, and nice words will only get you so far.", "I got burned out to such a point and I was a shadow of my previous self, and probably everyone in the department knew it.", "Eventually, I was fired. I got my severance package. I don\u2019t remember having smiled so much in a day as I did then. Everyone was expecting it, I was expecting it. I was cut on a Friday, and then the team and I went out to celebrate with hamburgers and beer \u2014 my awesome manager included. Times were good. I had the love of my life beside me, money in the bank to study full time, and data experience to make the transition a lot easier. The first thing I did, though, was take a nice month-long vacation to refill the batteries.", "During the next three months, I studied linear algebra, algorithms, and differential calculus \u2014 you know, that fun stuff everyone looks forward to in school. Had I known I\u2019d walk down this path, I would have gotten a STEM degree in college. Instead, I became a business administration bachelor, so that\u2019s pretty much 5 years worth of math to catch up with. Thanks a lot, younger me! Anyway, back to the subject.", "At some point, I started thinking about how to deliver this data sciency thing in a user-friendly manner. Believe it or not, people don\u2019t usually like having to understand unlabeled data below a handful of code. Go figure. And if you\u2019re a data scientist and you\u2019re reading this, I just didn\u2019t want to present notebooks.", "So I started studying software development, coming across those technologies I had learned 15 years ago, now newly shaped and on steroids. Lots of steroids.", "I started playing around with it, especially a framework called React. I fell in love with development all over again. I started creating full-fledged applications every week. I bounced to a new project every time I found something new to learn. I took a look at job openings for developers. The quantity was overwhelming. I realized I could probably just say \u201cscrew this\u201d and start over in software development. And so I did.", "It was a risky move. I expected to land a data science job within a month or two. My severance package wouldn\u2019t last much longer than that. I realized I\u2019d be more than happy taking a data science position, as I\u2019d develop applications to deliver the data products, anyway. Everything was looking beautiful, merging two worlds I loved into one.", "I completely bought the full career change. I developed my website, my re-branded identity.", "Two years before, I was contemplating a mass of openings in data science and analytics I had never seen before. The thing I was working on definitely had a hype train going on, and I was about to ride it.", "Once the pandemic hit, these opportunities dried up. Suddenly, my only choices were trying to compete in positions that asked for 5 years of experience in machine learning alone, or go into uncharted territory as a professional software developer. I was a professional with 12 years in the market and if you\u2019re to judge by the job ad description, no experience in any of my options. I became a pretty tall blob of insecurity, applying like crazy to openings to which I minimally met the requirements. It was not like I didn\u2019t have the experience, but the expectations out there are absolutely insane.", "At times, I would have no companies paying attention to me. Then, I\u2019d be interviewing for 9 positions at once. A week later, it was like it never happened. My bank account was consistently drying up and my anxiety hit record high levels with the uncertainty.", "At least once a week I\u2019d skip all meals over a 36-hour period, wake up after snoozing for a couple of hours and get to coding at 3 AM. I\u2019d be mentally exhausted at sunrise, and unable to sleep as my mind was racing.", "This went on for 3\u20134 months, approximately. During that time, I coded, studied, frustrated myself. I redesigned my approaches to things more times than I care to count. However, I\u2019m still a data guy, so here is what it boiled down to:", "For a lot of the applications I didn\u2019t get interviewed for, but I did get warm messages from the job posters or people involved. In quite a lot of cases, it was a matter of very specific requirements or technical impossibility of hiring me because they couldn\u2019t have international contractors (at least not ones without a U.S. visa, even though the positions were fully remote \u2014 that seems to be a thing more often than not).", "I\u2019m writing this on November 6th, 2020. So far, I have been \u201chired\u201d 5 times. One company ran out of money to effectively hire me, one converted the full-time position into an on-demand one (I may work anywhere between 0 and 160 hours a month, which does not help me at all), two went completely dark claiming they\u2019d have to make some advancements to actually bring me on.", "To manage in the meantime, I put myself out there as a freelancer. I managed to land a handful of gigs and being paid in U.S. dollars in a country with a pretty devalued currency truly helped. The average paid to offshore developers by U.S. companies ranges between $25-$50 an hour. Here, in Brazil, it ranges between BRL 20\u201350 an hour. Pretty close, isn\u2019t it? Except that USD outweighs BRL nearly 6 to 1.", "That means getting that handful of gigs actually got me through a decent period of time. Not as much as I\u2019d like, but they paid most bills.", "Fortunately, however, a few days ago I signed with the fifth and most recent company that approached me, ending a journey of switching from Strategic Planning Specialist to Data Scientist to Software Developer in roughly 11 months.", "I might\u2019ve had experience with coding, but I never truly had the work titles to show for it. I had little time publishing public code. Once I crafted a cover letter that shared a little of what I\u2019m sharing with you on this article, where I\u2019m coming from, what I love to do, and what I\u2019m willing to do, I started getting an avalanche of replies.", "I applied on Upwork alone 56 times, got 8 interviews (6 of which I declined because the job descriptions were poorly written and didn\u2019t reflect reality), and landed 1 of them. If you compare with the stats for the full-time jobs I applied to, it isn\u2019t that different, but the outcomes are very much so. If you land a full-time job, that\u2019s it. You know how much you\u2019re making by the end of the month.", "Landing a gig will pay you a fraction of what a full-time job would, and you\u2019ll have to make another sale if you want to get another week\u2019s pay (depending on the length of the project, obviously).", "Chances are, you\u2019ll have to be grossly underpaid to earn yourself a 5-star rating, and only then you\u2019ll get better responses to your bids. The made people in these freelancing platforms claim it gets easier the more you work, and you can get ever raising rates, which makes it a pretty attractive way of life \u2014 but be prepared for a tough start.", "I was practically hired back in May. Interviews and screenings that were supposed to be weeks apart were cut short to a day or two. People were legitimately excited in our conversations, talking plans for my role a year from that point. But then, the position was relying on them closing a contract. Or the budget for it was never secured. I learned the hard way that reality will burst your bubble without hesitation.", "I have a serious problem being on the receiving end of things. My better half and my parents reached out to me several times, assuring me they\u2019re here for me emotionally and financially if need be. I had to remind myself that I wasn\u2019t slacking and that they were all in betting on my passion alongside me, and thus it was fine to have support eventually.", "This is what surprised me the most. You need coding skills both in software development (well, duh) and data science. However, I was surprised to find you can get by in most interviews and get to the offer phase without writing a line of code as long as you talk the talk of a veteran, verbally demonstrating experience and mentioning things you did in the past, troubles you ran into.", "A few weeks ago, I had a call with the tech lead of a tech company. I was absolutely sure I was going to be drilled with questions of code and infrastructure optimization, why use a framework instead of another, and so on. It turned out to be one of the most philosophical conversations I\u2019ve had out of my inner circle in a while, where the code side of things was merely a detail once I mentioned what I enjoy working with.", "Bear in mind this is not an incentive to not be prepared, but you surely don\u2019t have to lose sleep dashing through HackerRank challenges to be a decent candidate.", "Most job boards will show you how many people applied to that position in the past two weeks or months. Just think of the odds that your application will even reach someone\u2019s hands.", "Apply through the official ways and go contact the decision-maker directly. If you\u2019re applying for a data analyst position, get on LinkedIn, and search for the data analytics manager in that company. Send a message, a simplified version of the cover letter I mentioned in the first topic. LinkedIn will allow you to attach your resum\u00e9 to the message. At the very least, you\u2019ll get a better chance.", "Network. I know this advice is everywhere, but that is so for a reason. And it\u2019s way easier said than done. During my Data Science boot camp, I was in a bad place. I didn\u2019t put myself out there, I didn\u2019t really connect with people. My struggles with merely getting out of bed to go to work and making it through the day mentally exhausted me to a point where I just couldn\u2019t be anywhere near my best self.", "Either way, I\u2019m still in a group chat with the class, several months after the conclusion. Someone shared an opening they\u2019d received for a software developer. I applied and thanked him for sharing that in the group. Not two days later, he reached out to me, asked how I was doing, and asked for my resum\u00e9 so that he could share with a group of startups he was in. I got two interviews off this.", "I don\u2019t think we ever exchanged more than a dozen words during those five months. There was nobody to vouch for me. He could easily say that he didn\u2019t know me. Even worse, I was mentally in a dark place and showed little to none of my capabilities \u2014 he had all the reasons to do nothing more. Yet, he went out of his way to get something to happen for me.", "Imagine if I had connected with him.", "An incredible mass of international job openings is in the United States. That means they usually require a working visa or residence in the country for you to even be considered \u2014 even when it\u2019s purely remote, for whatever reason that is.", "Websites like Jooble, Glassdoor, and Indeed will be heavily featured when you search for jobs, but those will be 99.99% directed towards U.S. citizens and residents. LinkedIn sucks for finding remote opportunities, so I won\u2019t even bother listing it. Here are some you can use to escape the trend:", "This has easily been the most enlightening year I had in my life. I threw away a pretty conservative self to seek what has been my passion in the first place, whatever shape it comes in. It cost me sleepless nights, skipped meals, and a couple of anxiety attacks, but I can nearly safely say I made it.", "I understand all of us will confront our conscience at least once about the life choices we made. It\u2019s pretty easy to feel insecure. We have to decide most things about the directions we\u2019ll take in life before we are even legally allowed to have a beer.", "It\u2019s okay if you\u2019re having doubts. Connect with yourself, trust who you see inside and make a plan to meet that person.", "Despite all the difficulty, if there\u2019s one thing I can assure you with the experience is that no bad can come from knowing yourself better, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong in raising a little hell to make this whole experience at least a little better for yourself.", "Just a hard-learned hint, though: if you\u2019re planning on making a move, try to be as sure as you possibly can that the world isn\u2019t ending in that timeframe.", "Your home for data science.
