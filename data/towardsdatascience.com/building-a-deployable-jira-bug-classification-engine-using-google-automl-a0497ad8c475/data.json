The various AutoML tools reside together with other GCP tools like Cloud Storage, App Engine etc much like how the pyramids reside together with the rest of the city of Giza.", "In the first article in this series, I detailed how I built a Jira bug classification engine using Tensorflow. In the follow-up article, I described a step-by-step approach to using Amazon\u2019s BlazingText to build and deploy a similar engine. In this article, I detail the steps to do the same using Google\u2019s AutoML.", "As in the previous article, I will be using the data-set found in [1].", "My personal objectives for doing this were the following:", "As in the previous article, you can find the notebooks and data files in Gitlab:", "I\u2019ve created a folder AutoML/textClassification to store the files in this project.", "As most of the steps to build this classification engine is via the UI, I\u2019ve put all the steps in the Google Colab notebook GCPAutoMLDataPrepTrainEval.ipynb found in the Gitlab repo.", "I would probably not do a whole lot of justice in explaining what AutoML in any depth here so I\u2019ll refer you to a video for that (see [2]).", "In a nutshell: remember when you did Machine Learning using Scikit-learn or Tensorflow? What you would do would be to try several different models and sets of hyper-parameters. This whole process could be automated and that is essentially what AutoML does.", "So in this case, what you need to do is (and similar to BlazingText), you\u2019ll need to format the training dataset into a format that the particular algorithm class (in this case text classification) will accept and then let AutoML do the rest.", "There are several GCP (Google Cloud Platform) tools used for this project:", "Author\u2019s note: if you have an interest to pick up Machine Learning on GCP, I highly recommend Coursera\u2019s Data Engineering, Big Data, and Machine Learning on GCP Specialization online course. It is self-paced and there are lots of labs that come free. There is also a YouTube series on basics of GCP that you can find here [3].", "One thing great about GCP is that they actually give you $300 of service free when you start out. So if you just want to dip your toes into it, this is a big incentive. To find out more see https://cloud.google.com/free.", "For those familiar with GCP this is a no-brainer: just navigate to the the GCP console and look for \u201cNatural Language\u201d under \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d on the side menu.", "For those new to GCP, you will need to:", "When you reach \u201cNatural Language\u201d you will see:", "Click on the \u201cGet Started\u201d link on \u201cAutoML text and document classification\u201d section. The page you will see is the \u201cData Set\u201d page.", "It took me a while to figure out what was the way to format the training data after I clicked on the \u201cNew Data Set\u201d link, selected \u201cMulti-label classification\u201d. and tried to import the CSV file. Turns out the system needs the data in another format.", "This I found out by clicking on a tooltip (ie. the \u201c?\u201d) after selecting \u201cUpload zip file from your computer\u201d. This is what is says:", "I decided to use the first approach. Here is the code I used to convert my CSV to this format (you can find it in the notebook as well):", "The next part was downloading the documents.zip and uploading to AutoML for processing. This can take some time but the nice thing is that they will send you an email once completed.", "Once processed, you will see something like this when you click on the \u201cItems\u201d tab:", "What\u2019s great is that you can click on \u201cView Label Stats\u201d to see the distribution of the labels etc and you can review the data as well. I personally really liked this about the tool.", "To kick off training, just click on the \u201cTrain\u201d tab and click \u201cStart Training\u201d. This will take a few hours to run as it is searching for the best algorithm and hyper-parameters. You will get a email when the task is completed.", "Once the training is done you\u2019ll see something like this:", "Click on \u201cSee full evaluation\u201d and you\u2019ll see something like this:", "You can select each label on the left to see the precision and recall metrics. One thing I really like about this is they actually list out the true positives, false negatives and false positives for you to do some kind of analysis.", "This couldn\u2019t be more straight-forward. Click on the \u201cTest and Use\u201d tab and click \u201cDeploy model\u201d.", "Author\u2019s note: make sure to delete the model when you\u2019re done as you will get charged if you keep it running.", "Once the model is deployed you can take your model for a spin (pun intended). There are a number of ways to do this and Cloud Natural Language provides a few ways of doing that.", "The first is just to type in some text and let the model predict:", "Next boiler plate code is provided below (sh and python). You can do it on your own machine or open a Google Cloud Shell for that.", "For this I used Google App Engine. This is fairly straight-forward.", "First navigate to App Engine on the Google console. Then look for the Quickstart guide. Select Python on the \u201cStandard environment walkthrough\u201d and follow the steps to clone the boilerplate sample code in Cloud Shell.", "Under the \u201cappengine\u201d folder you will see the following 4 files:", "Next, what I did was to use the test Python code to merge it with the sample AppEngine code:", "You can test this locally (or on google cloud shell) by running:", "First you need to create the app (I did this on google cloud shell):", "Once the app is deployed, you will see the App Engine app URL on the screen. You can then use curlto test it out:", "One of the objectives of this exercise was to evaluate to see how the model generated by AutoML compares with BlazingText in the previous article. As I already had the test data set created for BlazingText, I just needed to use it again.", "Here is the code I used", "This is close to the BlazingText result.", "As in the BlazingText article, I also used the Zookeeper data set to evaluate the model.", "(the NaNs are due to division by zero as some of the labels do not exist in this data-set)", "This is also similar with what was obtained using BlazingText.", "Overall this was my impression after using GCP\u2019s AutoML Natural Language Classifier.", "[1] Jira Social Repository, Marco Ortu et al https://github.com/marcoortu/jira-social-repository", "[3] Welcome to Google Cloud Platform: the essentials of GCP, Google Cloud Platform, https://youtu.be/4D3X6Xl5c_Y", "Your home for data science.
