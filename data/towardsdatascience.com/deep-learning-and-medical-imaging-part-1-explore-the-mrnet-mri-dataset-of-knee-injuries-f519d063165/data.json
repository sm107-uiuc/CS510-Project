So I set myself a personal challenge: learn about one medical application, implement it, and share it.", "In my joyful pursuit of data, I came across MRNet: a knee MRI dataset collected by Stanford ML Group to study knee injuries. The dataset is available upon written request and is accompanied by a research paper that the team published. In a nutshell, the work proposes a neural network architecture that detects 3 types of knee injuries with a very good performance.", "Spoiler alert \u26a0\ufe0f here\u2019s what it will look like", "In this project, we will specifically focus on Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tears which are the most common knee injuries among top athletes in soccer or basketball.", "ACL tears happen when the anterior cruciate ligament is either stretched, partially torn, or completely torn. The most common injury is a complete tear.", "Symptoms include pain, a popping sound during injury, instability of the knee, and joint swelling.", "There are around 200,000 ACL tears each year in the United States, with over 100,000 ACL reconstruction surgeries per year.", "To diagnose knee injuries we typically use Magnet Resonance Imaging.", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to form a picture of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body.", "MRI is used to diagnose how well you responded to treatment as well as detecting tears and structural problems such as heart attacks, brain injury, blood vessel damage, etc.", "Here is an animation of a head MRI:", "An MRI scan is not a single image of an organ. It\u2019s a set of different images or slices stacked together in a volume (that\u2019s why you see an animation going through every slice of the MRI).", "You can think of the MRI as the process of going through the organ at different levels of depth and according to a given plane.", "As mentioned few cells above, MRI of the knee is the preferred method for diagnosing knee injuries. However, the interpretation of knee MRI is time-intensive and subject to diagnostic error and variability. An automated system for interpreting this type of image data could prioritize high-risk patients and assist clinicians in making diagnoses.", "Moreover, a system that produces less false positives that a radiologist is very advantageous because it eliminates the risk of performing unnecessary invasive knee surgeries.", "In the next posts, we will see how we can build an ACL tear classifier on MRI scans using deep learning. But let\u2019s first look at the data and understand it in this post.", "MRNet is a knee MRI dataset provided by Andrew Ng\u2019s Stanford lab.", "It\u2019s split in training set (1130 cases), validation set (120 cases) and test set (120 cases) and is organized as follows:", "Note that we don\u2019t have access to the test set.", "Note that the case refers also to a patient. So we\u2019ll use these two terms interchangeably.", "train-acl.csv and valid-acl.csv (we\u2019ll ignore the other files for now) indicate the labels of each case (either normal or subject to an ACL tear) on train and validation data respectively.", "Each case, in both train and valid folder, has 3 MRI scans taken from different planes: sagittal, coronal and axial.", "To make a proper decision regarding a case, the radiologist usually looks at MRI scans from different planes to have a global view.", "The 3 MRI scans of a given patient don\u2019t necessarily have the same number of slices.", "Between different cases (or patients) and for a given plane, MRI scans don\u2019t necessarily have the same number of slices either. This is an important piece of information to have in mind because it conditions the architecture of the deep learning model we\u2019ll use later for classification.", "Let\u2019s now look at the data and explore it.", "The CSV files train-acl.csv and valid-acl.csv have the same structure with two columns:", "ACL tears appear in less than 20% of the cases for the training set.", "Let\u2019s look at a given case from the 3-plane perspective:", "Each MRI scan is a tensor of s slices. Each slice is a grayscale image of size (256, 256).", "Let\u2019s visualize the first one on each plane:", "It\u2019s not very convenient to plot slices of MRI scans and have a global view between three different planes, especially when you have a large number of slices per MRI scan and need to go over each slice.", "So here\u2019s how we can turn a static matplolib plot into an interactive widget that allows you to:", "Let\u2019s see how this can be done:", "You first need to load your data in a convenient dictionary where the keys are case numbers and the values are dictionaries in which keys are planes and the corresponding values are NumPy arrays representing the MRI scan.", "As expected, it contains a nested dictionary that maps plane to NumPy array objects.", "Now we define a class called KneePlot that creates the interactive plot from the cases object.", "In the next post, we\u2019ll build a convolutional neural network that will ingest MRI scans and predict the ACL tear probability.", "We\u2019ll discuss the architecture of this network as well as the different components that handle the data processing, data augmentation, and transfer learning.", "We\u2019ll see how to put everything together using PyTorch.
