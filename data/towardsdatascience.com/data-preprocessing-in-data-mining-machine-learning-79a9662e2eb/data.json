This will continue on that, if you haven\u2019t read it, read it here in order to have a proper grasp of the topics and concepts I am going to talk about in the article.", "Data Preprocessing refers to the steps applied to make data more suitable for data mining. The steps used for Data Preprocessing usually fall into two categories:", "Please bear with me for the conceptual part, I know it can be a bit boring but if you have strong fundamentals, then nothing can stop you from being a great Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.", "In this discussion we are going to talk about the following approaches of Data Preprocessing:", "\u2192 In simpler terms it refers to combining two or more attributes (or objects) into single attribute (or object).", "The purpose Aggregation serves are as follows:", "\u2192 Data Reduction: Reduce the number of objects or attributes. This results into smaller data sets and hence require less memory and processing time, and hence, aggregation may permit the use of more expensive data mining algorithms.", "\u2192 Change of Scale: Aggregation can act as a change of scope or scale by providing a high-level view of the data instead of a low-level view. For example,", "\u2192 More \u201cStable\u201d Data: Aggregated Data tends to have less variability.", "\u2192 Sampling is a commonly used approach for selecting a subset of the data objects to be analysed.", "\u2192 The key aspect of sampling is to use a sample that is representative. A sample is representative if it has approximately the same property (of interest) as the original set of data. If the mean (average) of the data objects is the property of interest, then a sample is representative if it has a mean that is close to that of the original data.", "\u2192 There is an equal probability of selecting any particular item", "\u2192 Sampling without replacement: As each item is selected, it is removed from the population.", "\u2192 Sampling with replacement: Objects are not removed from the population as they are selected for the sample. In sampling with replacement, the same object can be picked up more than once.", "\u2192 The term dimensionality reduction is often reserved for those techniques that reduce the dimensionality of a data set by creating new attributes that are a combination of the old attributes.", "\u2192 Avoid curse of dimensionality. To learn more about this, visit my earlier article explaining it in detail.", "\u2192 Reduce amount of time and memory required by data mining algorithms.", "\u2192 Allow data to be more easily visualised.", "\u2192 May help to eliminate irrelevant features or reduce noise.", "The techniques mentioned here are very vast to discuss in this post. You can learn more about them on internet. I have added YouTube links to both, in case you want to watch those videos and learn.", "\u2192 It is another way to reduce dimensionality of data by only using a subset of the features available. While it might seem that such an approach would lose information, this is not the case if redundant and irrelevant features are present.", "\u2192 Duplicate much or all of the information contained in one or more other attributes. Example: purchase price of a product and the amount of sales tax paid.", "\u2192 Contain no information that is useful for the data mining task at hand. Example: students\u2019 ID is often irrelevant to the task of predicting students\u2019 GPA.", "While some irrelevant and redundant attributes can be eliminated immediately by using common sense or domain knowledge, selecting the best subset of features frequently requires a systematic approach. The ideal approach to feature selection is to try all possible subsets of features as input to the data mining algorithm of interest, and then take the subset that produces the best results.", "There are three standard approaches to feature selection: embedded, filter, and wrapper.", "Feature selection occurs naturally as part of the data mining algorithm. Specifically, during the operation of the data mining algorithm, the algorithm itself decides which attributes to use and which to ignore.", "Features are selected before the data mining algorithm is run, using some approach that is independent of the data mining task. For example, we might select sets of attributes whose pair wise correlation is as low as possible.", "These methods use the target data mining algorithm as a black box to find the best subset of attributes, in a way similar to that of the ideal algorithm described above, but typically without enumerating all possible subset.", "\u2192 It involves creation of new attributes that can capture the important information in a data set much more efficiently than the original attributes.", "\u2192 The creation of a new set of features from the original raw data is known as feature extraction. Consider a set of photographs, where each photograph is to be classified according to whether or not it contains a human face. The raw data is a set of pixels, and as such, is not suitable for many types of classification algorithms. However, if the data is processed to provide higher- level features, such as the presence or absence of certain types of edges and areas that are highly correlated with the presence of human faces, then a much broader set of classification techniques can be applied to this problem.", "\u2192 This method is highly domain specific.", "\u2192 Sometimes the features in the original data sets have the necessary information, but it is not in a form suitable for the data mining algorithm. In this situation, one or more new features constructed out of the original features can be more useful than the original features.", "\u2192 Example: dividing mass by volume to get density", "\u2192 A totally different view of the data can reveal important and interesting features. Consider, for example, time series data, which often contains periodic patterns. If there is only a single periodic pattern and not much noise then the pattern is easily detected. If, on the other hand, there are a number of periodic patterns and a significant amount of noise is present, then these patterns are hard to detect. Such patterns can, nonetheless, often be detected by applying a Fourier transform to the time series in order to change to a representation in which frequency information is explicit.", "\u2192 Discretization is the process of converting a continuous attribute into an ordinal attribute.", "\u2192 A potentially infinite number of values are mapped into a small number of categories.", "\u2192 Discretization is commonly used in classification.", "\u2192 Many classification algorithms work best if both the independent and dependent variables have only a few values.", "\u2192 Binarization maps a continuous or categorical attribute into one or more binary variables", "\u2192 Typically used for association analysis", "\u2192 Often convert a continuous attribute to a categorical attribute and then convert a categorical attribute to a set of binary attributes", "\u2192 Association analysis needs asymmetric binary attributes", "\u2192 Examples: eye colour and height measured as {low, medium, high}", "\u2192 An attribute transform is a function that maps the entire set of values of a given attribute to a new set of replacement values such that each old value can be identified with one of the new values", "\u2192 Normalization: It refers to various techniques to adjust to differences among attributes in terms of frequency of occurrence, mean, variance, range \u2192 Standardization: In statistics it refers to subtracting off the means and dividing by the standard deviation.", "This concludes our discussion on Data Preprocessing.", "The follow up to this post is here.", "I am giving away a free eBook on Consistency.
