Notes on the series can also be found here.", "If you\u2019re new to R programming language or you want to know more about it, then this article is for you, inspired by the DS toolbox course on Coursera, I will be briefly illuminating the use of R in Data Science, covering details about its importance and how it compares to Python. At the end of the article, I\u2019ll also be sharing a few resources for learning R. Hope you enjoy reading this article!", "The creation of many programming languages are inspired by a specific problem at hand, and in general, to make programming more intuitive. For R, it was to build a more accessible and easier language for statisticians. Back then there was a highly-complex language called SAS which was built for statisticians, but the syntax and features were too difficult to use. Two brilliant developers saw the opportunity and created R, a free, open-source alternative to SAS, which is easier to write and streamlined.", "A quick look at Wikipedia elucidates that", "The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis", "The definition is pretty self-explanatory, R is a simple language geared towards statistical analysis \u2014 like Flutter for building mobile apps, and React is for beautiful websites \u2014 In general, R provides a simple way to take data and turn it into useful statistics, awesome graphs, and statistical learning models for prediction and inference.", "Today, R is not a language for statisticians in academic settings, it has a countless number of extensions to serve different purposes for various fields. For example, it can be used in engineering, marketing, finances, insurance, and so on.", "There are mainly 4 reasons given in the course, which are:", "R is the quintessential language for statistical analysis, and with its growing functionality and updates, along with the Data Science boom, it\u2019s become a top language for data scientists.", "Like most languages, it\u2019s open-source and free to use. There is statistical software like IBM SPSS which costs money, so it\u2019s great to have R accessible to all.", "R is really versatile. Aside from statistics and graphing, its wide-range of functions includes making websites, analyzing language, and many more. With the right package, you could use R to do almost anything you want.", "Like Python, it\u2019s open-source and has a wide range of packages that expands functionality. One advantage of this is getting help whenever you encounter problems in R, you can head over to forums to get your answers solved.", "You can download R at CRAN, which stands for the Comprehensive R Archive Network", "The official IDE for R is RStudio, which is makes programming in R super easy and fun.", "In light of the Data Science boom, Tidyverse was created. It\u2019s a collection of R packages for the use of Data Science, which extends the capabilities of the base. If you already have a background in programming and you\u2019re learning R for Data Science, using TidyVerse is ideal. However, without foundations in programming, you should learn base R first before moving onto TidyVerse.", "R and Python are the two giants in Data Science present in many heated discussions. I\u2019ll just briefly cover the main points, and link more detailed comparisons later in references.", "R is was built for statisticians, so R will have an upper hand in statistical analysis and modeling, especially with the TidyVerse package \u2014 data manipulation and plotting with ggplot2, as well as generating reports with R notebook and Markdown in RStudio. However, it does have a steep learning curve and", "Python is a more general-purpose language, a jack of all trades. It has an advantage in production and other aspects like software development, building websites, machine learning, and Deep Learning (PyTorch).", "With both languages having their own pros and cons, most people generally use both languages for different purposes, depending on their specializations and the use cases.", "There are many different opinions out there on which you should learn. But I believe the most important thing is to grasp the fundamentals of programming first since all programming languages work under the underlying concepts in programming and computer science.", "And even after that, which language you decide to learn first doesn\u2019t matter that much, both R and Python are widely adopted and used, and which you would use depends on your specialization and projects you do. So it\u2019s a good idea to just start learning so that you\u2019re not wasting time researching and contemplating and actually picking up skills to secure your future.", "One way you can narrow down is to decide on your preferred role is in the data science field, by researching about your dream job, you should be able to learn what languages are preferred by the company of your choice. Let\u2019s say you want to be a data analyst, you should focus on R which has cutting-edge packages. But if you prefer building models and productionize your code, you should focus on Python instead.", "The Data Science Specialization offered by John Hopkins University is a great place to start since it equips you with everything you need to know about the basics of Data Science, and going from zero to hero in R. Along with this course, you can start with the Book R for Data Science.", "For a better understanding of machine learning and statistics, you can also read the book Introduction to Statistical Learning which teaches you to build all kinds of statistical learning models in R, but only after you\u2019ve had considerable progress in the Data Science Specialization.", "Along with the above, you should also always be utilizing the myriads of resource on the internet\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as YouTube tutorials, articles, etc.\u200a\u2014\u200aand always be experimenting to really solidify and pragmatise what you learn, and taking down notes (handwritten notes for better retention), and reproduce in code what you learn after your learning sessions.", "The most important lesson for me in learning online is that your goals shouldn\u2019t be about the certificates or flaunting the new skills you pick up on your resume, it\u2019s about the skill of learning and learning how to learn that\u2019s incredible crucial in this fast-paced world where the latest tools and techniques for Data Science could change in the next few years.", "This guide to learning R isn\u2019t the best of course, it\u2019s just my personal plan for learning R and I hope you\u2019ll find this a good way of picking up the skill of writing code in R too! I hope you have a great time learning.", "In summary, R is a great language for statistical analysis and modeling and is still used by many people to this day. Deciding to learn R and being persistent in learning can be one of the best decisions of your life. I am currently learning R and I think it\u2019s a great language to learn, and I can\u2019t wait to be good enough to build models and beautiful graphs.", "Learning Data Science can be incredibly hard at times, you feel like you\u2019re not good enough (imposter syndrome). One way to maintain your motivation and determination is to remember why you\u2019re learning it in the first place, for me personally being \u2014 securing your future in this Data Science and AI era, and picking up amazing skills in the process.", "You also have to understand that learning it is a lifelong journey and process, it\u2019s not a 4-year undergraduate degree you can attain. Grades on a piece of paper don\u2019t denote your mentality and philosophy, nor does it prove your skills and ability (in the real world). The field is always changing and it\u2019s more important to be adaptable and focus on learning how to learn, instead of the textbook definitions and methodologies.", "\u201cEducation is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.\u201d", "\u201cIntellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death.\u201d", "So if you\u2019ve been thinking about becoming a Data Scientist, learning R is a great place to start.
