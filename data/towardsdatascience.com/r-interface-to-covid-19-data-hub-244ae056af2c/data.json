The user can instantly download up-to-date, structured, historical daily data across several official sources. The data are hourly crunched and made available in csv format on a cloud storage, so to be easily accessible from Excel, R, Python\u2026 and any other software. All sources are properly documented, along with their citation.", "In this tutorial we explore the R Package COVID19: R Interface to COVID-19 Data Hub.", "The data are retrieved with the covid19 function. By default, it downloads worldwide data by country, and prints the corresponding data sources.", "To hide the data sources use verbose = FALSE", "A table with several columns is returned: cumulative number of confirmed cases, tests, recovered, deaths, daily number of hospitalized, intensive therapy, patients requiring ventilation, policy measures, geographic information, population, and external identifiers to easily extend the dataset with additional sources. Refer to the documentation for further details.", "By default, the raw data are cleaned by filling missing dates with NA values. This ensures that all locations share the same grid of dates and no single day is skipped. Then, NA values are replaced with the previous non-NA value or 0.", "Example: plot confirmed cases by country.", "Example: plot confirmed cases by country as fraction of total population.", "Filling the data with the previous non-missing data is not always recommended, especially when computing ratios or dealing with more sophisticated analysis other than data visualization. The raw argument allows to skip data cleaning and retrieve the raw data as-is, without any preprocessing.", "The package relies upon publicly available data from multiple sources that do not always agree, e.g. number of confirmed cases greater then number of tests, decreasing cumulative counts, etc. COVID-19 Data Hub can spot misalignments between data-sources and automatically inform authorities of possible errors. All logs are available here.", "Example: plot confirmed cases by country as fraction of tests.", "Example: plot mortality rates by country.", "Retrieve the snapshot of the dataset that was generated at the end date instead of using the latest version. This option ensures reproducibility of the results and keeps track of possible changes made by the data providers.

See the documentation for further details.", "Example: load US data, detect changes in the testing policy, and plot them together with the mortality rate.", "The dataset can be extended with World Bank Open Data via the argument wb, a character vector of indicator codes. The codes can be found by inspecting the corresponding URL. For example, the code of the GDP indicator available here is NY.GDP.MKTP.CD.", "Example: extend the dataset with the World Bank indicators NY.GDP.MKTP.CD (GDP) and SH.MED.BEDS.ZS (hospital beds per 1,000 people).", "Example: plot the mortality rate in function of the number of hospital beds.", "The dataset can be extended with Google Mobility Reports via the argument gmr, the url to the Google CSV file.", "Example: detect changes in the Italian transport policy, and plot them together with the mortality rate, percentage of confirmed cases, and Google mobility indicators.
