(e.g., latent class models, factor analysis, graphical models, etc.)", "A Bayesian network represents a joint distribution using a graph. Specifically, it is a directed acyclic graph in which each edge is a conditional dependency, and each node is a distinctive random variable. It has many other names: belief network, decision network, causal network, Bayes(ian) model or probabilistic directed acyclic graphical model, etc.", "In order for the Bayesian network to model a probability distribution, it relies on the important assumption: each variable is conditionally independent of its non-descendants, given its parents.", "For instance, we can simplify P(Grass Wet|Sprinkler, Rain) into P(Grass Wet|Sprinkler) since Grass Wet is conditionally independent of its non-descendant, Rain, given Sprinkler.", "Using this property, we can simplify the whole joint distribution into the formula below:", "Conditional independence between variables can greatly reduce the number of parameters.", "This reduces so much of the computation since we now only take into account its parent and disregard everything else.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the numbers.", "Let\u2019s say you have n binary variables (= n nodes).", "The unconstrained joint distribution requires O(2^n) probabilities.", "For a Bayesian Network, with a maximum of k parents for any node, we need only O(n * 2^k) probabilities.

This third factor is called a confounder. The confounder, which is rain, was responsible for the correlation between accident and wearing coats.", "Note that this does NOT mean accidents are independent of rain. What it means is: given drivers wearing coats, knowing rain doesn\u2019t give any more information about accidents.", "Marginal independence is just the same as plain independence,", "Sometimes, two random variables might not be marginally independent. However, they can become independent after we observe some third variable.", "They are all in the same form as A \u315b B | C. A and B look related if we don\u2019t take C into account. However, once we include C in the picture, then the apparent relationship between A and B disappears. As you see, any causal relationship is potentially conditionally independent. We will never know for sure about the relationship between A & B until we test every possible C (confounding variable)!", "Your home for data science.
