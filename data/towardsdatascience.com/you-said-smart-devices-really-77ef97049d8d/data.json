Everyone knows what a smartphone is, but how smart is it? And what does it really mean for a device to be smart?", "Cambridge and Oxford dictionaries define a smart person as: \u2018Intelligent, or able to think quickly or intelligently in difficult situations\u2019.", "Thus, \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d are synonyms. But when it comes to devices, the two words refer to different concepts:", "The \u2018smartness\u2019 of a device is defined as the ability to \u2018act in an independent way using a computer\u2019, while the intelligence of a device resides in the ability to \u2018adapt and react to different situations, in a similar way to humans\u2019.", "Which means an intelligent device is usually smart too, but a smart device isn't necessary intelligent. This is where most people get confused.", "If a customer thinks two products are equal, the normal reaction is to buy the cheaper one. However, intelligent devices need more computational power, and consequently more expensive hardware.", "Even more confusing, in some languages such as French and Arabic, both words \u2013smart & intelligent, are translated to: \u2018intelligent\u2019. Thus, when marketers translate the name of their products, all \u2018smart\u2019 devices become \u2018intelligent\u2019, which leads to ambiguity.", "For example: when I buy a smart air-conditioner, I expect the device to show some AI features such as predicting which time I will return home so it will cool down the temperature before I arrive, or to adapt to my habits automatically, by switching to economy mode on Saturdays because I come back late. I will also expect the same behavior from all the smart devices I want to buy such as smart coffee-machine, smart lock, smart car\u2026etc.", "But since those so-called smart devices are not intelligent, I will have to manually set my air-conditioner to start cooling the house at a fixed time each day or to remotely launch the program using a mobile application. Moreover, I would probably have a different application for each device I buy!", "For tech-people, \u201csmart\u201d refers either to connectivity or to automatic execution:", "In simple words: \u201cA smart device is an electronic device, generally connected to other devices or networks via different wireless protocols (such as Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi, LiFi, 3G, etc.), that can operate to some extent interactively and autonomously\u201d (Wikipedia definition)", "It should be the case, but guess what? If you google the word \u2018intelligent device\u2019 you will find the following definition:", "\u201cA machine, instrument, piece of equipment or any other device with internal computing capability\u201d.", "But wait\u2026 isn\u2019t that the definition of a smart device? It looks like there is another confusion here!", "From what we saw before, the right definition for an intelligent device would rather be:", "\u201cAn electronic device using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in order to adapt its behavior to different situations and learn from past experiences\u201d.", "This makes sense, and would perfectly align with the definitions from the Cambridge and Oxford dictionaries.", "In fact, most of the researchers in computer science will agree on this definition. But in other fields such as electrical engineering or telecommunications, some people would use \u2018smart device\u2019 and \u2018intelligent device\u2019 to refer to the same thing. For instance, the International Telecommunication Union agency describes smart things as \u2018thinking things\u2019 involving embedded intelligence.", "Some people use these confusing definitions to their advantage; either to create a buzz or to attract investors.", "A recent study \u2013that examined 2,830 companies from 13 European countries, affirmed that 40% of the so-called \u2018AI startups\u2019 show no evidence of using AI material in their products.", "From my personal experience, as a coach in several hackathons in Algeria, most of the teams who claim their solutions use intelligent systems do not include any form of Artificial Intelligence at all. They use this word either as a sales argument or because they believe the system\u2019s intelligence is about connectivity and remote control using a smartphone.", "So the next time you want to buy an \u2018IoT\u2019, a \u2018smart\u2019 or an \u2018intelligent\u2019 device, ask the seller what he/she means by this word. Meanwhile, maybe Yasser Abdesselam can tell us more about the marketing part of this phenomenon.", "In the next article, let\u2019s clarify another confusion: what is a robot?Believe me, this question is harder than it seems.", "Till then, please share and comment to enrich the debate.", "Your home for data science.
