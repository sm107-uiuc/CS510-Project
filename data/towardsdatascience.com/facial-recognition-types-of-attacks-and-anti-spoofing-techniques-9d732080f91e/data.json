Nowadays, facial recognition is becoming the second most largely deployed biometric authentication method at the world level in terms of market quota right after fingerprints. Each day more and more manufacturers are including face recognition in their products, such as Apple with its Face-ID technology, the banks with the implementation of eKYC solutions for the onboarding process.", "Contrary to the main aim of research in face recognition has been given to the improvement of the performance at the verification and identification tasks, the security vulnerabilities of face recognition systems have been much less studied in the past, and only over the recent few years, some attention has been given to detecting different types of attacks consists of detecting whether a biometric trait comes from a living person or it is a fake.", "As shown in the figure above, there are exist seven modules and points that can be the target of an attack, they are divided into two types: presentation and indirect attack.", "Presentation attacks are performed at sensor level (1), without the need of having access to the interior of the system.", "Presentation attacks are related to purely biometric vulnerabilities. In these attacks, intruders use some type of artifact, typically artificial (e.g., a face photo, a mask, a synthetic fingerprint, or a printed iris image), or try to mimic the aspect of genuine users (e.g., gait, signature) to fraudulently access the biometric system.", "Because \u201cbiometric traits are not secrets\u201d, attackers are aware of this reality that a high amount of biometric data are exposed showing the face, eyes, voice, and behavior of people, so they take advantage of those sources of information to try to circumvent face recognition systems using the following examples.", "We use anti-spoofing techniques to prevent these attacks.", "Indirect attacks (2\u20137) can be performed at the database, that matches, the communication channels, etc. In this type of attack, the attacker needs access to the interior of the system.", "Indirect attacks can be prevented by the techniques related to \u201cclassical\u201d cybersecurity than to biometrics, so we will don\u2019t discuss them in this post.", "Without implementing presentation attack detection measures, most of the state-of-the-art facial biometric systems are vulnerable to simple attacks.", "Typically, face recognition systems can be spoofed by presenting to the camera a photograph, a video, or a 3D mask of a targeted person. or use makeup or plastic surgery. However, using photographs and videos are the most common type of attacks due to the high exposition of the face and the low cost of high-resolution digital cameras.", "Because most of the facial recognition system is easy to be attacked by spoofing methods. Therefore, in order to design a secure face recognition system in a real scenario, anti-spoofing techniques should be a top priority from the initial planning of the system.", "Since face recognition systems try to differentiate between genuine users, not to determine if the biometric sample presented to the sensor is real or a fake. We can do them in four different ways as follows.", "We use available sensors to detect in the signal any pattern characteristic of live traits.", "With a dedicated hardware to detect evidence of liveness such as a 3D camera, but which is not always possible to deploy.", "Using a challenge-response method where a presentation attack can be detected by requesting the user to interact with the system in a specific way.", "Using the following recognition algorithms intrinsically robust against attacks.", "Specular feature projections: Firstly, by characterizing the specular feature space corresponding to genuine images and learn the projections of genuine and spoof data onto this basis. Nextly the SVM model is trained corresponding to genuine projections, 3D mask projections, and printed photo projections are then used as an anti-spoofing model for detecting impersonations.", "Depth feature fusion: by deeply studying the importance of facial image color feature information for human face detection, a deep feature fusion network structure is constructed by deep convolutional neural networks ResNet and SENet to effectively train the involved face anti-spoof data.", "Image quality assessment: the method is based on the combination of image quality measures. This solution compares the original image with an image processed.", "Deep learning: this method is based on a multi-input architecture that combines a pre-trained CNN model and the local binary patterns descriptor.", "We can build a presentation attack detection system (PAD) using anti-spoofing techniques and integrate it with the facial recognition system.", "With this approach, the anti-spoofing system makes its decision first, and only if the samples are determined to come from a living person, then they are processed by the face recognition system.", "Your home for data science.
