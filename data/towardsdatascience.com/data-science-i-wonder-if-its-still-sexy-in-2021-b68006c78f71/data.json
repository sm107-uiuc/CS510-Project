Although data-driven decisions were around before 2012, a reputable write-up published in Havard Business Review attracted the attention of many.", "\u201cTheir sudden appearance on the Business scene reflects the fact that companies are now wrestling with information that comes in varieties and volumes never encountered before\u201d \u2014 Havard Business Review, 2012.", "With a title such as Data Scientists: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century, It\u2019s not difficult to understand why this piece may have been an influential factor in why many people want to become Data Scientists today. However, as we rapidly approach a decade since the original piece was published, I was curious to determine whether Data Science may have lost its sexiness over the years and whether it is a good career to pursue.", "Depending on who you ask, you may be given an extremely different answer to this question. For instance, Nate Silver an American statistician believes Data Science is simply another name for Statistics whereas, Andrew Gelman, also an American Statistician (and professor of statistics at Columbia University) has described statistics as a non-essential part of Data Science.", "Despite the confusion, I believe we could all agree that Data Science is focused on extracting knowledge and insights from datasets using scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems, thereby encompassing analysis, ensuring data is in a good enough state to be analyzed, and then providing insights to inform high-level decisions.", "If we want to know whether Data Science would be a good career, it is important we define the things that make up a good career.", "Many often would often imagine that finding the right career consists of finding one's passion through a flash of insight or determining the easiest job that pays the most money. However, according to a 2017 career guide titled, We reviewed over 60 studies about what makes for a dream job. Here\u2019s what we found, there is no evidence to back up these claims.", "Instead, from their research, they were able to come up with 5 key ingredients (It was actually 6, but I felt as though the 6th one was a bit repetitive) that go into making the dream job of which I will be using to determine whether Data Science is still a good career to pursue in 2021.", "Contrary to popular belief, salary, status, and the type of company one may work for do not contribute as much as one may think to whether work is engaging. In fact, what determines whether work is engaging is the work that is done on a Day-to-Day basis.", "\u201cEngaging work is work that draws you in, holds your attention, and gives you a sense of flow.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Todd, Author at 80,000 hours", "Come to think about it, this makes a lot of sense \u2014 think about how time whizzes past when we are playing a fun game. We find Games engaging since we are provided with:", "To bring this back into context, a Data Scientists' daily task would generally revolve around data \u2014 no surprise there. It\u2019s often quoted that much of Data Science work is gathering, analyzing, or cleaning data to put it into a suitable format to do further work. However, the full scope of the job goes beyond this and there are other activities that are just as important as the technical task listed above, such as communicating with non-technical stakeholders and keeping up with changes in the field.", "Many would agree that Data Science is pretty much an art as much \u2014 if not more \u2014 as it is a science hence providing practitioners with the freedom to perform the task at hand. The issue is that all the freedom in the world doesn\u2019t mean that value is being created as we\u2019ve seen in the past. There was a popular article in 2017 \u2014 Big Data Strategies Disappoint with 85% Failure Rate \u2014 that made a major claim that data projects failed to deliver the expected transformations that companies were expecting.", "It would be criminal of me to point my finger to say that is the absolute reason for Data projects high delivery rate, yet, for the sake of this post emphasis will be put on the Prolonged turn around time, and massive effort without visibility into the potential value since this covers a keys points of engagement \u2014 feedback.", "Data Science projects require lots of effort, despite there being a lack of visibility into the eventual outcome of the project and its business value. Traditional projects can take a very long time to complete until the outcome can be evaluated and the delayed feedback can be demoralizing especially if after all the effort and finances invested, the project is a failure.", "Additionally, if you are working for a smaller company you are less likely to be able to work on a variety of projects since they may not be as willing to put so much investment towards something that may or may not work.", "Gaming may provide a high level of engagement, but where it lacks is in its ability to help others\u2014 although this is beginning to shift as many are finding a great deal of entertainment in watching others game which can be considered as a form of help.", "Growing evidence has emerged that helping others plays a major role in our life satisfaction and if that\u2019s the case, here is where Data Science thrives. \u2014 For more on this you may read 10 benefits of helping others which was published by University College London regarding more charitable support, although I am under the conviction that people who use business to support others will also reap the same benefits.", "Data is generated by people and if Data Science is about using that data to discover knowledge and insights to make informed decisions to better others then I believe the inherent nature of Data Science is all about helping others. Of course, when the projects do not fail.", "I believe this is most eminent on platforms such as Youtube, Amazon, and Netflix which use recommendation systems to aid user efficiency and to provide resources that one may of never explicitly searched for but is still extremely valuable.", "My Rating (Work That Helps Others): 4/5", "Absolutely nobody enjoys constantly getting spanked at anything. Including their job. When you are good at what you do it provides you with a sense of achievement which is also considered a vital substance of life satisfaction.", "When you are good at what you do, it serves as leverage to:", "The dilemma we have with this ingredient is that absolutely nobody begins by being good at their job. In fact, it is almost certain that your first few attempts of anything in a new role would be shabby. Therefore, to properly evaluate this category we have to assume that the person interested in being a Data Scientist is someone that is eager to improve and we can then begin to consider the number of options open to them for improvement.", "Where Data Science adopts a fairly new role in business, many of the early adopters had to rely on textbooks to begin their journey in Data Science. As time has gone on, thousands of Data Science MOOCs have been developed and accessible books, talkless of the great open-source community. It also helps that a key aspect of the Data Science workflow, which is the programming language being used, is narrowed down to a dispute between R and Python \u2014 Unlike Software Engineering which has many programming languages with their own Idiosychrosies, pros, and cons.", "In that respect, I\u2019d say if you want to become good at Data Science then there are more than enough resources out there to develop yourself and take your skills to the next level. The sole factor of whether you become a good Data Scientist is yourself. On that note, I\u2019d give being Good at your job a 5/5.", "If you have colleagues you completely dislike and your boss acts like he was employed by Satan to torment you, then it\u2019s highly unlikely you\u2019d be satisfied with your job.", "Good relationships are a major factor when we discuss the topic of a fulfilling life, hence it's vital that we are able to establish friendships with a handful of people where we work. This doesn\u2019t mean everyone must become friends, instead what matters is that you are able to receive assistance when you become stuck on a task.", "Supportive colleagues do not essentially come in the form of the big softy that is scared to tell you that the work you\u2019ve produced is a bunch of trash. Adam Grant, an American Psychologist, would tell you that the best employees are not in fact the agreeable ones.", "\u201cDisagreeable givers are the people who, on the surface, are rough and tough, but ultimately have others\u2019 best interest at heart. [\u2026]. They are the people who are willing to give you critical feedback, that you don\u2019t want to hear but you have to hear\u201d \u2014 Adam Grant", "Whether you have supportive colleagues or not is totally dependent on the organization you are at so it\u2019s not a good way to measure this ingredient. Instead, I will base my evaluation on the Data Science community as a whole of which generally, you would hear is one of the best in tech due to how willing people are to share their research.", "However, where I feel the field is lacking is in the diversity department. You often find that the most disagreeable people are usually the ones that are very different from ourselves, and provided they have our best interest at heart, their feedback is often very valuable. Being apart of the underrepresented ethnicities in tech, I feel lots of big transformations are happening in the world as a result of big data, and the people that are being affected most have the least input.", "For work to be truly satisfying, the job should lack the things that make work unpleasant, such as:", "Commute time is subjective to the individual, although, in the midst of the pandemic, I do believe that we are in a transition phase where remote work is going to become more prominent (especially for technical roles) hence making this criterion potentially obsolete.", "I couldn't find much data regarding how long actual Data Scientist work on average, but I did find a pretty interesting subreddit that discussed that 25 hours of the week is spent waiting for work and 10\u201315 hours is the amount of time spent doing actual work \u2014 This makes it around 40 hours a week. I do believe the latency between being set a task and actually receiving the data is pretty common in most organizations.", "Data Science salaries are range quite a bit in my opinion. Since there has been no clear distinction agreed upon in business, oftentimes somebody could be paid less to do significantly more work than someone else at another organization.", "Job Insecurity is another tricky one. From my own personal experience, I\u2019ve realized that Data Science is very different from Software Engineering in the sense that Data Science requires a lot more freeflow and it could be difficult to distinguish a definitive end, whereas Software engineering has a clear goal that needs to be reached. As a result, it could sometimes seem like you aren\u2019t doing really doing anything as a Data Scientist, especially when you don\u2019t have much to show for what you\u2019ve done \u2014 If we are going off this then I\u2019d say job security isn't one of Data Science most glamourous appeals.", "My Rating (Lack Of Major Negatives): 3/5", "The total sexiness score I give Data Science is about 19/25 which is quite high. I would say much of the hype that was driving business is slowly dying down and more products of value are being developed. I\u2019d definitely recommend a career in Data Science to anyone that has aspirations to be one. But I\u2019d advise anyone that is considering this career to be ready to commit to developing themselves and learning something new constantly as the field evolves quickly.", "It\u2019s important to note that all of the ratings are based on my opinion and not definite. If you\u2019d rate something I\u2019ve rated differently then leave a response to share how you would rate it as I\u2019d love to know.", "Connect with me on LinkedIn and/or Twitter", "Your home for data science.
