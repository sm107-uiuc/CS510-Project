The role of humans\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://medium.com/@radecicdario/membership", "anchor_text": "Medium member", "paragraph_index": 29}, {"url": "http://betterdatascience.com", "anchor_text": "betterdatascience.com", "paragraph_index": 31}], "all_paragraphs": ["Over the past couple of years, there\u2019s been so much talk about AI, and how it\u2019s bad for us \u2014 job-wise \u2014 usually followed by a claim that it will only help us do our job better. The role of humans would then be to do the human part of the job \u2014 ergo the communication with clients and all that stuff you probably hate.", "Before I go any further, I\u2019d like to make a short disclaimer: this article will possibly be biased and is written with Eastern-European culture in mind. What I write may possibly not hold true in other parts of the world, so keep that in mind before jumping to the comment section.", "Okay, with that being said we may return back to the topic.", "The main issue I have with the world education-wise is the saying that one must pursue higher education in order to have a better-paid job and overall better life security.", "While that\u2019s true in some cases, it cannot be further away from the truth in others. Today, at least in my country, people with master's degrees are doing jobs that required only a high school diploma 20 years ago. Just take a moment and think about how insane that is \u2014 nowadays you\u2019ll need to be in school for 5 years longer just to work at the same place your parents did!", "I intend to back this up with a little story in the next section.", "A week or so ago I was at the bank, opening up a business account. Nothing fancy there, basically you sit with the worker and sign like 10 documents. Then, after a couple of days when the account was ready I went back in and once again only signed documents, but this time the pile of documents was never-ending.", "What\u2019s the point of this story, you may ask. Well, the whole point is that this person working in the bank needs to have a master\u2019s degree (or bachelors in some rare cases) just to hand out and prepare documents to sign.", "Of course, I don\u2019t think that all people working in banks do is preparing and handing out documents to parties, waiting for them to be signed. But for a part of them, that pretty much describes their jobs.", "This claim doesn\u2019t only apply to the banking sector, but also to the majority of the public administration. Just think about the last time you were standing in line, just to hear the same sentence person before you heard (and person after you will hear), only because you need to file one paper which for some unexplained reason cannot be filed online.", "Conclusion \u2014 the education level doesn\u2019t guarantee job security (automatization-wise).", "I\u2019m not saying that a job in a bank or public administration (or any which strictly implies following a procedure) is bad, but why the hell would you need 5 years of college to apply for a Junior procedure follower?", "You will learn everything needed in the first couple of months at the job. Period.", "And now we\u2019re talking about AI taking over jobs like those ones. People are scared. But why in the world would you need AI to write loops and conditionals?", "People are at the fear that AI will take over their jobs when the reality is that their jobs could be automated the moment computer programming was invented, and programmers learned how to write if\u2019s and for\u2019s.", "It\u2019s as simple as that \u2014 if there is a procedure to follow, then you don\u2019t need AI, because you don\u2019t really need somebody to think, just to perform. Anything that can be described can be automated. If your job is to follow a procedure, then the requirement for AI is non-existent, because it can be linearly programmed.", "The question remains \u2014 why haven\u2019t procedure-following jobs been automated?", "Some of the jobs have already been automated, and that\u2019s a good thing. The reasons why I think so are various, but it boils down to:", "But this section will deal with the main problems of job automation, at least from my standpoint. Those are:", "Now before making conclusions let\u2019s take a minute to discuss the pros and cons of job automatization.", "When we talk about pros, I think two parties can benefit:", "But when it comes to cons I\u2019ll dive into only one \u2014 but the one holding the automatization back \u2014 the ethics issue.", "Is it wrong to take away jobs people worked hard to get in the first place? What about thousands of families that would be put at risk?", "It\u2019s not so easy to make a decision, right?", "This wasn\u2019t an easy subject to talk about \u2014 there are just so many different viewpoints and opinions. As said earlier, the whole article is based on the situation of where I live, and I hope things are better (more 21st century like) where you live.", "With everything said, what can I conclude?", "To start out, I don\u2019t get the point of trash talking about AI and how it will replace you if your job could literally be replaced by a simple Python script. There\u2019s no need to worry, as for now, the ethics issues seem to outweigh the benefits. If your job can\u2019t be replaced by simple linear programming, then I think AI will one day help you make better decisions, and essentially make you better at your job, at least for now.", "From my standpoint, as someone fairly confident in my technical skills, but also a business owner, I would never even consider hiring someone if the job can be automated in any way, shape or form \u2014 being with simple if\u2019s and for\u2019s or by implementing more sophisticated machine/deep learning algorithms.", "But that\u2019s only my opinion, and you\u2019re entitled to have yours, so please share it with me down in the comment section.
