This is going to be a brief overview because, as with all things Data Science, the opportunity to get into the weeds is pretty strong.", "So what is homoscedasticity? Well, the subtitle says it\u2019s borrowed from Mary Poppins, but in actuality, the word is Greek in origin. We have the prefix Homo- from the Greek for \u201csame\u201d, and we add -skedacity, or skedastikos, the Greek for \u201cable to disperse\u201d according to Merriam-Webster. So homoscedasticity means the same or a similar dispersion. There, that\u2019s done, now we don\u2019t have to talk anymore.", "Ha! Just kidding, we\u2019re going to show you some graphics so you can really get what\u2019s going on. If you want to break it out into plain English, homoscedasticity is where we can observe a distribution of data, and determine that the error term, or whatever is causing our data to not neatly fall in line, is the same across all the points of data. This leads to some very predictable results, and people who do stats for a living like seeing homoscedasticity, but not always. Homoscedasticity does provide a solid explainable place to start working on their analysis and forecasting, but sometimes you want your data to be messy, if for no other reason than to say \u201cthis is not the place we should be looking.\u201d", "So let\u2019s take a look at what homoscedasticity looks like shall we? To really know what\u2019s going on, you also have to know about heteroscedasticity or its opposite. If something is not homoscedastic, it\u2019s either heteroscedastic, or it could be a little of both. We can use math to determine if something is homoscedastic or heteroscedastic by checking the variance or running an F-Test, but the easiest way to check is to run a scatter plot and look at the data. Yay for visualizations!", "Now, in the above graphs, we see some basic scatterplot correlations from my used car linear regression price predictor project. If we know that Homoscedasticity means same distribution or dispersion, would the 3 graphs above indicate homoscedasticity or heteroscedasticity? If you said heteroscedasticity you win the prize! What we are seeing is a classic example of heteroskedasticity!", "A signature of heteroscedastic distributions is the tendency to fall into a cone shape, as we can see clearly in the far right graph. They can also look like the eggplant and jalapeno pepper we see in the left and center graph. Basically, any time we can\u2019t confidently draw a line through our data and know that we got within range of most of the values, then we can begin to suspect heteroskedasticity!", "So what does homoscedasticity look like? Well here\u2019s what a homoscedastic scatter plot looks like:", "This isn\u2019t perfect, but on initial observation you could say this leans toward homoscedastic. It\u2019s certainly more homoscedastic than the previous graphs. You may notice that there are a significant number of outliers in this graph. Outliers can make a significant difference in determining the homoscedasticity of a data set in linear regression. Depending on how significant an effect they have, you may choose to omit them if they don\u2019t have a real effect on results, or you may choose to further transform your data if there is significant effect. If they skew too much, you may try adding more features, or throw out the model altogether.", "Regardless of the presence of outliers, we can see that our model successfully gets within a reasonable distance of all data points. This satisfies our definition of \u201csame distribution.\u201d That is, they are distributed similarly along the line of our model. An important thing to remember is that no matter how many text books you read, or blogs like this, when it comes to real world data, there\u2019s never any true homoscedasticity. The real world is loud, messy, and full of lies, and that\u2019s going to affect your data. As a result all models will be sort of messy, so we want to get as close to homoscedasticity as possible, and barring further analysis of the residuals and additional tests, we can feel confident that we are observing homoscedasticity here.", "I hope you enjoyed this brief overview of the funnest word in Data Science. It\u2019s also, for me, probably the hardest word I\u2019ve ever had to pronounce.", "Homoscedasticity, or getting close to it, is the gold standard for data scientists who want to get a working model, and in fact, testing for it, or testing for heteroscedasticity is a key component of developing those models. Getting them run and confirming them means the difference between running a good model and a bad one.", "So next time you see that cone, remember, it's not homoscedastic!", "Your home for data science.
