I\u2019m over 90 days into my new career on a Data Science team as a Product Analyst, so I figure it is time to do some reflecting and think about why I decided to upend my good and stable life to embark down a long path of hard work, struggle, and numbers.", "At the core of my decision to transition my life is truly my love for data. I love collecting it. I love cleaning it. I love looking at it. I love working with data! My love for data grew out of two seeds:", "I love the stock market.I got a job in software Technical Support.", "As a kid, I remember hearing my parents talk about the markets all the time. My dad would always have the news playing and would look at daily quotes in the newspaper at breakfast. I was exposed to the wealth creation engine that is the stock market at a young age, and I became fascinated by the idea of making money from owning a part of a company. I have yet to become a great and wealthy investor, but I did give day trading a try for a while and took on a group of traders as a mentor. They gave me access to some expensive data\u2026", "About a year prior, I had worked my way up into a Technical Support position at a software company where I learned the foundations of SQL, got a taste for computer science, and exposure to the software development life-cycle. As my love for SQL grew, I started creating databases at home.", "My first use-case: Collect the expensive stock data!", "Every day, I would manually scrape the data from the feed they allowed me to access. I\u2019d dump it into an SQL database and try to filter out the noise to reveal high probability trades. Overall, it produced some good results, but when the market environment shifted, my results went haywire.", "I realized I loved creating an algorithm to rank and analyze my stock data way more than I liked trading every day.", "Shortly after I became more advanced with SQL, I tried my hand at Python. I followed a few YouTube tutorials to scrape stock data from yahoo using BeautifulSoup. I thought it was pretty cool, but didn\u2019t get super into it. It wasn\u2019t long after that I started seeing the words \u201cData Science\u201d pop up everywhere. I figured, \u201cI like data and I like science, I should check this out!\u201d", "I had been at the software company for about 6 years at the time, and I knew we had a data science team, so I decided to see if the manager was interested in having an informal chat. I told him about my passion for data and desire to learn more about data science, and that I was worried I\u2019d fail because my background is technical writing and software support, not computer science and statistics...", "Essentially, he convinced me my background mattered less than my curiosity and willingness to learn.", "A few months later, after reading a few intro books on machine learning, I signed up for an Analytics coding boot camp as a means to discipline myself into learning to code. The MOOCs are a great way to learn, especially if you have a foundation, but I just couldn\u2019t stay focused long enough to get a lot out of them at first. If you\u2019re thinking about a coding camp, check out my article on my experience.", "When I was around the age of 26 or 27, I made a major shift in my life:", "I decided to take my passions seriously.", "For example, I know a lot of people who jump around from hobby to hobby or always seem distracted by the newest shiny thing. Instead of doing that, I decided to see how far I could push the few hobbies I cared about:", "The mental framework I built up for myself to stick with my passions and take them seriously, combined with the classroom environment of the boot camp and my experience with SQL allowed me to thrive. I\u2019ll be the first one to tell you, my python code is still on newbie level, maybe a little beyond; regardless, I am dedicated and coding nearly every day at home and at work, grinding to get to the next level. It has only been about six months since I graduated from my boot camp, and I\u2019ve not only landed a job on a data science team, but also have developed a passion for sharing my coding projects with the world through Medium and my blog!", "Before getting into data science and losing sleep studying algorithms and new methods I can use to cluster customer usage data, I had a pretty sweet life: Few complaints, stable relationships, decent money\u2026 So what gives?", "I saw an opportunity to be a part of a growing field in which I can explore my passions and surround myself with smart and like-minded people.", "Although I\u2019m not a Data Scientist, I get to work with people who are or want to be, and I think that is awesome. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I get to work with a lot of other interesting people too, and I try to maintain the friendships that I\u2019ve forged throughout my tenure at the company. It feels good to be new at something yet have a network of support that wants to see me succeed. That is how I feel, most of the time, at work and with my wife!", "Beyond the opportunity, the love for data, and a dedication to coding, there is yet another component to my data science decision\u2026 My interest in Rhetorical Theory piqued in college and sent me down a path to earning a degree in Scientific and Technical Communication.", "Data science and data analytics are giving me new tools I can use in my quest to inspire audiences.", "Although the title was a bit \u2018click-bait-ie,\u2019 after spending my first 90 days on a data science team, I had to reflect on why I got involved with Data Science. Although it feels like an overwhelming amount of information to learn, I\u2019m happy I made the pivot. Overall, it is my love for data, dedication to learning, supportive relationships, and a combination of my passions that turned me, a guy who didn\u2019t like numbers, into a guy who works in Data Science.
