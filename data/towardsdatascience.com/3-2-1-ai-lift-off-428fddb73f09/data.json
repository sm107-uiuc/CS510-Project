Pretty simple, NEED. Faced with the constant generation and consumption of data, humans needed a new tool that would learn and adapt for us. That is basically AI.", "What we previously considered impossible or science fiction, today is becoming necessary and highly expected by some. Tech leaders are competing to develop AI solutions that offer them a competitive advantage by increasing and empowering human intelligence. But, if we stop for a moment, all the advances that have been made in this area are based on the same equation:", "Big Data + GPU enhancement + Deep Learning", "Yes my friend, we have the new AI Coca Cola formula.", "If you want to learn more, go visit oscargarciaramos.com", "However, and as I said in my article \u201cThe Little Data Rebellion\u201d, we have a great opportunity to look to the future and evolve our \u201cbAsIc Equation\u201d, exploiting small data, more comprehensive and efficient deep learning models, new hardware and deep advancement in the use of unsupervised learning.", "It is obvious that Deep Learning is becoming increasingly important in the AI \u200b\u200bequation, when we refer to speech, vision or some context of NLP or Natural Language Processing (\u201cHey Siri, Can I help you?\u201d).", "However, Deep Learning has yet to demonstrate its full capabilities in assisting with machine reasoning, a faculty required for many AI prototypes and solutions. Deep Learning has helped us in well-defined problems where the data is mostly labeled and we want, for example, to classify it. However, the next step that we must take goes beyond classification or perception, but reasoning and understanding.", "The systems, for now, do not have common sense. Reasoning helps us deal with a wide spectrum of cognitive tasks, including possible context changes or unexpected events. Humans know that if they put water in a glass it won\u2019t leak unless the glass is broken. How does the machine know?", "Yes, we have indeed reached the point where after labeling a free text paragraph, we are able to transform a natural language sentence into a logical formula. The next step we need to take will be to use reasoning mechanisms to work and understand these formulas with the least possible effort.", "How do we become more efficient and evolve the next wave of Deep Learning?", "Yes, you are right. SMALL data.", "How many times have we heard \u201cthere is not enough data within the domain to feed the Deep Learning model\u201d or \u201cthe dataset is neither good nor relevant enough to train the model\u201d. We all know that Neural Networks require large volumes of data to learn a certain task. However, we usually do not have the time to find such a large amount of quality data or the resources to train it, driving deviation of project times, training, testing and refinement of AI systems.", "Researchers are spending much of their time investigating new ways to train systems with less data and that are the ones that, even being small in size, outperform large volumes of data.", "As we have seen, Supervised Learning requires a laborious task of labeling data, which can sometimes be quite frustrating, incurring resource costs and introducing biases into systems as it is a \u201cmanually human\u201d task.", "However, most AI visionaries claim that pure Unsupervised Learning is the holy grail of Deep Learning, still far from where we are now and being able to implement it in the development of AI solutions and model training.", "Surely, in the short-term future, we will position ourselves somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised learning.", "All is not lost, my friend.", "There are currently other methods that still require supervision, but which are helping us to explore the world of Deep Learning applications in more depth:", "And last but not least, \u2026", "Most AI and Analytics departments focus on developing models that require smaller architectures and run faster.", "Why? Although GPUs have made a qualitative leap in terms of training and performance, it is still not enough. To train a model, you still need enough computing power and resources first to train it and second to maintain it, slowing down innovation and application performance.", "It is impossible for hardware to evolve on its own and overcome computational complexity. There must be a symbiosis between algorithmic model enhancement and hardware development.", "As Kevin Kelly, author of the best-selling book The Inevitable, states\u2026", "\u201cBirds flap their wings to fly, but to make humans fly, we had to invent a different type of flying \u2014 one that did not occur in nature\u201d. In the case of AI, something similar happens. We have to invent new types of thinking that do not exist biologically.", "Therefore, this Intelligence does not replace human thinking, but augments it\u201d.", "Feel free to leave a comment or share this post.
