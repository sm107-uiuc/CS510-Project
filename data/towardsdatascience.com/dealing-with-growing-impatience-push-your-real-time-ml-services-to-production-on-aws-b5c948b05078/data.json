(And I\u2019m not talking about that 95% accuracy based on 50 images for the detection of COVID through CT scans \u2026) The AI revolution has brought its bucket of new applications to the real world, but all face the same issues: product-market-fit (which is way too big of a topic to be covered here) and concretization. Fortunately, hyperscaling and big computing have been quickly democratized thanks to the decreasing prices of hardware and the increasing reliability of cloud computing. In this article, I will take some time to talk about the latter for a specific set of ML applications: real-time services.", "Among them, the most popular ones are certainly real-time anomaly or fraud detection, on-the-fly pricing, social media platforms, chatbots or fancy streaming. On the far-fetched end, some of you that worked on collaborative platforms have been using some of it without even noticing through recommendations or audio stream denoising. Decision making is moving fast, with impatience being one of the biggest traits of the newest generations, forcing currently designed applications to be smartly crafted to face the demand for real-time interaction and interpretation.", "Alriiiiiight, so many reasons to be excited! I\u2019ll try my best to help you figure out what it takes to build such services and enable your users to use them.", "On the architecture side, streaming does somewhat mean that you need to open the door for a constant flow of information between two stakeholders. That stream will originate from a user and has to be kept alive until either this user or his counterpart does close the stream. Protocol-wise, this relates to the creation of WebSockets. Conceptually, they are mainly a system that allows information to get from A to B, and B to A, at the same time. This is what we refer to as full-duplex connections.", "Fortunately, there are multiple ways you may include WebSockets services in your product. I give you a sandbox template to play with on my Github. In that example, I use Flask as the base, flask-sockets as worker and gunicorn as supervisor. flask-sockets comes with a very convenient wrapper, enabling fast prototyping and enough control over your product.", "Unexpectedly, I have always found it harder to test out an endpoint relying on WebSockets than actually implementing it. Among the possibilities, one is provided by Ngrok, a service allowing you to transform your local machine into a proper endpoint with a public address, through secured tunnels management. However, the free version of Ngrok has some limitations (1 service at the time, capped at 40 connections per minute). It is super handy in some cases, less in others. I would recommend you give it a try anytime! :)", "In the meantime, simply use the following snippet to run your Flask server with the WebSocket workers enabled:", "And this snippet to stream a file to your application via those workers:", "The previous example enables you to send a stream coming from an audio file. You can obviously tweak the previous code snippet to send the input of your microphone, video frames, messages, \u2026 The possibilities are limitless!", "Having the previous steps functioning is already rewarding, as it enables you to already showcase the application you have been drafting from the start. The funniest part is when it comes to put that pipeline on the cloud and make it available to others. Here are the steps to follow, with all the code made available on Github:", "That is probably the last test you can run locally. Going through Docker is just good practice at this point regarding Cloud infrastructure. Containerization enables you to keep some cloud agnosticism for yourself and control your versioning at the same time. To maximize that agnosticism, my way to go is usually the Elastic Beanstalk instances from AWS, that do run my Docker images quite seamlessly and enable just enough configuration.", "Security is a big deal, but I won\u2019t go into the details of Virtual Private Clouds and static encryption in this article. I\u2019ll begin with a simple proof of concept that you can run and expand on your own cloud. The shared pieces of code will enable you to build a secured WebSocket connection to catch the stream through a classic load balancer and transmit that information to your application over SSL. This application here is merely an application that stores the data received on an Elastic File Storage (merely a mounted virtual hard drive) that you can share among different instances for further processing.", "This is where the magic occurs. As I had to go through a lot of forums and documentation, this is certainly where you will find the most value! :)", "For the rest of the configuration, everything is made available in the .ebextensions directory. The files will, among other tasks, enable HTTPS, enable the usage of headers in your requests, and mount your Elastic File Storage virtual hard drive to your instance. The .Dockerrun.aws.json file will communicate to the instance where to mount the EFS endpoint.", "CalAster is a platform designed to be used by emergency call centers to collect, analyze and prioritize information. Better information can help first responders respond to emergencies in a more efficient manner. Via a range of services ranging from call analysis to visualization, CalAster allows first responders to better understand the emergencies and mentally prepare for it. In addition, CalAster\u2019s prioritization tool allows for efficient triage of calls. This is especially helpful during natural disasters when resources run scarce and emergency call centers are overwhelmed. Here is a glimpse of what the architecture used to look like, getting us finalist of Call for Code 2019.", "Some of you may already be grumbling, as the real boundaries to real-time ML are usually the inference times. When you work on heavy models it gets trickier to run it as fast as your inbound stream, even on GPU (\u2026 pricy \u2026). The current ways to think about that are still moving ahead: among the strategies are model quantization and model pruning. I\u2019ll let you explore those two Github repositories, still under active development!", "Condensa is a framework for programmable model compression in Python. It comes with a set of built-in compression operators which may be used to compose complex compression schemes targeting specific combinations of DNN architecture, hardware platform, and optimization objective. To recover any accuracy lost during compression, Condensa uses a constrained optimization formulation of model compression and employs an Augmented Lagrangian-based algorithm as the optimizer.", "Riptide is a collection of functions, scripts, and tools that enable ultra low-bitwidth neural networks to be easily trained and deployed at high speeds. Riptide is built on top of Tensorflow for training and TVM for deployment. Riptide models uses a novel operator called Fused Glue to replace all floating point operations inside of a binary neural network. By combining Fused Glue layers with other optimizations such as Bitpack Fusion, Riptide is able to generate models that run 4\u201312X faster than floating point equivalents on the Raspberry Pi.", "There are so many problems out there that need to be solved, and so few people to tackle them. If you\u2019ve got an idea, know that there is an egregious amount of information available for you to build your idea, and bring it from a concept to an actual product that has impact!", "Interested in keeping in touch? :D Twitter | LinkedIn | Github | Medium", "Your home for data science.
