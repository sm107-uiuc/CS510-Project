At the second quarter of 2020, the US Industrial Production Index falls by 14.4% year-on-year. Shrinkage in industrial production is likely to create a negative demand shock for the input resources, which in turn drives down the prices of commodities, especially energy and metals.", "At the same time, variations in commodity prices would also affect the supply, production costs, and hence production decision. For example, the tentative agreement in April 2020 between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and other countries to extend oil production cuts aims to support oil price after a slump in demand caused by coronavirus lockdowns.", "Nonetheless, relationships among energy and metal prices could be even more complicated, not only due to their multi-directional linkages, but also due to the existence of time lagged effects, short run and long run equilibrium. In this article, I would try to apply Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to (1) investigate the relationships between commodity prices and industrial production in the United States, and (2) forecast the movement of industrial production and commodity prices in near future. For all the codes below, please refer to my Github link here.", "This exercise will focus on the period between January 1990 and July 2020.", "From the World Bank\u2019s commodity markets website, we can download the monthly price data for different commodities. Among all, below are selected as representatives of energy, industrial metals and precious metals.", "Energy \u2014 Crude Oil (Brent), Coal (South African), Natural gas (US)", "Industrial metals \u2014 Aluminum, Iron ore, Copper", "As a side note, in 2019, the two traditional energy sources, e.g. petroleum and natural gas, still account for 74.0% of total energy use in the US industrial sector, which is a record high since data available in 1950. In contrast, only 9.5% in total is contributed by renewable energy, a slight decline from the peak of 10.1% in 2011. What a sad situation!!!", "For the United States\u2019 industrial production index, data can be downloaded from the website of Federal Reserve Bank.", "According to the definition, the Industrial Production Index is an economic indicator that measures real output for all facilities located in the United States manufacturing, mining, and electric, and gas utilities (excluding those in U.S. territories).", "Economic theory suggests that long run equilibrium exists between economic variables in their levels, which can render these variables stationary without taking differences, and this is so-called cointegration.", "Vector error correction model (VECM) serves as a way to capture such long run equilibrium relationships (levels) on top of short run relationships (differences). A more detailed explanation about VECM and its difference from Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model could be found here.", "Prior to applying the VECM, let\u2019s investigate whether the original time series data is stationary, which means that the variance of a time series is not dependent on time. If the time series is stationary, the plotted graph will look like a white noise.", "From the below line graph of non-differenced time series and correlation matrix, it\u2019s likely that they are non-stationary, and there are cointegrations among them.", "Before proceeding, let\u2019s take a look of the auto-correlation function plots of the 9 non-differenced time series, which show that they are definitely non-stationary.", "If we do the plot on variables after first difference, the ACFs of the differenced variables look potentially stationary. This suggests each time series is integrated I(1). Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests can further confirm this.", "The null hypothesis is that the data are non-stationary. So if p-values are low, the data are stationary with high statistical significance.", "The results of the ADF tests for the differenced variables strongly support the hypothesis that the time series are integrated I(1). These time series need to be differenced once prior to modeling.", "Next, we would like to see whether there are causal relationships between the time series through Granger causality test. The underlying story is that if previous values of X can predict future values of Y, then X Granger causes Y. An F-test is performed by estimating a regression of the lagged values of X on Y. If the p-value is small, we can reject the null hypothesis that all the coefficients of the lagged values of X are 0, i.e. lagged Xs have predictive power on future Y.", "For simplicity, below only shows the test results on the US Industrial Production Index. The outputs show that all commodity prices, besides price of natural gas, have predictive power on the industrial production of the US. Therefore, it is appropriate for us to perform the VEC modelling after taking out the price of natural gas.", "In next step, we are going to test whether cointegration (long run) relationships exist between the time series by Johansen Cointegration Test.", "The results of this test show that there are 3 and 2 cointegrating relationships between the series at 1 and 2 lags respectively. Moreover, there is 1 cointegrating relationship between the time series at 3, 4, 5 and 6 lags during the sample period at the 95% significance level. Therefore, we can say that VEC modeling is appropriate to modeling these time series data.", "The loading coefficients (alphas) represent how quickly the time series converge to the long-run equilibrium relationship.", "The alphas for prices of oil, coal, aluminum and silver are statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level, while those for prices of copper and platinum are significant at the 0.10 significance level. However, the alpha for the prices of iron ore is not statistically significant.", "From the result, we know that price of iron ore is weakly exogenous to the US industrial production index. Weak exogeneity means that deviations from the long-run do not directly affect the weakly exogenous variable. The effect comes from the subsequent lags of those non-weakly exogenous variables. In other words, the lags of other commodity prices are the drivers of the return to the long-run equilibrium in the weakly exogenous variables (price of iron ore).", "The beta coefficients are the actual long-run relationship coefficients. The beta for the US Industrial Production Index is standardized at 1 for ease of interpretation of the other beta coefficients.", "Among all, the beta for silver price is -6.0521, which means that a 1 dollar increase in silver price would lead to a 6.0521 decrease in the US Industrial Production Index in the long-run. Similarly, the betas for prices of oil, coal and aluminum are -3.5384, -0.4791 and -0.0793.", "In contrast, the beta for iron ore price is 1.2618, which means that a 1 dollar increase in iron ore price would lead to a 1.2618 increase in the US Industrial Production index in the long run. Similarly, the betas for prices of platinum and copper are 0.1313 and 0.0334 respectively.", "Impulse Response Function (IRF) shows the response of one variable when another or the same variable is shocked with an increase of 1 unit in the previous period (month). The blue curve shows the effect of the unit shock when time passes, and the dotted lines represent the 95% confidence interval for the IRF. Here, we try to observe the impulse response for a period of 24 months.", "Let\u2019s focus on the IRF for the US Industrial Production Index.", "First, from the first column of the above graph, it\u2019s interesting to see that if the Industrial Production Index experienced a shock with an increase of 1 unit in the previous month, the prices of all the commodities will rise. This observation could be supported by the logic of demand shocks.", "Second, from the first row of the above graph, we can see that an one unit positive shock to the prices of oil, aluminum, iron, copper and silver would lead to a rise in industrial production, though in different extents and duration. The rationale behind could be a greater motivation for mining, electric and gas utilities industries to output amid rising commodity prices.", "Third, negative impacts are brought to the Industrial Production Index when prices of coal and platinum experience a positive shock of one unit. The rise in these commodity prices may lead to higher input costs to manufacturing sectors, and thus hinder industrial production.", "You may observe that there could be two dominating but contradictive factors within the Industrial Production Index \u2014 manufacturing versus mining & utilities. Rise of a commodity price may encourage mining and utilities activities but slow down manufacturing.", "If we look at the IRF of other commodities, there are many interesting observations. For example, the one unit shock in oil price will generate negative impacts on coal price, and vice versa. A substitution effect may be illustrated. Therefore, it may be worthy to conduct in-depth investigation on the industrial use of each commodity and the relationships among them.", "Last but not least, below is a dynamic forecasting graph of the US Industrial Production Index and commodity prices for upcoming one year.", "In fact, the forecasts are in line with our expectations surprisingly.", "(i) Industrial production is hard to pick up in short term, and may even decline slightly further. A strong recovery signal has not yet been sent from the US economy. The relatively weak trend is likely to continue for a longer period.", "(ii) Prices of all commodities besides silver will maintain at similar level. Demand, supply and geopolitics remain the fundamentals to affect commodity prices. Without some specific events, such as Russia \u2014 Saudi Arabia oil price war in March, the commodity prices tend to be stable.", "(iii) The current rising trend of silver price may continue. Besides industrial use, silver also serves as a store of value amid accommodative monetary policy.", "This article has made use of a popular econometric model \u2014 Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to help us understand both the short run and long run relationships between the Industrial Production and different commodity prices. The model has successfully built up a linkage between the data and reality.", "Either the impulse response function or the dynamic forecasting is showing a result that is in line with our expectations and economic rationale. I hope this would raise your interests to analyze and forecast the economies through econometric modelling.", "Thank you very much. See you next time.", "If you are interested to see how to apply factor & cluster analysis for countries classification, you may take a look of my another article below.
