An Overview of Python I/O methods. | by Guilherme de Lima Barros | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Getting Started With: Python I/O", "description": "A first look at encoding and how Python works with files on disks"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["There are several ways to present the output of a program; data can be printed in a human-readable form, or written to a file for future use.", "In the beginning, ASCII was represented by 128 bytes; these characters were created with the use of the English language in mind; therefore, if you die in a country like china, where the base of your language are special characters, this was not possible since then new types of encoding were created. For example ISO-8859\u20131 encoding (also known as Latin_1) was thinking about Western Europe, like French, Spain, Portugal, but the problem still exists, what if a Japanese developer tries to read our file? Then again, a new encoding type, utf-8, was created, supporting over 1 million characters, including Arabic, Chinese, Russian characters and also special characters. Our file on the hard drive is written in bytes, so that we can know the correct way to read these bytes, encoding provides this so that we can find out the correct way to decode these bytes.", "First of all, to know the content of our file, we need to open it.", "The function, open return is a representation of our file or you can also understand as a file object. The second parameter of function open is the mode our file will be opened, in this case we use mode r. The third method is the encoding type.", "Now we will see three possible ways to read our file.", "Method readline: reads a single line from the file.", "Method readlines: returns a list were each item is a line on your file. So you can iterate over your content variable, to show all lines from your file.", "Method read: returns all the content of your file in a string format.", "We already know how to open an existing file, now we will understand how to write to a file.", "In this example, I will write to an existing file. When I use W (recording) mode, if you open the file, you will see that the old content has been deleted and now only the content we added is in the file. This is how the recording mode works.Another way to save files is using the A () mode, this mode does not replace the content of the file, instead, the new content is added at the end of the content of our file.", "You may ask yourself: why should I close my file? When I finish my task, everything will be cleared of the memory and everything is fine.", "Well, you are not wrong. When you are writing a file, Python only releases our file when our application is completely finished, ie if you have a running process or a big task that takes a long time to finish, if you write information to a file , you will not be able to access this content until your application is completely finished, the close method comes to help us solve exactly this problem.", "Thinking about the same scenario above, you have a long task that you need to insert some data in a file, and there are several routines that will be executed until your application is finished. However, you need to add more information to this file. Closing and opening the file is not the best solution.", "You can Flush, basicaly, forces Python to insert the things that already existed before in the file, so that if you open it even before your application is completely finished, the data will already be saved in the file.", "This method directs the memory pointer to the numerical position that is passed as a parameter, this function does not have a return, so you need to use it and then use a reading method to display its content exactly at the position you indicated.", "Working with Python files is easy, the way the language works and gives us feedback on what happens is impressive. With these exemplified methods you will be able to work effectively in some scenarios, but if you want to take a bigger step you must understand that the environment with file competition is a more complicated scenario, but more realistic, what was shown is is the basicsfor working with the files in a simple and correct way.", "Your home for data science.
