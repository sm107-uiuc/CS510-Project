So, last weekend we were discussing how badly we miss all that hustle-bustle \u2014 the buzz from the clubs, people hopping pubs, singing (or screaming) and dancing \u2014 the sound of people having a good time. It made me wonder how are the clubs all over the world adapting to these changes? My research led me to an e-commerce company in China called JD.com who was approached by some alcohol brands and together they partnered with a music company called Taihe Music Group to deliver a virtual clubbing experience. They streamed music directly to living rooms and sold alcohol online and delivered to the door.", "One of the alcohol brands reported a 70% increase in imported liquor sales and an 8x rise in whiskey sales compared to the previous day. The profits inspired JD.com to carry on with the virtual entertainment even after the lockdown was lifted in China. They had this huge e-commerce infrastructure that attracted alcohol brands to partner with them and together they created a new business to make money in such gloomy times.", "The crux of the story is \u2014 to adapt to changes quickly, to create new business models, and to deliver value to your existing customers while attracting new customers, you need to be digitally equipped. Digital Transformation is no more about moving from offline to online or just upgrading technology. It is about taking advantage of modern technology platforms to build a flexible, efficient, secure and informed business that is connected to its customers, not restricted to one value chain and can quickly evolve with changing times. Simply upgrading products or tools will not suffice in this age of information. Your digital transformation should be backed by a strong data strategy. So, why is a data strategy vital in digital transformation? Let me explain.", "Data helps you understand customer behaviour and how they prefer to engage with your products or services. It allows you to get closer to your customer, helps you tune your offerings to suit their needs and respond faster to changes (like COVID-19). If you are still relying on instincts to understand your customer\u2019s pulse, you are bound to lose to the competition, just like Blockbuster.", "The workforce of the future is not going to be in the office, remote working has gone mainstream now. It boosts employee satisfaction and improves productivity in some industries. It gives you the flexibility to recruit from all over the world tapping onto a global talent pool. Being able to manage your people while they are not at the office might be challenging as interactions become virtual, shorter and thinner. Data can help you understand your people, the way it helps you to understand your customer. It can help you create a better work culture, tailor development plans specific to individuals and also identify future leaders within your organisation.", "Data can provide you with insights on how well processes are performing, whether they have improved over time and are robust enough to survive unforeseen circumstances. Data can connect processes to people, identify key influencers of change and convert insights into actions.", "When you understand customer behaviour, it opens up new channels of opportunities. Predicting your customer needs can help you create new value propositions, discover potential customers and generate additional revenue. Curating data over time creates data reserves which could be monetized to add a new revenue stream.", "Technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality and Digital Twin offers enormous opportunities for innovation across all industries. However, if you do not collect and explore data relevant to your business and even other sectors, you will not be able to spot the weak signals that might lead you to the next big opportunity.", "\u201cMost of the world will make decisions by either guessing or using their gut. They will be either lucky or wrong.\u201d \u2014 Suhail Doshi", "First, you need a strategy that aligns with your business processes, people, and technology. Secondly, your people must realise the importance of data governance before jumping on the cooler end of the spectrum like AI. My colleague Brian Poore explains why in this article Data Knowledge: The Foundation of Data-driven Organisation. And you need to adopt the right technology capable of delivering a modern data platform and those platforms should integrate well with your existing tech stack. Read more on why your organisation should modernise its data platform.", "Data-driven digital transformation will work if it is equipped with the right data strategy, guided by robust data governance and enabled by a scalable, secure and consistent technology platform that helps you monitor processes, track costs and maximises the return on investment.", "Data is everywhere in your organisation, it connects people to processes and if managed efficiently, it will connect your business to new opportunities. A data-driven organisation is more likely to succeed because it achieves high operational efficiency, can adapt to changes quickly and meet customer demands faster. So, if you are investing in digital transformation, make sure you back it up by a data strategy.", "Now you might say (referring to the JD.com story) that a 70% increase in sales is not a good indicator if we don\u2019t have the baseline figures. You are right, but the point is, when uncertainty hit, the alcohol brands did not approach the big clubs for running the show, they went to an e-commerce company, who were digitally capable and had the data to support such a value chain.", "Tell me, do you think virtual clubbing is a good idea? Would you opt for clubbing virtually, saving yourself the crowded dance floors, long queues and bouncers denying entry for the wrong footwear?
