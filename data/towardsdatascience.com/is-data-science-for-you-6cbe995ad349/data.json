France? Brazil? Australia?", "Now ponder this; where did that answer come from? Did you sense it pop into your head?", "The author Sam Harris uses this question to highlight the fact that we do not \u2018choose\u2019 many, and arguably any of our seemingly conscious decisions. I want to suggest that this very same subconscious decision-making process is already at work in answering the question posed in the title of this blog post.", "I\u2019m not actually a very gut-led person in general. I tend to approach both major and minor life decisions with an often overly complex degree of pondering, sometimes even scoring different options in a spreadsheet (that sounds pretty ridiculous as I type it). Sometimes, however, your gut (well, your subconscious) can come up with some pretty decent answers.", "A number of years ago, I found myself working in an engineering department, doing a number of tasks related to the development of scientific equipment. I enjoyed the work, but something wasn\u2019t right.", "I\u2019d sort of drifted into the role from my physics background, and at first, when the company was small, I was able to be an engineering generalist. I really enjoyed that period, being able to do bits of everything, but as the company matured, I became increasingly surrounded by specialists. I was suddenly working with mechanical engineers, software engineers and electrical engineers who had only ever done those things and didn\u2019t care about anything else.", "I envied them. They all seemed to have a laser-focused vision of what they wanted to do with their careers and had absolutely no interest in veering outside of their core area. I, on the other hand, started to be given more and more project management responsibilities. After all, I was in the unique position of knowing a bit about everything, whilst not knowing enough to do the serious, hands-on specialist work. It made sense for me to be the overseer.", "One day, I decided that if I was going to support the engineers fully, I should increase my knowledge of their fields. I selected mechanical engineering first, and completed a basic SolidWorks qualification, and then moved on to brush up on my electronics. I signed up to a course and pledged to work through it in my spare time.", "However, as the months rolled by, I often found myself coming up with excuses as to why \u2018today wasn\u2019t the day\u2019 to work on the course. I also tried electronic projects, but again, progress was painfully slow.", "The reality was that I had no passion whatsoever for engineering. And I felt incredibly lost as to what to do about it.", "Then, in a meeting one afternoon, I overheard someone talking about a colleague who was working on \u2018an algorithm\u2019, but was struggling to find the time to get it finished. I had no idea what this really meant, but something about it intrigued me.", "I found the guy, spoke him about it, asked if I could be involved, and he happily off-loaded the whole thing to me. This was my first taste of what I later would discover was a simple machine-learning algorithm. Before I knew it, I was working my way through the Coursera Data Science Specialisation. I happily worked through the courses on my lunchtimes. Evenings were lost to it. Weekends were spent exploring dozens of new ideas in R. I found myself loving statistics, a subject I\u2019d hated at school because it had been taught completely devoid of any sense of real-world application.", "And I\u2019m not talking about the headline-making, bleeding-edge stuff. Sure, I later did courses and projects on deep learning and big data, but I enjoyed the more mundane stuff, too. I really like running a t-test, or cleaning data, or making a really nice plot. That might sound a bit sad, but then I\u2019ll never understand why anyone would ever watch a game of cricket. Each to their own I guess.", "And that was that. I suddenly realised one day that I\u2019d found what I wanted to do. Physics and engineering had been great, but this was something that felt like a hobby. And I haven\u2019t looked back since.", "The point is, I didn\u2019t consciously make this decision. It wasn't the result of some calculated, rational breakdown of career opportunities and salary scales. It wasn\u2019t based upon a careful study of industries and companies. It just felt right and fun and interesting.", "So, my advice to you is this. If you\u2019re considering getting into data science, or you\u2019re already in it, and this isn\u2019t how you feel, it might not be for you. If you\u2019re doing data science for the kudos, the money or the idea of only ever working on super-cool AI projects, you might need to think again.", "After-all, there probably is something out there that you love, and if you\u2019re going to be doing it for tens of hours a week, for several decades, don\u2019t you want to find it?", "Explore as many avenues as you can. You\u2019ll know when something clicks. Don\u2019t worry about your age. Don\u2019t worry about having to learn a tonne of new stuff. Don\u2019t worry about ditching developed skills in other areas (they\u2019ll probably come in handy, anyway). You\u2019ll be much happier in the long run.", "Your home for data science.
