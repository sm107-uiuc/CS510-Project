Up to this date, it has accumulated over 18M views and 385K subscribers, so you know that it\u2019s good.", "In this Q&A, I wanted to learn more about how StatQuest started out and give practical advice for aspiring data scientists, so with that said, enjoy!", "Not long ago, I worked in a research lab doing statistical analysis on the data that my co-workers created. Because I didn\u2019t want my analysis to be like \u201cmagic\u201d, I created little tutorials on basic statistics for them. I put these on youtube for future reference; when someone new came to the lab, they could watch the video whenever they needed to learn the concept. I also added cooking tips videos because I love to cook and frequently shared recipes with my co-workers.", "So \u201cStatQuest\u201d started out as just a collection of videos for friends and co-workers. For the first few years, only friends and co-workers watched my videos, and I got between 5 and 20 views each month. However, at one point, someone outside of my circle stumbled onto one of my videos and shared it on a blog. And then more and more people started to watch the videos. Now over 1,000,000 people watch the videos each month.", "Short version: Zero time! I think of the silly songs on the spur of the moment and record them as quickly as possible.", "Longer version: Each video I make takes a long time. I have to research a topic, draw all the pictures, and write the script. Then I have to record and edit the voice over. The whole process can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months. Actually, I have worked on a few videos, like my PCA video, for years before they were done. However, the very last thing I do is record the silly song. It\u2019s my way of celebrating the completion of a big project.", "I love \u201cLinear Models\u201d. Does that count? It\u2019s actually a collection of important (and favorite) concepts.", "One is R\u00b2 (R-squared). I love R\u00b2 because it is 1) meaningful, 2) relatively easy to interpret and 3) can be easily calculated in a very wide variety of situations.", "However, it\u2019s meaningless without p-values, so I like p-values, and both are created so eloquently by Linear Models. I love them! BAM!", "I love \u201ctree-based\u201d methods, like Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost. I love them because they start out so simple and easy, but you can build on them to create very sophisticated models that are state of the art. Double BAM! To be honest, it\u2019s hard to have a least favorite algorithm because you never know when it might be the one that saves the day.", "I struggle with most of the concepts that I teach in my videos. PCA was very hard for me. So was Gradient Boosting, and I mulled over Neural Networks for years before I really understood how they worked.", "Linear Models \u2014 R\u00b2, p-values, and the relationship between something you want to predict and the data that you are using to make the predictions.", "Doing Statistics and Data Science means doing hard work, but it is also exciting because we use the tools to learn things that have never been known before. Every time you do a statistical analysis or build a machine learning model, you will create insights into data that have never been made before. This is cool! So don\u2019t lose sight of that and have fun and be proud that you are on the cutting edge of knowledge.", "I hope that you found this article insightful and entertaining! It was a huge privilege to be able to interview Josh.", "If you\u2019ve read my previous articles, \u201cHow I\u2019d Learn Data Science if I Could Start Over (2 Years In)\u201d or \u201c5 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Learning Data Science\u201d, you\u2019ll know that I\u2019m a huge advocate in learning statistics fundamentals early on in your data science career, so check out his channel if you haven\u2019t already!", "Not sure what to read next?
