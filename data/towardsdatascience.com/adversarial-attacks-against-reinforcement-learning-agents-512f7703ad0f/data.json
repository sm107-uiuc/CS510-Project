Well, Sandy and Ian\u2019s paper sits at the intersection of adversarial attacks and reinforcement learning, another area we\u2019ve discussed quite a bit on the podcast. In their paper, they describe how adversarial attacks can also be effective at targeting neural network policies in reinforcement learning. Sandy gives us an overview of the paper, including how changing a single pixel value can throw off performance of a model trained to play Atari games. We also cover a lot of interesting topics relating to adversarial attacks and RL individually, and some related areas such as hierarchical reward functions and transfer learning. This was a great conversation that I\u2019m really excited to bring to you!", "I\u2019d like to send a huge shout out to everyone who participated in the TWiML Online Meetup earlier this week. In our community segment we had a very fun and wide ranging discussion about freezing your brain (and if you missed that startup\u2019s announcement you probably have no idea what I\u2019m talking about), ML and AI in the healthcare space, and more. Community member Nicholas Teague,\u200f who goes by @_NicT_ on twitter, also briefly spoke about his essay \u201cA Toddler Learns to Speak\u201d, where he explores connections between different modalities in machine learning. Finally, a hearty thank you to Sean Devlin, who presented a deep dive on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Google DeepMind\u2019s seminal paper in the space. Check out the video recording and details on next month\u2019s meetup at twimlai.com/meetup.", "Are you an IT, technology or business leader who needs to get smart on the broad spectrum of machine learning and AI opportunities in the enterprise? Or, perhaps someone in your organization could benefit from a level-up in this area? (Or, maybe you would benefit from them leveling up!) If this sounds like you, or someone you know, you\u2019ll probably be interested in my upcoming AI Summit event.", "Think of the event as a two-day, no-fluff, Technical MBA in machine learning & AI. You\u2019ll leave with a clear understanding of:", "\u2022How machine learning and deep learning work (no math required)\u2022How to identify machine learning and deep learning opportunities in your organization\u2022How to understand and take advantage of technologies like computer vision and natural language processing\u2022How to manage and label data to take advantage of ML and AI\u2022And how to build an AI-first culture, and operationalize AI in your business.", "You\u2019ll have an informed perspective on what\u2019s going on across the ML and AI landscape, and will be able to engage confidently in discussions about machine learning and AI with your colleagues, customers and partners. I\u2019m super excited about this event and the speakers you\u2019ll get a chance to learn from.
