In pursuit of this understanding and its respective implementation, we set out three questions that must be answered:", "1) Which Customers Have the Highest Probability of Churning Soon?", "2) What is the Lifetime Value for Each of Our Customers?", "3) What Retention Offer is Most Appropriate for each Customer?", "In addressing Question #1, we developed a churn prediction model that provided several strategies we can leverage in identifying high risk customers/members. As there is no single, optimal strategy due to the various trade-offs, the determination on which specific strategy to use would be based entirely on the amount we would be willing to invest as an attempt to prevent the existing members from leaving.", "\u201cSo how much should we invest into each of our high-risk customers\u201d you ask? Well, that\u2019s completely dependent on how much we expect them to purchase and contribute over their lifetime. This expectation is referred to as a customer\u2019s Lifetime Value (LTV).", "This article is written as a \u201cfollow-along\u201d to my repo. Here, I will cover the main ideas, results, and inferences I came across over the course of this project. Now, let\u2019s go ahead and jump straight to Question #2:", "What is the Lifetime Value for Each of Our Customers?", "Lifetime Value (LTV) and Why is it important?", "Often when we think of customer acquisition and retention we immediately move into a cost minimizing (the floor) state of mind. Yet, how is it that when we hire talent we want the best and we are willing to pay (the ceiling) for the best? We need to apply this same exact logic to our Customer Acquisition and Retention efforts. We shouldn\u2019t be obsessing over pennies if there are dollars to be gained!", "LTV, aka Value of Acquisition-Retention, is defined as the present value of the future (net) cash flows. This is a forward-looking concept and is not a measure of past profitability.", "So how do we calculate LTV? Well, it depends. All revenue streams can be boiled down to either a Contractual or Non-Contractual model. The main difference being that in a contractual setting we observe the time when our customers \u201cdie\u201d (example: an application that offers a monthly subscription and a customer doesn\u2019t re-subscribe), whereas in a non-contractual setting, the exact time in which a customer becomes inactive is not observed (example: a customer making a purchase from an ecommerce site and never returning).", "Each of these models carry their own unique way of evaluating LTV, thus we will only cover discrete, contractual calculations as our use-case deals with a subscription-based, fixed-price business. If you are interested in Non-Contractual LTV analysis, you can refer to this great tutorial.", "Calculating LTV in a Discrete, Contractual Setting \u2014 The Game Plan:", "1) Conduct a Survival Analysis and analyze the survival probabilities of each of our members using Kaplan Meier curves.", "2) Create a Cox Proportional Hazard Model (Survival Regression) to investigate the relationship between the survival time (expected lifetime) and our variables.", "3) Use this regression model to determine expected lifetime for all members and calculate their respective LTVs.", "4) Revisit our Churn Model and the identified high-risk members.", "Addressing the question \u2018how long would it be before a particular event occurs\u2019, Survival Analysis is a branch of statistics originally used in medical and biological disciplines to study the survival times of trial patients suffering from major diseases. Simply put, we refer to this as a \u2018time to event\u2019 analysis. This technique can be further applied not just to traditional death events, but to many different types of events of interest in different business domains.", "Survival analysis works well in situations where we can define:", "Keep in mind, however, that this is more of an Exploratory Data Analysis technique used to evaluate the expected lifetime of different cohort groups by visualizing their respective cumulative probabilities for survival over time. The visual representation of this function is typically referred to as the Kaplan-Meier curve, and it demonstrates the probability of an event (for example, survival) at a certain time interval.", "Similar to how we would conduct a bi-variate EDA to understand the behavior and potential effect of individual features before creating a regression model, we conduct a Survival Analysis before creating a Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) Regression. Let\u2019s now see what information we can gather using a specific type of survival curves called Kaplan-Meier Curves.", "The curve above provides some intuition related to the health of our population. Overall, retention seems relatively strong with our members having an ~80% probability of survival at 4000 days. This shows that KKBox is quite a healthy business as the odds of a customer surviving are high. Let\u2019s now break up our data into various cohorts to develop a solid foundation before determining the Lifetime Value for our customers.", "In a previous project, we identified the following 4 cohorts based on user activity:", "Here we see a clear separation between Cluster 1 (The Less-Active Minority) and the other cohorts. This is a solid follow-up to our segmentation analysis as it further demonstrates how Cluster 1 clearly has the worst expected lifetime of the group (75% Survival vs ~89% for the other groups @ 4000 days). However, in the long run, having your worst customers with 75% chance of survival at ~11 years is a GREAT problem to have.", "Although KKBox doesn\u2019t provide much information on values for the Registration Method, I find it to be an interesting feature as it could potentially represent \u2018how\u2019 the user was on-boarded to the platform.", "One of the luxuries of conducting a survival analysis is that we can clearly see the exact factors that contribute to both strong and weak members. Here we see a clear difference in survival rate over all 4 registration methods, with registered_via = 9 and 3 outperforming the rest. Members with registered_via = 10 and 4 seem to die almost instantly. If our assumption of this feature is true, then through attribution we could make a strong case for redistributing our resources in the former 2 methods to acquire more long-lasting members.", "From the perspective of process improvement, survival curves also act as a prompt in investigating why 4 and 10 performed so poorly. This is a great example of how we can use survival curves for Optimizing User Acquisition by evaluating marketing campaigns and the types of customers they produce for our company.", "Companies that utilize subscriptions usually offer various tiers for customers. Typically, one of those tiers are highlighted or distinguished as the company is purposely trying to lure customers to select a default package. With Survival Analysis we can ask the question: How does the choice of what we default people into for these subscriptions impact how long they stay with us as customers?", "Here we can see that the choice of plan has a significant effect on membership duration. The plans with larger durations have a worse survivor rate over time compared to the 30-day monthly plan. This could be because once a plan expires, people with large plan durations are less willing to re-subscribe at the same high, one-time payment. Furthermore, what makes this chart so valuable for us is that it tells us how we could Optimize Customer Activation.", "Should we default everyone on a 30-day plan then? Well, that depends on the current business strategy. If a business is looking for increased revenue in the short term (365 days or less) for cash flow purposes, defaulting users to the 360-day plan would likely be best. But if the business is prioritizing long-term customer health and equity, then the 30-Day plan is the obvious candidate.", "Not only are these Kaplan Meier plots visually appealing, but they clearly explain the underlying patterns with our existing customers. It is such a simple and rudimentary tool, yet it provides valuable information on which we can make clear, effective decisions. Don\u2019t forget, all this insight came simply from calculating the cumulative marginal rate from just two features (tenure and churn)!", "As previously discussed, our Kaplan Meier curves work with only one feature and ignore the effects of all other features. Hence arises the need for a better model that can simultaneously assess the impact of all numeric and multiple predictors on survival times.", "Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) is a commonly used, semi-parametric model used for investigating the relationship between the survival time and all our variables (including categorical and quantitative predictors). It returns the Expected lifetime for each user by cumulatively calculating an individual\u2019s risk of \u201cdeath\u201d over time for a given rate of hazard. These \u2018Hazards\u2019 can be thought of as something that would increase/decrease chances of survival. In our business problem, for example, a hazard may be the associated likelihood of death (customer churn) due to the type of contract a customer has or the way they registered for the app.", "We must emphasize again that the main point of running a CPH regression model is not to analyze who dies and who does not die. Rather, we do this to study effects of our features (also called covariates) on the timing of death. The result of said study is the ability to predict a user\u2019s expected lifetime, which we then in turn use to calculate their respective lifetime value.", "The resulting model summary is quite elaborate, so for now we will only focus on the key output: exp(coef). This is interpreted as the scaling of hazard (risk) for each additional unit of the variable:", "Now that we have a CPH regression model, we can now calculate expected lifetime and lifetime value.", "Here we see Observed Tenure and our newly calculated Expected Lifetime. In comparing both plots we can see that our current member population is quite young in terms of tenure. With a median age of ~1000 days and the rate in which our members are churning (death event), we can expect our members to remain with us for a median of 4000 days (~11 years).", "As mentioned earlier, Expected Lifetime Value is calculated as the present value of the future (net) cash flows. We calculate this assuming a weighted average monthly cost of $9.50 (~$0.32 per day, USD conversion) at an arbitrary yearly discount rate of 10% (in practice, discount rates are usually 6\u201312%,).", "With a total LTV of $819.45 over 4000 days, we see how mass adoption is critical for this business model to be successful. It is important to note that this calculation does not account for a member\u2019s tenure, meaning the Total LTV of $443,914,440.78 is inclusive of past value that our members have already contributed to the company. However, we are more interested in determining how much remaining value can we expect a member to contribute.", "For our use-case, this is much more valuable, as we now have a realistic perspective on what to expect over time. In addition, we can see how LTV dips into the negatives and thus we can identify living users who were expected to be dead based on our estimate for Lifetime. To understand this better, it helps to interpret them as an absolute value representing the additional amount of value these members have contributed past their respective LTV amounts.", "This is just another great insight LTV modeling offers as these members could potentially belong to Cluster 3 (The Power Users) and would be candidates for potential premium up-selling. Even from a company valuation standpoint, we can make a very strong argument as to what this company is actually worth based solely on this distribution.", "In the previous project, we set out to answer the question: Which Customers Have The Highest Probability of Churning Soon? And although we created several models that could easily answer this question, we still did not have enough information to select the best model for our business. We concluded that since we did not know each customer\u2019s worth, we couldn\u2019t properly determine what treatment would effectively convince them to stay with us. The cost of this treatment is what ultimately decides which model we should use, as these models gave us a clear understanding of risk and reward depending on the strategy. Now that we know how much our customers are worth to us, let\u2019s revisit our previous models and quantify the risk-reward trade-off between the two.", "Before we continue, this is a great place to briefly mention a small disclaimer for LTV Analysis. At the end of the day, LTV is to be used and treated as a temporary snapshot. It should be treated as an effect, NOT a cause. Thus, the change in value should be the result of the actions we take in marketing, products, communication strategy, etc. With that in mind, even as we witness a strong survival rate of 4000 days, it would not be wise to assume that this survival rate will remain constant over time. We will therefore use our current model to make inferences using LTV values capped over the next three years.", "So, if we did not intervene, and all our actual high-risk members churned, what would be the total potential loss of value? The answer is $5,833,677.41 over the next three years. That is the summation of the Expected, Remaining LTV for the members who are Actually High-Risk. But what if we did intervene? How much are you willing to spend to have a chance at retaining this value?", "GBT 1:1 Ratio Model \u2014 Too Many False Negatives", "In this model, we give up on 2,618 members, leaving ~$764K on the table so we can have a chance at retaining 17,305 members with a remaining LTV of $5.07 Million over three years. However, this comes with a catch. In order to reach all 17,305 members, we would have to re-approach the 94,020 members who were Marked as High-Risk.", "GBT 13:1 Ratio Model \u2014 Too Many False Positives", "This model essentially gives up on 11,670 members, leaving $3.24 Million on the table so we can have a chance at retaining 8,253 members with a remaining LTV of $2.41 Million. The advantage of this model is that we only have 15,559 members identified as Actually High-Risk. This means that \u201cproportionally\u201d compared to other models, we don\u2019t need to approach as many people to reach those users who are Actually High-Risk.", "With this information, we now have the framework to make actual decisions. As an example, let\u2019s evaluate each model at a single treatment cost to better understand their overall cost and ROI . Let\u2019s start with some assumptions:", "Because of LTV modeling, we can make informed decisions on which model strategy we should choose. By only going after customers who have the potential to give us a reasonable ROI, we can ensure we spend our money wisely. It is also important to note that this is merely an exercise to view the effect of cost on each of our models. In reality, we would not give all members the same treatment as customers are NEVER HOMOGENEOUS. When we ignore Customer Heterogeneity, we waste valuable resources on chasing product sales from anyone and everyone, at any cost. We\u2019ll look at this later.", "With the presented models and their associated amounts of risk, reward, and the cost, we can simply decide how much are we willing to spend.", "We started this article with the need to understand LTV so we could determine how much we can spend to convince a high-risk customer to reconsider their exit. This cost was crucial as it would spell out the trade-off posed by each of our model strategies in terms of cost and potential gains. While executing this calculation, we were actually able to get a little more in terms of value through the calculation.", "One of the luxuries of conducting a survival analysis is that we can clearly see the exact factors contributing to both strong and weak members, allowing us to redistribute resources as necessary to better focus acquisition efforts.", "Although it is commonly believed that long-term plans are best for business, this analysis made a strong case for the opposite using relatively limited data. Insights such as this which make survival analyses invaluable for all businesses.", "Cost of Acquisition vs Value of Acquisition", "As I mentioned before, we often seek to minimize costs in customer acquisition and retention yet are willing to pay a premium for the best talent. LTV is a valuable tool that can be used to find and acquire the Best Members. We shouldn\u2019t be obsessing over pennies when there are dollars to be gained!", "Let\u2019s look at our third and final question:", "What Retention Offer is Most Appropriate for each Customer?", "The deliberate answer for this question, unfortunately, goes beyond the scope of this project. But the main idea behind answering it is the acknowledgement that all customers are not created equal. As we stated before, we gave all customers identical treatment as a mere demonstration of showing the effect of cost on a churn model. In reality, the problem with treating all customers as equals lies in the false idea of the existence of \u201cThe Average Customer.\u201d With this approach, we fail to recognize the distinct attributes of our customers on a more granular level. When we ignore Customer Heterogeneity, we waste valuable resources on chasing product sales from anyone and everyone, at any cost. LTV is what we use to understand the right price for right customer. After distributing these treatments across all high-risk customers, a model can be created to understand which treatments proved to be most effective.", "One way we can look at properly answering this question is through a Segment, Target, Position approach. From a general perspective, we can segment our customer base solely on CLV into three groups and define a simple theme on how to treat them:", "In leveraging LTV, everything I presented here in this project adds a fresh perspective on how we approach churn modeling projects. This is especially true since they aren\u2019t as one dimensional as many assume. What was most impressive about this project was the amount of inference that we were able to derive with respect to Customer Acquisition, Activation, and Retention. This demonstrates how Lifetime Value is an invaluable tool that no business should operate without, yet is not talked about enough. Cheers!", "I hope you enjoyed these articles!
