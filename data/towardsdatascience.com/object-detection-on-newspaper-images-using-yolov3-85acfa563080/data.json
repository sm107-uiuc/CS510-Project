To fix this the model should be able to identify sections on the document and draw a bounding box around it an perform OCR. It was this moment when applying Yolo Object detection on such images came into mind.", "YOLOv3 is extremely fast and accurate. In mAP measured at .5 IOU YOLOv3 is on par with Focal Loss but about 4x faster. Moreover, you can easily tradeoff between speed and accuracy simply by changing the size of the model, no retraining required!", "First of all I needed a dataset of labelled images to train the Yolo model and there were none available so I decided to make my own. Found an excellent tool written in Python to label images according to the Yolo format Link. After hours of mouse pointing and drawing bounding boxed and manually labelling newspaper images I ended up with a 32 image dataset with 4 classes", "I\u2019ve uploaded the dataset on Kaggle as well as Github for further use by anyone. (Link Below)", "The model architecture we\u2019ll use is called YOLOv3, or You Only Look Once, by Joseph Redmon. This specific model is a one-shot learner, meaning each image only passes through the network once to make a prediction, which allows the architecture to be very performant, viewing up to 60 frames per second in predicting against video feeds. Fundamentally, YOLO divides an image into subcomponents, and conducts convolutions on each of those subcomponents before pooling back to create a prediction. A recommended deeper dive on YOLO is available here.", "Now, even though we\u2019re training our model on a custom dataset, it is still advantageous to use another already trained model\u2019s weights as a starting point. Think of this like we want to climb a mountain as quickly as possible, and instead of starting completely from scratch in creating our own trail, we\u2019ll start with assuming that someone else\u2019s trail is a better faster than us randomly trying to guess twists and turns to follow.", "To power our model\u2019s computation, we\u2019ll be using Google Colab, which provides free GPU compute resources (up to 24 hours with your browser open).", "Started off by cloning Joseph Redmond\u2019s Github repo. This provides most of the tools required to train object detection models on the fly.", "Edit the yolo-v3.cfg file to configure it according to your requirements", "You need to put your no. of classes in the first line, train.txt and test.txt path in 2nd and 3rd line, object.names path in the 4th line.", "Now you need to edit the *.cfg file. By default each YOLO layer has 255 outputs: 85 outputs per anchor [4 box coordinates + 1 object confidence + 80 class confidences], times 3 anchors.", "In our case we are using only four classes, then we need to edit the filter. You can reduce filters to filters=[4 + 1 + n] * 3, where n is your class count. This modification should be made to the layer preceding each of the 3 YOLO layers. Also, modify classes=80 to classes=n in each YOLO layer, where n is your class count.", "Change num classes to the number of classes you want to detect and we\u2019re good to start training.", "And after thousands of lines of console outputs and a few hours \u2026", "With the help of image augmentation, a small dataset of 32 images with 2 hours of training was able to produce results with upwards of 98% confidence. Considering newspapers are very complicated documents with a focus on fitting a lot of content the model performed very well. Similar models can be trained for various tasks like verifying Id\u2019s, validating physical forms, converting handwritten notes and many more!", "Please feel free to clap if you like what I did!
