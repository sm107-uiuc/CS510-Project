In this story, we are going to study a social distancing problem and find solution to it using Genetic Algorithms. After setting the problem and its constraints, I\u2019ll summarize the principles of Genetic Algorithms (GA) before applying these principles to our problem.", "This summer (August 2020), people from Neo4j (the graph database) proposed weekly challenges to be solved with graphs. The advanced barbecue challenges of week 1 comprises a social distancing task, whose rules where the following:", "While this problem can be solved with graphs (see the proposed solution here: https://medium.com/neo4j/summer-of-nodes-week-1-the-barbecue-ead98d441a91), it sounds to me like a constraint problem that can be addressed with other techniques. In this post, I investigate the use of GA to solve this specific problem.", "Talking about GA, let\u2019s focus on the main principles behind this technique and how this kind of algorithms can help solving the above problem.", "Contrarily to the common approaches, GA does not consider a single solution and update it depending on some conditions (gradient\u2026.). Instead, GA will consider a population of solutions, and evolve them over several generations based on a selection process biased towards the \u201cbest\u201d individuals. This involve being able to determine \u201chow good\u201d a solution is, or how far it is from the best solution through a fitness function. The steps of the algorithm are hence:", "Let\u2019s now come back to our social distancing problem.", "A solution for us will be a list with the seat assigned to each guest. A seat is an integer whose value is equal to", "For instance, the seat 2 in table 4 corresponds to the integer 42.", "This works fine as long as we have less than 10 seats per table.", "Hence, a solution can be written:", "The guest with index 0 (the Host) is assigned to table 1 (0-based indexed) and seat 4. The equivalent tables are reproduced below:", "-1 is the default value for empty seats.", "Now that we have a representation for each solution, let\u2019s define its fitness, i.e. its \u201ccloseness\u201d to an satisfactory solution.", "To define fitness, we have to take into account each of the three constraints defined in the problem definition section, plus the fact that each seat must be assigned only once. Each time a constraint is violated, the fitness will be increased accordingly.", "In order to count how many times a seat is assigned, we use the collections.Counter python object and check that each value appears less than once. Otherwise, we return a high fitness value:", "After that, we can create the tables, a 2D matrix whose ij elements contains the guest family for seat j of table i. For instance:", "For each table (row), we can count how many families are represented and increase the violations for this table by 1 if there are less than two families on that table:", "Using the same counter, we can count how many individuals from the same family are seated at the same table, and increase the fitness if too many of them are present:", "Finally comes the most complex part: the social distancing between guests from different families.", "To compute this constraint, we are going to use collections.deque objects which comes with a practical .rotate() method. Practical because we have a boundary condition for guests seated on seat 0 and 5 of the same table, which are only 1 meter apart (and not 5). First, we create the deque:", "Then, we create another instance with the same input list, but this deque is then rotated:", "For instance, starting from the table:", "The td and tdr variables would contain:", "From there, we can iterate over both deque . If the two values are equals to -1 (meaning no guest is assigned to that seat), we do nothing. Otherwise, we check that the two guests seated next to each other are from the same family, otherwise we increase the fitness:", "And here we go, our fitness function is finally ready!", "We have only done half of the work though, since we need to configure the genetic algorithm parameters. Hopefully, we won\u2019t have to code all of them ourselves, since very smart people have already done it for us (thank you!).", "In order to implement the GA part of our problem, we are going to rely on the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) Python package.", "The main steps are reproduced below:", "The core of the algorithm is then encapsulated into:", "The hall of fame contains best performing individual, regardless of the generation they belongs to. They are the solutions we are interested in.", "After running the full code (available on GitHub), we can see that the 10 best performing individuals in the hall of fame all have a 0 fitness, meaning no constraint violation. One of them is reproduced here:", "Here we go, we have solved a social distancing problem using the power of Genetic Algorithms. You will be able to meet your friends at a barbecue while limiting the risks related to Covid-19!", "You can download this code and try and modify the parameters and see how the solver behaves. Both the input parameters (guests, number of tables\u2026), and the model parameters (size of the population, probability of mutation, type of cross over\u2026) can be changed.", "Enjoyed this post?
