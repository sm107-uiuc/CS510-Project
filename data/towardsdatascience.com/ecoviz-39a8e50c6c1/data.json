Bicycle use has very well known health benefits and saves travel times over short distances to users, while helping the environment, and decreasing traffic congestion in the city.", "The amount of data generated by ECOBICI is immense since one record is generated per trip, each of these trips register fields such as:", "To begin to understand the ECOBICI system, let\u2019s start by visualizing the travel distributions over a week.", "These defined patterns for business days, Friday and weekend immediately stand out when we view the withdrawals as a time series, let\u2019s see the average distributions for each type of day in April 2019.", "It is interesting to see the clear distinction between business days and weekends. Between business days the distributions appear to be identical with the exception of Friday afternoon. On holidays, which in Figure 2. coincide with the days of easter holiday week, the distribution is almost identical to that of weekends. The working days are those that have the most trips, these days have a bimodal distribution, with the peaks coinciding with the hours of entry and exit of the workday. On weekends the system reaches its maximum use at noon.", "The working days are the most active with 2 clear peak hours in the morning and in the afternoon, seeing the previous graphs we can affirm without fear that the working days are practically identical, that is why we think that visualizing the activity in a working day can be enough to understand most of the activity in the system.", "The following video shows the total activity of ECOBICI on June 12, 2019, this day was selected because it is an ordinary working day in the sample, being careful not to take atypical days due to weather or other reasons. This day there were 32,363 trips in total, with 3,738 trips per hour during peak hours.", "Feel free to pause during peak hours (8am and 8pm approx.).", "Let\u2019s take the time to understand the previous graph and thus be able to extract all the information it gives. Let\u2019s start by visualizing the stations as each of the circles. The size of the circle corresponds to the sum of withdrawals and arrivals that were in that station per hour, with 140 arrivals plus withdrawals the maximum activity per hour in a station. Each of these stations is colored inside and outside. The interior color responds to the balance presented per hour, that is, if there have been more withdrawals or arrivals in one hour at that station. A dark red responds only to withdrawals and a dark blue to arrivals, white shows a perfect balance. Exterior color corresponds to the state of the station, that is, the proportion of the bicycle spaces occupied by an ECOBICI in that station at the time cut, a dark red color responds to a station without available bicycles while a white color shows a fully occupied station. Trips are defined by straight lines between 2 stations showing the number of trips per hour.", "A reproduction of the video allows to correctly identify the peak hours, it is also possible to see how in the mornings, the stations near public transport such as Polanco and Buenavista subway stations are the starting points of most trips, trips that end in areas with high labour as some parts of Polanco and Reforma Avenue. This phenomenon reproduces almost identical in the afternoon but in the opposite direction, now the areas with high labour turn out to be the starting points and the arrival points are intersections with public transport of higher reach. Let\u2019s see a single frame of the video for the morning rush hour.", "The display highlights the saturation of the system at its periphery. This suggests that a big part of the users of the system are arriving from other places, and that they would probably be interested in a wider coverage of the system.", "In addition, if we focus on the state of the stations (the edge of each circle), it is possible to see that after each burst of arrivals and departures, the stations are full and empty, stations with many arrivals become saturated (white borders) in opposition to the ones having many withdrawals which become empty (black edges).", "The particular dynamics of shared bicycle systems suggest emphasizing in inventory optimization through rebalancing, as shown in \u2014 Castillo, 2019. to avoid saturation and gaps.", "Who are the users of ECOBICI? By the distribution of trips on business days we can infer that in general, these users correspond to workers. Let\u2019s go a little further and try to better understand their profiles with the following graphics.", "Seeing the big differences in use by sex can be an alarm screaming a gender problem exists, in a deeper analysis this difference could be visualized in each of the stations to indicate more or less safe areas for women in the panorama of the city that ECOBICI covers.", "On the other hand, the distribution of ages highlights areas of opportunity for social programs such as the inclusion of teenagers into the system, or the possibility of encouraging physical activity in people over 40 years old.", "Now let\u2019s loose a little focus on ECOBICI and get some perspective on scale, let\u2019s see the system wrapped by the city.", "ECOBICI occupies a very small area of Mexico City! However, it is important to understand that almost a third of Mexico City is occupied by forested regions around Milpa Alta and El Ajusco, so let\u2019s focus only on the urban area by zooming in a bit.", "The opportunity to extend the system is immense, including a possible integration with urban areas in the state of Mexico and integrations with other transport systems with greater reach. It also gives rise to the imagination of being able to include mountain ecobicis in rural areas among other possible programs that would for sure promote social welfare.", "Since this article is a visualization exercise, we created the following graph with the idea that it could be observed in a print of significant size. It shows the aggregate activity of ECOBICI during the month of September 2019. If we zoom in the graph we can observe in detail the name of each station, its activity, the flows between stations as well as the subway stations near the system.", "Approaching this visualization allows you to generate a fairly robust first idea of \u200b\u200ba possible new network of bicycle paths and stations. Excused requirements because many of these routes are already being occupied, setting aside some meters on public roads for the flow of these eco-cyclists and cyclists would recognize them and provide them with security from the government, in addition to favoring intelligent mobility systems even with the few incentives that exist for them. Scaling these forms of mobility would improve many social variables that are currently in red numbers.", "Proper attention on the scale of contemporary social projects is one of the most important variables in their success, which is why we believe in cooperation. We are also sure that the search and validation of public solutions must be a collective exercise, therefore, all the analysis developed in this project can be replicated, as all scripts are available in this public repository . The original Spanish article was designed in a Jupyter Notebook while the content was made 50% in Python with matplotlib graphics and 50% in R with ggplot to mention some of the free software libraries that were occupied. We are proud to announce that it won the first place in a data visualization contest held by CIMAT!", "The correct interpretation of the data allows the necessary leverage for an effective implementation of public policies, we celebrate the recent announcement issued by the secretary of mobility for a new tender for the ECOBICI system and we hope that the winner takes into account the existing information, the previous solution has been a success, however it has reached saturation. It would be great if the new solution could be better adopted by women and youngsters as well as people from different colonies.", "We hope that these visualizations have been sufficient to support our narrative in addition to generating others in the minds of the readers.", "Your home for data science.
