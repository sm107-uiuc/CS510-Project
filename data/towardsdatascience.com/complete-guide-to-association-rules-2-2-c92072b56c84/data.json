Part 1 of this blog covers the terminology and concepts that form the foundation of association rule mining. Motivation behind this whole concept and meaning of some basic terms is explained there. Here are very brief definitions of some terms from the previous part.", "Now that we are familiar with these terms, lets proceed ahead with extracting the rules from a list of transactions. The very first step in the process is to get a list of all the items occurring at least once in our set of transactions.", "The challenge is the mining of important rules from a massive number of association rules that can be derived from a list of items.", "Remember, rule-generation is a two step process. First is to generate an itemset like {Bread, Egg, Milk} and second is to generate a rule from each itemset like {Bread \u2192 Egg, Milk}, {Bread, Egg \u2192 Milk} etc. Both the steps are discussed below.", "First step in generation of association rules is to get all the frequent itemsets on which binary partitions can be performed to get the antecedent and the consequent. For example, if there are 6 items {Bread, Butter, Egg, Milk, Notebook, Toothbrush} on all the transactions combined, itemsets will look like {Bread}, {Butter}, {Bread, Notebook}, {Milk, Toothbrush}, {Milk, Egg, Vegetables} etc. Size of an itemset can vary from one to the total number of items that we have. Now, we seek only frequent itemsets from this and not all so as to put a check on the number of total itemsets generated.", "Frequent itemsets are the ones which occur at least a minimum number of times in the transactions. Technically, these are the itemsets for which support value (fraction of transactions containing the itemset) is above a minimum threshold \u2014 minsup.", "So, {Bread, Notebook} might not be a frequent itemset if it occurs only 2 times out of 100 transactions and (2/100) = 0.02 falls below the value of minsup.", "A brute force approach to find frequent itemsets is to form all possible itemsets and check the support value of each of these. Apriori principle helps in making this search efficient. It states that", "All subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent.", "This is equivalent to saying that number of transactions containing items {Bread, Egg} is greater than or equal to number of transactions containing {Bread, Egg, Vegetables}. If the latter occurs in 30 transactions, former is occurring in all 30 of them and possibly will occur in even some more transactions. So if support value of {Bread, Egg, Vegetables} i.e. (30/100) = 0.3 is above minsup, then we can be assured that support value of {Bread, Egg} i.e. (>30/100) = >0.3 is above minsup too. This is called the anti-monotone property of support where if we drop out an item from an itemset, support value of new itemset generated will either be the same or will increase.", "Apriori principle is a result of anti-monotone property of support.", "Apriori principle allows us to prune all the supersets of an itemset which does not satisfy the minimum threshold condition for support. For example, if {Milk, Notebook} does not satisfy our threshold of minsup, an itemset with any item added to this will never cross the threshold too.", "The methodology that results is called the apriori algorithm. Steps involved are:", "Generate all frequent itemsets (support \u2265 minsup) having only one item. Next, generate itemsets of length 2 as all possible combinations of above itemsets. Then, prune the ones for which support value fell below minsup.", "Now generate itemsets of length 3 as all possible combinations of length 2 itemsets (that remained after pruning) and perform the same check on support value.", "We keep increasing the length of itemsets by one like this and check for the threshold at each step.", "As can be seen from the graphic, pruning of infrequent itemsets reduces the number of itemsets to be considered by more than half! This proportion of reduction in computational power becomes more and more significant as the number of items increases.", "This proportion also depends on the minimum support threshold (minsup) that we pick up which is completely subjective to the problem at hand and can be based on past experience.", "Once the frequent itemsets are generated, identifying rules out of them is comparatively less taxing. Rules are formed by binary partition of each itemset. If {Bread,Egg,Milk,Butter} is the frequent itemset, candidate rules will look like:", "From a list of all possible candidate rules, we aim to identify rules that fall above a minimum confidence level (minconf). Just like the anti-monotone property of support, confidence of rules generated from the same itemset also follows an anti-monotone property. It is anti-monotone with respect to the number of elements in consequent.", "As we know that support of all the rules generated from same itemset remains the same and difference occurs only in the denominator calculation of confidence. As number of items in X decrease, support{X} increases (as follows from the anti-monotone property of support) and hence the confidence value decreases.", "An intuitive explanation for the above will be as follows. Consider F1 and F2:", "F1 = fraction of transactions having (butter) also having (egg, milk, bread)", "There will be many transactions having butter and all three of egg, milk and bread will be able to find place only in a small number of those.", "F2 = fraction of transactions having (milk, butter, bread) also having (egg)", "There will only be a handful of transactions having all three of milk, butter and bread (as compared to having just butter) and there will be high chances of having egg on those.", "So it will be observed that F1 < F2. Using this property of confidence, pruning is done in a similar way as was done while looking for frequent itemsets. It is illustrated in the figure below.", "We start with a frequent itemset {a,b,c,d} and start forming rules with just one consequent. Remove the rules failing to satisfy the minconf condition. Now, start forming rules using a combination of consequents from the remaining ones. Keep repeating until only one item is left on antecedent. This process has to be done for all frequent itemsets.", "Here again, minimum confidence threshold that we pick up is completely subjective to the problem at hand.", "With these two steps, we have identified a set of association rules which satisfy both the minimum support and minimum confidence condition. The number of such rules obtained will vary with the values of minsup and minconf. Now, this subset of rules thus generated can be searched for highest values of lift to make business decisions. There are some nicely built libraries in R to fetch association rules from transactions by putting in minsup and minconf as parameters. They also provide capabilities to visualize the same. This article here discusses the whole process step-by-step with the code.", "Before concluding, I would introduce two more terms, maximal frequent itemset and closed frequent itemset which are used as a compact representation of all the frequent itemsets.", "Maximal frequent itemset: It is a frequent itemset for which none of the immediate supersets are frequent. This is like a frequent itemset X to which no item y can be added such that {X,y} still remains above minsup threshold.", "Closed frequent itemset: It is a frequent itemset for which there exists no superset which has the same support as the itemset. Consider an itemset X. If ALL occurrences of X are accompanied by occurrence of Y, then X is NOT a closed set. (Refer the figure below for example)", "Maximal frequent itemsets are valuable because they are the most compact form of representation of frequent itemsets.", "All the frequent itemsets can be derived as the subsets of maximal frequent itemsets. However, information on support of the subsets is lost. If this value is required, closed frequent itemset is another way to represent all the frequent itemsets.", "Closed itemsets help in removing some redundant itemsets while not losing information about the support values.", "Calculation of support values of non-closed itemsets from closed itemsets is another algorithm, details of which are out of scope of this article.", "I have tried to cover all the important terms and concepts related to mining of association rules through this blog going into details wherever necessary. Following are one line summaries for few terms introduced in this process \u2014", "I hope you enjoyed reading this and have more clarity in thoughts than before.
