While conducting preliminary research on how digital platforms influence human cognition, and how that in turn impacts democratic institutions, I found myself constantly wondering why people trust online platforms so much. Conversely, why should we be skeptical about online forums? (Disclaimer: any mention of products/plug-ins designed by me are not affiliated with the Institute for Security and Technology, or any of their projects or programs, in any way.) While I remain unable to fully answer these questions, my involvement with my capstone project provided me with an opportunity to grapple with these issues.", "In the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we are spending more time online than ever before. Accordingly, data collection and monitoring is increasing as well. Debates on the tradeoffs of contact tracing and surveillance are unfolding before our eyes. On one side, contact tracing may help curtail the spread of the virus. On the other, how will governments use the same surveillance technology after we overcome the pandemic? Do we really believe governments will relinquish their privilege to use these advanced tools? Who is to say that institutions of power will not turn around and use similar technology to expel immigrants or identify and harass citizens expressing their first amendment rights of protest?", "My 11th grade history teacher, Andy Owens, used to say, \u201cprivilege is never given up voluntarily.\u201d I think this continues to ring true in these uncertain times. The discussion of online privacy could not be more relevant. This isn\u2019t a new problem. For a more in-depth discussion of privacy risk aversion and privacy behavior, read It\u2019s Safe with Us! The Science of Consumer Privacy by Alisa Frik and Matilda Ruck. Here are several intriguing findings mentioned in this article:", "We corroborated these statistics with our own user research, which revealed that 50% of respondents reported that they never read a website\u2019s privacy policy, and none of our respondents said that they always read a policy. Additionally, when asked if they feel responsible on the internet, 67.2% of respondents said \u201cno\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Not only does this show us that internet users don\u2019t feel that their safety needs are being met, it also shows us that many users just don\u2019t know if their information is safe or not.", "The problem we seek to address has to do with privacy policies, which ideally should be the place for users to feel reassured about the safe data collection practices of a company. However, this is rarely the case. The primary issue with privacy policies is that they are too long and filled with technical jargon and \u201clegalese.\u201d Privacy policies are often written by lawyers seeking to insulate companies from litigation. They are rarely written to protect user interests and promote their awareness. More recently, it has been increasingly fashionable from a public relations standpoint to construct more transparent privacy policies. Nevertheless, these are fringe cases, and privacy policies remain difficult for the average internet user to read, understand, summarize, and analyze. The truth is that most people don\u2019t read them, and unwittingly agree.", "This is why we\u2019re launching Termite: a free browser add-on tool that uses web scraping and NLP approaches to automate and scale the assessment and rating of online terms of service, terms and contracts, and privacy policies. Termite also provides users with customized cyber hygiene reports and empowers users to track their online agreements, all in real-time. We aim to optimize UI, awareness, and actionability. When privacy policies and terms and conditions are unreadable, Termite rates and tracks them. When users feel uncertain about their information safety, Termite empowers them. When websites take advantage of users not reading their policies, Termite lets users know, protecting them.

In 2018, the combined income of Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation was $436 million. They currently represent 7.58% of the browser market. By comparison, Google Chrome is the largest browser, and currently represents 68.81% of the browser market.

DuckDuckGo represents the most comprehensive and successful solution out there.", "Terms of Service; Didn\u2019t Read (ToS;DR) was formed to crowdsource online privacy policy analyses and privacy grades. It merits recognition as the best attempt to educate users about their online privacy. A fair criticism of ToS;DR, though, is that by crowdsourcing policy analyses and ratings, their website scores lack consistency. Moreover, their index of privacy topics spans 24 categories, far too many to be helpful and user-friendly. Further, their analyses are user-generated, meaning manually conducted by humans, resulting in a limited reach of site analyses.", "Polisis is a chrome extension that provides users with an AI-powered summary of any privacy policy. A unique way of visualizing privacy policies, Polisis utilizes deep learning and artificial intelligence to educate users on what data a company is collecting about you, what it is sharing, and much more. You don\u2019t have to read the full privacy policy with all the legal jargon to understand what you are signing up for. In Polisis\u2019 words, they argue that their product \u201cenables scalable, dynamic, and multi-dimensional queries on natural language privacy policies. At the core of Polisis is a privacy-centric language model, built with 130K privacy policies, and a novel hierarchy of neural-network classifiers that accounts for both high-level aspects and fine-grained details of privacy practices.\u201d Polisis boasts having 1000+ users according to the Chrome Extension Store. They break their privacy categories down into the following 10: 1) First Party Collection, 2) Third Party Collection, 3) Access, Edit, Delete, 4), Data Retention 5) Data Security, 6) Specific Audiences, 7) Do Not Track, 8) Policy Change, 9) Other, and 10) Choice Control. Although Polisis is a neat tool that employs very intriguing data visualizations, my experience has been that it is slow and not all that user-friendly.", "Privee is a proof of concept browser extension that seeks to automate the analysis of privacy policies. They boast that they have analyzed 38522 websites and counting. Privee has not been worked on since 2014, and only has 42 users on the google chrome extension store. To train their models, they relied on ToS;DR policy excerpt annotations. To develop and test their models, they used regular expressions to extract appropriate policy excerpts from new websites. The following six privacy categories that they cover include: 1) Collection, 2) Encryption, 3) Ad Tracking, 4) Limited Retention, 5) Profiling, and 6) Ad Disclosure.", "The innovation of tools such as DuckDuckGo, and the relative success of crowdsourcing efforts (both financially and in the form of analytical services) marks the beginning of a trend. There is a growing demand for companies to design with privacy-minded principles. In the absence of far-enough-reaching regulation and compliance, academia, the private sector, and civil society have demonstrated that they are willing to chip away at the boulder that is the privacy problem. Nonetheless, more progress needs to be made in realms that have not been adequately covered yet.", "This blog is a kickoff to a five part blog post.
