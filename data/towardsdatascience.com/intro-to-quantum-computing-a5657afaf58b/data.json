In this article, we\u2019re going to look at how to run some non-trivial programs on actual quantum computers. In particular, we\u2019re going to discuss something called graph states. Graph states are used for quantum cryptography, quantum error correction, and measurement based quantum computing. If all of that sounds like a foreign language, that\u2019s okay. We\u2019re going to go through everything, from the ground up, and in detail\u2026and don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll keep it light and fun.", "What is quantum computing? Quantum computing should be thought of as an ASIC, or \u201cApplication Specific Integrated Circuit\u201d such as a GPU used to accelerate machine learning. They shouldn\u2019t be thought of as a replacement for standard \u201cclassical\u201d computers like your laptop, smartphone, or one of the supercomputers used by companies like Google to process mass amounts of data and train machine learning models for several days. Quantum computers are a specialized computational resource that we send certain problems to. Quantum computers process information in a fundamentally different way from the standard binary processes in a standard computer. They use properties like \u201cinterference\u201d, \u201csuperposition\u201d, and \u201centanglement\u201d to gain an advantage over classical computers in solving certain kinds of problems. While a universal quantum computer can do anything a classical computer can do, the problem we are interested in solving determines whether we want to use a quantum computer.", "The most popular model of quantum computing is the circuit model, which described operations on qubits as a sequence of gates which can be represented as a matrix being multiplied by a vector. Let\u2019s look at an example.", "First, you\u2019ll need to download the free Jupyter notebook tool which comes in the latest (also free) distribution of Anaconda. Once you\u2019ve downloaded this, open the Anaconda navigator, and open an instance of \u201cJupyter Lab\u201d. It will give you the option to run a Python 3 kernel, select it. Next, you\u2019ll see a window with cells, which you can change to dark mode if you\u2019re into the hacker aesthetic.", "Now, in the first cell, run the following commands to import the libraries you\u2019ll need.", "Once you\u2019ve done this, create a \u201cQuantum Register\u201d and a \u201cClassical Register\u201d as follows, along with a \u201cQuantum Circuit\u201d.", "The quantum and classical registers should be thought of as channels of information for bits and qubits. In this circuit we have two qubits and two classical bits. Now, let\u2019s perform some operations on our qubits! Let\u2019s prepare a \u201cBell state\u201d. The Bell states are classical examples that exhibit entanglement. They are sometimes called EPR-states due to the commentary from Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in a classic paper on how these quantum states exhibit entanglement. The following code will build a circuit that applies a \u201cHadamard gate\u201d to the first qubit, and a \u201cCNOT\u201d gate to the first and second qubit, and then draws the circuit.", "The above circuit can be interpreted in terms of linear algebra as follows:", "If you\u2019re not an expert at linear algebra, that\u2019s okay, Python and NumPy can do this computation for us\u2026", "This outputs the state vector that results from running the quantum circuit we constructed.", "Now, the state vector that we have just constructed exhibits entanglement as well as superposition. It exists in a combination of two state at once, unlike classical bits which are always zeros and ones. In particular, our state vector represents the combination of the two states \u201c00\u201d and \u201c11\u201d. So, either both qubits are either spin-up or spin-down when measured, but the outcome is probabilistic and will be one 50% of the time, and the other 50% of the time. The fascinating thing is, we only need to measure one qubit to know what state the other qubit is in! This is due to the entanglement. We don\u2019t need to observe the second qubit to know that it is in whatever state the first qubit is in. If we want to run this on one of IBMs quantum computers, we can construct this circuit in the (free) IBM Quantum Experience, using an interactive drag and drop circuit composer. Sign up for an account, then navigate over to the circuit composer in the side bar.", "Now, click on the \u201cNew Circuit\u201d button.", "Next, simply drag and drop the following circuits onto the circuit diagram. This will prepare the same Bell state as what we prepared, and will measure the first qubit (the little black meter symbol with a z).", "You can get a visualization on the left side of the two states you are likely to measure if you run this circuit.", "You can run this on an IBM quantum computer in the cloud, and get your results back depending on how long the wait list (number of jobs on that hardware) is. It\u2019s as simple as that!", "Now, if you\u2019d like to construct a graph state, you can use the following function we wrote using NetworkX over at The Singularity Research.", "You\u2019ll need to run the following imports:", "And this function will define a graph state quantum circuit:", "If we define the following graph in NetworkX:", "We can feed \u201cG\u201d into the \u201cgraph_state_measure(G)\u201d function and get the following circuit:", "Circuits like this are called graph states because the exhibit entanglement based on the graph we define them by. The pink \u201cCZ-gates\u201d that connect two lines in the circuit diagram correspond to edges in the graph, and the nodes of the graph correspond to the qubits running along the black lines of the circuit diagram. These graph states can be used in quantum cryptography (see this interactive notebook). They are also used in error correction (see this interactive notebook).", "If you\u2019d like to know more about quantum computing and if you\u2019d like to work through more advanced tutorials addressing things like entanglement, entropy, and complicated circuits and algorithms, you can check out The Singularity\u2019s Github page. We have tons of interactive notebooks you can run in your browser without having to download anything! You can also check out IBM\u2019s excellent online book for Qiskit, which covers some similar topics in a slightly different way, as well as some different topics.
