This is a follow-up article to the Essential probNstats 4 ML project in which I will explain the differences between those two terms, why they are chained as well as the statistical approaches that exist.", "Probability theory is a branch of mathematics concerned with probability. Probability is a numerical description of the likelihood of an event. A lot of times by saying probability, we refer to probability theory and not just the number. This is understandable by the context of the sentence.", "Statistics is a branch of mathematics that concerns the collection, organization, displaying, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.", "The relationship between those two is that in statistics, we apply probability(probability theory) to draw conclusions from data.", "To make the definition more clear, here are two examples of them:", "You have a fair coin (equal probability of heads or tails). You will toss it 100 times. What is the probability of 60 or more heads? We can get only a single answer because of the standard computation strategy.", "You have a coin of unknown provenance. To investigate whether it is fair you toss it 100 times and count the number of heads. Let\u2019s say you count 60 heads. Your job as a statistician is to draw a conclusion (inference) from this data. In this situation, different Statisticians may draw different conclusions because they may use different conclusion forms or may use different methods for predicting the probability(e.g. of landing heads).", "Before we can proceed let\u2019s define some basic terminology for probability that will be necessary:", "Experiment(or trial) is any procedure that can be infinitely repeated and has a well-defined set of possible outcomes.", "Sample space is a set of all possible outcomes from an experiment.", "An event is a set of outcomes of an experiment.", "There are two statistical interpretations used to tackle a problem: frequentist and Bayesian.", "Frequentists address the probability as a measure of the frequency of various outcomes of an experiment. For example, if we have a fair coin(50% probability of landing heads) we expect that the half number of experiments will land on heads.", "Bayesians address the probability as an abstract concept that measures a state of knowledge or a degree of belief in a given proposition. This means that probability has a range of values that may be true, rather than a single one. This approach will be adopted by us as Data Scientists or ML engineers to be used for systems such as speech or face recognition.", "Before we can proceed we will need some basic understanding of sets:", "A set (S) is a collection of elements.", "An empty set is denoted as \u2205 and it contains no elements.", "A subset (A) of a set (S) is a group of elements that exist in that set. It is represented as A\u2282S.", "The Complement of A in S is the set of elements of S that are not in A. It is represented as A\u1d9c or S \u2212 A.", "Union of A and B is the set of all elements in A or B (or both). It is represented as A \u222a B.", "Intersection of A and B is the set of all elements in both A and B. It is represented as A \u2229 B.", "Two or more subsets are disjoint if they have no common elements and their Intersection is equal to \u2205.", "The difference of two or more subsets e.g. A and B is the set of elements in A that are not in B. We write this as A-B.", "Lastly, there are two important laws that combine Intersection, Union and Complement. They are called DeMorgan\u2019s laws, and they are shown below:", "Before we jump into the problem, we need to learn some important probability concepts:", "We can also compute the permutations and combinations of k elements of a set. The general formulas for computing those two in either case is:", "\u2099P\u2096 = number of permutations (lists) of k distinct elements from a set of size n", "\u2099C\u2096 = number of combinations (subsets) of k elements from a set of size n", "Suppose we have a fair coin, what is the probability of landing exactly 3 heads in 10 flips?", "Firstly we must count the number of ways to get 3 heads in a sequence of 10 flips. This can be done with the \u201ccombination\u201d formula:", "Each of the 10 flips has 2 possible outcomes so by the rule of product we have 2*2*2\u2026=2\u00b9\u2070=1024 sequences of 10 flips. Now we can calculate the probability of landing 3 heads in 10 flips by dividing the number of combinations by the total number of sequences: 120/1024 \u2248 0.117.", "We learned about the difference between Probability and Statistics. We also learned that Statisticians may draw different results based on the form the conclusion takes or the probability computation approach.
