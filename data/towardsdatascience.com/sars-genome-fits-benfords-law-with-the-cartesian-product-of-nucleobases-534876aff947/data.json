The first-digit dominance of smaller numbers out of 1 to 9\u2026 the hidden pattern we somehow all fit in and cannot escape from.", "Given the current events, I wonder how Benford\u2019s Law could apply to viral genome sequences, as a big number of instances is needed for Benford\u2019s to appropriately apply. The SARS species genome (including SARS-CoV-2, commonly known as the novel coronavirus) is ~29,800 in length in terms of nucleotides or nucleobases (a.k.a. the building blocks of the genome: A, T, G, C). Publications already showed trends with Benford analysis on specific genes, but just looking at the genome sequence alone seems not telling about biological information, other than to offer some fun \u201cplaying with\u201d the law. Today, I will play with the law and unveil the \u201cBenfordiness\u201d of the SARS sequences. First, I imported the sequence text file, taking away the line breaks. Then I split the string into individual letters and created a function \u201ccount_pattern\u201d just for the counting purpose (code is shown below). In this post, I am showing examples of both 2003 SARS and 2019 SARS-CoV-2 (click to see genome information).", "One way to create more instances is to look at how many times a specific nucleobase (I call it bp) arrangement appears in the genome (i.e. how many times AG, AT, GC, ATG, GGG, CTA, ATGC, CGTT\u2026are found). To exhaust the list, we just take the Cartesian product of the bp: A, T, G, C. [Briefly, what is Cartesian product? It is permutation with repeats: say, putting apples, pears, and bananas, in some order into four pockets #1, 2, 3, 4, with one fruit per pocket.] To not end up with mostly single digits, I tallied from single bp (how many times A, T, G, C show up, respectively) to 5 bp (i.e. AGTGC).", "One \u201cbug\u201d worth mentioning is that the count function in Python 3 does NOT repeatedly count the same character in an arrangement more than once. For example, if encountering \u2018..AAAA..,\u2019 we know that there are technically 3 \u2018AA\u2019 in it, but the function would answer 2. Similarly, if encountering \u2018..TTTTT..,\u2019 the function would tally only 1 \u2018TTT\u2019 in this arrangement, while we would tally 3. To solve this problem quickly (forget elegance for one moment), I simply semi-manually added the counts of repeat=3 & 5 to counts of 2 bp, repeat=4 & 5 to counts of 3 bp, and repeat=5 to counts of 4 bp. I am not digging deeper, but the math just works out this way. And this only applies to counting arrangements that are of uniform bp.", "Interestingly, there seems to be a parity-dependent or alternating trend: the count of even bp arrangements yields a more Benford-like trend \u2014 meaning first digits are far more likely to be ones and twos, while that of odd bp arrangements seems to greatly violate Benford\u2019s Law. Note the y-axis is in natural log instead of the linear scale, to show the lower-count values well.", "If pooling all the tallies together, however, we get a Benford-like curve based on Mann-Whitney test (P > 0.86 for both SARS and SARS-CoV-2 sequences). Although the Mann-Whitney test may not be the best to detect any nuances, I will leave it for now as the trend is clear. Black bars represent actual data while the purple curve is Benford\u2019s curve from the formula log(1+1/d).", "What can we learn from this exercise? I am blown away by the prevalence of Benford\u2019s Law \u2014 it seems to lurk underneath the counting of this world, one way or the other. There are numerous ways to create instances to count (like the one introduced here). I am willing to bet that the conclusion from this post holds true for other genomes as well, although I am no expert in genetics. I also wonder if randomly generated sequences would fit the conclusion. Is Benford\u2019s Law underlying all measured things or just the \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d ones? How is \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d truly defined? Perhaps researchers could work on establishing more meaningful standards and guidelines on using Benford\u2019s Law to detect fraud and provide actionable insights. An article that shows human brain electrical activities also obeying this omnipresent law can be found here. I will leave further insights and interpretations to whoever interested \u2014 but I had fun exploring this topic a little.", "Your home for data science.
