Don\u2019t get me wrong, Power BI is much more than a data visualization tool \u2014 it can be used in many scenarios as a comprehensive ETL solution.", "However, Power BI certainly has some limitations when it comes to specific user requests. In those situations, some workarounds and tweakings are necessary in order to achieve desired functionalities.", "One of them is Expand/Collapse functionality in visuals other than Matrix. Even in Matrix visual, it was not possible to use the \u201c+\u201d sign for expanding until November 2019 update.", "For us coming from the SSRS world, this was so strange and unexpected. Ok, matrices are covered now, but what if we want to apply this same functionality to other visuals, for example, Card visual.", "Stay tuned, I\u2019ll show you a workaround, so you can achieve that. As usual, I will use the Contoso sample database for demo purposes.", "Let\u2019s say I have a report page showing a stacked column chart in the middle and two card visuals in the upper right corner, showing Sales Quantity and Sales Amount:", "Now, let\u2019s say I want to give my users the possibility to get more insight into details that form these figures. Using the Tooltip page, which I described in this article, can be an easy and quick solution. But, Tooltips are static and they only show underlying data, without giving the opportunity to interact with it.", "Therefore, I decided to play with bookmarks in order to mimic expand/collapse functionality. Bookmarks are a very useful technique in Power BI and I\u2019m using them quite often.", "Simply said, bookmark captures the current state of the report page (with all visible visuals on it) and you can navigate between different bookmarks using buttons/images, by setting Action property to Bookmark.", "Broader explanation on Bookmarks is out of the scope of this article, so just keep in mind that Bookmarks are a quite useful technique to customize your reports and improve overall user experience.", "The first thing we need to do is to give our users a hint of what they can do with the card visuals. I\u2019ve imported two transparent icons for \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d signs and I believe that it will be intuitive enough.", "Put both icons one over another, as in the following picture:", "Do the same for the Sales Qty Card visual and we will also put another pair in the middle, between the cards. This icon will enable the user to expand/collapse both cards at the same time, while the small icon will handle that specific card.", "Now, real magic needs to be created. Under the View tab, enable Bookmarks and Selection panes. We will need two bookmarks for every single scenario: expand/collapse Sales Qty card only; expand/collapse Sales Amt card only; expand/collapse both cards.", "Here is the screenshot of the bookmark pane I\u2019ve created:", "Now, we need to define the look of every single bookmark. That means, when I open the report page, only \u201c+\u201d icons should be visible (which means that I need to hide \u201c-\u201d icons).", "After that, you need to set the Show/Hide property for all visuals depending on the user\u2019s selection. It would take a lot of time and pictures to illustrate every single step, but let\u2019s just show for Sales Qty (logic stays the same for Sales Amt).", "Turn the Action field on, choose Bookmark under Type and select Qty Expanded bookmark. That way, we \u201ctold\u201d this icon to navigate us to a specifically created bookmark which shows the captured status of the report page we need to show.", "Once you do CTRL+click on \u201c+\u201d sign, you will see that the report page changed:", "The first thing you\u2019ll notice is a new Line Chart visual which shows Sales Qty broken down per month. Additionally, the \u201c+\u201d sign disappeared, and the \u201c-\u201d icon is there instead, suggesting the user that he can click on it once he decides to collapse this extended visual.", "Now, if the user clicks on Sales Amt \u201c+\u201d icon, the following thing happens:", "Visual has changed to show the Sales Amount figure per month! Also, \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d icons were synchronized to follow the user selection.", "Finally, if the user wants to expand both card visuals with one click, he can do it by clicking on the big \u201c+\u201d sign between the cards:", "Finally, here is the final solution in action:", "As I previously mentioned, you can give more insight to users with Tooltip pages, and that\u2019s also a legitimate solution, but they are static. With clever usage of bookmarks, you can set different types of additional visuals to appear on the user\u2019s request. Moreover, these visuals can be used like regular visuals for cross-filtering or drilling down and that\u2019s the greatest advantage of this technique.", "Become a member and read every story on Medium!", "Subscribe here to get more insightful data articles!", "Your home for data science.
