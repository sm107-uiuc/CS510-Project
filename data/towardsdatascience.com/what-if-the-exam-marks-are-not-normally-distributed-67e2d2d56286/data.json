Normalisation and Standardisation have to be considered."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Usually, when I tell you a student has got 90 marks, you would think this is a very good student. Instead, if I say the marks are 75, that probably means the student might be average. However, as a Data Scientist/Analyst, we need at least ask two questions immediately:", "The first question is important and perhaps everyone would ask because 90/150 is not better than 75/100. The second question is a little bit subtle and possibly only a \u201cdata person\u201d will have this sensitivity.", "In fact, to make sure an exam having its results normally distributed in the class, it is quite common to select exam questions as follows:", "What if we have 100% easy questions or 100% difficult questions? If so, we\u2019re very likely to have results that are not normally distributed in a class.", "Then, we have our main topic now. I have been a tutor at a University for 5 years. It sometimes cannot be guaranteed that the exam questions are precisely followed the above proportions. To make sure it is fair to all the students, in other words, not too many students failed or too many students got A grades, sometimes we need to normalise the marks to make sure it follows the normal distribution.", "Also, when we want to compare students from different universities, or we want to aggregate the results of multiple exams, normalisation is also very important.", "For demonstration purposes, Let\u2019s suppose we have 5 different exams. Because we need to randomly generate the expected distribution, the following imports are needed.", "Let\u2019s plot them together using Seaborn distplot.", "These 5 different exams have completely different distributions. When we get such a dataset, we can\u2019t compare them directly.", "The basic idea of Min-Max Normalisation is to normalise all the values into the interval [0,1]. It is fairly easy to do this.", "Please be noticed that we need to convert our NumPy arrays into vectors before they can be normalised. So, the easiest way of doing this is to reshape them into column vectors reshape(-1, 1).", "After they are normalised, we don\u2019t have to convert them back to a 1-D array to visualise. Below is the histogram after normalising. It is more confident now to put the 5 different exam results together.", "Z-Score is another commonly used technique. It is called standardisation rather than normalisation because it \u201cstandardises\u201d the data in two aspects:", "Therefore, we can calculate it as follows.", "It can be seen that the Z-Score Standardisation not only normalised the exam results but also re-scaled them.", "In this article, the exams are used as examples to explain why we need to normalise or standardise datasets. In fact, I have seen many learners and Data Science students who are really enthusiasts of algorithms. They may know many different types of data mining and machine learning algorithms. However, I would say that data transformation is more important than selecting an algorithm most of the time.", "Therefore, I have also demonstrated how to use the Python Sci-kit Learn library to easily normalise/standardise the data. Hope it helps someone who has just entered the Data Science and Data Analytics area.", "All the code used in this article can be found in this Google Colab Notebook.", "If you feel my articles are helpful, please consider joining Medium Membership to support me and thousands of other writers!
