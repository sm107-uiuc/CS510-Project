The game was made by Niantic, Inc. an American software development company based in San Francisco, which is best known for developing the augmented reality mobile games Ingress, Pok\u00e9mon Go, and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. The company was formed as Niantic Labs in 2010 as an internal startup within Google, as such Niantic spawned from Google Maps. The company and its current effort are explained in-depth in a Kotaku article written in October 2019. This is a summary of this article. It questioned the power of tracing all the location data and had some critical thoughts regarding augmented reality.", "\u201cToday, when you use Wizards Unite or Pok\u00e9mon Go or any of Niantic\u2019s other apps, your every move is getting documented and stored \u2014 up to 13 times a minute, according to the results of a Kotaku investigation. Even players who know that the apps record their location data are usually astonished once they look at just how much they\u2019ve told Niantic about their lives through their footsteps.\u201d", "John Hanke the CEO has previously led startups invested in by the US army with mapping technology. His previous company Keyhole was acquired by Google. They realised Google had plans to map the entire world in 3D.", "\u201cIf you have mobile computing and services people are using while moving around in the world,\u201d said Hanke in a 2016 talk to the Berkeley School of Business, \u201cthe question we asked ourselves was, \u2018Could these services influence how people behave in the physical world? Could the products they\u2019re using cause them to walk a different path, drive a different path, divert from the trajectory that they\u2019re normally going to go on? If you could do that through information services that you\u2019re offering to people, there\u2019s tremendous opportunity for businesses that might want to change the behavior of people to get them to go places where they wouldn\u2019t otherwise go.\u201d", "In this manner driving these actions through games and integrating the real world with augmented reality. Ubiquitous computing is the seamless integration of the digital world into the physical one, anywhere, at any time. Also referred to as \u201cmediated reality,\u201d", "Really interesting and twisted vision of AR mentioned by the Kotaku article:", "Pok\u00e9mon Go sparked privacy controversy, blamed on a bug, which involved users giving Niantic a huge number of permissions: contacts, location, storage, camera and, for iPhone users, full Google account access, which was not integral to gameplay.", "In the future, Niantic says on their website they\u2019re planning on releasing a \u201cplanet-scale real-world AR platform,\u201d which would more believably integrate game experiences into a live camera feed of the real world.", "Kotaku looked into data requests from Europe and found the following:", "In total, Kotaku analyzed more than 25,000 location records voluntarily shared with us by 10 players of Niantic games. On average, we found that Niantic kept about three location records per minute of gameplay of Wizards Unite, nearly twice as many as it did with Pok\u00e9mon Go. For one player, Niantic had at least one location record taken during nearly every hour of the day, suggesting that the game was collecting data and sharing it with Niantic even when the player was not playing.", "Through using this information Kotaku could identify their home, work and some of their habits.", "The idea that data can successfully be anonymized has long been a contentious one. In July, researchers at Imperial College London were able to accurately reidentify 99.98 percent of Americans in an \u201canonymized\u201d dataset.", "Niantic\u2019s current valuation is over $4 billion. It is not always communicated to users of a service what their data is used for.", "Advertising market research company Emarketer projected that advertisers will spend $29 billion on location-targeted advertising, also referred to as \u201cgeoconquesting.\u201d These are being united to consolidate digital and physical ad profiles.", "A patent issued in August of this year, which Niantic acquired when it bought a company called Tick Tock AI in 2018, describes a technology meant to incentivize the collection of data through gameplay [\u2026] Another patent held by Niantic, also acquired from Tick Tock AI, describes software that can use computer vision to \u201cidentify shoes, determine specific model, determine that shoes belong to John Smith, and disambiguating between other shoes owned and worn by John Smith.\u201d According to this patent, a host of intimate contextual information can then be associated with the item by using \u201c\u2026audio (e.g., noises of cooking), images of the food prior to cooking, activity recognition data of a person cooking, a time at which cooking was initiated and a time at which cooking was completed.\u201d", "This is fascinating at best and worrying at worst. It is strange to think what Niantic is capable of.", "As one former Niantic employee put it: \u201cIt is almost irrelevant to talk about the company\u2019s original intent, because I think that to create such an organization is to invite rot over time. It\u2019s more of a question of, how can we structure companies that have fiscal responsibility to public welfare?\u201d", "It may be important to mention that this article is only an echo and summary of the truly amazing article written by Cecilia D\u2019Anastasio and Dhruv Mehrotra.
