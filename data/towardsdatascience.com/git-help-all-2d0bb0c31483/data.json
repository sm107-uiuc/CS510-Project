And once you understand how it works and it doesn\u2019t feel like black magic only there to make your life miserable, you just might start to appreciate it a bit.", "All promises aside, let\u2019s understand what is really happening here before we decide to just skimp through and just slog down commands like a total tool with no versioning support.", "One of the things a git command does is to move/copy the data around. There are 4 areas where our data can reside while working with git.", "Additionally, a git command can also move the pointer from one commit to another. It is also capable of doing both \u2014 move data and the pointer \u2014 around in one go. Wait, what pointers am I talking about here?!", "Well, the picture I painted above is an oversimplified one, for more clarity. The local repository is not just a singular copy of your actual project. But rather is a tree of commits \u2014 where each commit is a snapshot of your project at different stages.", "Let\u2019s walk through an example, where we a have a new git project with 2 files \u2014 ReadMe.txt and BubbleSort.cpp.Then we created a file MergeSort.cpp and modified the ReadMe.txt to reflect the new state. Now we add these files and create a new commit C2.", "Every time you create a new commit, it will append it to the latest commit(the one HEAD is pointing to at that moment). The branch will pointer will not move during this process.", "Now that we know a bit about git, let\u2019s move onto the commands.", "It shows you the current status of your work-space. It will tell you the changes that are staged, un-staged or un-tracked(newly created files i.e files that are in your work-space but not in index and repository).", "It adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit, which in simple English means copying your changes from your work-space to your index/staging area.", "It captures a snapshot of the project\u2019s currently staged changes. Only once you have staged your changes, you can commit them. This copies the changes from your index to your repository and creates a new commit. What is does, on top of that, is to move the branch pointer to the latest commit. As the HEAD was pointing to the branch pointer earlier, it will now also point to the new commit. The following options are useful:", "This will create a new commit with the same message \u201cadded 3 files\u201d, containing the staged files in both these commits and replace the original \u201cadded 3 files\u201d commit.", "It shows you the history of commits. To see what changes(commit hash and commit messages) you have committed, or changes committed to that branch by other people. That is why it is important to give meaningful and relevant messages while committing changes so as to make sense of what changes might have gone in each commit.", "It temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.", "This one takes all your changes (doesn\u2019t include un-tracked files) and moves them from work-space to your stash. The changes will no longer be present in your work-space.", "It shows the difference between two files, two different areas on git or even two different commits.", "git stores a branch as a reference to a commit. In this sense, a branch represents the tip of a series of commits", "At a higher level, it is used to move from one branch to another or to create a new branch. At a very fundamental level, it is used for moving from one commit to another. It only moves the HEAD pointer.", "It allows us to move both HEAD and branch pointer to a specified commit. One should be very careful while using this command as it can create irreversible changes. It will modify the pointer in the staging and working areas as well, based on the option used. The following 3 options are available with the reset command:", "After git fetch, you will be aware of the chain of commits with the remote origin/master pointer(in green). The git merge will create a new commit H, will merge the changes from both G and C. It will also update the local pointers to point at H. Both HEAD and local origin/master will point to H.", "I\u2018m glad you made it till the end of this article. \ud83c\udf89I hope your reading experience was as enriching as the one I had writing this. \ud83d\udc96", "Do check out my other articles here.", "If you want to reach out to me, my medium of choice would be Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
