The term \u2018constant\u2019 is defined as occurring continuously over a period of time, and so, you could say that change is perpetual. This poses a problem for machine learning models, as a model is optimized based on the variables and parameters in the time that it was created.", "Imagine a classification model created to detect phishy emails (spam emails) created several years ago. Back then, spam emails would look something like this:", "You could tell that this is a spam email because it includes an unrealistic lump sum of money being offered ($4.8 million USD), it includes a contact within the email, and it asks you to follow the instructions urgently, or \u201cas soon as you read this email.\u201d", "Times have changed since then, and scammers are creating more sophisticated and realistic emails that make it harder to differentiate. Here\u2019s an example of a more recent phishy email:", "Notice how different this spam email is compared to the one several years ago. Do you think that the fraudulent detection model created several years ago would be able to classify this email correctly? Probably not because the presentation of phishy emails has changed and models don\u2019t like change. One of the main assumptions when creating a model is that future data will be similar to past data used to build the model.", "This is an example of model drift. In this article, you\u2019ll learn what model drift is, the types of model drift, how to detect model drift, and how to address it.", "Model Drift (also known as model decay) refers to the degradation of a model\u2019s prediction power due to changes in the environment, and thus the relationships between variables. Referring to the example above, changes in the presentation of spam emails would cause fraudulent detection models created several years ago to degrade.", "There are three main types of model drift:", "Concept drift is a type of model drift where the properties of the dependent variable changes. The fraudulent model above is an example of concept drift, where the classification of what is \u2018fraudulent\u2019 changes.", "Data drift is a type of model drift where the properties of the independent variable(s) change(s). Examples of data drift include changes in the data due to seasonality, changes in consumer preferences, the addition of new products, etc\u2026", "Upstream data changes refer to operational data changes in the data pipeline. An example of this is when a feature is no longer being generated, resulting in missing values. Another example is a change in measurement (eg. miles to kilometers).", "The most accurate way to detect model drift is by comparing the predicted values from a given machine learning model to the actual values. The accuracy of a model worsens as the predicted values deviate farther and farther from the actual values.", "A common metric used to evaluate the accuracy of a model among data scientists is the F1 score, mainly because it encompasses both the precision and recall of the model (See below for a visual representation of precision and recall). That being said, there are a number of metrics that are more relevant than others depending on the situation. For example, type 2 errors would be extremely important for a cancer-tumor image recognition model. Thus, when a specified metric falls below a given threshold, you\u2019ll know that your model is drifting!", "Sometimes monitoring the accuracy of a model isn\u2019t always possible. In certain instances, it becomes much harder in obtaining the predicted and actual paired data. For example, imagine a model that predicts the net income of a public firm. This means that you would only be able to measure the accuracy of the model\u2019s predictions of net income 4 times a year from the firm\u2019s quarterly earnings reports. In the case where you aren\u2019t able to compare predicted values to actual values, there are other alternatives that you can rely on:", "Detecting model drift is only the first step \u2014 the next step is addressing model drift. There are two main methods in doing so.", "The first is to simply retrain your model in a scheduled manner. If you know that a model degrades every six months, then you may decide to retrain your model every five months to ensure that the model\u2019s accuracy never falls below a certain threshold.", "Another way to address model drift is through online learning. Online learning simply means to make a machine learning model learn in real-time. It does this by taking in data as soon as it becomes available in sequential order rather than training the model with batch data.", "For more articles like this one, check out Datatron\u2019s Medium page or their blog https://blog.datatron.com/", "If you like my work and want to support me\u2026", "Your home for data science.
