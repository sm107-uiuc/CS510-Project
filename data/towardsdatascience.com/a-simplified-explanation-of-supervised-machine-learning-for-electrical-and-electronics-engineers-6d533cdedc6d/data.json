Your brain just executed a supervised machine learning algorithm.", "Because you were already aware of what they are, how they look like and may be bits and pieces of how they work. This is one of the classical ways of training machines by providing them what each little data unit means.", "The source of knowledge are units of information presented in the form of texts, numbers or images like you would have had studied in your hand-out before you went to the lab. For you, food for your successful identification was the picture in your hand-out that might be something like the pictures below.", "Do you think the previous image has sufficient information? How did you know which picture is a resistor or a capacitor? Well, your hand-out must have had image captions. So you learnt what each picture corresponds to.", "So whenever you point out an instance and tell your computer what it is, it is called Data Labeling and whatever you tell your computer about your instance are your Data Labels.", "Have you noticed the yellowish tones of the resistors and the red & blue bands? Or may be their hour-glass figure. You must have noticed the cylindrical shapes of the capacitors. The ceramic capacitors are round and flat. As for inductors, you must have noticed the coils around them.", "Each of these are characteristics or features of the resistor, capacitor and inductor which have helped your identify them correctly. You basically had a mind-map on how to identify them but after putting them into Excel Sheet would look something like this.", "Do you spot the \u2018Label\u2019 column? This label column is the one we are predicting on the veroboard.", "Everything you read in the hand-out was your training data. For a machine learning algorithm, the summary of the observations in the table is the training data.", "One you are have your features in your mind, you have already tried to find patterns and match them on the veroboard. Human mind is swift, ain\u2019t it?", "The machine learning model\u2019s foundations are good data.", "If you had images like this, it would be difficult to draw patterns. The machine learning algorithms essentially learns from numerous instances in the training data and attempts to find patterns just like the human brain.", "It looks pretty simple here with all the three different labels. Well, this is not the case in most real-world scenarios. There would be thousands of labels and astronomical training instances. Is that fathomable by a human brain? No, right? We have our limitations and that is why we have computer aided predictions to be made. We leverage the immense computation power of our machines and that is why using a machine to learn patterns is important.", "When you tried to identified a resistor from a capacitor, you dealt with test data already. Test data is the unseen instances that the machine applies the patterns recognized and tries to predict the labels.", "Now, imagine if your lab instructor gave your a point for every correct resistor and deducted a point for every incorrectly identified resistor. Your total is then aggregated and you found out that your are fifth in rank in our class.", "Similarly, a machine learning algorithm is evaluated on it\u2019s performance on test data. For supervised learning, the most common metrics are accuracy, precision and recall. It is important to evaluate the performance metrics to understand which is the best performing model.", "What do you think this is?", "Two pinned, cylindrical, flat-topped object, HAS A COIL \u2014 it\u2019s an inductor.", "Grand, you\u2019ve got it! You\u2019ve just correctly labelled an unseen inductor with a supervised approach using the features in the training dataset and that\u2019s what supervised ML algorithms do!", "Image Sources: Images are used for demonstration and sourced from links mentioned in their captions.
