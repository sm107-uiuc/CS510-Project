This part, part 1 concerns the background/intro to the topic.", "To start off, let\u2019s define microservices/microservice oriented software architecture and machine learning.", "In a nutshell, microservices is an approach to build software when different functional application parts are independent and communicate via communication protocol over a network. Every application component is isolated and interfaces other components according to service layer agreement, SLA.", "Machine learning, or ML is a cross-disciplinary approach to extract patterns from the data using iterative computational techniques and applying mathematical algorithms. It is a sub-domain of computer science/data science. A machine learning software product follows the flow:", "First off, you may ask yourself two reasonable question, why microservices and why python? I, as pretty much all of us, will use google to answer it :)", "As one sees, the community interest in using python, microservices software development, machine learning and DevOps is growing over time, and these areas of interest are highly correlated. In the other words, when people search terms concern microservice, or machine learning, or DevOps topics, it is very likely that python related search terms were queried on google.", "The search trends above, the fact that python is the third most popular general programming language after C and java according to the TIOBE index (as of July\u201919) and relative simplicity of using python to bootstrap and execute a project makes it to be the leader for machine learning and data science.", "As for microservice oriented software architecture, it is clear that developers community\u2019s interest is skewed towards microservices against monolithic software architecture.", "One of the main advantages of microservices is independency of software product feature services which enables companies for distributed development and improves software scalability. It makes this development approach to be a reasonable architecture choice to integrate machine learning into software product.", "It is a reasonable question to ask as an executive, shall I be bothered by data science, or machine learning for my product at the moment?", "It comes with the followup questions:", "The diagram above may be helpful to answer those questions. Let\u2019s follow it:", "If after answering all questions from the flow chart we get to the the final yes, we are ready to get to the point of working on machine learning services and on their integration into the product.

The final stage of the cycle, the model deployment involves Machine Learning engineers, Developers and Ops/SRE/DevOps engineers. Only once this step is completed, the project can be evaluated by stakeholders. Only at this stage, the result of many teams work can be integrated into the product and hence can influence business. Without this stage, a data science/machine learning project cannot be considered as a project because it would never interface users otherwise.
