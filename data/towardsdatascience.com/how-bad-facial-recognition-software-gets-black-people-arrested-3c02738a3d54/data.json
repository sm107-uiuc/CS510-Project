But while police murders are in focus right now, we shouldn\u2019t be forgetting about the subtler tools that the justice system uses to ruin Black lives.", "For one, there are the numerous Black and Brown people who die after being arrested. While federal officials have failed to gather the data, independent resources show that the disparity is real.", "Then there is the fact that people of color get harsher sentencing upon trial. To state the obvious, this is a consequence of racial bias among predominantly White criminal judges.", "On top of all that, there is the fact that Black and Brown people get arrested way more often. While Black people make up 13% of the average population, they make up 33% of US prisons, as of 2017. White people, or 72% of the population, only make up 30% of prisons. Statistically speaking, a Black person is therefore six times more likely to be incarcerated than a White person.", "It is therefore quite obvious that Black and Brown people get oppressed by the police and the justice system due to racial bias. What is less obvious is that predominantly White software developers contribute to this crime.", "A recent study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) confirms what researchers have said all along: Facial recognition serves you well as long as you\u2019re a white male \u2014 all others lose out.", "One method that is important to courts is one-to-one matching. This means that you query whether two different photos depict the same person, which can be useful to identify a suspect that you\u2019ve caught on video, for example. The study finds that there are 10 to 100 times more false positives for Black or Asian Americans than for Caucasian Americans, depending on the algorithm. In other words, if an algorithm is presented with two images from two different people of color, they look pretty much the same to the computer.", "The number of false positives is about the same, regardless of non-Caucasian race, in US-developed algorithms. Apart from African and Asian Americans, this also included Native American, American Indian, Alaskan Indian and Pacific Islanders in the study.", "Some researchers, among them Patrick Grother from NIST itself, have mentioned that there could be more diversity among the faces of Caucasians than among those of Africans or Asians. But this doesn\u2019t hold true: The NIST study also finds that algorithms that were developed in Asia managed to identify Asians about as accurately as Caucasians. The root cause seems to lie much more within the algorithm itself, or in the dataset of images that it learns from.", "This lack in accountability for facial recognition isn\u2019t only bemoaned by the NIST. For example, researchers Joy Buolamwini from MIT and Timnit Gebru from Stanford University found similar disparities regarding race and gender. It\u2019s worth mentioning that both scientists are Black women themselves \u2014 two of the very few that work in Artificial Intelligence.", "All these disparities wouldn\u2019t be as bad if facial recognition were a toy made by White people for White people. The problem is that these algorithms are used on ethnic groups that had no say in their development and implementation. For example, they\u2019re more likely to get wrongfully incarcerated because a machine made a mistake due to the color of their skin. As Buolamwini puts it, \u201ctechnology should be more attuned to the people who use it and the people it\u2019s used on.\u201d", "What causes these disparities? Maybe it\u2019s the algorithms \u2014 there\u2019s no quantitative data on that. But most researchers claim blame the data that the algorithms use to learn what a face is. Apparently, it is much easier to get lots of images of White people than of Black and Brown people.", "This does seem to be true. White people are more likely to have enough cash to buy technical gadgets which they could use to take photos of themselves and their families, and upload them to the web. For example, if you google \u201cgrandma\u201d, you need to scroll down quite a bit before you see a woman with darker skin.", "And White developers are more likely to take one of these predominantly White datasets and not think about the fact that they\u2019ve forgotten something. Even if the algorithm per se were suited for images of Black and Brown people, too.", "For example, in 2009 an HP webcam that was supposed to be able to track faces didn\u2019t work for Black people. And in 2015, Google mislabeled a Black person a \u201cgorilla\u201d. So far, only Apple\u2019s FaceID with its three-dimensional infrared scanner seems to be effective on all ethnicities. The problem is, people in everyday life and in law enforcement rarely take photos and videos in three dimensions and invisible infrared light.", "So it makes perfect sense to try to get as many pictures of Black and Brown people as possible, so developers can include them in the existing datasets. The only problem is, getting these pictures can lead to even more problems.", "To make their face scans work on the Pixel, Google sub-contracted workers to get scans of Black and Brown people on the street in exchange for a $5 gift card. What is worrying about that is that multiple former contractors have since come forward saying that they were advised to use unethical tactics.", "\u201cThey said to target homeless people because they\u2019re the least likely to say anything to the media,\u201d one former contractor told the New York Daily News.", "\u201cI feel like they wanted us to prey on the weak,\u201d said another contractor.", "There were even reports that contractors were advised to rush people into signing a consent form without reading it, and masking the face scan as a \u201cselfie game\u201d or \u201csurvey\u201d.", "This obviously raises more concerns about the privacy of Black and Brown people in public. Creating an inclusive product cannot come at the cost of misusing the privacy and trust of the most vulnerable.", "Despite all these concerns, facial recognition technology is already in wide use in US police and justice departments. And it can result in prison sentences when other evidence against the suspect is thin.", "This happened in the case of Willie Allen Lynch. Back in 2015, undercover agents in Florida got a man to sell $50 worth of crack cocaine to them. But they didn\u2019t want to blow their cover right away. So instead of arresting him on the spot, one officer held a phone to his ear, pretending to be on a call, and took a few snapshots of the man.", "Back at the Sheriff\u2019s Office, detectives were unable to identify the man on the photos. So they turned to the Face Analysis Comparison Examination System (FACES) instead. When presented with a photo, this software returns possible suspects from the police\u2019s database. The photo returned Willie Lynch, among other suspects, and he got arrested.", "One troubling aspect is that the agents didn\u2019t mention FACES in Lynch\u2019s arrest report and claimed instead that they\u2019d identified him using a manual search. The other aspect is that multiple suspects were returned by the software, all rated with a star system.", "As Slate reported, the analyst who ran the software thought that Lynch was he was rated with one star by FACES, while all the others had none. She admitted, however, that she had no idea what the maximum number of stars possible was.", "Funnily enough, neither the court nor the police considered that the man on the photo may just not be in the police\u2019s database of suspects. The fact that Lynch is Black emphasizes this point. Apart from that one snapshot, all they had is $50 worth of crack cocaine \u2014 but apparently that was evidence enough to lock the man up for eight years.", "The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a friend-of-the-court brief in March 2019 to get the issue into Florida\u2019s Supreme Court. But since these kinds of processes take time, it might not be until the end of Lynch\u2019s eight years in prison until a decision has fallen. And nobody can give these years back to Lynch.", "As the riots against racism go on worldwide, so does a massive wave of arrests. We\u2019ll need to make sure that faulty facial recognition software doesn\u2019t lead to more false accusations.", "The technology isn\u2019t ripe for police use as long as it\u2019s unequal. And the technology isn\u2019t ripe at all; that\u2019s a fact. Two years ago, IBM released a \u201cdiversity in faces\u201d dataset to level out the disparities in facial recognition. Now, they have announced that they will no longer offer, develop, or research this kind of technology. It seems as if the prevailing biases are so strong that even IBM can\u2019t smooth them out.", "Obviously, this doesn\u2019t mean that other firms like Google, Amazon and Microsoft won\u2019t keep pushing in the area. But even they are starting to doubt how ethical and lucrative facial recognition software really is.", "As the EU is considering a five-year ban of the technology, Amazon and Microsoft are opposing the ban much louder than Google. As a matter of fact, Google is refusing to sell facial recognition software to anyone. It seems like the scandal around the way they tried to get images of Black and Brown faces was enough for them. Microsoft is following suit and has announced that it won\u2019t sell its software to the police.", "Even big corporations are realizing that screwing Black and Brown people isn\u2019t cool anymore. As more and more people go on the streets against racism, voices against facial recognition are getting louder, too.", "Whichever color our skin, it\u2019s our job to hear those voices and make them heard. Think about that the next time you see a CCTV camera.", "Your home for data science.
