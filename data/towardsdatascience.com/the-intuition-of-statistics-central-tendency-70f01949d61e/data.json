We discovered Statistics to help ourselves in sheer decision making, analysis of events \u2014 why they are and how do we predict the same in most probable near future. Our brains are more statistical and mathematically oriented.", "According to Kenneth Craik, our brains model the reality to understand the reality itself. This model is notoriously known as the Small-Scale Model.", "In a nutshell, we use statistics to discern good reasoning (decision) and bad reasoning (decision). I want you all to understand the desiderata involved here. Let\u2019s digest the above sentence. You might wonder how statistics are applied in deciding what is good and what is bad?", "Our Brains are so good at collecting data, analyzing it, and intelligently help us reason out the conclusive results. How does it collect Data? Brains collect data through the sense organs (eyes, nose, ears, tongue, and skin), well that\u2019s too much Biology in the room. The whole process happens unconsciously within no time. The hidden process is converting data into sensible information.", "This simple introspection leaves us with a significant conclusion. We need Data to perform Statistics and to chart out Results. The more data you have, the more reasonable conclusions we make.", "Hence I am shedding light on intuitive assimilation of the statistical concepts which are fundamental to relate events in our daily activities.", "Whenever we have data, be it numerical or categorical, we endeavor to understand it by finding the common patterns. During this process, we either invented or discovered some of the statistical relations or functions and they are called Central Tendency. Central Tendency is the characteristic of quantitative data (values of the distribution) to cluster around the central value. What values of the distribution are considered as central value(s)? That\u2019s a good question, to answer that, we generally calculate the average or median or mode of the distribution. But why only average, median, and mode? If you have this question in your mind, then get in the line we will unravel slowly.", "Let\u2019s create some data and play with it. We will write some simple Python functions and see the answers live.", "I know the code looks big, but it is simple. We also need to create a simple function to generate our observations.", "Now we are all set to understand why average, median, and mode are considered to be central values. Let\u2019s instantiate the class we just coded.", "Have you noticed the 1st and the 2nd subplot? Mean (average) in purple and Median (Q2) in green, both fall approximately in the center of the observations. The second subplot that depicts Mode is not the center of the observations (remember, it may sometimes be in the center). Visualization always helps to unravel these fundamental concepts in Statistics. If you don\u2019t understand how a function is working under the hood, then just chart the inputs on the X-axis and outputs on the Y-axis, now you have a diagrammatic representation of the function. This will make life easier.", "Let\u2019s examine the Mean and the Median in little detail.", "Outliers impact the value of the Mean but not the value of the Median.", "What are outliers? In the summer season when every Human Being in the neighborhood is wearing lite summer outfits and if you wear a sweater then you are an outlier. Technically speaking, an outlier is a value in the distribution that is extremely different from the rest of the values in the same distribution. And YES, outliers impact the value of Mean but not Median. Let\u2019s see this with visualization and little code.", "Let's instantiate the class for mean and median separately and see the result.", "The mean is highly affected if there are any outliers. In the above graph, the 1st subplot represents mean with no outliers in the data. The 2nd subplot represents mean being pulled towards outlier to some extent when an outlier is added in the same data. The outlier value is 285 which is extremely greater than any other value in the distribution.", "The median is not affected by outliers but they do have a slight effect when the outliers are much larger. In the above graph, we don\u2019t see any change in the value of the median in spite of outliers being present in the data. The outlier value is 209 in this case but has no effect on the median.", "This clearly explains the outlier behavior on the Mean and the Median.", "The mean and the median are central values of the distribution. All the graphs above clearly illustrate their nature and answer to our fundamental question of why they are center? Because when formulating mean and median we consider all the observations and perform some aggregation. Due to this aggregation, the outcome always falls within the highest and the lowest values of the distribution but mostly center. The Median is often unaffected but the Mean is highly affected by extreme values.", "I hope this article helps us to understand the nature of Mean and Median.", "Your home for data science.
