They seem to be concerned with the unknown future and how it affects us. Since I have been exploring the topic of AI Safety it does now make sense seeing as FLI has funded a series of different projects throughout the last five years particularly with two rounds, both funded by Elon Musk and different research institutes. The first round seems to have been in 2015 with a focus on AI Safety Researchers and the second round with its focus on artificial general intelligence (AGI) Safety Researchers in 2018.

FLI is currently focusing on keeping artificial intelligence beneficial and they are also exploring ways of reducing risks from nuclear weapons and biotechnology. They are based in Boston and held a launch event at MIT in 2014. They organised a conference on the Future of AI in 2015. 5000 researchers signed on a letter to make AI robust. In 2015 Elon Musk announced that he would be supporting with $10 million, with the first $6 million set up at that time. 37 researchers were chosen and grant winners produced over 45 scientific publications.

Our programme aims to address several questions that are foundational to the problem of governing advanced AI systems. We will pursue four workstreams toward this aim, concerning the state of Chinese AI research and policy thought, evolving relationships between governments and AI research firms, the prospects for verifying agreements on AI use and development, and strategically relevant properties of AI systems that may guide states\u2019 approaches to AI governance.

Instead of designing rewards by hand, we consider inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), an imitation learning technique where agents learn directly from human demonstrations. These techniques are well developed for the single agent case, and while they have limitations, they are often considered a key component for addressing the value alignment problem. Yet, multi-agent settings are relatively unexplored.", "We propose to fill this gap and develop imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning algorithms specifically designed for multi-agent settings. Our objectives are to: 1) develop techniques to imitate observed human behavior and interactions, 2) explicitly recover rewards that can explain complex strategic behaviors in multi-agent systems, enabling agents to reason about human behavior and safely co-exist, 3) develop interpretable techniques, and 4) deal with irrational agents to maximize safety.

Existing approaches to AGI (including RL and IRL) are arguably not safely scalable: the agent can become un-aligned once its cognitive resources exceed those of the human overseer. Christiano\u2019s Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA) is a promising alternative. In IDA, the human and agent are \u2018amplified\u2019 into a resourceful (but slow) overseer by allowing the human to make calls to the previous iteration of the agent. By construction, this overseer is intended to always stay ahead of the agent being overseen.", "Could IDA produce highly capable aligned agents given sufficiently advanced ML components? While we cannot directly get empirical evidence today, we can study it indirectly by running amplification with humans as stand-ins for AI.

The project will thus provide foundations on which incentives will stimulate such outcomes, and how they need to be employed and deployed, within incentive boundaries suited to types of players, in order to achieve high level of compliance in a cooperative safety agreement and avoid AI disasters.\u201d", "The Anh Han is currently a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at School of Computing, Media and the Arts, Teeside University.", "\u201cTechnical Abstract: Many paradigms exist, and more will be created, for developing and understanding AI.

This project explores the safety issues of present and future AGI paradigms from the perspective of measures of generality, as a complementary dimension to performance.", "We investigate the following research questions:1. Should we define generality in terms of tasks, goals or dominance? How does generality relate to capability, to computational resources, and ultimately to risks?2. What are the safe trade-offs between general systems with limited capability or less general systems with higher capability? How is this related to the efficiency and risks of automation?3.

The goal is to extend the existing theory to enable formal investigations into the Control Problem for generally intelligent agents. Our focus is on the most essential properties that the theory of Universal AI lacks, namely a theory of agents embedded in the real world: it does not model itself reliably, it is constraint to a single agent, it does not explore safely, and it is not well-understood how to specify goals that are aligned with human values.\u201d", "Marcus Hutter is Professor in the Research School of Computer Science (RSCS) at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra.
