However, often we have wished there was a single point that was representative of the data at hand. Using any extreme value in the data series would only explain one end of the series. So, it may be useful to use a central value with some observations larger or smaller than it. Such a measure is called central tendency. However, does a central point tell the entire story? You know some values are larger or smaller than the central tendency value, however it does not talk about the spread or heterogeneity in the data. This is what dispersion measures. The two concepts form a foundation for many advanced statistical concepts.", "The aim of this article is to describe the different measures of central tendency and also introduce a bit of simple python coding to explain how to see them in practice. I\u2019ll attempt to share some knowledge on dispersion in a follow up article.", "Different measures of central tendency can be easily demonstrated by the below chart:", "As evident from the image, central tendency can be classified into 3 classes \u2014 mean, median and mode. Before we get into the details of each, it is worth taking a look at the requisite properties of an ideal measure of central tendency as defined by Prof. Udny Yule:", "With this in mind, let us take a look at different measures of Central Tendency below. Also, 2 noteworthy concepts to note here are population and sample. Population is the collection of all possible observations in a data set while sample is a subset drawn from the population using different techniques.", "The mean is calculated by various mathematical operations on all observations in a data series:", "One interesting property of A.M. to note here is that if each observation in a series is increased or decreased by the same constant, the A.M. of the new series would also increase or decrease by the same constant.", "If the calculations can be taken a bit further, it is very easy to see that usage of logarithms can make the calculations easier.", "A useful relationship between the 3 types of mean is (look at the Python codes below for a demonstration):", "An elaborate mathematical proof is available for this relationship which I\u2019ll skip in the main article and provide separately later in a follow-up edition.", "In a series of observations, median is defined as the middle most value. In a discrete series, if the count of observations is odd, then median is simply the (N+1)/2-th observation of the ordered series. However, if the discrete series has even number of observations then median is approximated as the arithmetic mean of the (N/2)-th and (N/2)+1-th observations of the ordered series.", "What if instead of an instead of an individual series like above, there are frequency distributions for discrete or continuous data?", "We refer to frequency tables like figures 3a and 3b. The table in 3a is slightly easier so let us tackle that first. Here the total number of observations is 250, which is even. So, the median would be the N/2 = 125th observation. By looking at the cumulative frequency (Fig 4), the 125th observation can be determined. In table 3a, which lists discrete observations, we would expect the 125th observation to be 5. Why? There are 112 observations which are \u2264 4. The next 25 observations are valued 5. So, given 112 + 13 = 125, it means that 13th observation after the last 4 should be 5 and hence the median.", "Next, let us look at 3b. Following the above approach, we can find that the median would lie in the class 46\u201355, but we do not know an exact point. Can that be found? The answer is yes. More often, answers from the data can be obtained by plotting it. A cumulative frequency for this example can be calculated (like Fig 4) for each limit of the weight classes and plotted in a chart:", "Given there are 3,000 observations (N) in the data, the median would be the N/2 = 1,500th observation which lies between 135\u2013144 lbs range (this is the median class). Based on the chart above (Fig 5), if you plot the point on the horizontal axis which corresponds to cumulative frequency = 1,500 on the vertical axis, you would find the weight to be approximately 137 lbs. Hence, the median weight is approximately 137 lbs. Such a curve is known as ogive. This can be generalized in a mathematical formula:", "When the values are substituted, the median for this example comes out to be 136.96.", "Mode is defined as the value which is most frequent in a series of observations. Considering a simple series like 9, 1, 10, 9, 3, 7, 4, 9, 5, 6 the mode is 9 as it occurs most frequently, i.e., 3 times. There can be multiple modes or no modes in a series. For example, 10, 11, 13, 11, 10, 15, 17, 12 has 2 modes, 10 and 11 whereas a series like 2, 6, 3, 2, 6, 3 has no mode as all the elements have exactly same frequency. Mode can be calculating by observing a data series. In case of a continuous distribution like the one in Fig 6, there is a mathematical formula that can be used.", "The class 50\u201360 USD has the highest frequency and hence is the modal class. A mathematical formula to calculate the mode value in this case of continuous distributions with ranges is as follows:", "Substituting the values in the above example, the mode for this data is 56.", "We have looked at the ideal properties of central tendency earlier in the article. Let us compare the different measures of central tendency based on the properties and also look at some of their most common usages:", "This section does not intend to introduce or teach Python programming language, but the below embedded codes will help users with even basic familiarity of Python to calculate central tendency from various data series.", "This article introduced the foundational principles for calculating Central Tendency and also new age computational resources like Python that can make the task of calculating it much easier with huge volumes of data! Central Tendency serves as a foundation concept for all further advanced statistical work and needs to be understood well before working with advanced data distributions.", "The next most important concept to understand would be measures of dispersion which I shall attempt to explain in my next article.", "Read my next article describing measures of dispersion with mathematical formulae and Python coding here.", "Your home for data science.
