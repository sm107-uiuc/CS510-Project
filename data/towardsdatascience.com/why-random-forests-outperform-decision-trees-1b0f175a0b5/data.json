The following figure shows the decision boundary becomes more accurate and stable as more trees are added.", "Here we\u2019ll provide two reasons why random forests outperform single decision trees.", "Higher resolution in the feature space", "Trees are unpruned. While a single decision tree like CART is often pruned, a random forest tree is fully grown and unpruned, and so, naturally, the feature space is split into more and smaller regions.", "Trees are diverse. Each random forest tree is learned on a random sample, and at each node, a random set of features are considered for splitting. Both mechanisms create diversity among the trees.", "Two random trees each with one split are illustrated below. For each tree, two regions can be assigned with different labels. By combining the two trees, there are four regions that can be labeled differently.", "Unpruned and diverse trees lead to a high resolution in the feature space. For continuous features, it means a smoother decision boundary, as shown in the following.", "A single decision tree needs pruning to avoid overfitting. The following shows the decision boundary from an unpruned tree. The boundary is smoother but makes obvious mistakes (overfitting).", "So how can random forests build unpruned trees without overfitting?", "For the two-class (blue and red) problem below, both splits x1=3 and x2=3 can fully separate the two classes.", "The two splits, however, result in very different decision boundaries. Decision trees often use the first variable to split, and so the ordering of the variables in the training data determines the decision boundary.", "Now consider random forests. For each random sample used for training a tree, the probability that the red point missing from the sample is", "So roughly 1 out of 3 trees is built with all blue data and always predict class blue. The other 2/3 of the trees have the red point in the training data. Since at each node a random subset of features is considered, we expect roughly 1/3 of the trees use x1, and the rest 1/3 uses x2. The splits from the two types of trees are illustrated below.", "By aggregating the three types of trees, the decision boundary shown below is now symmetric for x1 and x2. As long as there are enough trees, the boundary should be stable and does not depend on irrelevant information such as the ordering of variables.", "The randomness and voting mechanisms in random forests elegantly solve the overfitting problem.", "Although random forests are accurate, they are considered as black-box models (hard to explain). This article illustrates how to interpret them.", "Find more content in my book freely available at dataanalyticsbook.info.", "Your home for data science.
