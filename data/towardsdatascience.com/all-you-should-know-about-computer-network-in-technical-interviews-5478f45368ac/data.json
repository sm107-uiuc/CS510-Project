Please wait for our further notice in the next few days.\u201d", "Does this seem similar to you?", "Don\u2019t give up. You definitely can do it better.", "Here are some common computer network problems you would face in technical interviews. Most of them are related to the application, transport, and network layers. You can follow this guide to learn computer networks from scratch and clearly explain them to your interviewer.", "In general, computer network concepts often be divided into 5 main layers. This is a combination of the OSI (Open System Interconnection) model and TCP/IP model, which have 7 layers and 4 layers respectively.", "The following introduction will be based on the OSI network model:", "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented service, which means it builds connection before transferring data and closes the connection after the transmission.", "The reliability of TCP reflects on establishing a connection by a three-way handshake, and some mechanisms like error detection, flow control, congestion control, and retransmission. Those features will cost a lot of overhead and occupy the resources of processors.", "TCP is often used in the file transmission, sending and receiving of mail, and remote login.", "UDP (User Datagram Protocol) does not need to build a connection before the data transmission, which means that the remote host is not required to acknowledge after receiving UDP segments.", "Although UDP cannot provide reliable transmission, it is the most effective service under certain situations (instant messaging in general), e.g., real-time audio and video streaming.", "We\u2019ll first look at how TCP build connection in the Client/Server model, which is generally called a three-way handshake:", "SYN segments confirm that the route from a sender to a receiver has no issue, but the route from a receiver to a sender should be confirmed by ACK segments.", "Next, we\u2019re going to discuss how TCP terminates the connection in a Client/Server model, which is a four-way handshake process:", "ARQ is an error-control method for data transmission in the transport layer and data link layer.", "Acknowledgments and timeouts are used to ensure reliable data transmission. If a receiver doesn\u2019t get the acknowledgment within a given time, it will resent the same packet until an acknowledgment has been returned or exceeding the pre-defined times of retransmission.", "There are two types of ARQ, including:", "The purpose of flow control is to control the speed of packet sending, which ensures the receiver can receive it in time.", "TCP can achieve flow control by sliding windows. The sliding window size at the sender side can be controlled by ACK segments returned by the receiver, which can also affect the sending speed.", "Network congestion happens when the requests for a network resource exceeds the amount of data it can handle.", "Congestion control is to prevent excessive data from injected into the network so that the network links or nodes will not be overloaded.", "TCP congestion control adopts various strategies, which are:", "This process can be divided into a few steps:", "HTTP is a \u201cstateless\u201d protocol, which means it doesn\u2019t save the connection status between requests and responses itself.", "So how do we save user status?", "Sessions are managed to solve this problem. The main feature of sessions is to record user status from the server-side.", "For instance, while you putting some products into your Amazon shopping cart, and thinking of buying them later. The system actually cannot know who is saving those items via HTTP since it is stateless. So the server will create and keep a specific session for you, which enables tracking your shopping information.", "Both cookies and sessions can track and store user identity, but they\u2019re often be used in different scenarios.", "Cookies are generally used to store user information. For example, after we log into a website, next time we do not need to log in again since our security details have been stored as a token in a cookie. The system just has to find the user based on token value.", "Sessions record user status via server. The typical scenario of using sessions is online shopping carts. As HTTP is stateless, the server will track user status by marking them with a session.", "Cookie data are stored on the client-side (browser), whereas session data are stored on the server-side. This implies that sessions have a higher security level comparing to cookies.", "HTTP runs beyond the TCP and transfers the content with plaintext. Both client and server sides cannot verify each other\u2019s identity.", "HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the HTTP that runs beyond SSL/TLS, which SSL/TLS running beyond the TCP. All the content transferred is encrypted.", "Hence, the security of HTTPS is higher than HTTP, but HTTPS requires more resources than HTTP.", "To be clear, there is still a lot of knowledge related to computer networks. Since common technical interviews, especially the junior software engineer interview, often focus on the upper half of network layers, those problems we\u2019ve seen are only a small part of this field.", "Hope you find it useful and good luck with your next interview!", "Your home for data science.
