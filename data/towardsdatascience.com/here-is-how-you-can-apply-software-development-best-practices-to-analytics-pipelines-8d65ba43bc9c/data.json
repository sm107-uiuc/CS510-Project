Being a hardcore software engineer, I always wondered how to bring the principle of software engineering best practices to the analytics world. Recently I came across a very interesting open-source tool \u2014 dbt ( Data Build Tool).", "dbt applies the following principles of software engineering to analytics code \u2014", "dbt is an open-source project under Apache 2.0 license.", "One thing you need to note is, dbt does NOT help you in ingesting data. dbt\u2019s magic comes live when your data is already sitting in your data warehouse.", "dbt currently supports ( via core and community contributions) the following databases/data warehouses \u2014", "The focus of this article is to showcase how dbt is built inline with software development best practices.", "dbt allows you to transform your data using a simple command-line option. Installation instructions are available on the dbt site based on your OS. Once dbt CLI is installed you can verify by running a simple command \u2014", "You will be able to see options like \u2014", "dbt was first created by a company called Fishtown Analytics. They also offer a cloud-based dbt service \u2014 https://cloud.getdbt.com/", "You can either use CLI or the cloud service as per your choice.", "In this tutorial, I am going to transform a very simple data which I loaded into the Big Query. The dataset I am using is available on my GitHub repo. You can download and upload it to Big Query.", "The table scheme looks like this", "Sample data looks like this \u2014", "You can configure the Big Query credentials using the methods described on the dbt site. Here I am using the service account JSON key method. You need to make sure the service account has following permission \u2014", "Then you need to make sure dbt profile is setup $HOME/.dbt/profile.yml and details for the service account are updated as shown below \u2014", "You can set up profiles for dev and prod separately without affecting any code change. This one of the features of dbt which allows us to do the sandboxing and environment management easily.", "You can create a dbt project using a simple CLI command", "This command creates a sample dbt project with all the required files and folders. The typical structure looks like as shown below -", "Looking at the folder structure, you can see the sense of software development principles where you see folders for tests, logs, modules, data separately. This allows the overall manageability and readability of the code structure. This is very much version control friendly and easy to follow.", "You can read about the details of the folder structure and their meaning on the dbt site.", "In dbt_project.yml , you need to set up the profile you configured in the earlier section.", "I am creating two simple models to manipulate the data and get some insights.", "The models/example/athletes.sql looks like this \u2014", "and model/example/players_by_country.sql looks like this \u2014", "Here you can see the dbt feature where you can define a model in one file and refer it in other models. This helps in re-usability. Also if you need to change anything in base model, you can do it in one place. Just like in any typical software engineering language.", "Models have other features like \u2014", "You can create models inside the specific folders. This allows you to achieve modularity. This is similar to creating packages/namespaces in certain programming languages.", "dbt allows you to auto-generate documentation for the models. Making it easier for the team to understand and collaborate better", "You can generate docs by running a command", "You will be able to look at the documentation by running a command \u2014", "You can even look at the lineage information in the documentation website as shown below \u2014", "dbt allows you to do some testing of the models generated. By default, you can configure tests like a unique check, null check, referential integrity etc. for a model. In this example, I am running sample schema tests to validate the results of the model for null checks. I can configure these tests in schema.yml as shown below \u2014", "You can run tests for this project by running a simple command like", "and see output like this \u2014", "You can even run some complex tests as described on the dbt site.", "Every time you compile and run a dbt project, it will generate the detailed logs for you. In case, you face any issues, these logs are quite useful to trace back the errors.", "All dbt commands give proper exit codes like 0, 1, 2. You can use this feature in a CI/CD pipeline so that you know if a particular step was successful or failed.", "Your home for data science.
