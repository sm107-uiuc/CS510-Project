I applied data science methods to forecast the e-commerce sales, predict the profitability of the products at a granular level, and optimize the profit of the firm. And finally, the project achieved buy-in for operationalization from the firm\u2019s eCommerce Insights & Analytics team.", "This article is an extension of the experiences and learnings gained through that project. I\u2019ll explore the different avenues where data analytics can be employed in the e-commerce retail industry, particularly by multinational consumer goods companies like Unilever, Nestle, P&G, etc. And I\u2019ll do that in my trademark easy-to-understand, fun-to-read style.", "In the words of Claire Hennah, Global VP of eCommerce at Unilever,", "\u201cE-commerce is no longer a channel simply for the future. The future is here.\u201d", "I love numbers. So, I\u2019ll start with some numbers.", "In the 2nd Quarter of 2020, US retail e-commerce sales have shot up to $211.5 billion, up from $160.4 billion in the 1st Quarter. The lockdown caused by Covid-19 has certainly contributed to this boost in e-commerce sales.

He knew the food items you bought, the laundry detergent you purchased, or the ice-cream your kid loved. He knew your shopping budget and would make recommendations. And you did end up purchasing what he recommended quite a few times. Didn\u2019t you?", "That relationship with the customers is what the companies need.", "A product recommendation engine is the solution. What is a recommendation engine?", "It is simply an automated form of the \u2018friendly storekeeper\u2019. It is a tool that uses machine learning algorithms to suggest products to customers that they might be interested in. The recommendations can happen through the following channels:", "The recommendation engines are of two types:", "This is useful for sending out recommendations via welcome emails or bulk newsletters, without using customer data. Here are some useful categories:", "This is gold! It uses customer data to recommend the best offers and promotions. It uses deep learning algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to make the customer experience as personalized as possible. The algorithms use data from the following spheres:", "These algorithms are really powerful and can greatly boost e-commerce sales by:", "Here\u2019s what Amazon\u2019s recommendation engine shows me currently. It looks like it knows that I love to workout.", "McKinsey has reported that 35% of what customers purchase on Amazon come from product recommendations based on such algorithms.", "Market Basket Analysis is a technique that identifies the strength of association between a pair/group of products that are purchased together. In simpler words, it\u2019s based on the concept that if a customer buys a product, they are more or less likely to buy another related product. Market Basket Analysis also uses machine learning/deep learning algorithms, like product recommendation engines.", "I\u2019ll explain this with an example from the project at Colgate-Palmolive that I mentioned earlier. I bundled a children\u2019s toothbrush (unprofitable product) with a deodorant, a dad\u2019s product (fast-moving product), and was able to increase the total weekly profit of the combination by 8%.", "Association rule learning is a machine learning method that is used for discovering associations between products. It does not consider the order of the purchase of products. Let me explain this with a demonstration.", "The analysis is run on millions of baskets, but I\u2019ll demonstrate it with 7 baskets and explain the 3 important measures used.

Expected confidence is simply the probability that product y is in the basket.", "Business meaning: The lift of a rule indicates how strong is the association within the rule, i.e. how better a rule is at predicting the result than just assuming the result in the first place. Higher lift values indicate stronger associations.", "I know lift is a little tricky. But I hope you got it now.", "And after this, Chi-squared analysis is useful to determine the statistical significance of association rules.", "80% of people say that the most important aspect of shopping at an online e-commerce store is competitive pricing.", "So, you know how important it is to set optimal prices and strike a balance between customer satisfaction and the firm\u2019s profit. Now, let\u2019s explore 3 important concepts related to price optimization:", "This is the first step in price optimization, where you\u2019ll group similar products and customers. Classification (supervised) and clustering (unsupervised) algorithms are useful for this segmentation. The best technique will depend on the business requirements and the type of data.", "By the way, I had used K-mean clustering to form groups of products with similar sales trends during my stint at Colgate. It had helped me to build one predictive model per cluster instead of having many models.", "And, I have touched upon RFM Customer Segmentation in another article of mine. Give it a quick read!", "Once the segmentation is done, regression model on the various data points around sales, conversion rates, seasonality, product attributes, marketing channels, etc. helps to fix optimal prices for the products.", "Let me give you a hypothetical business example from the CPG industry. The regression model built by the analytics team at Unilever for Personal Care products can help it to predict that a 5% decrease in the price of Dove deodorant can boost sales by 15%.", "Do you remember the last time the price of your favorite product dropped during the big sale at Amazon, and the other e-commerce stores also dropped their prices?", "This is dynamic pricing. It uses competitor data as an input into machine learning algorithms for pricing to determine the product price at different times. This helps the products to remain viable in the competitive market with frequent price fluctuations.", "A/B Testing can be used to refine the pricing model, but it needs a lot of technical considerations and is a whole different topic. I\u2019ll talk about it in detail some other time. Meanwhile, you may want to read this article I have written on the top mistakes that creep in during A/B Testing, with interesting business cases & fixes.", "Let\u2019s imagine Benjamin Franklin and Abraham Lincoln to be e-commerce business tycoons for a minute.", "Franklin seems to have warned against underestimating the potential of demand forecasting in e-commerce retail sales,", "\u201cIf you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.\u201d", "And Lincoln seems to have provided the perfect strategy for including demand forecasting in the analytics scene at your e-commerce company.", "\u201cGive me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.\u201d", "Demand forecasting refers to the use of analytics techniques to predict the demand for a product and forecast sales. When you know the sales trends in advance, it gives you an advantage over your competitors in the following ways:", "An underestimation of inventory levels can lead to inventory getting out of stock and hence cause customer dissatisfaction. An overestimation of inventory stock levels can lead to overstocking of inventory and hence cause unnecessary storage costs.", "Demand forecasting helps in informed inventory planning and saves you from both selling out of popular products and warehouse space wastage due to slow-moving stock.", "Since the money is not tied up in slow-moving inventory, It helps you plan the budget properly and use the cash optimally. Thus, it helps you to reduce financial risk.", "Effective demand forecasting also helps in improved pricing strategy. You can charge more for the products having a high demand forecast, and vice versa. You can better plan the marketing budget, advertising investment, and discount plans.", "The prior knowledge of the product demands and their fluctuations helps in planning better customer service. It\u2019s time for a business example.", "Amazon patented \u2018Anticipatory Shipping\u2019 in 2013 to use predictive modeling to ship products to you before you would even make the purchase. Amazon\u2019s algorithms would predict your purchase, and it would send the product to your nearest warehouse. Then, Amazon would wait until the actual purchase. Amazon believed that this would drastically cut the delay from the time of purchase to the actual delivery and boost the overall company sales.", "There are more analytics applications in the e-commerce retail industry but these are some of the prominent ones with a direct impact on the revenue from e-commerce sales. I hope you enjoyed reading it.", "To end with Joel Anderson\u2019s (Former CEO, Walmart) powerful message,", "\u201cYou can\u2019t just open a website and expect people to flood in.
