So. What. Two words that can come across as downright hostile, as opposed to particularly useful managerial guidance.", "Of course, once you\u2019ve had some time to get over the jarring response to that beautiful scatter plot you\u2019ve been tirelessly crafting for the last six hours, you start to see their point (albeit begrudgingly).", "Data scientists can be precious of their work. This isn\u2019t a criticism \u2014 the characteristic is normally born of healthy passion. And good data scientists are an intellectually curious bunch (I\u2019ve done plenty of analysis for its own sake in my time!)", "However, in a professional context analysis is rarely an end goal in and of itself. Even the world\u2019s great analytical powerhouses \u2014 your Facebooks, Googles, and Amazons \u2014 crunch numbers to somehow improve an aspect of their business.", "In my previous life as a Consultant, my analysis was supposed to inform a business decision, or help form the basis of a client recommendation. Hence the catchphrase, \u201cSo What?\u201d I soon learned to self-assess my work. The difference between two customer cohorts is statistically significant. So what? Can my client do anything useful with this information?", "Having spent five years in Management Consultancy, conflating things that are \u2018interesting\u2019 with things that are \u2018important\u2019 is a mistake that I\u2019ve seen all too often. I\u2019d gently suggest that less than half of all McKinsey consultants who\u2019ve used the phrases \u2018Advanced Analytics\u2019 or \u2018Machine Learning\u2019 in front of their clients properly know what these things are, and fewer still would know how they\u2019d actually help to solve the business problem at hand.", "So, if faced with a sea (or indeed a lake) of data, how are we supposed to hit upon analysis that\u2019s guaranteed to be important, rather than a mere intellectual sideshow? In this context, good analysis stems from a well-constructed hypothesis, and a well-constructed hypothesis is the fruit of a well-constructed issue tree.", "The issue tree is a classic tool in any Consultant\u2019s kit. It allows the decomposition of a grand, overarching topic into multiple (and much smaller) \u2018issues\u2019, which can then be tackled separately. The golden rule when creating an issue tree is very simple: Be MECE!", "MECE (pronounced Mee-See, and originally developed by McKinsey consultant Barbara Minto in the 1960s) stands for:", "In other words, the branches coming off each \u2018node\u2019 of the issue tree should break down the issue into parts that do not overlap (ME), and that cover all possibilities (CE). This is best demonstrated using an example: let\u2019s say our business is experiencing fewer online sales than we\u2019d expect. How could we investigate this problem with an issue tree?", "Start with the first box on the left hand side. Online orders can be thought of as the number of times that people visit the website, multiplied by the number of times that visits are converted to a sale. Thus, we can take traffic generation and traffic conversion as two \u2018sub-issues\u2019 of online orders, which we can then think about in isolation.", "It follows mathematically that this split is MECE:", "Web traffic generation and its subsequent conversion are two different parts of the customer journey that we can analyse independtly (hence Mutually Exclusive), whilst we have shown mathematically that our two new branches can account for online orders without the need for a third factor (hence Completely Exhaustive).", "Note \u2014 this isn\u2019t the only possible MECE split. You could express online orders as the product of \u2018Total Orders\u2019 and \u2018Online Share of Orders\u2019, for example. You could always write a second tree using these branches as your starting point, and see if you reach different conclusions.", "Having created your first branches, you then work left to right, breaking down each issue into further sub-issues, going down as far as you can.", "Some general tips for creating issue trees:", "Suppose that we\u2019re working or consulting for Northwind Traders, a fictional company created by Microsoft, which imports and exports food and drink products to customers around the world. We have access to their SQL database, and we have been tasked to come up with (and then test) some hypotheses to help inform business strategy.", "Without even diving into the data, we can come up with a rudimentary issue tree to help structure our thinking. We start with a simple mission statement that no one could argue with: Increase Northwind\u2019s Profit!", "What follows is a relatively simple issue tree \u2014 increase revenues, reduce costs, and so forth. However, by the third layer we\u2019re already in a position where we can start asking substantive questions, which could form the basis of hypotheses.", "Of course, we still need to do all the usual good stuff when designing a test \u2014 make sure that we have:", "Let\u2019s take the third annotation from the diagram. Northwind could notionally increase revenue per customer by encouraging each customer to make orders more frequently. However, it may be the case that customers who order less often do so because their orders are bigger \u2014 they buy 200 goods every two months, rather than 100 goods every month, for example. A head of sales might be interested to know whether or not this is the case before pulling the trigger on a big sales push!", "A sensible first step is to look at the data, and see if it holds any clues as to how exactly we should define our hypotheses. Let\u2019s create a scatter of Northwind\u2019s customers, plotting the average days between their orders against the average size of their orders.", "Far from the correlation we originally expected, it seems as though customers who order more often actually make bigger orders. Our analysis is now framed differently \u2014 if we can show that this relationship is statistically significant, then the business case for encouraging higher order frequencies is suddenly very strong indeed.", "We define our hypotheses in light of this. Let Group 1 be the customers who order at least once every two months on average, and let Group 2 be the customers who order less than once every two months on average. Then, we have:", "We can then run Monte Carlo simulations to come up with a p-value (see my previous blog for a full guide on how to do this).", "As it happens, we find that the p-value for this test tends to a miniscule 0.000005 (or 1 in 200,000). Given our standard alpha level is 0.05, this means we can emphatically reject the Null Hypothesis \u2014 customers that order more regularly make bigger orders, and Northwind should be doing everything it can to increase the order frequency of its existing customer base.", "Of course, if we had been unable to reject the Null Hypothesis this would have also been valuable. By demonstrating the absence of a relationship, we would be able to recommend against high-effort measures to increase order frequencies.", "This is the beauty of defining hypotheses using the issue tree approach \u2014 regardless of the experiment\u2019s outcome, you\u2019re always able to perform analysis that comes with a strong riposte to the question: \u201cSo What?\u201d", "Thanks for reading all the way to the end of the blog!
