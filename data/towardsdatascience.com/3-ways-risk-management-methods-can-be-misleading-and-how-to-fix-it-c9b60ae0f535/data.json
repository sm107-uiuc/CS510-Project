You also may be tempted to re-use scale definitions from a previous project.", "To illustrate how dangerous such practices could be, let\u2019s take an example.", "If you were told to prioritize two risks, one which may add a 17% delay to your project and a second one which can multiply by a factor of 2 your total budget. Which one would you consider more important?", "The answer to this question can depend on the nature of your project, however, most people would agree that losing 100% is more important than losing 17%.", "Now, let\u2019s take the previous scale definition table provided in the PMBOK and apply it to a 500K$ project which is supposed to last two years.", "Suppose you have to prioritize two risks with the same probability, one that could delay your project by 17% (4 months) and a second risk that could make you lose 100% of your budget (500K$).", "According to the definition table, the first risk (17% delay) will be rated as \u201cHigh priority\u201d while the second one (100% overbudget) will be rated as \u201cMedium\u201d. This is just the opposite of the intuitive conclusion we have made before!", "As a take away, before using any scale\u2019s definitions, even if it is provided by your organization, you should always make sure the different scales are aligned, coherent, and well suited to your project\u2019s context.", "Once you have evaluated the probability and impact levels using the well-defined scales, conventional risk management methods recommend associating a score to each scale level. Probabilities and impacts scores are then multiplied to calculate the risk\u2019s criticality.", "The higher this criticality is, the more the risk is considered as important and worth your attention to take action and reduce its probability or impact to an acceptable level.", "In the example provided in the PMBoK guide, the proposed scores range from 0.9 for \u201cvery high\u201d probabilities to 0.1 for the \u201cvery low\u201d ones, and impact scores range from 0.8 to 0.05.", "With such scales, two random events which are significantly different could be considered as equivalent. For example, two events with probabilities which are respectively equal to 0.71 and 0.99 will both have the same score of 0.9.", "This scale compression phenomena can even reverse the order of priorities of your risks.Consider for example two risks:", "Based on the probability-impact matrix above, the first risk has a higher criticality (0.14) than the second one (0.12). We expect it then to have a higher priority.", "However, if we calculated the maximum expected impact which is at risk in both cases, we will find the opposite order of priorities!", "If we plot all the possible values of budget impact vs the evolution of criticality, we can see a few other points where this function is decreasing. Which means that it reverses the natural order of priorities for the identified risks.", "We have just demonstrated that, due to a scale\u2019s compression effect, risk management methods can lead to reversed risk prioritizations.", "The last type of error we make when dealing with risks is related to the way people (mis)interpret the probability scales.", "David Budescu, Professor of Psychometrics and Quantitative Psychology at Fordham University, has conducted several studies where he questioned thousands of people from different nationalities about their understanding of sentences extracted from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.", "The IPCC is the United Nation\u2019s body for assessing the science related to climate change. The IPCC rely on probability scales (such as \u201cunlikely\u201d and \u201cvery likely\u201d) to convey the underlying uncertainty of its forecasts.", "David Budescu demonstrated that people systematically misinterpret the probabilistic statements even when they are provided with clear definitions of these scales (e.g., unlikely < 33%; very likely > 90%).", "David Budescu\u2019s teams succeeded in enhancing the percentage of interpretations which are aligned with the definition by changing the scales\u2019 definition to match the probabilities that participants would have associated to the words \u201clikely\u201d, \u201cvery likely,\u201d and others used in their daily life.", "The percentage of consistent interpretation jumped thus from 26% to 40%. However, 40% of consistency in comprehending the scales is still very low.Imagine you are in a meeting with your colleagues and have just agreed to categorize a specific risk as \u201cvery likely\u201d while you are referring to the scale\u2019s definition where \u201cvery likely\u201d is associated to probabilities higher than 90%.According to this study, you still could have 40% of your team that agrees with you to use the \u201cvery likely\u201d level, while if they were asked to assign a probability to this same event they would say > 50%.", "The only thing you would have succeeded in doing in this meeting was creating an illusion of communication and agreement within your team on what should be the most important risks to tackle.", "In this article, we have just shared 3 possible ways conventional risk management methods can be misleading and ambiguous.", "I am not saying you should stop using these methods. However, it is important to be aware of these biases in order to make the most of such methods while limiting their possible drawbacks.Below are few guidelines to increase your chance of success:", "Your home for data science.
