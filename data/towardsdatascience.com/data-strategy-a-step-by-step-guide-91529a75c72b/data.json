If you own your own business, it will help you draw a roadmap for extracting the most value out of data. Either way, understanding how a company\u2019s strategy takes data into account is more important than ever.", "The main steps for drafting a data strategy are:", "Let\u2019s take a look at each one of them, in detail.", "When it comes to getting value from data, business goals usually fall into 3 categories: improving business decisions, improving operations or using data as an asset. You should outline what is it that your company wants to achieve with data, considering one or more of these categories.", "For each area of your business, follow these steps:", "This will give you a list of questions to be answered using data, which will guide your data strategy.", "Goals for improving operations fall into 2 categories: optimising everyday operational processes and improving customer offering:", "List opportunities in manufacturing, warehousing and distribution, business processes, sales and marketing processes", "List opportunities for developing better services or better products", "The use of data as an asset usually is defined well before, sometimes being the company\u2019s own core business. It is possible, however, that you can create an extra flow of revenue by using data you already collect or are already in a good position to collect.", "A good example of this case is Google, whose own original core business was based on using data smartly.", "An example of this is Fitbit, the wristband that collects health and sports-related data from the user, and sells it in the shape of information (your heart rate, how many steps did you walk, etc.)", "When choosing the right infrastructure to host and analyse your data, you should first answer the following questions:", "With this in mind, choose the best tools and infrastructure for each of the following tasks (notice that you can use the same tool for many or even all of them):", "Now that you have defined your goals and chosen the tools and infrastructure for achieving them, you can better understand what skills you need in your organisation in order to make the best use of those tools, and how to build them.", "Some broad categories of skills that can be needed are:", "Within each of them, you should be able to define the more specific skills, such as a programming language or machine learning technique. Using this framework, follow through with these steps:", "It is very hard to find people with all the skills you need to fill the gap, so if you find candidates with some of them, you might consider training them to build the necessary competency level, or integrating them in a complementary team that will fill those gaps together.", "Data can be an asset but it can very well be a liability too if you don\u2019t take good care of it. Your data should be safe from leakages, attacks and even unwanted access by unnecessary people within the organisation itself.", "A few items to be taken into account here:", "You finally know what goals you want to achieve, the tools and skills needed, and made sure that are no loose ends regarding data security. Now it\u2019s time to get your hands dirty:", "These steps you ensure that you have concrete goals to look for (such as people to hire or tools to procure), a timeline for them and that someone is responsible for the project and ensures that the deadlines and requirements are being followed. Since your business goals and the technical environment are not static, this is an iterative process, so you should revise your strategy periodically to make sure it stays relevant, and make the necessary updates.", "This article was loosely based on Data Strategy, which I think is a good book, but that also contains a lot of examples that might not be relevant for everyone. I tried then to extract the key insights into a step-by-step guide, adding my own inputs when needed.", "Your home for data science.
