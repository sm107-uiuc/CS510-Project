They\u2019re tasty and healthy and I enjoy eating them. I know that makes me a basic cliche millenial, but the heart wants what the heart wants! When I came across the Avocado Prices dataset posted by Justin Kiggins on Kaggle, I immediately wanted to have a look at it and play with it. This contains information about avocado sales in the United States between 2015 and 2018, compiled by the Hass Avocado Board.", "There\u2019s a lot of good information contained in this dataset, and I could have chosen a few different things to explore (and perhaps I still will later on). I\u2019d seen some cool choropleth maps on twitter and wanted to try my hand at that. I saw that each price observation was tied to a particular region, and I decided to see if I could get that information from text form into map form somehow.", "In this post I\u2019ll take you step by step through how I did it, and you can find my complete Jupyter Notebook containing the code here. This was my first attempt at making this kind of map using Python, so I welcome all feedback and ideas on how I could have made this process easier on myself!", "Let\u2019s get into it! The first thing I did was import my libraries and import the data itself. Using pd.read_csv() creates a pandas DataFrame directly from our CSV file.", "This gives us a nice DataFrame.", "But that\u2019s too much information for us just now. I want to make a map including price and region data (and perhaps later do something with volume and year), so let\u2019s drop a lot of these columns.", "Nice! That\u2019s more streamlined. Doing some Exploratory Data Analysis gave me an idea of the dataset I was looking at, the maximum price for an avocado in the dataset was $3.25(!) \u2014 the cheapest was $0.44 \u2014 more than 7 times cheaper. That\u2019s some variation! The median price for a single avocado in our dataset was $1.37, the mean $1.41 and the standard deviation was $0.40. This gives an idea of the distribution of prices in the data.", "It\u2019s always helpful to do some EDA visually. Here is a histogram of the AveragePrice column to give us a clearer sense of the overall distribution.", "To make the map that I want to make (a choropleth showing the price of an avocado in each region, to clearly show regional variations in price), I want to collapse the many different price measurements into one value for each region. It could be interesting to explore differences year-on-year, or by volume (who buys the most avocados?), but to answer the question I\u2019ve set myself, I want to squash this all down.", "There are a few options here, but I think the clearest and most honest way to do this is to take a simple mean of all AveragePrice data, grouped by region. How do we do that?", "First, we need to identify all the regions.", "This give us a list of all the regions contained in the dataset:", "Now we want to use this list to group our DataFrame and get down to one AveragePrice value per region-", "Now we have one price value per region, but each region is stored as text, e.g. \u2018Albany\u2019, \u2018SanDiego\u2019, \u2018Roanoke\u2019 etc. Matplotlib is smart, but not yet smart enough to plot those on a map just based on the text. We need to find a way to get geographical data (specifically, co-ordinates) from those region names.", "Well, we are not the first people to want to do this! We can use the geocode feature of GeoPy to do exactly that. After playing with this for a while I went with Bing Maps (it was free to get an API Key, and I could get it to work!), but there are other geocoding services available, so feel free to try it with those.", "I found using the RateLimiter useful to not overload the API with too many requests, but it significantly increases the time for the request to run and might not be necessary for you, so bear that in mind.", "This returns a dictionary full of information, from which we just want the co-ordinates. We can convert this to a DataFrame ready to join to our existing DataFrame using the following steps:", "Here is the head of the DataFrame which results.", "Now we have the co-ordinates for each region in our dataset, we want to join this to our existing DataFrame so we have one DataFrame which contains the average price and the co-ordinates for each region. Happily, pandas makes this extremely easy using its merge function. Thanks, pandas!", "Our next step is to bring this all together and create a GeoPandas GeoDataFrame which contains our average price for each region, plus the geographic information we need to plot each are on our map. To do that we first need to create a column for latitude and one for longitude (GeoPandas, very reasonably, wants to have that information to create its \u2018geometry\u2019 column, which is its way of storing the geodata).", "Great! Now we\u2019ve got a GeoDataFrame with all our data. Let\u2019s take a quick look to see how it looks!", "OK \u2014 I\u2019ll admit this doesn\u2019t look too inspiring yet, but I promise you, we\u2019re getting there! If you squint you can see that the majority of the data does kind of look like it could be in the United States. We have one outlier way down in the bottom right, which will be explained and dealt with shortly.", "As we saw above, just getting our GeoDataFrame did not lead to the immediate production of the beautiful choropleth of our dreams. We need to give Python (and Matplotlib) instructions on how we want to present that information. After all, we\u2019re the Data Analysts, we\u2019re making the decisions on how to present our data and there\u2019s a huge range of ways we might choose to do so. This flexibility means we still have some work to do!", "So, we want to superimpose our GeoDataFrame of avocado prices onto a map of the continental United States. How can we do that? There is a very useful Python library called shapely that can help us here. mattymecks has a super helpful post about all of this stuff here \u2014 I strongly recommend giving the whole post a read if you\u2019re trying to get your head around this.", "A Shape file stores a shape as a polygon, which is simply a series of co-ordinates, each connected to the next. So a triangle would be saved as 3 points identified by their co-ordinates, a square by 4, and more complex shapes by thousands or more points.", "Anyway, for our purposes you just need to know that Shape files exist and can provide us the map that we are seeking. But where to find the best ones? Of course the best way is with some Furious Googling\u2122, but I can perhaps save you some pain and point you to the TIGER/Line Shapefiles offered by the US Census Bureau. If those guys don\u2019t know what the shapes of the US States, Territories and Dominions look like, then I don\u2019t know who would!", "Download those files, unzip them and keep all of them in your active folder. Then import Point and Polygon from Shapely and you\u2019re ready to rock!", "OK, let\u2019s take a look at that bad boy.", "We can see here the foundations of what we need. Now why does this map have so much white space? I thought the USA was just in the Western Hemisphere? Well, without getting into too much geopolitical detail here, let\u2019s just say there is some territory which belongs to the United States of America that is in other geographical locations than would first come to mind.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at our Shape data here.", "We already confirmed that our avocado price data is confined to the continental United States (except for that one weird outlier, which I promise we\u2019re getting to), so we can get rid of some of these other entries.", "Now we have the Shape files for the US ready to form the basis of our map, and we have our price data geographically located and ready to go. But, there were a few weird things going on, specifically with that outlier on our map a few steps back. Now it\u2019s time to investigate that and do some sanity checks on our data.", "If we display our whole DataFrame (it\u2019s too big to do here, but if you\u2019re following along at home, I\u2019d encourage you to do it), we can see that some of our co-ordinates are NaNs (e.g. entry 25 \u2014 Midsouth), some are suspiciously round (e.g. entry 29 \u2014 Northeast), and some are way off (e.g. entry 52 \u2014 West \u2014 this was our outlier on the map!). What\u2019s happening here is that our original CSV file from the Hass Avocado Board (by way of Justin Kiggens) contains some meta-region summary data for some over-arching regions (such as Midsouth, Northeast and West).", "When we used our geolocator (in our case Bing Maps, but this problem would have happened whichever service we used), the service tried its best to provide an accurate location. In some cases (like Midsouth) it wasn\u2019t able to, so we ended up with NaN. In others (like Northeast) it found something very general and went with that. In yet others (such as West) it was able to locate somewhere with that name, but not the place we were looking for (in this case it returned the co-ordinates for Western, Zambia). This is why it\u2019s important to check your data where possible by plotting it in different ways and investigating things that look suspicious.", "For our purposes, we don\u2019t need this meta-region data, so we can just get rid of it en masse.", "Now that we\u2019ve improved df, our DataFrame, and we have our shapefile saved as usa, let\u2019s put these together using the same CRS \u2014 Co-ordinate Reference System. This will ensure that our GeoDataFrames use the same reference system, so as long as the co-ordinates for each of our regions are accurate, they will be accurately represented on the US map. Here I used epsg:4326, as that\u2019s what the Shapefile was already using.", "This is it! We\u2019re ready to go!", "With the help of a few nice features from Matplotlib we can make this very beautiful indeed.", "Now we have made real the beautiful choropleth that until now existed only in our dreams! Congratulations to us! It looks like we want to avoid the built-up Northeastern USA and San Francisco, and instead head down to Ohio or Texas to live that cheap avocado dream.", "I hope this helped you to see how we can use some powerful tools in GeoPandas, GeoPy and Matplotlib to take data in text and number form, use an API to find the co-ordinates, and then create an appealing and clear visualisation to show people at a glance the information we want to highlight.", "Thanks very much for taking the time to come with me on this journey. I always welcome your feedback \u2014 please get in touch with me on Twitter at @craigdoesdata and let me know how I could have done this more effectively! I am very much still learning and I want to learn your secrets too, so please share them with me.", "Again, the whole Jupyter Notebook and associated files are available on my Github page, and I encourage you to play around with them.", "Your home for data science.
