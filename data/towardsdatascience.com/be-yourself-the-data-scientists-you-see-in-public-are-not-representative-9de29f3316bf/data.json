Are they the founder of one or multiple startups and foundations? Do they have fancy titles and degrees like Senior Staff Chief Something, PhD at FAANG? Do they have a gajillion twitter followers and have the best shitposts? Do they blog/newsletter/write books faster than you can read? Is their Github chart greener than the plastic plants on your desk? Do they have more Kaggle prize money than your annual salary?", "Do you look at yourself and are just speechless at the gap between where you sit and them \u201cover there\u201d? I\u2019ve got something important to say to you.", "You don\u2019t have to be ANYTHING like those people. At all. They\u2019re not normal. It doesn\u2019t take nearly that much to work within the data sciences.", "While these people are definitely awesome and can sometimes be an inspiration, they\u2019re also standing atop unknowable intersections of luck, opportunity, and survivorship bias. Fame is rare by definition. If a bunch of data scientists resembled them, even just a little bit, they wouldn\u2019t stand out any more. We\u2019d have different heroes.", "As data scientists, we\u2019re supposed to be experts at understanding things like sampling, and hidden bias lurking in our data sets. Cutting through that chaff to get to the delicious grains of knowledge within is what we\u2019re about. But thanks to human nature, it can be surprisingly difficult to turn that thinking inward.", "The vast majority of people who work in data don\u2019t live and breathe the stuff constantly. They have families to take care of, non-data hobbies to enjoy, and friends to play with. They don\u2019t enjoy programming so much that they do it for fun at home. They don\u2019t compulsively stalk arXiv to read the latest Machine Learning papers. They don\u2019t go on speaking tours or constantly attend/run Meetups.", "But despite not doing ANY of these things, these people will provide useful insights to their organizations, engineer robust systems, run experiments, and do important work. Only just quietly, unseen by the world at large. Even the unicorns don\u2019t do all those activities simultaneously!", "In my own case, Iwrite semi-regularly because it\u2019s cathartic to get stuff written down. But I spend the majority of my non-work time cooking a tasty dinner, fixing things I break at home, and taking care of the baby. Work stays at the office, and none of my side projects has anything to do with data.", "While we often hear about imposter syndrome, how the very people we admire feel skeptical that they\u2019re worthy of the admiration they get, we hear less about just where the bar is before it\u2019s acceptable to consider yourself part of this great community.", "I\u2019m here to say that the bar is, and should be, low. If you work with data, you\u2019re doing stuff that is within the scope of the data sciences. The job title of \u201cData Scientist\u201d is merely given to people who meet an arbitrary set of skills and experience as dictated by some hiring manager. It varies too much to be very sensible. It\u2019s just noise.", "Don\u2019t get intimidated by all the people you admire. They\u2019re high above folk like you and me exactly because they\u2019re awe-inspiring unicorns.", "Also, gate-keeping jerks can sod off.", "Have a good holiday season, everyone.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "I stress about data quality a lot. Data nerd/scientist, camera junkie. Quant UXR @Google Cloud. Formerly @bitly, @Meetup, @primarydotcom.
