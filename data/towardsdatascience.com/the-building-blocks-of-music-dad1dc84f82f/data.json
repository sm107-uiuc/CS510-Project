But, fun as these particular pitches are, and it is possible to create some interesting melodies from them, they do not sound good together. What does sound good, however, is the overtone series. The overtone series is what you get when you start with one pitch and add multiples of that pitch to the set. For example {100Hz, 200Hz, 300Hz, 400Hz }. This series mimics how many of our pitched instruments work.", "For example, consider a guitar string (red in the image), with tension T:", "Where \u03c6 is the string displacement in y direction and \u00b5 is the string density.", "By taking the limit and doing some algebraic juggling we end up with the wave equation:", "Where c is the propagation velocity, which is \u221aT/\u00b5.", "The wave equation can be solved by assuming", "Putting this into the equation yields", "Since the L.H.S is a function of only x and the R.H.S is a function of only t they must both be constant.

That is: The overtone series.", "This is also what we see in a spectrogram of a guitar string.", "The relative amplitudes of the overtones are determined by the initial conditions (i.e. in what place the string was struck) and the resonance frequencies of the instrument body.", "It is this distribution of different frequencies that gives an instrument its distinct timbre.", "There are other instruments who\u2019s overtone series are not so simple though, for example a drum, where we have to solve the 2-dimensional wave equation, resulting in a sum of Bessel functions which is more complex than the trigonometric functions of the string. This is generally true for the unpitched instruments.", "Let\u2019s mark the overtones of the string on a sheet:", "The first overtone is the octave, the second the perfect fifth, octave again, major third, flat seventh and so on.", "According to the legend, Pythagoras discovered the foundations of musical tuning in the overtone series by listening to blacksmiths hammers, and how good they sounded together depended on the ratio between their sizes.", "This is immortalized in the famous Theorica musicae (1492) by Gaffurius, as seen below. This image is interesting not only because Gaffurius apparently cannot decide how to spell Pythagoras, but also because the lower left part is wrong. c=\u221a(T/\u00b5) remember, so the weights would have to be the square of what they are in the picture.", "The overtone series is a great scale to use, but it has its limitations. Say we have created our scale using {1, 5/4, 3/2}. This would correspond to the tonic, major third and perfect fifth, and they sound nice together. If the tonic is C, we have a C-major chord. But now we would like to create major chords for the other two tones in our scale, E-major and G-major. For the E we need {25/16, 15/8} and for the G we need {15/8, 9/8}. But now we have new notes that need even more notes to pair up with, does it ever end?", "The answer is no, but almost. To see this, we will follow an idea by Pythagoras and extend our scale by perfect fifths, we get 1, 3/2, 9/8, 27/32\u2026. Is there a point when we get back to the octave at 2? No, that would be impossible since 3 and 2 are both prime so that 3^x/2^y can never be 2 for any x,y. But, let\u2019s see how close we can get.", "Apparently scales of 53 gets us very close, but 41 and 12 is also pretty good. In this way, perfect fifth chords will always sound good, and for 12 we also, it turns out, get a good approximation of the overtone series. The 17 tone scale is used in Arabic and Persian music.", "Interestingly, for 53 and 12, our tones get spaced pretty uniformly, as can be seen by plotting the normalized standard deviation of the distance between the tones.", "There is a local minima at 12 and 53 tones.", "Btw, people have made use of the 53-tone scale: Taking Flight [53edo Microtonal Orchestral Music]", "31-tones is also fairly popular: QUANTUM 7 (Transcendent Tonality) 31 tone guitar. It\u2019s a good scale for thirds (the major third has 5 as nominator):", "But even though the Pythagorean system yields approximately an octave, it is not an actual octave, and it is possible to hear that. One way to deal with it is to build half the scale by going upwards and the other half by going downwards. Then the mismatch will occur at the opposite end of the tonic, in C this would be the tone F#. This is called the wolf tone and sound very out of key. The problem with the wolf tone lead to the development of a great many tuning systems, Well tempered, Just Intonation, Quarter Comma Mean Tone, until western music, in the 20th century, converged on Equal Temperament, where the distance between all notes are the same. In this way, the dissonances are distributed in small portions all over the scale. This is what is heard in almost all western music today.", "I find it interesting that the building blocks of music that we take so much for granted today, was constructed as a \u201cgood enough\u201d solution to many different and conflicting specs, instead of discovered as laws of nature. It makes music seems more like an engineering problem than a scientific one.", "The equal temperament scale has it\u2019s own problems of course. Most notably, the third is quite some distance from its overtone counterpart and sounds a bit off. This was taken into consideration in the song Scar Tissue by Red Hot Chili Peppers, where the B string is tuned to the overtone scale, making the intro better than it would have been with normal tuning.", "Musician Jacob Collier also uses this to be able to go from 432Hz to 440Hz in a song without us noticing it. Here explained by David Bruce.", "So now that we have the 12-tone equal temperament, we might ask ourselves what we can do with it.", "How many 12-tone scales are there? We can represent a scale as a binary string of 12 characters where the 1s are notes used, and 0s are notes not used.", "The Major scale thus becomes: 101010110101. We make no distinction between scales in different keys, hence C-major and G-major counts as the same scale.", "This is how music theorist Ian Ring numbers the scales. It is easy to see that there are 2\u00b9\u00b9=2048 scales.", "The good news is that, even among the most progressive metal bands or avantgarde jazz-cats, most of these scales are not used. A Google search on terms such as \u201cmusical scales list\u201d, \u201cscales and modes\u201d, \u201cjazz scales\u201d, \u201cexotic scales\u201d, \u201cscales for guitar\u201d etc yields about ~45 scales that seems to be in common usage.", "If you are interested in all the 2048 scales, check out Ian Rings site, where he lists them all.", "To be able to make some sense out of these scales we will need a way to classify them. Once such way might be to use the intervals. So, for example the Major scale is characterized by --.---. where \u201c.\u201d is a half-step and \u201c-\u201d is a whole-step. One thing that gives this scale its unique sound is the two half-tone steps at position 3 and 7. This makes it the configuration of 5 whole-tones and 2 half-tones with the half-tones furthest away from each other, 2 whole-tones (since the scale is cyclic a distance of 3 is not possible). But there are a few other scales like this, 7 to be exact. We can generate them by starting with a major scale and move the starting point. A more visual way of doing this would be to continuously move to the right on the piano, starting first with C, then D etc, and only use the white keys.", "These are called the modes of the scale. Modes are a great way to infuse your music with some variety since they sound familiar (the intervals are what you are used to) but at the same time different. So, by starting at position 2 we instead get the Dorian scale, and at position 3 we get the Phrygian scale, continuing the sequence with Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian (natural minor) and Locrian (all named after different regions in ancient Greece).", "But, this ordering is not very indicative of how the scales actually sounds. I find that ordering the modes according to brightness to be more helpful in this regard.", "Brightness is connected to the notion that large distances between notes feel more \u201copen\u201d or \u201cbright\u201d and short distances more \u201cdark\u201d. Hence, major is brighter than minor since we have a larger distance to the third tone in a major scale. There is no formal definition of brightness, although an agreed upon ordering of the modes of the major scale exists, so I\u2019m going to use the sum of the intervals with a parameter that is decreasing with distance from the root note. In this way scales with many large intervals in the beginning gets a higher bright score.", "Sorting our previous mentioned modes thus yield: Lydian, Ionian (Major), Mixolydian, Dorian, Aeolian (Natural Minor), Phrygian, Locrian.", "This is the same order as the circle of fifths, but the relationship is largely incidental, though, and does not generalize to other scales. It is an effect of having a scale that alternates between distance 2 and 3 between the half-tones depending on where one starts.", "Btw, the reason that the fifths (placement 7) and forths (placement 5) can act as generators for the 12-tone scale is that 7 and 12 are coprime, and so is 5 and 12. Also, 11 would work, but none of the others.", "Having sorted the modes of the major scale we might ask ourselves if there are any more scales with 5 whole-steps and 2 half-steps, and indeed there are.", "We can make use of the formula of cyclic permutations:", "\u03c6 in this case is Euler\u2019s totient function .Setting j1=5 and j2=2 we see that there exists exactly 3 heptatonic (7-tone) scales with two half-tones and five whole-tones.", "This can readily be seen by representing the scale as a necklace.", "The other scales are the ones where the distance between the half-tones are 1 and 0, respectively. They are called Heptationia II (contains melodic minor) and Heptationia III (sounds mostly like the whole-tone scale with one added tone).", "Apart from the above there are a few more common heptatonic scales, one is the harmonic minor (-.--.3.) and its modes.", "This set of intervals (3 half, 3 whole, one 3-halves) has 20 different configurations according to the circle permutation formula, but only 5 seems to be in common use, and few of their modes are used.", "The last collection of intervals for 7 tone scales we will look at is the double harmonic scale. This one has 3 half, one whole and two 3-halves. There are 15 different ways of organizing this configuration.", "All in all the cyclic permutations formula yields 66 different 7 tone configurations.", "Below are all the common 7 tone scales, grouped by interval and sorted by brightness. The ones written in bold font have a popular music example further down.", "As stated before, there are many more 7-tone scales, but one seldom hear of them.", "Apart from brightness, it might be interesting to sort the scales by dissonance. As usual, Euler has already been here. He devised a formula, called Euler\u2019s Gradus Function, for measuring the dissonance of an interval.", "To get the dissonance of the whole scale, I have summed the dissonance of all tones in the scale relative to the root note.", "It might be interesting to classify scales as either Major or Minor, and to my subjective ears, this has a lot to do with if the third is natural or flat. I also found that a flat second makes a unique sound distinct from either major or minor so I added the class of Phrygian to the mix.", "Plotting the consonance (opposite of dissonance) and brightness with the major/minor grouping yields the following:", "Clustering our plot, using k-means, into 4 clusters we get.", "Blue: Home, Normal and consonant Purple: Space, Bright and somewhat dissonantBrown: Night, Dark and somewhat dissonantPink: Mordor, Very dark and very dissonant.", "Pick from these groups if you are after a specific sound.", "But what do these scales actually sound like? I have recorded the excellent tune \u201cAh! vous dirai-je, maman\u201d, also known as \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\u201d using the different scales mentioned above. But, since our ears are so accustomed to hear it in the Major scale there is a tendency for us to feel the other version sound \u201cwrong\u201d, so I have also included examples that originally are in the scale they are presented in where I could find it.", "For lydian I choose a film score, which I think is rather representative of the mode. Many film score uses lydian.", "Many popular songs today are in minor, but to really capture the full Aeolian mode I choose a song with both a iii-minor and a IV-major chord. Plus, the time signature is pretty interesting.", "For the phrygian, I thought that Metallica was appropriate. They often use the phrygian mode in parts of their songs, for example \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d and \u201cThe Memory Remains\u201d.", "Lydian #5 \u2014 Lydian Dominant--Mixolydian b6--Melodic Minor--Half diminished--Phrygian #6--Super Locrian", "I had a hard time finding popular examples of the modes of the double harmonic scale, but that does not mean that they are useless.

This can be useful if one for example would like to use an unusual scale that is similar (in terms of brightness and consonance) to, for example, the Lydian scale. In that case one simply picks a scale in the vicinity of (90,10) where the Lydian scale resides. I will not label the names since most are not well known, but instead write out the notes used. Major, Phrygian and Locrian are provided as reference. Below are 20 randomly selected permutations of the -.- -.3. configuration (with the common scales removed except for Major, Phrygian, Locrian).
