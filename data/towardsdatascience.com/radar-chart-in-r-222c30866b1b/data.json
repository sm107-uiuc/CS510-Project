There are many charts that we can use, such as the bar chart, histogram, line chart, radar chart, and many more. The usage of it depends on the purpose that we want to achieve.", "Radar Chart, or Spider Chart, is a type of chart that displays multivariate data in a 2-dimensional chart where each variable starts at the same point.", "In this article, I want to show you how to build the radar chart starting from preparing the data until the visualization of it. For the dataset, we will use the dataset that is being used on #TidyTuesday from R4DS learning community. And for the library, we will use the fmsb and tidyverse library. The final graph will look like this,", "Let me explain the data first. The data is from the #TidyTuesday event which is an event for those who want to increase their skill using R, especially on Data Visualization and also Data Wrangling. It is based on the complaints to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), and also the outcome the RSPCA has made since 1999. It consists of 3 datasets, such as they are animal_outcomes.csv, animal_complaints.csv, and brisbane_complaints.csv. Now, we just use the animal_outcomes.csv to create the radar chart.", "To create the bar chart, we have to prepare the dataset first. At first, the dataset looks like this,", "The dataset consists of 664 rows and 12 columns where each row consists of the year, the animal type, the state, and what is the outcome after the RSPCA takes care of them whether it\u2019s reclaimed or currently in care.", "We want to have the dataset that looks like this,", "To make the dataset looks like that, we have to preprocess the data using the code like this,", "Here is the explanation. First, we have to remove the total column that describes the sum of each condition for an animal at each state. Then, we have to filter only to use Cats as our animal type. Then, we have to pivot the 4th until the 11th column. Then, we have to summarize the numbers on each state, outcome, and animal_type by sum the number throughout the year. Then, we spread the column to make the dataset longer. And finally, we rake out the first and second column and set the states name to become the name of the row.", "To be honest, we can use the data as the input for the radar chart, but the result is not that good. It looks like this,", "That\u2019s not the graph that we want. To fix that, we can normalize each column, so it has the 0\u20131 range to it. We can use the min-max scaling for it, and the code looks like this,", "After we scale each column, we have to do one more task before we can use the graph function. We have to add each column the minimum and the maximum value for our graph. We can set the minimum value to 0, and the maximum value with the maximum value that exists on our data which is 1. The code looks like this,", "After we do that, we can use the data to create our graph. To build it, We can use the radarchart function from fmsb library. The parameters that the function needs is the data, how many axis segments which is based on our column, the color, and how much the width for the line. The code looks like this,", "The result will look like this,", "Finally, we\u2019ve finished building our radar chart. I hope that useful to you.
