And this is fine. No dataset is perfect! Not even the Titanic or wine quality data sets that are very popular for classification problem tutorials.", "Some data sets will have a split of the classes that is 90/10 (i.e. 90% active customers, 10% churned customers), some will have a 95/5, or even 99/1 type of split. This would be very imbalanced.", "Since imbalanced data can have different ratios, we begin to wonder what ratio is an actual problem that we would have to assess. Is having 10% cases of your minority class a problem? 5%? Less than 1%?", "The answer is the same answer that I get whenever I ask someone knowledgeable an interesting question: it depends!", "There is no standard threshold for how your classes should be split. Depending on the type of business problem you are solving and the type of industry, the split might become more meaningful. For example, an 80/20 split for a customer retention problem might be acceptable, but not so much for a healthcare problem. Fraud detection, surviving the Titanic shipwreck, churn analysis, or COVID spread might all use a different split in the classes used for their respective classification problems.", "In our practicum project, the imbalance was not as drastic as having a 1% of the minority class (churned customers), but it was still something that we decided to address.", "There are many ways to handle imbalanced data. Jason Brownlee, who has a Masters and PhD in Artificial Intelligence, covers this topic in more detail as well as many other fun Machine Learning tutorials on Machine Learning Mastery. He also recommends this book to \u201cdive deeper into some of the academic literature on dealing with class imbalance\u201d.", "Today, we\u2019ll go over 3 methods:", "The very first thing we typically look at when we obtain the results of a classification model is the number of correct predictions from all the predictions we made. This seems intuitive since we want to see how well our model performed. This is the accuracy of the model: total correct predictions over the total number of predictions. However, we need to keep in mind that looking only at the accuracy is not enough!", "\u201cAccuracy is not the metric to use when working with an imbalanced dataset. We have seen that it is misleading.\u201d \u2014 Jason Brownlee", "Brownlee explains the details of why the accuracy alone cannot give you enough information to make a decision in this post. In our case when doing churn analysis and predicting customers who would churn, the accuracy meant how many customers did we correctly label as \u201cchurn\u201d who actually churned (true positives) and how many customers did we label as \u201cnot churn\u201d who did not churn (true negatives) over all customers:", "Because there were so many customers who did not churn, the high number of true negatives made the accuracy be very high, which would be misleading since we wanted to focus on those customers that did leave, and try to discover what we could do to prevent that from happening with other customers.", "Precision came in handy here. Precision is: out of all customers who were labeled as\u201dchurn\u201d, how many did we correctly label as such? This is the ratio of customers who were correctly labeled (true positives) to all customers who were labeled as \u201cchurn\u201d (true positives and false positives).", "This metric made more sense for us to review both before as well as after handling the imbalanced in the data. If you want to read more about performance metrics, Salma Ghoneim, a Computer Engineering student does an excellent job explaining accuracy, recall, precision, F-score and specificity in this post.", "Additionally, you may want to check the Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operator Characteristic (AUC ROC or AUROC) to determine the relationship of your true positives and false positives. This other post explains this important concept very well and this clear explanation by StatQuest\u2019s founder Josh Starmer walks you through the details step-by-step (double BAM!)", "Doing nothing here does not mean we\u2019re done with the problem! It means that rather than addressing the imbalance in your data, you can consider other approaches, such as collecting more data (if possible) or using a different machine learning model. Decision trees and random forests are good alternatives. You can also try C4.5, C5.0 or CART, as suggested on this post.", "The beauty (and challenge!) of data science problems is deciding which method to go with that can both maximize model performance and uncover the insights in the data.", "We saw much better results in terms of model performance once we balanced the data set using ADASYN. This allowed us to continue our analysis and evaluate how different models answered our question: what key features are mostly related to customers leaving/staying with this SaaS company? We were able to find those golden nuggets hidden in the data that answered this question, and helped us give actionable recommendations to the stakeholders at this SaaS company.", "Did we continue our practicum happily ever after? Nope. We had many more challenges in this project that made it even more interesting. Spoiler alert: we did deliver strong results, our stakeholders are very happy and we\u2019re currently wrapping up the project and our MSBA program strongly.", "Your home for data science.
