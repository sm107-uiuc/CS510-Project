One of the main reasons behind its rise is the built-in support of GPU to developers.", "The torch.device enables you to specify the device type responsible to load a tensor into memory. The function expects a string argument specifying the device type.", "You can even pass an ordinal like the device index. or leave it unspecified for PyTorch to use the currently available device.", "For example 1.1, we select the device type that we want to store our tensor on during runtime. Note, we have specified our device type as cuda and also attached the ordinal in the same string separated by a \u2018:\u2019.", "Example 1.2 achieves the same result by passing in separate arguments for device type and index.", "The expected device types in torch.device() are cpu, cuda, mkldnn, opengl, opencl, ideep, hip, msnpu. The device type should exist in the list of expected devices for correct usage of this method.", "Let\u2019s take a look at what happens when we tried specifying GPU as the device type.", "The specified device type should be available on the machine running your notebook. Failure to do so will result in an error as explained in example 1.3 (b).", "In 1.3 (b), we defined a tensor using a cuda device type which required an NVIDIA GPU. Since our machine does not have any GPU available, the kernel threw a runtime error.", "The torch.view() method changes the view of the tensor (be it a vector, matrix, or a scalar) to the required shape. The transformed tensor has modified representational dimensions but retains the same data type.", "Let\u2019s jump into an example \u2014 Define a sample tensor x and transform its dimensions to store in another tensor z.", "In example 2.1, we transformed the dimension of a 4 x 5 matrix represented as a single row vector. The row-major order by default prints the elements of the rows contiguously. Every row-element in the transformed view appears in the same order as it does in the original tensor.", "Besides, the new tensor must be of a shape that supports the same number of elements in the original tensor. You cannot store a 4 x 5 shaped tensor in a 5 x 3 view.", "For example 2.2, we will use -1 to denote a dimension. PyTorch automatically interprets the unknown dimension from the other dimensions. The transforming tensor is compatible in size and stride with the original tensor.", "Note that only one dimension is inferrable at a time. Using -1 for more than one dimension will only introduce ambiguity and a runtime error!", "PyTorch only allows -1 as an acceptable value for at the most 1 dimension. If more than one dimension is passed as -1, it will throw a runtime error.", "Many times, you would like to print the contents of a tensor before performing certain tasks. For this purpose, you may need to change the display representation when you print a tensor in your notebook.", "Using the set_printoptions, you can adjust properties like precision level, line width, result threshold, etc.", "For our example, we will take a tensor representing a 20 x 30 matrix. Representing such a huge matrix in the notebook is not often required. A general use case behind printing a tensor variable is to peek the first few and last rows.", "We will make use of the threshold, edgeitems and linewidth properties to change the visual representation of the tensor according to our liking. We can also alter the number of digits to display after the decimal point using the precision property.", "There are 3 profiles available to us in the method: default, tiny and full. Passing the profile name along with other properties is an incorrect usage. The function ignores the profile attribute in that case.", "Tensors are used to simplify the common tasks required in a Machine Learning pipeline. To perform gradient descent, a popular loss minimization technique, we need to compute the gradients (recall - derivates) w.r.t the loss function.", "PyTorch simplifies this with the backward() method by storing gradients with each method call. Note: PyTorch computes the gradients for a tensor only if its require_grad property is set to True.", "We will use the linear equation y = mx + c to find the partial derivates of y w.r.t each variable in the equation.", "After calling the y.backward() method and printing the computes gradients, we can access the .grad property of the tensor x.", "As we did not set the require_grad option to True, we will not get a result on calling .grad property for m.", "Calling the y.backward() again will result in second-order differentiation of y w.r.t the tensors. Note that PyTorch stores the gradients cumulatively.", "The linspace() method returns a 1-dimensional tensor containing a range of numbers. In contrast to the rand() function where the numbers are generated randomly, the returned numbers are members of a series in arithmetic progression in linspace().", "The difference in each member is specified by the steps property and the range (end \u2014 start).", "The output tensor contains 50 equally-spaced numbers in the range 1\u201310. The dtype property is int so decimal places are not stored.", "Note that while creating a tensor using the linspace() method, the dtype value must confer with the output tensor\u2019s defined dtype.", "This article covered some of the basic methods available in the PyTorch API to get you started with it. As much of the implementation is borrowed from the NumPy library to build on the existing understanding and experience of Python developers, the API is easy to get started with.", "The next step after reading through these functions is to browse through the official documentation. As PyTorch is a deep-learning library, it is highly encouraged to learn ML fundamentals before you start using these functions.", "That\u2019s it, you made it till the end of my very first blog in the PyTorch series!", "If you liked this article and would like to read more from me in the future, you can follow me here and on LinkedIn and Twitter.
