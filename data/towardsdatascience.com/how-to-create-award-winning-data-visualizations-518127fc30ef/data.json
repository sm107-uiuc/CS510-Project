Kaggle vs Glassdoor.", "While the competition evaluated several aspects of my submission, I think that the way I displayed information was a central piece in getting awarded. Here I want to share a little bit of the thought process behind building the data visualizations, with step by step instructions.", "My idea was to measure how many people are working in different positions (job titles) comparing different countries.", "I choose to use Plotly mainly because I\u2019m already used to it, and because I enjoy the interactivity it provides out of the box. However, the concepts that I applied, and that I\u2019m going to demonstrate can be used with any other graphing library or software, language agnostic.", "I was not satisfied with a bar plot for this visualization. I wanted to display the same information but allow comparing different countries. Adding multiple bar charts for various countries did not look good at all. Then I tried a line chart, since adding multiple lines works better than various columns.", "Much better\u2026 now let\u2019s try to add countries, instead of the aggregated of all of them.", "It\u2019s Looking better than the bars. But still not right. My next idea was to transform the x-axis into a radial.", "This looks interesting! I think I can go forward with this chart type.", "Some countries have much more absolute rows than others. This creates a distortion in the chart, so I will change the metric and plot the relative percentage for each job title in each country instead. It should allow us to compare them!", "Indeed! Now all countries are on the same scale. Comparing them proportionally is much better than comparing absolute values.", "This is a little bit trickier. To \u201cclose\u201d the radar chart on Plotly you need to add the first data point again to the end.", "If you look at the axis, they don\u2019t currently have a hierarchy or any specific order. I want to create one by keeping close together job titles that are similar, from the least technical to the most technical. For me it makes sense to organize it in the following order:", "Business Analyst < Data Analyst < Data Scientist < Data Engineer/DBA < Software Engineer < Statistician/Research Scientist", "This is the most important part of any good data visualization. Remove any noise that is not directly contributing to how people are reading and interpreting data.", "Now that the background is white, we also need to change some other elements, such as grids, ticks and lines. Here my choices were:", "It looks much better now, doesn\u2019t it?", "Now we will transform all lines to grey, reduce their width and also make them less sharp by applying some smoothing.", "This is SO MUCH BETTER! Because now we can actually \u201csee\u201d each line! But as they say, the devil is in the details. Let\u2019s keep improving it!", "When we hover the mouse over the data points we are seeing r and theta values. This is not informative for anyone that is viewing the chart. Let\u2019s adjust a few things there.", "Now we will highlight some specific countries that we want to tell a story about. For this chart, I\u2019m choosing the United States vs China. What we will do:", "Now we are telling some story with this data! We are able to see the differences between China and the United States! We can easily get some conclusions from this chart!", "Now we will add a meaningful title and the data source to the chart.", "Using the standard autosize of Plotly is all elements too much separated from each other, let\u2019s bring them closer by defining the height and width size of the chart.", "Also some minor adjustments to legend as well:", "This chart easily allows us to compare two different countries. It also gives more context to the story that is being told by keeping the data for all other countries that are not part of the story.", "The reader\u2019s attention is drawn to the data itself, and not to other chart elements. Story/comparison is highlighted and clear and the title is about the story. The chart tells just one story.", "Colours were wisely chosen and have a meaning as well (country flag colour). All other elements that are not part of the story were sent to the background in grey colour.", "The source is clearly cited and doesn\u2019t draw too much attention.", "When showing multiple charts, stick to a few different chart types. The purpose of this is to make your readers lives easier, as they will not need to learn how to read every new chart \u2014 after learning how to interpret one chart, reading all the other charts will be automatic.", "If your highlighted data colours don\u2019t hold any meaning (unlike this example, where they encode the colour of a country flag) then you shouldn\u2019t use a lot of different colours. Keep them to a minimum.", "It might be tempting to highlight multiple things in a single chart. Instead create various charts to highlight different things, one unique story per chart.", "See the notebook with all code and data that was used to create this step by step guide.", "Your home for data science.
