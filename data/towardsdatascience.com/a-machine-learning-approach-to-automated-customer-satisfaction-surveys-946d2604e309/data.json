For context, this paper was written for one of my classes where we had a project sponsored by a company. In my case, I worked with Matthew Bussing, Kai Nichols, and Sidney Johnson on a project sponsored by ProKarma to try to automate customer satisfaction surveys. This paper was originally published on our course website here. It has been adapted to fit this format and the original is embedded at the end of the article. Enjoy!", "Natural language processing (NLP) is a broad discipline concerning the problems of capturing, analyzing, and interpreting humanlanguage. In particular, NLP can be used to evaluate human speechin order to determine different qualities about its speaker, context,and sentiment. These evaluations can be used to inform human-computer interaction, accessibility, automation, and statistical analysis of natural language.", "This NLP project was proposed by the Edge Intelligence group atProKarma, an IT solutions company headquartered in Nebraska offering digital transformation and analytics consultancy. ProKarma\u2019sEdge Intelligence group is researching ways to improve customerservice by incorporating machine learning to augment customerservice calls in the telecommunications industry. One approach toimprove customer service satisfaction includes determining customer attitudes toward particular products and by performing sentiment and topic analysis on customer call data, effectively allowing for automated customer service surveys.", "Automating customer satisfaction data collection would provideactionable information about consumer attitudes toward productsand services at much higher response levels than simply relying onon customers staying on the line to finish a phone survey. This automated system could run parallel to the traditional phone surveyscurrently in place at many wireless carriers. Automated sentimentanalysis on products mentioned during the call could be validatedagainst instances where the customer finished the post-call phonesurvey.", "Because of the huge number of variables involved in natural language, traditional analytic methods would be prohibitively difficultto adapt to this purpose. Machine learning algorithms allow simple linear interpolation of audio data as well as powerful patternfinding tools. For this reason, neural networks were developed forboth topic and sentiment classification. These models find patternsbetween product types and consumer attitude which provides theinformation required to generate automated customer satisfactionsurveys from customer call audio.", "Three models were required to accomplish the ultimate goal of anautomated survey process: speech-to-text transcription, sentimentmodeling, and topic modeling.", "These models culminated in an engine for end-to-end audio analysis of customer call recordings. All project code was written usingPython 3.6, used Google\u2019s TensorFlow machine learning library viathe Keras interface, and used the Python/R Anaconda distribution.Version control was performed using git and GitHub was used forhosting all project repositories. The project was developed using anAgile workflow, and team collaboration and communication wasfacilitated using the software, Slack.", "The aim of this project was to prove it is possible to take a customerservice call as input and get data relevant for a customer satisfaction survey as output. The system constructed to accomplish this task, pictured in figure 1, consists of three main models: a speech-to-text model, a topic model, and a sentiment model. The speech-to-text model was trained on web-scraped customer service call audio files. The topic model was trained on a web-scrapped corpus of a wireless carrier\u2019s FAQs and forum posts. The sentiment model was trained on a combined dataset of annotated IEMOCAP transcripts and electronics reviews. The customer service call audio was then passed through the speech-to-text program to generate transcripts, which were then fed into the topic and sentiment models. These two latter models output predictions of overall topics and sentence-by-sentence sentiment tagging. These two outputs were then aggregated to produce visualizations of customer satisfaction indicators such as sentiment over time during the call and sentiment associated with specific topics.", "The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for natural languageprocessing is a fairly recent development. CNNs are mostwell known for their success in image classification from filters\u2019natural proficiency for identifying components of an image likelines and shapes. Whereas a CNN used on images can successfullyfind patterns in shapes, the filters of a CNN used on language isanalogously able to find patterns in n-grams.", "The network used for testing, pictured in figure 2 and elaboratedon in figure 3, has two convolutional layers. The first convolutionallayer has 64 filters with a filter size of 4, and the second has 32 filterswith a filter size of 6. These were starting points to test that themodel has functionality. These parameters could be further tunedto improve the accuracy of the model. A larger number of filtersand filter sizes in the range of 3\u20135 are recommended for sentimentanalysis using a CNN in order to capture a large amount of contextualinformation based on the relations between closely adjacentwords. The dropout layer in the diagram is intended to preventoverfitting.", "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic models are widely used foridentifying underlying topics in a set of documents. Given K topicsto find, an LDA model will sort words in a document into varioustopics based on the words they appear most frequently with andtheir respective topics. This works through a generative processwhere the LDA model assumes the following: a document is composedof an assortment of topics and each topic is composed ofan assortment of words. It then reverse engineers this process in orderto identify the topics in a corpus. Figure 4 is the graphical platenotation where:", "For the purposes of sorting customer service transcript data intotopics, an online technical support discussion board and FAQ sectionof a wireless carrier was used. By using this dataset, the topicscould be predetermined and the model could be tuned to identifyspecific topics. Figure 5 provides examples of topic informationwhich can then be used to identify topics. In order to do this, \u03b2 was defined in the following way:", "This enabled the model to bias toward finding specific topics in adocument rather than determining its own.", "Some tools were across all sections of the project. The general purposedata science tools used throughout the project include:", "As this was a far-reaching project with many moving parts, a varietyof technical tools were required to specifically accomplish thegoal of each major utility:", "DeepSpeech, the automated speech recognition (ASR) enginepreferred by our client, is an end-to-end trainable, character levelLSTM recurrent neural network. DeepSpeech has beenused to produce a very low word error rate (WER), particularlya 6% WER on LibriSpeech, an open-source 1000 hourdataset of natural speech. 6% is approximately the humanerror rate. Out of the box, DeepSpeech\u2019s generic models returneda 65.4% WER on our customer service call testingdata, more than 10x the WER of human processing.This WER was ultimately reduced to approximately 18.7%on the custom model generated using a very small corpusof training data.", "DeepSpeech functions best when translating sentence-length,<10 second audio clips. The processing time required by Deep-Speech to create a transcript per audio clip is between 4 and9 seconds, with a mean of 7.14 seconds. Therefore, 5 minutesof audio could take DeepSpeech almost 4 minutes ofprocessing time.", "Accuracy of various models were compared on 80/20 splittraining/testing data made up of the IEMOCAP dataset anda web-scraped dataset of electronic reviews with the sentimentclassification accuracies contained in figure 6. Thesewere 3-class classifiers where the sentiment classes werepositive, negative, and neutral. Accuracies of different feature implementations were then compared, with results containedin figure 7. Some feature implementations did not easilylend themselves to being run on different classificationmodels, so that data is absent.", "Among the different datasets and implementations the bestresults were on Neural Network Classifiers using the tf_hubword embedding module. Of the word embedding modules,the universal sentence encoder outperformed the other modules.A deeper neural network outperformed sklearn\u2019s DNNClassifierunder the same feature implementation, and was thehighest performer of all the implementations at about 10%higher test set accuracy than the second contender. The bestmodel iteration was an LSTM RNN that used tf_hub\u2019s universalsentence encoder as feature input. This model had atest set accuracy of 77.6% on a combined IEMOCAP andelectronic review dataset. Baseline accuracy for randomlychoosing a class for 3 classes is 33.3%.", "Using data scraped from a wireless carrier\u2019s online discussionforums and FAQ section, the training data was organizedinto 5 topics: accounts and services, android products,apple products, network and coverage, and other products.Each of these topics also included some keywords that wereseeded into the LDA model with bias (such as \u201ciphone\u201d forapple products, \u201cgalaxy\u201d for android products, etc). Usingthis training data to train the LDA model, it was able to successfullypredict the topics on the testing data 57.6% time. Baseline accuracy for randomly choosing a class for 5 classes is 20%. A visualization of this LDA can be found in figure 10.", "The part-of-speech subject identifier (PoSSI) model was trainedusing corpora included with the Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK) and then tested on the web-scraped wireless carrierdata described above. This model was able to producecoherent subject-verb-object (SVO) results, but because theweb-scraped dataset is unlabeled, there is not a quantitativeway of analyzing the accuracy unless all web-scraped datawas hand-labeled for part-of-speech. Hand labeling the entireweb-scraped dataset was not in the scope of this project.", "Visualizing sentiment over the course of a call showed trendswe might expect: a green, positive, first sentence introductionfollowed by a red, negative, introduction of the problem,and darker greens (i.e. more strongly positive sentiment) towardsthe end of the call.", "These are promising results that suggest sentiment analysiscould be applicable in the context of automating customersatisfaction surveys.", "DeepSpeech is highly trainable but, with 120 million parameters,requires massive training corpora, hundreds of hoursof training, and expensive equipment. Transfer learning wasperformed in the form of freezing all sublayers of the modeland retraining the final layer. Experimentation with alteringprevious layers was unable to create improvements. Transferlearning is a viable course of action to customize Deep-Speech for future transcription requirements but should betrained using a greater number of high-quality audio clips.DeepSpeech performed significantly better on our testingdata than alternative ASR engines such as Kaldi and CMUSphinxas well as traditional ASR approaches such as HiddenMarkov Models.", "Future workFurther improvements could likely be made in preparinglow-quality call data for transcription, as well as in post-processingthe transcriptions to produce more correct speech(as DeepSpeech is character-level, it sometimes producesnonsense). Retraining the weights of DeepSpeech on a large,industry-specific copora would also likely produce greateraccuracy, but would be significantly more expensive \u2014 bothin computation time and amount of data required.", "The two biggest impacts on the accuracyof the tested sentiment analysis models were data preparationand model selection. Data preparation and input formattinghave a larger impact on a smaller dataset. Model selectionhas a larger impact on a larger data set. Throughoutthe various model iterations we tried, three different typesof formatting for data input were used:", "Given the relatively small vocabulary size of our data set,using a Pre-trained word embedding module gave the bestresults, outweighing the effect of what model was used. Alternativemodels were also developed, such as:", "With a small-to-mid sized training dataset, there is a much higher risk of overfitting to your training set when using neural networks with thousands of parameters, such as RNN and CNN neural networks. This can be seen by large discrepancies between testing and training set accuracies in our performance results. The ideal point at which to stop training is right as the training and testing scores begin to diverge where the training score continues going up, but the testing score starts going down. In the context of training a model, this means it is important to save checkpoints as you train, so the model can be reverted to an older checkpoint which is not yet overfitting. See Appendix B for an example of training and testing scores over the epochs of training. Overfitting can also be reduced by adding a regularization parameter to the loss function or to introduce dropout layers. Adding dropout to layers has seen success in most types of neural networks. However, this method does not work well on RNNs with LSTM units, which is the type of model that showed the greatest performance in this project. To mitigate overfitting on our small training dataset we apply dropout only to a non-recurrent layer.", "The low accuracy result of the LDA model is expected asLDA models are not meant to be forced into predefined topicsand instead should be used for finding hidden topic informationin the corpus. SVO extraction using POS and NERtagging was able to produce coherent results, but these resultsare not consistent across topics which presents a challengewhen trying to sort documents by topics.", "A.
