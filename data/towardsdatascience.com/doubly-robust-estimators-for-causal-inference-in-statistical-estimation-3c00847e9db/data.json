Recovery of unbiased estimates of Causal Effects is at times a tough task, even in Randomized settings. This task can be particularly challenging in Non-Randomized settings, requiring an array of often empirically untestable assumptions to hold that have both mathematical and philosophical implications.", "In the interest of recovering an unbiased estimate of a Mean Causal Effect of an Intervention on an Outcome, there are several tools we can leverage. Under the assumption of the correct specification of a true Causal DAG, and in the case where the measured variables in the DAG are a sufficient set for conditional confounding adjustment of the Intervention-Outcome relationship (and hence provides conditional exchangeability within levels of the variables in the sufficient set), we can leverage the set of G-Methods to recover unbiased estimates of Causal Contrasts of interest. In particular, in the set of G-Methods we may be able to leverage:", "When used individually, Standardization requires correct specification of the Outcome Model, with Inverse Probability Weighting requiring correct specification of the Intervention Model.", "However, is there a way to combine these two approaches into a single estimation technique with more relaxed assumptions? A technique that only requires correct specification of the Outcome Model OR Intervention Model, but not both. And importantly, we need not know which model is correct, only that at least one of them is correct? This is exactly the spirit behind Doubly Robust Estimation.", "In this article, we will specify a toy-example, work through the theory and mathematics behind G-Methods, specify an example Doubly Robust Estimator, and conduct an in-depth computational simulation to investigate these methods.", "The formal contents of this piece are as follows:", "Let us postulate a simple toy example:", "We would like to recover an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of binary Intervention A on continuous Outcome Y in a non-randomized setting. Let us assume we are all-knowing and know exactly the \u201ctrue\u201d marginal Causal DAG as shown in Figure 1 (under the null hypothesis of no causal effect of A on Y).", "Figure 1 specifies two common causes of both A and Y, binary variables C1 and C2. In the marginal graph there are two backdoor associational paths from A to Y, i.e. A to C1 to Y and A to C2 to Y.", "A brief refresher on the connection between d-separation of a Causal DAG and independence in distribution of observed data:", "In Figure 1, A and Y are clearly not marginally d-separated due to the open backdoor paths from A to Y through C1 and C2.", "When exchangeability exists within levels of known and accurately measured variables in the Causal DAG, there are several approaches for \u201cmanipulating\u201d or \u201cadjusting\u201d the graph to achieve d-separation. These methods can be grouped into two broad categories:", "The methods of interest in this article, and those of which form the Doubly Robust Estimator discussed here, are G-Methods", "We will next discuss two such G-Methods: Standardization and Inverse Probability Weighting.", "Let us assume we were to leverage classical stratification-based techniques. Assume we were to condition on C1 and C2 as shown in Figure 2. In this conditional Causal DAG we have closed all backdoor paths from A and Y, leaving A and Y d-separated conditional on C1 and C2:", "Under the assumption of consistency and positivity, via the Causal Markov Assumption the d-separation of A and Y conditional on C1 and C2 directly implies independence in distribution of A and Y conditional on C1 and C2, of which our observed data is a function of.", "Mathematically we can express this by the following:", "Given the data is drawn from joint probability distribution P, we can specify the following sampling estimator:", "Notice although the mean estimates above are for counterfactual quantities, the causal contrast recovered is within levels of variables C1, C2. With the outcome model correctly specified, we could leverage the joint distribution of C1, C2 and the parametric g-formula to marginalize out C1, C2, recovering the marginal counterfactual estimates of the mean outcome under a=1 and a=0.", "The above equation we refer to as Standardization with the parametric g-formula.", "Note Figure 3a below, where we have specified the Causal SWIG (Single World Intervention Graph) of the Causal DAG in Figure 1. Note how we have decoupled the observed intervention A and counterfactual intervention a into separate nodes. A is the observed intervention present in the data, while a is where everyone in the population received intervention a. For further clarity, we can draw separate explicit SWIGs for our two interventions of interest, as shown in Figure 3b and Figure 3c.", "Returning to our marginal Causal DAG in Figure 1, we know that Intervention A and Outcome Y are not marginally d-separated. In the previous section, we specified the outcome model with the correct functional form, and then leveraged Standardization via the parametric g-formula to recover a pseudo-population representing the Causal SWIGs in Figures 3a-c to recover unbiased estimates of the mean counterfactual outcomes if everyone in the population received intervention a=1 and everyone in the population received intervention a=0.", "There is an alternative approach that also leads to a pseudo-population with the identical Causal SWIGs in Figures 3a-c as produced by Standardization. This approach involves correctly specifying the Intervention Model, and leveraging Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) with Marginal Structural Modeling (MSM).", "Bringing our attention back to Figure 2, we know that A and Y are d-separated conditional on C1 and C2, which directly implies independence in distribution of A and Y conditional on C1 and C2 by the Causal Markov Assumption:", "Therefore, let\u2019s attempt to specify the Intervention Model with these conditional variables C1 and C2:", "In the previous two sections, through leveraging G-methods we recovered unbiased estimates of the mean counterfactual outcome if the entire population had received intervention a=1, and the mean counterfactual outcome if the entire population had received intervention a=0:", "We recovered these mean counterfactual outcomes using two different approaches:", "Note importantly however, in order for either of these two approaches to recover unbiased estimates of the mean counterfactual quantities of interest, the model specification of the statistical models need be correct.", "With Standardization, we assume we correctly specify the true Outcome Model, and with Inverse Probability Weighting we assume we correctly specify the true Intervention Model:", "Correct specification not only in terms of the correct variables in the model to result in d-separation of an appropriate Causal DAG or SWIG, but also the correct functional form of said models and fulfillment of any parametric assumptions with respect to estimation of (at least) model location parameters. If the model specification is incorrect, these methods are not guaranteed (and likely will not) recover unbiased estimates of the mean causal effects of interest.", "Now, there are situations where due to the causal structure of the problem and available data, only Standardization or Inverse Probability Weighting are an option but not both (I will cover such an example in a future article). However, in examples like the one presented in Figure 1 where we could reasonably use either method, which should we choose? Standardization or IPW?", "One option, based on our domain expertise, is to choose the method we feel most confident about. From a subject matter perspective, do we have far more confidence in our ability to correctly specify the Outcome Model over the Intervention Model, or vice-versa? If we have far more confidence in our model specification abilities with one method over the other, it could be desirable to use that method.", "The above approach is reasonable; though there\u2019s something a bit deflating about it. Instead, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to use BOTH methods and somehow combine the results? And perhaps we can combine the methods in such a way that it works \u201cbetter\u201d than using either approach individually? This is exactly the spirit behind Doubly Robust Estimation.", "The general idea behind a Double Robust Estimator is to recover estimates of the mean counterfactual quantities of interest using both Standardization and Inverse Probability Weighting, and then combine the results of the two analyses together. Importantly though, we construct a combined sampling estimator such that as long as we have the model specification of just one model correct (the Outcome Model or Intervention Model), then our sampling estimator produces unbiased estimates of the mean counterfactual quantities of interest. This is the case even if our model specification is completely wrong for one of the two models. And importantly, we need not know which of the two models is correctly specified (Outcome or Intervention model); just that at least one of them is correctly specified. Hence the name \u201cDoubly Robust Estimator\u201d. Colloquially speaking, we don\u2019t put all of our eggs in one basket with one approach. Rather we \u201cspread around the risk\u201d and have two shots at getting the answer correct.", "There are many Doubly Robust Estimators (DRE)researchers and practitioners have developed. Below is a very popular DRE that coincides with our particular problem (binary Intervention with a Continuous outcome).", "Regarding the Doubly Robust Estimator, our claim is the following:", "Let\u2019s take steps to formally prove this claim.", "First let\u2019s investigate the case where the Outcome Model is correctly specified, but the Intervention Model is misspecified:", "As we can see above, our claim of unbiasedness holds.", "Let\u2019s now rearrange our DRE a bit:", "Let\u2019s now investigate the case where the Intervention Model is correctly specified, but the Outcome Model is misspecified:", "Again, we can see our claim of unbiasedness holds.", "With our mathematical analysis of the DRE sufficiently complete, let\u2019s next jump into the computational simulation.", "We\u2019re going to conduct a computational simulation in Python to investigate the methods described in this piece, in particular the Doubly Robust Estimator. We will:", "Specify a function to simulate a dataset as the per the Causal DAG specified in Figure 4 of size n=100,000:", "Note above that as per our simulated dataset, the true Mean Causal Effect Difference of A on Y is 1.23.

As already mentioned, the DRE described here is just one DRE. There are other DRE sampling estimators that have been developed for other use-case problems. I would encourage anyone who found the above material insightful to research other DREs, create there own simulation examples, leverage my code as a jump-off point, and experiment on your own!", "If you would like to learn more about methods and considerations for Causal Inference, I would suggest textbooks \u201cCausal Inference: What If\u201d by Miguel Hernan and Jamie Robins at Harvard (two of my former Professors), \u201cCausality\u201d by Judea Pearl at UCLA, and \u201cProbabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques\u201d by Daphne Killer at Stanford and Nir Friedman at Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
