Therefore, some readers could use this article as a window into what to expect from an MSc in Machine learning and Computer Vision.", "Along with information as to what I learnt during my studies, I\u2019ll also include information as to how relevant the gains academic knowledge is to my current job role as a Computer Vision Engineer.", "An advanced degree in machine learning has a few selected topics that reflect the direction of progression within the machine learning field.", "There is so much to be covered in any given course in machine learning. Therefore the MSc degree I undertook had ensured students had the following pre-requisites before acceptance to the course.", "Let me start with my strongest modules from the course.", "Computer Vision and Deep Learning studies is an area of machine learning that genuinely interests me. Perhaps I\u2019m drawn to the field as a result of the direct impact developed techniques can have.", "Media outlets have sung praises of how far computer vision technology has progressed over the decades. The rapid advent of facial recognition systems is unmissable. It\u2019s difficult to not find a facial recognition system at major international airports, banks and government organizations.", "Studies in computer vision within my masters were very structured. You are not expected to jump straight into implementation and analyzing the state of the art techniques.", "In fact, you took several steps back. You started with gaining knowledge of basic image processing techniques that were developed before the introduction of the computer vision advanced techniques we see and use today.", "Within Deep Learning, we understand that the lower levels of a convolutional neural network learn low-level patterns from the input image such as lines and edges.", "But before the introduction of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) into computer vision, there were heuristic-based techniques used to detect regions of interests and extract features from images.", "My computer vision studies ensured I understood the foundation of the field, by gaining some knowledge in how some of these heuristic-based techniques worked and are utilized in practical applications.", "Computer vision studies provided me with the knowledge of traditional machine learning techniques to process images, extract features and classify descriptors obtained from images.", "Below are a few key topics and terms that were introduced during my computer vision studies:", "Feel free to skip the definitions. I placed these here to provide some information for curious individuals\u2026", "Other notable topics to mentions are as follows:", "Very early on within my studies, I was expected to begin developing computer vision-based applications. Object classification is a popular topic and one of relative ease to gain some essential knowledge from and also implement.", "Within my studies, I was tasked with developing a visual search system in Matlab.", "Matlab is a programming language that has been developed for efficient numerical computing and matrix manipulation, and the Matlab library is equipped with a suite of algorithms and visualization tools.", "Having past programming experience in JavaScript, Java, and Python helped me pick up Matlab programming syntax easily so that I could focus wholeheartedly on the computer vision aspect of the studies.", "The visual system to implement was rather basic, and it worked by passing a query image through the system, after that the system produces a set of results of images that are similar to the query image that was passed into the system.", "I should mention that the system contained a database of stored images to extract result images from(query image in then result images out).", "The visual system didn\u2019t use any fancy deep learning technique, but rather some of the traditional machine learning techniques mentioned earlier.", "You simply pass an RGB image that is converted to grayscale and then a feature extractor is imposed on the image; thereafter, an image descriptor is extracted and represented on an N-dimensional feature space.", "Within this feature space, you could work out similar images by calculating the euclidean distance between two N-dimensional points.", "Understanding computer vision is not just limited to working with images; you are expected to utilize algorithms and techniques on videos.", "Remember that videos are just sequences of images, so you are not learning anything new in terms of the preparation and handling of input data.", "Object tracking within a series of images seems very trivial if you are using an object detection framework such as YOLO, RCNN etc. But recognize that studying computer vision is not about using pre-trained networks and fine-tuning. It\u2019s about understanding how the field itself has progressed over the years, and the best way to gain a solid understanding is by surveying the variety of traditional techniques that have been developed over time.", "So for the task of object tracking, the following topics were introduced:", "I\u2019ll be honest, I haven\u2019t yet utilized any traditional machine learning classifiers within my current role, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be using any soon.", "But to give you an idea of how relevant some of the mentioned techniques are it\u2019s worth stating that self-driving cars, license plate readers and lane detectors incorporate one or two of the methods discussed earlier.", "Deep learning is a natural progression from computer vision studies.", "Some deep learning topics were already covered within the computer vision module, while other topics of deep learning were extensions or improvement to traditional computer vision techniques.", "The teachings of topics in deep learning took a similar path to my computer vision studies, which is, the creation of a solid understanding of the fundamental of the field before moving to advanced topics and application development.", "Deep learning studies started from an understanding of the fundamental building block of images, pixels.", "You quickly gain the knowledge that a digital image is a grid that contains a collection of pixels.", "After an understanding of the atomic basis of images, you move on to learn how images are stored within system memory.", "The framebuffer is the name given to the location of where pixels are stored within the system memory (not a lot of MOOCS will teach you this).", "I also gained knowledge of how camera devices actually capture digital images.", "I have to admit it was great having some intuition as to how a smartphone camera captures images.", "Let\u2019s fast forward to some more cool stuff.", "You can\u2019t learn Deep Learning without having an understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN), they go hand in hand.", "My studies introduced the timeline of the introduction and development of CNNs over the last 20 years (from LeNet-5 to RCNNs)and their role in replacing the traditional pipeline for typical computer vision tasks such as object recognition.", "An exploration of different CNN architectures presented in the early days of deep learning was introduced during my studies. AlexNet, LeNet and GoogLeNet were case studies that were utilized to create an understanding of the internals of a convolutional neural network and their application to solving tasks such as object detection, recognition and classification.", "One important skill I learnt was how to read research papers.", "Reading research papers was not a skill that you were directly taught. If you are serious about deep learning and studying in general, it\u2019s always a good idea to go the source of information and research. It\u2019s rather easy to utilize pretrained models offered by deep learning framework. Still, an advanced study expects you to know the intrinsic details of the techniques and components of each of the architecture presented, information that is only presented in research papers.", "Here\u2019s a summary of topics that were covered in the deep learning module:", "Feel free to skip the definitions. I placed these here to provide some information for curious individuals\u2026", "Other notable topics and sub-topics include neural networks, backpropagation, CNN network architectures, super-resolution, gesture recognition, semantic segmentation etc.", "This is essentially my bread and butter.", "To date, I have incorporated face detection, gesture recognition, pose estimation and semantic segmentation models on edge devices for gaming purposes.", "In my current role, I implement, train and evaluate a lot of deep learning models. If you would like to work with a lot cutting edge algorithms, tools and within progressive companies, then deep learning is a field that can put you at the forefront of actual commercial developments in AI.", "A masters thesis aim is to enable you to utilize all the skills, knowledge and intuition you\u2019ve gained during your studies towards devising a solution to a real-life based problem.", "My thesis was based on the utilization of computer vision techniques for conducting motion analysis on quadrupeds(four-legged animals). The key computer vision technique that I used to perform motion analysis was pose-estimation.", "This was one of the first times I was introduced to the world of deep learning frameworks. I had already decided that my solution to motion analysis was going to be a deep learning-based solution that leveraged convolutional neural networks.", "For the selection of the framework, I went back and forth between Caffe and Keras, but I settled for PyTorch due to its readily available pretrained models that were relevant to the task. Python was my programming language of choice.", "Motion analysis is the term given to the process involved in obtaining movement information and details from clear moving pictures or collation of images representing sequence to sequence depiction of locomotion.", "The results of applications and operations that utilize motion analysis are in their most straightforward form details around motion detection and keypoints localization. Complex applications enable the utilization of sequential related images to track objects on a frame by frame basis.", "In the present day, motion analysis and its various application forms provide significant benefits and rich information when utilized on temporal data.", "Different industries benefit from the results and information provided through motion analysis, sectors such as healthcare, manufacturing, mechanical, finance, etc. have various use cases and method of application of motion analysis to solve problems or create value for consumers.", "The diversity of how motion analysis is utilized across the industry has indirectly introduced various arching subsets of motion analysis such as pose estimation, object detection, object tracking, keypoint detection, and different other subsets.", "The thesis presented an approach to motion analysis conducted utilizing computer vision and machine learning techniques. In the presented approach, a dataset of synthetic quadruped images was used to train a pre-trained keypoint detection network.", "Keypoint-RCNN is a built-in model within the Pytorch Library that extends the capabilities of the original Fast-RCNN and Faster-RCNN. The approach in the thesis modified the Keypoint-RCNN neural network architecture pre-trained on COCO 2017 object detection and segmentation dataset and retrained the last layer with a synthetically generated dataset.", "By expanding a baseline framework for keypoint detection of humans with 17 joints across a body, I presented an extension of the framework, to one that predicts major joints location on several generated quadrupeds with 26 joints.", "Quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies were used to show the visual and metric performance of the modified Keypoint-RCNN architecture in predicting key points on an artificial quadruped.", "If you\u2019ve made it this far I applaud you\u2026let bring this article to a close", "The machine learning field is changing rapidly; the content of my course was relevant for the year 2018\u20132019.
