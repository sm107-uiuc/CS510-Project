He will fly at a speed of 1280 miles per second and spend one millisecond in each of the 842 million households. Not a simple deed, especially for a man of his age. So how can we all help Santa in this epical feat?", "First of all, I am sure many children are asking a million and one questions about Santa. Parents try to give them a reasonable answer even though let\u2019s face it; we can\u2019t explain the magic behind it. So why not get the old-man himself to answer? AskSanta (https://asksanta.com) is an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot which is ready to satisfy the queries of those little curious minds. Even the most difficult ones! All you have to do is register for free and start asking questions. It\u2019s rather fun, and Santa is there to answer anything you want.", "Second, it takes quite some effort to convince today\u2019s kids. They understand technology better than some of us. Here is where personalisation can help. Portable North Pole (https://www.portablenorthpole.com) provides free mobile or video calls directly from Santa. He will not only call your child with his first name but also relate something that happened to him. Remember, he also knows if he\u2019s been bad or good! In fact, through this service, the child can receive countless messages encouraging the child to improve his behaviour, congratulating him for a great job or even reminding him of Santa\u2019s visit to his house.", "Third, on Christmas eve, children might want to track Santa\u2019s journey across the globe. There are various programs to help you do that. The most famous two are the Google Santa Tracker (https://santatracker.google.com) and the Official NORAD Santa Tracker (https://www.noradsanta.org). They use some advanced technologies such as radars, satellites and jet fighters to track the movement of the flying sleigh. Although both systems are somewhat accurate, they cannot predict precisely when Santa will visit each house. However, as a general rule of thumb, if children are still awake when Santa arrives, he moves on to other homes. He returns later, but only when the children are asleep! Up till Christmas eve, these websites also offer various free games and educational activities. These include a Santa Selfie, Elf Maker, Penguine Dash, Build & Bolt, Map Quiz, Santa\u2019s Canvas and much more.", "Fourth, once the kids are asleep, grownups will do their utmost to gather proof of Santa\u2019s visit. So far, it mainly consisted of discovering new presents under the tree, an empty glass of milk, bitten carrots and cookie crumbs all over the place. Unfortunately, it is somewhat circumstantial evidence for today\u2019s kids. Our technology has not advanced enough to capture Santa\u2019s visit (which only lasts 1 ms), until this year! Parents can now download an app called \u201cSanta Was Here\u201d (https://tinyurl.com/AI-Christmas-SWH) which makes use of your mobile device to capture a movie of Santa placing presents next to your own Christmas Tree. The technology behind it is called Augmented Reality (AR) and makes use of the camera system on your mobile device to place virtual objects over the real world.", "Finally, the real magic of Christmas does not happen when we receive the presents, but only if we manage to touch someone\u2019s heart. It is even more powerful when we help someone in need whom we don\u2019t even know! And this year, there\u2019s a web application for this called Gran\u2019s Post Office (https://tinyurl.com/GranPostOffice). Kids only need to write or draw a heart-warming message for an older person (whom they don\u2019t know). Then they take a photo of the message and upload it on the website. The elves on the other side will get all of those electronic messages, print them out on paper and deliver them to all those elderly who will be passing a lonely Christmas. Like that, they will know that they\u2019re no longer lonely because someone thought about them.", "As you can see, this special time of year is indeed magical. Of course, technology is playing an important part. AI is giving the personality to the Father Christmas, who is answering millions of questions online. It is personalising the mobile and video calls. Complex algorithms track Santa\u2019s journey throughout the night. Augmented Reality is allowing you to take a photo of him in your living room and computer systems are managing the elaborate mailing room of the Gran\u2019s Post Office. But we don\u2019t need to wait for modern technology to do good. Use a telephone and give-a-shout to the relative you seldom call. Share a smile with your invisible neighbours. A simple greeting or even a phone call can go a long way to free these people from the spectre of loneliness. So, ask yourself whether there is someone who needs your help and begin to change the world, starting from your own backyard, one person at a time.", "May I take this opportunity to wish you all a Happy Christmas and a Wonderful New Year full of Health, Love, Peace and Joys.", "If you enjoyed the article and would like to contact me, please do so on \ud83d\udc26 Twitter, \ud83d\udd17 LinkedIn, \ud83d\udcf7 Instagram or \ud83d\ude0a Facebook.", "Prof Alexiei Dingli is a Professor of AI at the University of Malta.
