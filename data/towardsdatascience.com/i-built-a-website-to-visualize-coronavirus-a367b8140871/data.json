It is only a matter of time before we are released back into the wild again, and the frontline workers can relax for a bit.", "While staying at home, I understand things can seem to be a little blur. We are unsure of what is happening out there, and that can feel like living under a rock. Lucky for you, I\u2019m here to offer you the perfect solution. A Coronavirus website.", "I created an interactive website that tracks the statistics, trends, and news of the Coronavirus all around the world. The website updates itself every 30 minutes, keeping it almost live for its browsers. It features a smooth user experience, perfect for you to monitor what\u2019s going on in your country, and then some.", "In this article, I will talk about why I built the website. I will talk about the motivation behind it, what I had decided to include in it, and my thought process behind everything. This is to share my journey with all of you and perhaps inspire you to build something even better. Here we go.", "There are already a few websites out there serving a similar purpose as my site. You may be familiar with sites like Worldometers and WHO Corona Dashboard, which have done a good job of displaying the current data for Coronavirus.", "The problem with these sites is they provide a global view on the current situation of Coronavirus. It\u2019s great and all, but there are users who are interested in the data of a specific country only. Often, when I\u2019m looking for data on Coronavirus, I find myself searching for a specific country to truly understand how is that country recovering.", "According to a post made by Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, states that Coronavirus search results will be altered. Google has made an effort to display search results that are connected to authorities like governments. Hence, sites like Worldometers will show up frequently when searching for Coronavirus.", "I am aware that some of the sites use a geographical layout to showcase the magnitude of Coronavirus all around the world. However, most of the time, we don\u2019t even know where the country we are interested in is located on the world map, making it a hassle to find.", "For example, we all read about the news on how Coronavirus has been spreading in the United States of America. Knowing this, I go onto any site to look for Coronavirus\u2019 stats on the US but have yet to find a smooth experience to do so.", "I am also interested in how is my country doing specifically. I live in Malaysia, which is currently in a movement control order. The government here has been extending the order week after week now, no one has any idea when is this going to end. Having said that, I find myself looking up data on Malaysia often, which is a hassle to find on some sites.", "Having searched for specific countries multiple times, I figured why don\u2019t I build something myself. A Coronavirus dashboard that allows users to get a global view, as well as being able to drill down into country-specific data smoothly.", "The site features a simplistic design, with multiple colors to represent new cases, deaths, and recoveries. Users are able to clearly look for global data, as well as being able to search for countries of interest. The tables, graphs, and numbers will update themselves accordingly to the country the user has specified.", "I find myself just going onto the site, searching for Malaysia daily. I get good results on how is Malaysia recovering by looking at the trends and numbers. For fun, I include neighboring countries like Singapore and the Philippines to compare our recoveries. It looks like Malaysia isn\u2019t so bad after all.", "This is my take on an interactive website on Coronavirus. It may not be ideal for everyone, so feel free to leave feedback or email me if you are shy to do so.", "The Landing Page shows 3 numbers. Total Cases, Deaths, and Recoveries.They mean exactly what they are displaying, which are the total cases, deaths, and recoveries due to Coronavirus on a global scale. This is a quick glance at the situation of Coronavirus around the world.", "This is where it gets interesting. The page shows you almost all the data you need to know in an organized way while featuring a search bar at the top. Type in whichever country you\u2019re interested in, the page will change accordingly.", "The trends section provides insights on how countries are recovering. There are 3 main charts which are updated by the search bar to show this, but I would like to highlight the new cases vs new recoveries chart. If the green is constantly higher than the read, it means that your country of choice (global by default) is on its way to a full recovery soon.", "Along with the two other charts, you can roughly guess how soon your country will be up and running. I track this daily to estimate when I can finally go out to get a haircut.", "The news section is a nice-to-have section featuring all the latest news about Coronavirus. It is being scraped from a Reddit subforum named \u2018coronavirus\u2019 which shows news from famous sources like BBC and The Guardian.", "On the back-end, there is code written to update the site every 30 minutes. The code gathers up-to-date data from sources like WHO, Reddit, and Covid19api.com to populate the graphs, tables, and news. This is to ensure users get up-to-date data while browsing the site.", "I\u2019m a Millenial. We all have that inner entrepreneur inside us. I\u2019m proud to say that this project has satisfied my inner entrepreneur greatly.", "Often, youngsters like me don\u2019t really know what it is like to pump out a working digital product. Some of us think that it\u2019s just the code. I handle everything from design, front and back-end, product, deployment, and marketing for the site. It has been a good ride for me and I\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019ve learned a ton from this experience.", "The site has been up almost a week now, it has gathered about half a thousand sessions. I actively ask for feedback from users to improve my site. I learned that different target audiences have different opinions on a certain product, which I need to take into consideration to improve my site.", "Take my parents as an example, they don\u2019t really know how to look at data. They can\u2019t really translate graphs and tables. Hence, they find the site extremely confusing. On the flip side, my colleagues find the site very helpful. They also mentioned that the colors do a great job at representing different stats.", "As a product owner, this has helped me to verify my target audience. It has also provided me with valuable feedback on how different users perceive my product, and how I can improve it for everyone.", "The main objective of the site was never to make money, but to provide value.I identified a problem and thought that if I could solve it for someone, they would find it valuable.", "If I make a small buck from the site, that\u2019s cool. However, that is not my main objective. There are way better business models out there than serving a free site without ads.", "Simply put it this way, this is my first take on providing value by solving a problem that I think many people are facing. Whether if that\u2019s true, we will find out soon enough.", "I\u2019m a data scientist/data engineer by profession. I have always wanted to build something cool. This website is just a start.", "By writing ALL the code for the site, I\u2019ve learned a lot on how front and back-end work. I\u2019ve learned new frameworks, how to optimize page load speeds and mobile responsiveness through my code.", "Fun fact: When I initially completed the site, it took almost 20+ seconds to load, which is completely unacceptable. Now, it takes about 3\u20135 seconds on average.", "I will publish an article on the technicalities on the site, some of you might find that interesting.", "That pretty much sums it up. Above is the link to my site once again.Check it out and tell me if it\u2019s useful for you. Share it with your close ones if you think it would help them.", "I hope this has been somewhat an interesting/inspiring read for you. I had a great time making the site, I hope you have a great time using it too.", "We are not done yet with our journey. Stay tuned, I am writing about the technicalities on the site. In the meantime, feel free to check out my other articles to temporarily fill your hunger for data.", "As usual, I end with a quote.", "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor. \u2014 Elon Musk", "Thanks for reading! If you want to get in touch with me, feel free to reach me on nickmydata@gmail.com or my LinkedIn Profile. You can also view the code for previous write-ups in my Github.", "Your home for data science.
