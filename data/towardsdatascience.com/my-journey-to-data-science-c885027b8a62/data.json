I\u2019ve been meaning to write one of those \u201chow\u2019d I end up here\u201d posts for a while, but as time passed I wanted to hold off until I had worked a while longer. Retrospectives tend to be more pointed and honest after some time has passed \u2014 at which point it\u2019s easier to separate the signal from the noise and emotions.", "In March of 2019, I left a cushy job at a robo-advisor (automated investment advice for individuals and 401k plan participants) where without much effort, I was able to earn a lot of money. Why would I do such a thing? Three reasons:", "So quit I did. My boss was actually pretty surprised when I gave him the news. He was nice enough to offer to hold my spot if I wanted to come back once I completed the bootcamp, and I almost accepted. But I wanted a fresh start so I ultimately said no. If there was a job for me to potentially return to, then I worried that I would just gravitate towards that path of least resistance.", "On April Fool\u2019s Day of 2019, I started my bootcamp. It was honestly a really fun 12 weeks. During that time, I made new friends, worked on various passion projects, and started my blog.", "To be honest, I didn\u2019t learn that much from the bootcamp. I\u2019d been working in various quantitative roles for most of my career, so I was already reasonably familiar with statistics and working with data.", "The main things I learned from the bootcamp were:", "Would I attend the bootcamp again? Yes, in a heartbeat. I know it costs a lot of money ($17,000 for 12 weeks) and requires you to give up working for several months. But it was great fun and will probably be the last time I attend a school like environment (it feels sad to type that).", "Could I have gotten my current job without going to bootcamp? Yes, I probably could have. At the same time, the structure of the bootcamp, the determination of my peers, and not having a job were great motivators to get off my butt, brush up on my interviewing skills, and job hunt.", "Did the bootcamp help me land interviews and eventually a job? No, I did all of my recruiting on my own. A few of my cohort mates did land roles through our careers counselor, but by and large, everyone did most of their own recruiting. This is probably my main gripe about data science bootcamps in general \u2014 they use glossy employment stats to attract people, but what\u2019s not communicated is that the stats are much more reflective of the student\u2019s own drive and effort than the bootcamp\u2019s pull with recruiters. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the bootcamps do do a good job of teaching their students data science. But the market for data scientists is significantly less deep and welcoming than their marketing brochures make it out to be.", "The past year has taught me a lot about myself actually. My previous job had become so easy for me that I had forgotten what it was like to strive and stretch. In moments of doubt, I worried whether I still even could. That\u2019s why regardless of the outcome, I\u2019m happy that I was able to muster up the guts to take a chance and give this journey a try.", "I was able to find a job relatively quickly after the bootcamp. I interviewed with 3 companies (all for data science positions) : a bank, a consulting firm, and a fintech startup. Ultimately, I was fortunate to receive offers from all 3 (I accepted the fintech startup offer). My interview experience was atypical (I only completed one take home and surprisingly was never asked to do any SQL) so I don\u2019t really have anything too insightful to say about it. In lieu of job hunting advice, I will give some job choosing advice:", "Lastly, I want to add that there is a discrepancy between what people think data scientists do and what they actually do. The sexy aspects of the job that everyone wants to talk about are machine learning and artificial intelligence. But that\u2019s just a small part of the job. During the vast majority of my time when I\u2019m not training and fitting models (building and fitting a model really doesn\u2019t take that long), I\u2019m sourcing and cleaning data or brainstorming about what data I need and what approach I should use to solve the problems faced by my company. For these, domain knowledge and the ability to learn on the fly are actually much more useful than an encyclopedic knowledge of machine learning algorithms. To conclude, I want to leave you with a list of attributes that I think every good data scientist must possess:", "Your home for data science.
