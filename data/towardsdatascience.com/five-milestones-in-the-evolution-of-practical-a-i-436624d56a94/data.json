Some think it\u2019s inevitable for people to be able to program computers to do the same tasks humans perform with ease. Others believe computers will never be able to even approach people in intelligence, decision-making and perception.", "Whatever the future holds for the field, machine learning is not magical. In fact, it has been steadily and significantly changing our lives for the past 80 years. And the progress is rather fascinating.", "We can trace the roots of the first conceptual neural network back to 1943 and the work of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts. However, the first real-life application of machine learning principles occurred in 1959, when Arthur Samuel created the first checker-playing program.", "The way most people would approach building a checkers game on a computer at the time was by brute force. An algorithm would go over the board, making moves in a sequence and searching each possible path until the game came to a conclusion. The only problem is, it would take around thirteen years for a computer to brute-force checkers. That wouldn\u2019t really do for the endeavor of trumping humans.", "Instead of searching each path, Samuel decided to write a function that assessed the situation on the board at any given moment. The function considered how many pieces became \u201ckings,\u201d how close others were to reaching that stage and how many pieces overall remained on each side. The program then tried to make a move that would optimize the value of the function and increase the probability of winning.", "Later, Samuel also designed mechanisms that allowed the computer to memorize the positions that it had already been in, as well as how \u201crewarding\u201d those positions turned out to be.", "In 1997, it became real. A computer beat the top-ranking human in the game of human development, setting the pace for years of A.I. research to come. The machine was called Deep Blue, and it was one of IBM\u2019s greatest creations.", "Before the definitive match of 1997, Garry Kasparov met ChipTest, Deep Blue\u2019s early prototype, in 1989 \u2014 and beat it. It took the researchers nearly another decade to improve the system. When Deep Blue defeated the grandmaster, Kasparov accused the machine\u2019s creators of cheating, claiming that Deep Blue\u2019s decisions had a human touch.", "Much later, however, in his 2017 TedTalk, Kasparov shared his favorable views on the developing technology and noted that machines complement humans rather than contest them.", "Calculating moves in chess is pretty cool. Classifying already generated images is somewhat impressive. A computer that can produce original creative work, however, is a blast.", "Stats Monkey, a project of several students at Northwestern University, can write a story about any baseball game in about two seconds. The system uses statistics to figure out the outcome of the game, the key players, and dynamics. After establishing what the story should be about, Stats Monkey uses a library of specific expressions and pieces together a narrative that actually doesn\u2019t sound robotic.", "DeepMind is a system that can teach itself to play computer games \u2014 and best humans at it. Acquired by Google in 2014, DeepMind was the first successful application of machine learning that allowed a computer to get progressively better at 49 different Atari console games.", "The novelty lied in the algorithm. Although it was easy to program DeepMind to play certain games, the creators aimed for a more elegant and universally applicable approach. They wanted a model that could learn from scratch.", "Dr. Demis Hassabis, the co-founder and CEO of DeepMind, commented: \u201cThe only information we gave the system was the raw pixels on the screen and the idea that it had to get a high score.\u201d", "The final version of the system utilized deep learning and managed to figure out the mechanics of the game after playing it for several hours. The success of DeepMind was not only impressive but demonstrated that it was possible to program a computer to learn from large amounts of data and apply that knowledge without human intervention.", "Early detection of various skin cancers is incredibly important to the survival rate. In 2018, human doctors succeeded in detecting melanomas in approximately 86.6% of cases. It means that out of 59,782 deaths per year due to melanoma in the world, approximately 8,011 fatalities could potentially happen because of this error.", "In 2018, researchers from Germany, France and the United States produced an artificial intelligence system that could recognize malignant melanomas correctly in 95% of cases. The model also made fewer misjudgments regarding benign moles on the skin. The accuracy is likely to increase with more training.", "Machine learning, as a tool, is immensely enabling. The five developments covered in this article constitute only a tiny fraction of millions of phenomenal solutions that utilize the technology. Upon deeper inspection, you realize that A.I. is everywhere now \u2014 from face recognition and medicine to business analytics, gaming and YouTube recommendation algorithm.", "It\u2019s a perfect time to not only expand our expertise in A.I. but tailor it precisely to solving the biggest problems of our time.", "Your home for data science.
