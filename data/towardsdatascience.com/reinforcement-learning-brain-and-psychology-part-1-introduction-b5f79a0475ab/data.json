For decades reinforcement learning has been borrowing ideas not only from nature but also from our own psychology making a bridge between technology and humans.", "In these series we will dive into what has already inspired the field of RL and what could trigger it\u2019s development in the future.", "This topic is broken into 9 parts:", "We\u2019re not going to investigate RL itself in this series, assuming that you\u2019re already somewhat familiar with it. Hopefully there\u2019s going to be another series, which will be RL focused and will cover everything starting with Dynamic Programming and finishing with complex things as AlphaZero.", "All of the thoughts here are gathered from different sources including my own experience and thinking on the topic. But I must spotlight the source I praise the most and from which I draw most of the knowledge \u2014 \u201cReinforcement learning: An Introduction\u201d by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. This is one of the very few books on RL and the only book which covers the very fundamentals and the origin of RL.", "In this post we will cover the basics of RL using some real world examples as this series is not about the math, neural networks or programming. It\u2019s more on understanding of our own minds and things that we could apply in Artificial Intelligence.", "\u201cWe will probably build AGI long before we understand how our brain works.\u201d", "The key concept of RL is very simple to us as we see and apply it in almost every aspect of our live. A toddler learning to walk is one of the examples.", "You might\u2019ve seen similar pictures in every RL course, nothing new here but it gives the idea.", "A toddler is sitting on the floor (it\u2019s his current state) makes an action, a tries to stand up, and gets a reward after this. That is reinforcement learning in three words.", "The toddler doesn\u2019t know how to walk but he learns by trial and error. An environment gives feedback such as pain, when he falls down, or a hug from a loving mother, when he takes a step. Does this sound familiar? Yeah, it\u2019s what many people know as positive and negative reinforcement or in more general way operant conditioning. We also apply it when we teach a dog to bark or to roll, for example.", "Agent is what many call an AI but it basically a personification of an algorithm which acts in an environment. A person, a dog, or a toddler could be an agent.Environment is what surrounds the agent and what the agent takes a reward from. For example, the world around us or a game you play.Policy is logic, morality and the brain of the agent. It gives the agent an insight on what he should do in order to succeed. Speaking more technically, it tries to predict the outcome of agent\u2019s actions in some given situation. Reward is what the agent gets when it does something. It could be positive or negative depending on how well the agent acts. A cookie for a dog for making a roll is an example of a positive reward and a violent shout of your coach is an example of a negative reward.State is a situation the agent got into. It\u2019s some representation of the information you possess, like how much money you have, how far from work you live, how lazy you are. The agent decides what to do depending on a state.", "So basically what RL researchers do is trying to create such an agent (in terms of RL our toddler is an agent) which will be operating in an environment (such as the world for the toddler) and could understand what is the best move in a given situation. Back to toddler example, how he should put his body in order to hold the balance and make a step.", "What differ us people from RL agents is that rewards given by our environment are not that clear and understandable. We have lots of saying on this matter actually: \u201ceveryone has their own version of the truth\u201d, \u201cwhat does the truth even mean?\u201d, \u201cGood and Evil are different in only a point of view\u201d etc.", "To put in simple, we do not know which actions are good and which are bad. We always have figure this out in a kinda empirical way, and there is no one who could tell you how well you did. Well, obviously we have teachers and parents who help us in learning but in general we are alone in this dark and scary world. No one can tell you which of our actions will lead to success and which will lead to failure.", "So, like I said, unlike reinforcement learning agents we do not get that interpretable reward, which is also called an extrinsic reward, from our environment but we have what is called an intrinsic reward.From human standpoint, intrinsic reward is self-motivation, curiosity, desire to accomplish goals just because and with no reason at all. It\u2019s somewhere inside us, it\u2019s a spark which some of us turn into fire.", "And, of course, we figured a way to give RL agents this kind of reward. For example, in this beautiful paper by OpenAI \u2014 Large-Scale Study of Curiosity-Driven Learning \u2014 researchers made an agent curious about the world. Long story short, the agent gets an intrinsic reward when it goes to previously unseen location. The results are amazing, the agent manages to solve Montezuma\u2019s Revenge which is extremely complex for reinforcement learning algorithms due to its hierarchical walkthrough (go get the key, then find the door, open it etc.).", "Of course, there are more technical explanations why Montezuma\u2019s Revenge is so hard to solve but it\u2019s outside of this series and requires somewhat more knowledge of reinforcement learning algorithms.", "Reinforcement learning could be the way to an AGI or it could be not. Honestly, I don\u2019t know and probably no one does. I believe it\u2019s the closest to the AGI among machine learning technique we have but who am I to judge?", "What I can say for sure is that RL is being constantly influenced by our own nature and it this series we will unveil what happens in our brains and minds, and discover what the field of AI has borrowed from us humans.", "Connect with me on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and follow on GitHub!", "Your home for data science.
