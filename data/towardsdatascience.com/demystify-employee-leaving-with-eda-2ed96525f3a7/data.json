Now I will share recent work in the human resource domain to bring some predictive power to any firm struggling to retain their employees.", "In this first post, I will focus on exploring datasets for any interesting patterns. As always, it is split into below:", "If you are from the Human Resources department, you may agree that hiring and retaining employees are complex tasks that require capital, time, and skills.", "According to toggle hire, companies spend 15%-20% of the employee\u2019s salary to recruit a new candidate. Hiring an employee in a company in a company with 0\u2013500 people costs an average of $7,645 \ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude40.", "As a data scientist, you are tasked to develop a model that could predict which employees are more likely to quit. Your findings will support more effective and efficient employee retainment.", "The dataset used here is IBM HR Analytics dataset from Kaggle. There are 1470 records with 35 features. Check the video below to have a real touch on the raw dataset.", "To better understand the meaning of each feature, I made an easy-to-view figure below.", "To understand the distribution of numerical variables, use below.", "For data quality check (if there is any NULL or missing data in each column) and view the data type, use below:", "Note that you can also use below to check if there are any NA values in a dataframe:", "With all the above, we found 26 numerical variables and 9 categorical variables with no missing values.", "We use the histogram as a simple visualization for numerical variable distribution analysis.", "First, let\u2019s convert binary categorical data into numerical. Use a one-line function with lambda to apply to the whole column. Then, pandas built-in plot function to create a histogram. Specifically,", "Reviewing Fig.2, you may find column \u2018EmployeeCount\u2019, \u2018Over18\u2019, and \u2018StandardHours\u2019 is of no value because these remain the same for all employees. So let\u2019s remove them:", "Variables correlation is an important issue that is worth every data scientist\u2019s nerve.", "In general, correlated features don\u2019t improve model performance. It is wise to remove correlated features considering the curse of dimensionality and the interpretability of the model. To perform correlation analysis, use:", "Fig.3 shows some sensible correlations. For instance, \u2018TotalWorkingYears\u2019 is strongly correlated with \u2018JobLevel\u2019 and \u2018MonthlyIncome\u2019. In general, we can see quite a lot of variables are poorly correlated. Great, because it is desirable to train a predictive model with features that are not highly correlated with each other.", "To analyze how each feature impacts employee leaves, we can inspect each variable\u2019s distribution with respect to the response variable.", "First, for employee \u2018Age\u2019, let\u2019s use countplot,", "Fig.4 shows employees between 25\u201335, show a high leave ratio compared to the rest ages. Below 21, a very high leave percentage can be spotted, indicating young professionals are more likely to leave the firm \ud83e\udd2d.", "Second, for \u2018JobRole\u2019, count plot is:", "Fig.5 shows \u2018sales executive\u2019, \u2018sales representative\u2019, and \u2018lab technician\u2019 are more likely to leave compared to other roles.", "Third, let\u2019s use KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) to analyze the probability density function of the numerical variables.", "KDE takes bandwidth and a kernel function to approximate the true distribution of the population by weighing the distances near each sample. The more data points nearby, the estimate is high, indicating the probability of seeing a point. Bandwidth determines how \u2018smooth\u2019 the resulting curve is. A lower bandwidth means only points close to the current position are given weight. Enough of the explanation, if you want more introduction, try this link. Let\u2019s see how to achieve it.", "As shown in Fig.6, more employees tend to leave when the distance from home is more than 10 km \ud83c\udd92\ud83c\udd92.", "For the variable \u2018YearsWithCurrManager\u2019, more employees tend to leave with less than 2 years with the current managers and tend to stay if having more than 5 years experience \ud83e\udde8\ud83e\udde8, as shown in Fig.7.", "For the variable \u2018 TotalWorkingYears\u2019, more employees tend to leave with less than 7 years of experience \ufe0f\ud83d\udce3, as shown in Fig.8.", "Now, let\u2019s use boxplot to visualize and compare the distribution of \u2018MonthlyIncome\u2019 between \u2018Gender\u2019. As shown in Fig.9, female and male monthly income shows a similar variability with similar median, 75%, and 25% quartile values \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f, as shown in Fig.9.", "At last, let\u2019s see different \u2018JobRole\u2019 income distribution. Fig.10 shows the monthly income distribution and variability of different roles. Interestingly, we found \u2018Sales Representative\u2019 shows a compact distribution, with income broadly lower than other roles \ud83d\ude40. This could explain why \u2018Sales Representative\u2019 tends to leave more as shown in Fig.5.", "Hopefully, this sheds some light on how to better understand your employee or colleague's decision when it comes to leaving.", "Great!
