In today\u2019s business world, driven by decisions made by artificial intelligence, that mantra has changed into \u201cto trust, or not to trust\u201d.", "With recent AI debacles making news, the question of lack of transparency and increasing biases in AI models have come to light. With recent examples where the AI system stated that the highly polluted air was safe to breathe whereas, in reality, it was highly dangerous or the instance when the AI system stated that a certain patient didn\u2019t have cancer when in fact the patient did have cancer and died or the instance when the AI system identified a certain transaction as fraud whereas it was a completely legitimate transaction creating unnecessary trouble for the customer, there is clearly something wrong. These debacles are increasing every day with the wide use of AI and are caused by, none other than, our blinded trust into these AI systems, but now it\u2019s time to take action!", "The current business landscape is still very sceptical when it comes to implementing and trusting these AI systems. Many companies have initiated the process, but have yet to realize the value. This is mainly due to the understanding gap between data science teams and business stakeholders. We talked to many business stakeholders over the past few months, that are on the receiving ends of these predictions, and found the inability of the data scientist to explain the why and how behind AI systems predictions to be the biggest factor of mistrust and scepticism towards the data science initiative. People in the data science teams are highly technical with a knack for complexity to signal the extent of their skillset. However, business stakeholders are sometimes the complete opposite: they don\u2019t care about the technology used, but how the results generated by the model tie-up with their business goals and KPIs.", "This is impossible to achieve unless the data scientist can answer these essential questions:", "1. Why should I trust the results generated by the model?", "2. What was the rationale used by the model to generate the results?", "3. What are the upside and the downside of using the model in production?", "4. Do the results align with the business logic or not?", "Only after answering these questions, the data scientist can bring recommendations to the business user, and expect to make some progress.", "To solve this, the data scientist has two choices:", "1. Explain the black-box models by building an interpretable model on top of it. This is the logic behind LIME & SHAP. SHAP is more widely used since it guarantees a fair distribution of contribution for each of the variables and has a wide array of graphs. Sadly, this approach requires a lot of iterations, lacks interactivity and is not scalable especially when you\u2019re dealing with sensitive datasets and decisions. More than that, the visualizations are not appealing and interactive. Their static nature creates an even further divide between the data scientist and the business stakeholder. The absence of dynamic and interactive graphs makes it extremely difficult to generate value from SHAP or LIME, thus a better way to use these techniques is required.", "2. Use interpretable models: instead of using black-box models such as deep neural networks, a data scientist can try to optimize simpler models like logistic regression or decision trees to make predictions. There will be a trade-off in accuracy and interpretability, but the data scientist will need to decide what is important to generate value and will need to focus on the marginal benefits between the two models. If the marginal increase between accuracies is not significant, it\u2019s more ideal to implement simpler models and tie the predictions directly with business KPIs. Sadly, with the increasing complexity in the data, we\u2019re collecting today, simpler models do not perform well.", "mltrons\u2019 xAI lab is researching on an xAI Module, that aims to bring explainability and transparency to ML/DL black-box models through interaction innovation. The purpose is to understand why decisions were made by the AI system and ensure the AI predictions are unbiased, accurate and free of any logical inconsistencies.", "This module acts as a plug-n-play system that fits right into any Jupyter notebook \u2014 With automated visualizations and high interactivity, data scientists will be able to sit together with the business stakeholders to build trust in the AI system and make fully informed decisions.", "This means that data scientists can now bring in their Jupiter notebooks, data sources \u2014 Amazon, MySQL, HDFS and custom-built models using XGBoost, CatBoost, PyTorch, Tensorflow, SageMaker to the mltrons engine \u2014 mltrons xAI module will take in input and will work as an added layer to provide explainability on how these algorithms work, think and output results. The data scientist will be able to then explain the results in simple business-friendly language, ideally understood by anyone, through interactive visualizations, reports, and shareable dashboards.", "If you have any questions about the technology, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to us via this form:", "About the author: Raheel Ahmad is a Visiting Researcher at NYU Tandon\u2018s Visualization Imaging and Data Analysis (VIDA) Center with a focus on ML model explainability.
