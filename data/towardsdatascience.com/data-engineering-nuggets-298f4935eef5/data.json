A person with the title Data Engineer is likely to have arrived at the role wearing a variety of different hats only to discover \u201cData Engineer\u201d as the best moniker for them all. When addressing a crowd of these people there is a great deal of complexity regarding what can and cannot be considered \u201ccommon knowledge.\u201d With that in mind, I set out here to lay the groundwork for a collection of data team related learnings. By data team, I generally mean the collection of Analysts, Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Business Intelligence experts that make up most organizational knowledge structures (though my slant will usually be DE-focused). There are lessons we learn from doing that are both exceptionally valuable and relatable regardless of how we go about relating to them, and that is the angle I will take here. My hope is that it paints a broad primer for my take on the things that make data teams successful today.", "Before you sign any vendor contracts, spin up your first database or type a single git init, you need to understand the purpose of the data team in your organization. Nebulous goals with frighteningly vague directives like \u201cbecome a data driven organization\u201d or the dreaded \u201cuse machine learning to reduce toil\u201d are at best meaningless and at worst a threat to your career. Does the organization want to focus on internal analytics (accurate reporting around itself) or business intelligence (accurate reporting around customers)? Forecasting (predicting future business) or trend analysis (looking for long-term statistical patterns)? Real-time personalization (application-speed data science) or root cause analysis (data forensics)? A well-defined mission is the bedrock from which the scope and supported use cases of your work are derived. These will act as your highest level requirements when making choices about what tech to use, who to hire, and what defines \u201cdone\u201d for the work you do.", "Meh Mission: The Data Team will support the organization\u2019s goal of becoming more data driven and use machine learning to take our business to the next level.", "Yeah! Mission: The Data Team will build and maintain our \u201csingle source of truth\u201d data system, providing performance insights, product and customer analytics, and predictive forecasting internally to business stakeholders. This team will produce and certify assets used for internal performance metrics, product roadmapping & decision making, root cause analysis of product and efficiency issues, along with expense and sales projections.", "Now we know what we are setting out to accomplish. For example, the components of this mission all fall under either decision support, monitoring or forecasting \u2014highly latency-tolerant activities. The business value that we want to gain from the data team, in this case, can be had with daily, maybe even weekly batch processing \u2014 so investing heavily in a streaming NRT solution is probably the wrong answer here. Update your mission early and often. When in doubt press for clarity, especially when those ever-fickle C-suite characters give you vague direction. You can\u2019t succeed if you aren\u2019t clear on what success means.", "I am by no means a pioneer of this school of thought, and you can read plenty about data-engineering-as-code development written by people much smarter than me. In short, the transformations, extract-loads, artifacts, models and visualizations we produce are the result of programmatically applied business logic. This is the exact same function as the code that powers websites, and business software, and operating systems, and IOT toothbrushes. In the software world where this other applied business logic lives, certain tools and techniques are (generally) considered bedrock staples of the craft such as:", "We call these \u201cbest practices\u201d, and modern software developers have commands like git commit and tox -e test burned deep into their muscle memory. Oddly enough data teams are often considered exempt from these practices, and are held to a completely different set of development standards (or no standards at all). This is probably due in part to those diverse origins; somewhere along the lines a Business User became an Analyst, who then became a Data Engineer, and there was never a clear moment where someone from the software team felt the need to say \u201cYou are engineering software now, you need to start using Git.\u201d", "So here it is, in no uncertain terms. As a member of a modern data team in 2019, you need to test your code and your data artifacts. You need to use source control and subject your work to peer review. You need to learn how to deliver value in small increments and pivot as you unearth nuances in the subject data. You need to hold yourself accountable to real SLAs. These are not \u201calternatives\u201d to manual versioning, lone-gunman data engineering/science, eyeball-QA and code run directly against a production database from a sql terminal; not any more than riding a horse is an \u201calternative\u201d transport method to an airplane for a cross-country trip.", "There is much more to this topic for sure, and in the near future I will do my best to dive into how to best tackle data team software workflows in additional write-ups.", "The story goes something like this:", "A well-meaning CTO (or CEO, or CIO or whoever) decides that the company needs to be data driven. \u201cNo longer will we operate in data-darkness!\u201d cries the C-suite hero, and so they assemble a crack-team of engineers and devise an architecture including a data lake, extract-load pipeline, data warehouse, and business intelligence tool. Raw data from all the primary applications are pumped into the lake, a few SELECT * FROM queries are used to bake out flattened \u201canalysis tables\u201d, and boom! You have one of these:", "And the team does one of these:", "Except shortly after the \u201claunch\u201d, users begin to notice that the data doesn\u2019t quite match the previous reporting. It also doesn\u2019t make sense with how they understand the data or provide many real insights beyond what they already knew. A few things are way off. Soon departments start to compare notes, the backlog of discrepancies builds. In just a few months user confidence plummets, and the glorious white knight that was your Business Intelligence solution becomes another \u201ctruth\u201d alongside the army of sources it was supposed to replace.", "Put simply, data in a visualization does not equal mission accomplished. Moving data from source \u2192 data lake \u2192 data warehouse \u2192 visualization gets you maybe 10% of the way there; the other 90% is decrypting the tribal knowledge, magic numbers, transactional and operational structures that conflict with how users understand (or need to understand) the outputs, developing and implementing quality tests, and conforming the structures across data sets. This work is what transforms data into information. This is where the majority of a data team\u2019s value lies, and how we truly define \u201cdone\u201d.", "There are a few different tools we can use to tackle this other 90% (namely forensics, transformation, quality testing and data conformity). I\u2019m a big fan of the Kimball Bus Matrix \u2014 it sticks around because it works. For forensic work, I find that DBA partnerships and developer/stakeholder interviews are immensely valuable, but nothing beats reading the application code yourself. The reality is that your data product delivery is going to be most successful in a framework of iteration, which is why using a UAT development process for data teams is definitely one of my favorite solutions for internal analytics.", "However you go about it, remember that the earliest data products you present to the organization will define the level of confidence in your team. Putting your best foot forward with properly researched, tested and \u201chardened\u201d data products will pay off in the long run.", "As of fall 2019, data is the pumpkin spice of business terms. Companies want it, consumers worry about who has it, content creators don\u2019t know what to do with all of it, governments want to regulate it, Google and Facebook trade boatloads of it\u2026 everybody who\u2019s anybody is involved with data some way or another, or so it seems. For data team members this has created both some amazing opportunities and some gravely concerning trends.", "First off, the good news: Everybody loves you. Because of the recent obsession with data, we are enjoying an explosion of interest and support from our business counterparts. It is not every day that what is primarily a cost center can double or triple their operating expenses without being drawn and quartered; yet at this moment there are plenty of CIOs that will happily pay that monster AWS EMR bill if you say it was for all the \u201cmachine learning\u201d you\u2019ve been doing. There has never been an easier time to get what we need to build the right things that can impact the business in the right ways, thanks to this haze of data-euphoria.", "Now the not-so-good news: All booms must bust. This intoxication with data has all the makings of a bubble a la 2005 Florida real estate. If you remember that far back, it was a pretty amazing time to be a Realtor in ft. Lauderdale. By late 2009, not so much. People in power, be it the C-suite execs or directors, or even board members - they all want to be part of the data party today. And so they are likely to jump into data team meetings, drive oversized initiatives with lots of visual flash (often without tie-ins to company OKRs), and focus on the tech over the outcomes (especially when it involves a tool they have heard other C-suite types mention). Stakeholders from all over the organization may point to the data team as the obvious solution for seemingly every problem, usually without a corresponding plan of action. Eventually, the promises of analytical crystal balls and AI-powered mega-growth will fester into a hangover of huge capital investments with very little tangible return. When the other shoe finally drops it will be the data team that feels the pinch, long after the tourists having moved to whatever the next business fad may be.", "So what are some ways to guard against the boom? One is certainly to own your destiny (more on that later). Another simple trick to warn you of a potentially treacherous situation is to listen for this one word:", "Oddly enough, actionable, valuable data team work rarely includes the word \u201cdata\u201d in the description. Consider the following:", "Actionable: We need the user cohorts from salesforce, partitioned by our new RFM breakpoints, so we can re-tool our email sends before holiday hits.", "Fluff: Our sales are down because we don\u2019t have the salesforce data, so we don\u2019t have any insights.", "The actionable work has a clear strategy for how data (salesforce user cohorts) becomes information (new RFM breakpoints applied) becomes functional knowledge (update emails to improve conversion).", "Trying to make the same value path with the fluff is a lot harder because it depends on \u201cthe data\u201d to solve problems. Data doesn\u2019t solve problems or make decisions. People do those things. If the people in question do not have a plan of action in which the data can inform, the data will not be of any use to them (and neither will you).", "Many lives ago I sold motorcycles, and we had a saying at the dealership where I worked: \u201cAre you a salesperson, or an order taker?\u201d Order takers simply relayed whatever they were, blindly walking customers to the bike in that week\u2019s advertisement and reading off the price tag, filling out paperwork and seeing them off. Salespeople, on the other hand, listened to what the customer was saying, used their knowledge of the machines and the inventory, and suggested the right bike that was the best fit for them. Order takers follow orders, salespeople add value.", "The same rules apply to modern data teams. It is dangerously easy to take stakeholders at their word that populating a few Adwords data tables will be the answer to all marketing woes and will guarantee anyone with equity an early retirement. Given the complexity of our work (creating EL processes, modeling, deployment, visualization etc) we can be fooled into a false sense of security - because we are working hard at something that is hard to do, we must be doing good work, right?", "Here\u2019s where it breaks down. When you are working to deliver data products, worthless work often feels exactly like super valuable work. This means you can toil day and night, apply the most cutting-edge analysis and dive deep into data quality efforts to deliver a spectacular set of artifacts, which (by no fault of your own) may be totally without value to the business. And make no mistake, that value is how your work - and you - will be judged by the business. The shift to investing not just in work quality but also in work value is a key step for successful modern data teams.", "And so, make it a point to question your stakeholders. Implore them to help you understand the why of data work that needs to be done, and how it makes the business better. A brilliant data scientist I once worked with would use this gem for analytics/reporting work:", "Can you tell me about the decisions you are going to make based on the output of this request? Understanding those decisions will help us ensure that the (report/data/model) we build for you will fulfill your needs.", "The same type of question can be posed to productized data (\u201chow are we going to make money from this output?\u201d) and metrics (\u201cWhat organizational KPIs are tied to these metrics and how?\u201d). Most importantly, if the answer isn\u2019t something you can reasonably get behind, push back. That\u2019s right - data teams have a responsibility to make sure they are adding value even when that means (very tactfully) telling the CEO / CIO / Director of Whatever that you disagree. It is reasonable to say that the \u201cwins\u201d column of your self-evaluation needs some big victories this year, and the \u201ctop 10 products shipped this hour\u201d dashboard isn\u2019t going to get us where we want to be as an organization. You may still have to build some fluff, and shipping the occasional low-value artifact to keep the peace can be good politics. But if you find yourself constantly playing \u201corder taker\u201d when you should be a \u201csalesperson\u201d, it is time to start looking for greener pastures. No one will rush to the defense of the data team come budget season, regardless of how many low-value asks you successfully delivered, as requested, in the prior year (this is called executive amnesia).", "So far I\u2019ve skimmed through a few hard-won lessons in modern data; my hope will be to take a deeper dive from both a process and a technical angle in the coming months, and share the things that feel valuable/interesting/worthwhile along the way.", "Your home for data science.
