We\u2019re going to train an artificial neural network how to \u201cread\u201d book descriptions and guess its genre.", "Since understanding written language requires keeping track of all the words in a sentence, we need a recurrent neural network to keep a \u201cmemory\u201d of the words that have come before as it \u201creads\u201d sentences over time.", "In particular, we\u2019ll use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cells because we don\u2019t really want to \u201cforget\u201d words too quickly \u2014 words early on in a sentence can affect the meaning of that sentence significantly.", "Here are some important libraries we will need for this project \u2014 Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, Plotly and Tensorflow. We will be using Keras \u2014 something that runs on top of TensorFlow (or CNTK or Theano). Keras allows us to think less about original model topology and dive straight into easy and fast prototyping.

Remove descriptions with invalid format", "Since we are predicting the genre, the genre will be our labels and the features would come from the descriptions of each book. I have observed that there were formatting errors in some entries \u2014 this is where langdetect comes in. We will implement a function to remove any rows with invalid description format.", "I noticed that there were many languages involved in my dataset. For simplicity, I only want to get book descriptions that are in English.", "detect from langdetect allows us to map each description to a ISO 639\u20131 value to make our lives easier when filtering out english descriptions. Use it! I will then retrieve a list of languages and their respective ISO values from Wikipedia.", "Clearly from the graph, the vast majority of descriptions are in English. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the distribution of other languages.", "Retrieve all English books from our test and training dataset with these one-liners!", "This is how our genre column looks like. We have numerous user-defined genres separated by \u2018|\u2019 so we definitely have to clean that up.", "In every data science project, it is very important to know the distribution of your data and the best way to do so would be to plot graphs! I really like using Plotly for data visualisation, but matplotlib and seaborn would do the job as well.", "This is my function to get all genres for each book and plot them in a graph.", "Most books have approximately 5\u20136 genres each and pretty normally distributed I must say.", "The code above gives me a dictionary of all genres and their total count in the entire corpus. Let\u2019s get to the plot.", "It is not practical to look at those genres with very low counts since it holds little to no value to us. We will only want to look at the top unique genres that is representative of the dataset hence let us pick the top 50 genres to look at!", "If we look at the genre_list column, a book is classified as fiction if \u2018fiction\u2019 is included as at least one of its genres. By observation, if a book has at least fiction in its genre_list, all other genres in the same list will be closely associated to fiction as well. From this I can compare the number of fiction and nonfiction books in my dataset and turn this into a binary classification problem!", "Here are my functions to remove any non-Ascii characters and remove punctuations.", "and we now have a \u2018clean\u2019 description for each book!", "\"Winning will make you famous.

The book description is our predictor so we have to pay special attention! We need to ensure that every description is in the same format and length.", "Working with fixed input length improves performance during model training because this allows for the creation of fixed-shape tensors and hence more stable weights. Therefore, we will do clipping and padding \u2014 process of trimming descriptions to an optimal length and padding it with empty values if original description length is shorter than optimal length.", "How do we determine the optimal length?", "Plot the distribution of description length and observe the most \u2018common\u2019 description length.", "Wow that\u2019s a very skewed distribution! But know we know most books have description lengths lesser than 500. I want to plot the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) to observe the \u2018population of books\u2019 for every level of description length.", "About 92.7% of the records have word count below 277 words. Hence I decide to set my max threshold at 250 words. We will need a minimum threshold as well and I will set that to 6 since any description with less than 5 words is unlikely to be descriptive enough to determine the genre.", "For records where the description is less than 250 words, we will pad them with empty values, whereas for records where the description is more than 250 words, we will clip them to include just the first 250.", "The RNN reads token sequence from left to right and outputs a single prediction for whether the book is fiction or nonfiction. The memory of these tokens are passed on one by one to the final token, and thus, it is important to pre-pad the sequence instead of post-padding it. This means that the zeros are added BEFORE the token sequence and not after. There are situations where post-padding may be more effective, for example, in bi-directional networks.", "The above code filters out all descriptions with less than 6 words.", "We have 85616 unique words. Finally the last step for this clipping and padding step, tokenize each description.", "When a dataset is imbalanced, i.e., the distribution of target variable (fiction/nonfiction) is not uniform, we should make sure that the training-validation split is stratified. This ensures that the distribution of the target variable is preserved in both the training and validation datasets.", "We can also try random under-sampling to reduce number of fiction samples However, I will use stratified sampling in this case. Here\u2019s why.", "Stratified random samples are used with populations that can be easily broken into different subgroups or subsets, in our case, fiction or nonfiction. I will randomly choose record from each label in proportion to the group\u2019s size versus the population. Each record must only belong to one stratum(label) and I am certain each record is mutually exclusive since a book can only either be fiction or nonfiction. Overlapping strata would increase the likelihood that some data are included, thus skewing the sample.", "One of the many advantages stratified sampling has over random under-sampling is that because it uses specific characteristics, it can provide a more accurate representation of the books based on what is used to divide it into different subsets, also we don\u2019t have to remove any records which might be useful in our model.", "x_train and y_train will be used to train our model while x_val and y_val are used to check the validation accuracy of our model. We are aiming for a moderately high training accuracy and high validation accuracy to ensure we are not overfitting.", "Overfitting is when our model performs well at making predictions on the data they were trained on but fails to generalise on unseen data \u2014 validation data. On the other hand, under-fitting occurs when our model performs terribly even on the training data.", "An overfitted model will have high variance and low bias while an under-fitted model will have high bias and low variance.", "Our main aim is to reduce error and not bias or variance specifically so the optimal complexity is in the middle.", "At this step, our training data is only a matrix of numbers which is the necessary input into our model. As for our y labels, it is now 1 (fiction) or 0 (nonfiction).", "So to recap, we have a bunch of book descriptions that have been converted into vectors of words represented by integers, and a binary sentiment classification to learn from. RNN\u2019s can blow up quickly and to keep things manageable on our little PC we have limited the descriptions to their first 250 words. Not forgetting that this also helps in the performance improvement of our model training!", "Now let\u2019s set up our neural network model! Considering how complicated a LSTM recurrent neural network is under the hood, it\u2019s really amazing how easy this is to do with Keras.", "We will start with an Embedding layer \u2014 this is just a step that converts the input data into dense vectors of fixed size that\u2019s better suited for a neural network. You generally see this in conjunction with index-based text data like we have here. The embedding layer helps us reduce the dimensionality of the problem. If we one-hot encode the words in the vocabulary, each word will be represented by a vector the size of the vocabulary itself, which in this case is 85643. Since each sample will be a tensor of size (vocabulary x no. of tokens), i.e., (85643 x 250), the size of the layer will be too big for the LSTM to consume and it will be very resource-intensive and time-consuming for the training process. If I use embedding, my tensor size will only be 250 x 250! WAYYY smaller!", "One hot encoding will result in a huge sparse matrix while embedding gives us a dense matrix representation. The higher the embedding length, the more complex representations our model can learn since our embedding layer learns a \u201crepresentation\u201d of each word that is of a fixed length.", "Next we just have to set up a LSTM layer for the RNN itself. It\u2019s that easy. We specify 200 to match the output size of the Embedding layer, and dropout terms to avoid overfitting, which RNN\u2019s are particularly prone to. You can choose any number other than 200 by the way, it only specifies the number of hidden neurons in that layer.", "Finally we just need to boil it down to a single neuron in the last layer with a sigmoid activation function to choose our binary sentiment classification of 0 or 1.", "I will explain why I chose my hyper-parameters for the model, but if you would like to skip to the codes, feel free to skip this part!", "How many LSTM layers should we use? Speed-Complexity Tradeoff", "Usually 1 layer is enough to find trends in simple problems and 2 is sufficient to find reasonably complex features. We can compare accuracy of our model after a fixed number of epochs for a range of choices(number of layers), if we find that the validation accuracy does not change significantly even after adding more layers, we can select the minimum number of layers.", "How many hidden nodes should we add to our LSTM layers?Ns : number of samples in training dataNi : number of input neuronsNo : number of output neuronsalpha : scaling factor(Indicator of how general you want your model to be, or how much you want to prevent overfitting)", "Adding a Dropout layer. Accuracy-Overfit prevention Tradeoff", "Prevents overfitting by ignoring randomly selected neurons during training and reduces sensitivity to specific weights of individual neurons. This forces our model to spread out it learning.", "Since we have 1 output label indicating fiction or nonfiction, we will have 1 dimensional output.", "There are many activation functions to choose from so it depends on our goal.", "In this case, we want the output to be either fiction/nonfiction hence Softmax or Sigmoid functions will be good.", "Sigmoid function basically outputs probabilities, we will usually use sigmoid for binary classification.", "Softmax function output values between 0 and 1 such that the summation of all output values equals to 1. Basically you get a probability of each class whose sum is bound to be one. This makes Softmax great for multi-class problems.", "You can tune the activation layer hyper-parameter with both Sigmoid and Softmax functions and compare the validation accuracy! We could try reLU too, it is commonly used because it is fast to compute and works well.", "Choosing the loss function, optimiser and judgement metrics", "Since we are faced with a binary classification problem, binary cross-entropy will work well with Sigmoid because the cross-entropy function cancels out the plateaus at each end of the sigmoid function and therefore speeds up the learning process.", "For optimisers, adaptive moment estimation (adam), has been shown to work well in most practical applications and works well with only little changes in the hyper-parameters. r", "Judging the models\u2019 performance from an overall accuracy point of view is the easiest to interpret the resulting model performance.", "Now we will actually train our model. RNN\u2019s, like CNN\u2019s, are very resource heavy. Keeping the batch size relatively small is the key to enabling this to run on your PC at all. In the real word of course, you\u2019d be taking advantage of GPU\u2019s installed across many computers on a cluster to make this scale a lot better.", "I noticed that as my epochs goes from 3 to 5, test accuracy increases, but validation accuracy decreases. This means that the model is fitting the training set better, but it is losing the ability to predict on new data, indicating that my model is starting to fit on noise and is beginning to overfit. Let\u2019s change up the parameters!", "We achieved training accuracy of 96.4% and validation accuracy of 93.4% in only 2 epochs! That is pretty good for just 2 runs. I have tried with many different hyper-parameters and running just 10 epochs took me an hour so\u2026.", "Try it for yourself and let me know what parameters you chose to obtain a higher validation accuracy than me!", "Simple function to test our model", "\u2019In this mesmerizing sequel to the New York Times bestselling Girls of Paper and Fire, Lei and Wren have escaped their oppressive lives in the Hidden Palace, but soon learn that freedom comes with a terrible cost. Lei, the naive country girl who became a royal courtesan, is now known as the Moonchosen, the commoner who managed to do what no one else could. But slaying the cruel Demon King wasn\u2019t the end of the plan \u2014 -its just the beginning. Now Lei and her warrior love Wren must travel the kingdom to gain support from the far-flung rebel clans. The journey is made even more treacherous thanks to a heavy bounty on Leis head, as well as insidious doubts that threaten to tear Lei and Wren apart from within.Meanwhile, an evil plot to eliminate the rebel uprising is taking shape, fuelled by dark magic and vengeance.
