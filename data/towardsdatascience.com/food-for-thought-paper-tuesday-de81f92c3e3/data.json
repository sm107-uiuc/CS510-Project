I hope that my review can help you get the juiciest part of the paper under 2 minutes!", "Deep neural networks have unparalleled performance in many computer vision tasks like image classification, object segmentation, and image generation. Many people would argue that it is the millions of parameters that give the models the power to learn difficult tasks. However, there is no free lunch. If we want to train more parameters, we are simply going to need more data. Data augmentation is a way to generate new data from collected data via simple transformations. More particular, when it comes to images, people used to randomly rotate and flip images or change the brightness and hue.", "Recently, a group of researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong developed an astonishingly simple yet effective augmentation method that rivals the most complicated AutoAugment algorithm. Here\u2019s the link to the paper:", "Information dropping forces the networks to focus less on trivial details of the input data by removing pixels from images. Here\u2019s an example:", "Two problems with existing solutions such as random erasing, cutout, and Hide-and-Seek, according to the authors, are excessive deletion and reservation of continuous regions. For instance, in the image above, the second and fourth plot (from left) suffer from excessive deletion and the first one suffers from reservation of continuous regions (we want some part of the dog to be deleted, not just grass)", "The authors found a straight-forward method to better avoid the two problems \u2014 removing a mesh of blocks from images.", "The algorithm is so simple! Create a mask (the second row in the image above) and multiply it entry-wise with the original image.", "The authors demonstrated that GridMask is less likely to remove (excessive deletion) or keep 99+% (excessive reservation) of the target objects than current methods by a large margin.", "The authors also tested GridMask on standard datasets like ImageNet -1K and CIFAR10 and demonstrated the potentials of this simple algorithm.", "It is surprising to see that GridMask constantly outperforms all other information dropping methods!", "As I mentioned earlier in the post that information dropping is an effective way of regularization. GridMask turns out to be a good regularizer as well.", "Although the 1% improvement is not significant in real-life applications, but it\u2019s quite useful in data science competitions like Kaggle, in which people create gigantic ensemble models just to increase by a small margin. This paper is a reminder to all that we should spend more time exploring the simple tricks rather than engage in an \u201cArm Race\u201d in which people simply pile up more parameters.", "Your home for data science.
