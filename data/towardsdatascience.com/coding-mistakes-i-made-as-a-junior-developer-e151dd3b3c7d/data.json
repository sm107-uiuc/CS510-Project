But what they really need is someone to tell them \u2014 \u201cyou can do it!\u201d", "Below are mistakes I personally made during my first software engineering job. This should make you feel better if you\u2019re having a tough time.", "Writing good code is hard. Understanding bad code is harder. But this isn\u2019t intuitive when you\u2019re started out.", "Thankfully I had a senior developer who called me out on each of the below points more than once.", "Compressing logic into as little space as possible made me feel smart. But it also made my code unreadable. Now I always try to err on the side of readability.", "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.- Kernighan\u2019s Law", "Coming up with good variable names is surprisingly hard and I wanted to complete tickets as fast as possible.", "So I\u2019d choose the first name that popped into my head.", "Both are bad ideas and made it difficult for anyone to understand what I\u2019d written (including myself).", "This is another situation where I\u2019m thankful to an awesome senior developer who saved my code from getting hacked.", "It took a long time to build up a mental checklist of best security practises, which I now use when reviewing other developers\u2019 code.", "Spending a week on a feature and then realizing its the wrong feature is embarrassing. I\u2019ve done it more than once.", "Taking a breath, understanding the business problem, and planning code around it is a huge multiplier for engineers.", "Learning from this, I make new developers in my own startup plan out tickets in detail before beginning. This level of micro planning helps clarify thought and develop more effective solutions.", "In the beginning I commented nothing.", "Then I went through a phase where I commented every line. A method called add_two_numbers would have been commented with # adds 2 numbers. This is too much.", "In retrospect, the right amount of commenting didn\u2019t click until I\u2019d read enough code written by other developers, and noticed where I wished they had added comments.", "Some frameworks autogenerate a lot of unnecessary files. You also don\u2019t know all the existing code when you start working on an app.", "Anecdotally, I\u2019ve found the best way to avoid these problems is walking through code you\u2019ve written in detail before submitting it for review.", "I knew zero about databases when I started my first job. It probably took me a year before I figured out database indices.", "In that time I wrote a lot of N+1 queries, and created db tables to store large amounts of data without indices.", "Both are recipes for an annoyingly slow app.", "Conditional if/else statements are a core part of software.", "In pseudocode, they typically look like this.", "But the first app I wrote for my portfolio was filled with logic like this.", "Sometime we need to rescue an error, like when hitting an unreliable API. But this should be the exception rather than the norm.", "One of the first things I learned was to not combine multiple features in the same pull request. It\u2019s not nice to the person reviewing code.", "Going beyond a couple hundred lines can make it difficult for others to mentally walk through different paths of execution.", "Sometimes this is the result of poorly scoped tickets. So I always tell new developers to push back if they think a ticket could be further broken down into sub tickets. Smaller is better.", "Learning to write software is hard. There\u2019s a hundred moving pieces that you can only learn by doing.", "I hope that reading about my fumbles makes you feel better if you\u2019re struggling yourself.", "What helped me the most was having a senior developer give detailed feedback on every piece of code I submitted. Find a company/team where you get that. It\u2019s the fastest way to improve.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Just a developer.
