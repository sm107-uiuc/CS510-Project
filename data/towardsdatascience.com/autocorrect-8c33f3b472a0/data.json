The number of times I\u2019ve gone to type a message and it would come out as if I am drunk then autocorrect intercedes on my behalf \u2014 Oh, how I love you autocorrect (sometimes).", "To define Autocorrect more formally, it is a software function that suggests or makes corrections for spelling or grammatical errors automatically whilst we type.", "We all use autocorrect, but this post will teach you how it works. However, in these notes, we will only be covering spelling errors and not contextual errors. For example, \u201cHappy Birthday my deah Friend!\u201d contains the misspelled word \u201cdeah\u201d which autocorrect would hopefully identify and change to \u201cdear\u201d (given our model is accurate). On the other hand, \u201cHappy Birthday my deer Friend!\u201d would not be considered an error since \u201cdeer\u201d is an actual word (It is an animal) which is not correct in a contextual sense unless your friend is actually a deer.", "Note: Catching contextual errors is a more sophisticated problem and will be covered in the future.", "There are 4 key steps to building an autocorrect model that corrects spelling errors:", "#1: Identify Misspelled word \u2014 Given our previous example, how would we know the word \u201cdeah\u201d is spelled incorrectly? If a word is spelled correctly then the word would be found in a dictionary and if it is not then it is probably a misspelled word. Therefore, when a word is not given in a dictionary then we would flag it for correction.", "#2: Find Strings n edit distance away \u2014 An edit is an operation that is performed on a string to transform it into another string, and n is simply the edit distance (i.e. an edit distance of 1, 2, 3, etc) which counts the number of edit operations. Therefore, the n edit distance tells us how many operations away one string is from another. Here are the different types of edits:", "With these 4 edits, we are capable of modifying any string. And the combination of these edits allows us to find a list of all possible strings that are n edits away.", "Note: For autocorrect, n is usually 1\u20133 edits.", "#3: Filter Candidates \u2014 We only want to consider correctly spelled real words from our candidate list so we compare the words to a known dictionary (like in #1) and filter out the words in our candidate list that do not appear in the known dictionary.", "#4: Calculate Word Probabilities \u2014 With our list of actual words, we can calculate word probabilities and find the most likely word from our candidates. This requires we know word frequencies and the total number of words in the corpus.", "Given the formula in Figure 1, we can image a corpus made of the sentence \u201cI am happy because I am learning\u201d, we first take the word counts\u2026", "then we apply our formula to calculate the word probability (we will use \u201cI\u201d for our example)\u2026", "When performing autocorrect, we must find the word candidate that has the highest probability and select that word to be the replacement.", "Above we saw how to apply autocorrect using edit distance, however, when we are given multiple words or whole documents, we can also use minimum edit distance to evaluate how similar they are. In fact, there are numerous situations in which minimum edit distance may be applied, for example:", "Minimum edit distance \u2192 The lowest number of operations required to transform one string into another.", "To calculate minimum edit distance, we use 3 types of edit calculations of which we have already discussed. These 3 edits are insert, delete, and replace \u2014 See Figure 4 for an example of minimum edit distance.", "The total number of edits in Figure 4 is 2 given we consider all edit operations to cost the same. However, by adjusting the cost of each edit we can calculate the edit cost, which is what we are trying to minimize, by summing the cost of each edit that was made \u2014 see Figure 5 for updated edit cost.", "For our example, in Figure 4 our revised edit cost would be 4. This was pretty easy and we could have worked this out visually. However, if we had much longer strings or large corpora of text there would be much more operations and wouldn\u2019t be as simple. We can try to overcome this with brute force by adding one added distance at a time and enumerating for all possibilities until one string is transformed into another. However, this may potentially take an unnecessarily long time.", "Note: Solving this way increases computational complexity exponentially, as each string grows in length.", "A faster way to do this is with dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is a known feat in computer science and refers to the simplification of a complicated problem by breaking it down into easier sub-problems. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to a polynomial (Source: GeeksToGeeks).", "Note: To go into Dynamic Programming in depth is beyond the scope of this post, but you may read up more on wikipedia.", "Given our edit cost from Figure 6, the first task with our matrix D is to fill D[0, 0] of which we go from an empty string in our source to the empty string in our target. This is pretty obvious, the number of edits to reach this would be 0 since they are the same.", "In fact, filling the first row and column is quite intuitive because we simply add the cost of a delete to the previous cell \u2014 see Figure 7.", "This can be expressed mathematically as shown in Figure 8.", "Now let\u2019s apply this formula to our example in Figure 7 to with the updated edit cost. Remember we said earlier that the answer is 4, and we worked this out visually because we have fairly simple strings. To determine the minimum edit distance we will see the number of operations that occurs in the D[m, n] (Bottom right corner) of our matrix \u2014 if we do it correctly, it should be 4.", "As you can see the matrix agree that 4 is the minimum edit distance to convert State to Stain. I also added some colour to the matrix just to highlight the interesting patterns.", "Note: I personally did not understand this after repeating the video numerous times. A video on Youtube called Minimum Edit Distance Dynamic Programming helped me clear this up.", "To measure edit distance, we assign our 3 edits: insert, delete, and replace, with edit cost, 1, 1, 2 which is known respectively as the Levenshtein distance, which is not the only method but is what we used in our example. It is also important we keep a backtrace, or simply, a pointer in each cell in order to allow us to track how we arrived at our minimum edit distance.", "Thank you for reading to the end.
