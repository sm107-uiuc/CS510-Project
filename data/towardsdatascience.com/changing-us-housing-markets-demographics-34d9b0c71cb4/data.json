Many in Generation X and Millennials saw their accumulated equity vanish. Those close to or in retirement witnessed one of their most trusted assets, their property, fall off a precipice. Across all age groups, people suffered financial difficulties. Those were able to afford a new property or retain owned assets saw substantial gains in the last decade, not only recovering to pre-crash highs but in some areas doubling or even tripling in value. Meanwhile, a perfect storm of debt, a dwindling number early career jobs that pay a livable wage, and increases to costs of living have changed the homeownership prospects for many. A recent analysis found a 52% majority of 18\u201329 year olds are living with their parents, which may be partially attributed to confluence of higher education being remote, the continued rise of remote work, and large layoffs across different industries. In this article, I will demonstrate how the percentage of owner occupancy and renting has changed between 2010\u20132018 in different age groups and generational categories. The data is publicly available from the American Community Survey. All scripts and the data used is available on the project GitHub. This project is a follow up to my previous conjectures about aging in place.", "The original data is a compilation of percentage values across time of owner occupancy and renting separated by age demographics. In this study, we explore the change of percentages over time as well as the change by generational category. The four generational categories are Silent Generation, Boomer, Generation X, and Millennials.", "To create the animation the package celluloid was deployed to record multiple seaborn plots. Celluloid can be installed in Python using pip.", "In simple terms, we take a picture of each graph generated during a for loop. After our loop we stitch together these images into a video or gif.", "There is a lot to interpret in this graphic. First from 2010 until 2018, the group with the biggest change is 64\u201374 years old Owner Occupants with an overall increase in percentage of 4.4%. Owner Occupants 45 to 54 years old had the largest decline over the same period with -4.0%. The gains in the Owner Occupants 54 to 64 years old of 1.1% may be a result of owner occupants aging into a new category. All categories below and including 45 to 54 year olds saw a cumulative decrease in percentage in both renting and owner occupancy. Younger people (Under 35 & 34 to 44 years old) are experiencing a slight increase in percent ownership in 2017 and 2018 (+0.3% and +0.2% respectively).", "How do these numbers play out by generational category?", "Members of the Silent Generation and Boomers see an increase in their percent of owner occupancy across the time period at the expense of Generation X and Millennials. The code and additional gifs (Delta by Year) can be found on the GitHub.", "In my prior article, I conjecture that given the current pandemic and economic uncertainty many near or in retirement are choosing to age in place. The expansion in the owner occupancy category for the older generations represents evidence supporting this assertion even before the pandemic. What is surprising in this data is the decrease of Generation X across both renting and owner occupancy percentages. While Millennials are moving into their parents at a record rate, it is unclear where members of Generation X are going in the ownership/rental percentages.
