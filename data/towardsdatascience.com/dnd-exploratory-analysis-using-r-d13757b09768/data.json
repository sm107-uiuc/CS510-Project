We will cover from 2D to 3D visualizations and we will do this by using DnD data from the github repository of Burak Ogan. I made some data reduction out of the initial data set which had 768 classes and 182 races to 13 predominant classes and 16 predominant races for facilitating data visualization and manipulation.", "Before going into the details of the analysis here is a quick introduction.", "D&D is a rolling dice game that works usually based on a set of 7 dice (d4,d6,d8,d10,d12,d20 and another d10). Dice play an important role in the game and they are all used with different aims. For example a d20 is usually used in attacks while d4,d6,d8,d10 or d12 are used for weapons damage depending on the weapon,character and a few other variables. But also dice are also used when setting the scores of a character.", "This makes the data that we are gonna be analyzing random and discrete by definition due to it is obtained through calculations based on rolling a dice and therefore even when in this sample of data may show some patterns this doesn't mean that these patterns are set for being repeated in other samples(due in part of the randomness concept mentioned before). And that is one of the best and most interesting characteristics of DnD.", "Every DnD character is unique in their own way, there are different classes and races that you can choose from and basically the player is the one who can make the most or the least out the character skills(read: ability scores). Players can decide to choose between predefined characters or create their own. When creating a new character one chooses the class and race and rolls the dice to define the different abilities with also adding bonuses or subtracting penalties when required (this changes depending on the case). Similarly, other features like Hit Points (HP), Armour Class (AC) and others are defined using die rolling and bonuses noted in the player handbook.", "Here is a hyperlink to different sections of the article so you can jump straight to the section that you are interested in.", "2.1 Circular plot classes vs races", "Using dplyr,tidyr and ggplot2 I created a histogram for all the numeric variables of the dataset.", "This is a really good mix because while ggplot2 offers a powerful graphics language, tidyverse allows us to process the data and dplyr allows us to use a pipe operator %>% to connect data operations from left to right instead of creating intermediate objects.", "After wise I did a correlation matrix to measure if there was any degree of correlation between the variables. This showed that all variables have a positive correlation between each other but the strength of the relationship sits on 0.4 which can not be classified as significant. Anything below 0.6 means the relationship is not even moderate positive.", "This makes sense due to the DnD scores are obtained through dice rolling which constitute independent events. And If two random variables X and Y are independent, then they are also uncorrelated. However for other cases it\u2019s important to take into consideration that if X and Y are uncorrelated they can still be dependent.", "Even when for this case we are just handling discrete variables it seemed to me as a good idea to showcase how to identify in a quick and dirty way the distribution of a dataset.", "For this purpose the fitdistrplus package was chosen. The fitdistr function in this package allow us to estimate distribution parameters by maximizing the likelihood function.", "Due to our stats are obtained from rolling dice it makes sense that they tend to a normal distribution, following the central limit theorem.", "For this one we will keep using ggplot2 along with tidyverse and dplyr as we did before but we will include this time polar coordinates so we can make it into a circular barplot. Which to me is a nice way of displaying the information between classes and races.", "Boxplot diagrams work like a really good way of describing the center and spread of a distribution(variability.)", "By using with the same libraries we can make a boxplot by individual variable.", "And then we can replicate the exercise by groups or predominant classes for the main variables: AC,HP and Con.", "Lastly I thought it would be good to bring out the facet wrap functionality of ggplot which is really useful when you want to do split up your data by one or more variables(groups or classes in our case) and plot the subsets of data together.", "Finally even when 3D plotting is just advisable when we have actual 3D objects or data mapped onto them. I think for this specific case where we have multiple discrete variables with points overlapping in 2D it makes sense to have a 3D plotting to increase perspective.", "To show this i will plot the 2D scatter of Con vs AC with ggplot and then a 3D scatter of AC, Con and HP with scatterplot3d which allows us to plot a three dimensional (3D) point cloud.", "For creating the 3d scatter plot animations we will use the rgl and magick packages.", "rgl works by calling different functions. Here is what each of them does. Movie3d calls a function in a repeated way recording each frame into a movie while Play3d only works for displaying the visualization into R. In this case the function to be passed to R is spin3d.", "As regards to the legend, rgl has a bit of a trouble when you have several classes it is 2D and goes by default at the back of the graph so depending of the number of classes you have it could be difficult to fit.", "As a last step with magick I created a png by class in a loop using the scatterplot3d function with the addition of some overlaying points through the points3d function and then I joined them into a gif using the image_join function of magick. This takes us to the initial gif and the end of the article.", "So that is all from a board game enthusiast. I hope the analysis have been fun to read how it was to write . It\u2019s always fun to do data analyses about non-traditional topics like tabletop games.", "Your home for data science.
