I found four mistakes that are very common among engineers and executives. In this article, I describe 4 common mistakes to build an ML product with several examples from the context of a wearable technology company.", "Once, I led the machine intelligence team at a wearable technology company. The company built a gesture control armband that lets users control their environments using their hand gestures. We developed a gesture recognition engine that takes muscle signals as inputs and recognizes the hand gestures.", "We had to build and evaluate a large list of ML models to build an industry-grade ML product. Therefore, we built a pipeline that properly administers all the development steps required to build an ML product including data collection, model training, model evaluation, or model selection.", "We successfully shipped an ML product to more than a hundred thousand users all around the world. We were not able to do that unless we implemented the best practices in development of an ML product.", "Here, I share 4 potential mistakes to build an ML product along with some suggestions to work around them. I found these mistakes common in many other teams that I worked on afterward.", "One of the common mistakes to build an ML product is to insist on building a single end-to-end model to address all scenarios. An ML product can barely be shipped by a single ML model. One of the reasons is that use cases have more differences than what you usually expect.", "Mistake I \u2014 From the early days, I insist to build a single end-to-end ML model and address all the use cases through that model.", "In the early days, we aimed to build a gesture recognition model for seven billion people all around the world. You can guess. It did not work as well as we planned. So, we soon started looking into the raw muscle signals to obtain better insights.", "We found that the patterns or features that we expected for each gesture were not consistent among users. In other words, we found individuals have more differences than what we thought in the early days and a single ML model may not work for everyone. For example, we found that individuals have different muscle anatomy, skin conductivity, perspiration rate, forearm perimeter, and gesture styles. But what is the alternative solution?", "We could have assigned individuals into similar groups, for example, based on their forearm perimeters, and build a specific model for each group. This approach could significantly improve model performances. However, it could not create the user experience that we wanted to deliver. Then, we took another approach. We decided to create only two options for our users: the \u201cpopulation model\u201d that was built in the company using our training dataset and the \u201cpersonalized model\u201d that was built by users through their own data.", "You must thoroughly evaluate the performance of an ML model before each release. Therefore, it is important to collect a valid test dataset soon in the process. On the other hand, a valid test dataset must be a true representation of the user data. However, you do not know your users well enough; especially during the early days. So, you do not know how, where, or by whom your products are used. Therefore, you must always be doubtful whether your test dataset can truly represent user data.", "Mistake II \u2014 I do not have time to carefully design the data collection protocols. I will only spend my time on training a complex model.", "Our analysis showed that parameters such as \u201cforearm perimeter\u201d or \u201cskin condition\u201d significantly affect the model performance. We could measure forearm perimeters from individuals at scale but it was hard to measure their skin conditions. Therefore, we sufficiently collected data holding a normal distribution in the forearm perimeter while we could not do the same for the skin condition. Note that we measured the skin condition using a conductivity meter for a small group of users for analysis but nothing more.", "Regardless, we were not aware of the distribution of forearm perimeters or skin conditions in our users. If we had a large number of users, we could assume that it must be a normal distribution. However, we did not have that many users at that time. So, we were certain that the distribution is definitely skewed. That means we could just guestimate how a new release affects the user experience. Since we could not 100% sure about the quality of releases, we must always have a contingency plan.", "You can simply evaluate an academic 2-class machine learning problem with standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Nevertheless, you can not evaluate an ML product that easily. For example, an ML product is often a multi-class problem with problem-specific configurations each of which introduces some complexities to the evaluation framework. One of the common mistakes to build an ML product is to evaluate an ML product with standard performance metrics.", "Mistake III \u2014 I do not need problem-specific metrics. I can use standard metrics to evaluate an ML product.", "We designed an ML model to identify 5 hand gestures, i.e., Left, Right, Fist, Spread, and Snap. We evaluated the performance of ML models in each class with 3 standard parameters, i.e., accuracy, precision, recall. Therefore, we had 15 (3\u00d75) performance metrics to consider. These 15 parameters were not equally important. For example, the false positive in class Fist or Snap has different consequences on the user experience in use case A. Plus, use cases had also their own differences. In short, we had to create problem-specific metrics to ensure releasing a new ML model given all of the complexities.", "\u201cIf we collect more data, our model becomes better. Right?\u201d I am sure you heard this sentence many times. But the reality is the model performance does not necessarily improve by feeding more data. That is why you must archive the models along with their performance reports in a library for the sake of future purposes. For example, you may want to retrieve them to conduct a comparative analysis or to deploy them in production.", "To build an ML product, you must frequently build ML models while the model performance does not necessarily and consistently improve in each build. Therefore, you must store models along with their important metadata such as performance metrics and hyperparameters. This helps you run a deeper analysis of the results if needed. You must also store train and test data next to models to ensure that you can reiterate the previous experiments if needed.", "You can build this library of models in a cloud storage solution such as Amazon S3, a universal artifact management solution such as JFrog, or in a compartment provided by a continuous integration solution such as CircleCI. The best practice is to use an artifact management solution that creates better access to the list of stored ML models. Note that you may want to search through this collection using a query on performance. You can not do this if models are stored in file-based storage such as Amazon S3.", "Mistake IV \u2014 I do not need to archive the ML models. If we collect more data, our model becomes better. Why should I spend time creating an infrastructure?", "Just imagine you are a machine intelligence lead at a company. In the past several months, you have worked hard to design an ML model with a list of requirements. A deadline reaches and, unexpectedly, you are told that the company needs an ML model with different requirements. You do not have time to do all the training and testing again. What you must do is to run a query on the model library and extract the one which has the closest performance to the new requirements. Can you respond properly to this situation if you do not have this library ready?", "If you like this post and want to support me\u2026", "Your home for data science.
