Once we are used to coding in a certain way, we tend to use the same functions over and over again, even when there may be a much better way. And, as per the Zen of Python, there should be only one \u2014 and preferably only one \u2014 obvious way to do it!", "More often than I would like to admit, I have fallen in this trap as well. For example getting too used to for loops, using prints too often instead of logs and the list goes on. That is definitely not the Pythonic way to do it. You can always refresh your knowledge about being Pythonic, i.e. writing clear, concise and easy to maintain codes and much more here:", "Over a period, the following 7 functionalities became my favorites to use because of their simplicity and an inherent elegance. If you haven\u2019t till now, you should definitely try to use them whenever possible.", "Python 3.6 came up with a brilliant way to format strings known as f-strings (formatted string literals). Before f-strings in Python 3, we could do it in any of the following two ways:", "As we can see, the readability of the code is totally screwed up. As is the case with str.format() below.", "This is in no way better that the first. Fortunately, we have Python 3 f-strings to the rescue. Here is how they work:", "As simple as that! And boy, do we have readability. To top it all, since f-strings are evaluated at runtime, you can do a whole range of things including other functions and methods. Have a look here:", "I know there are conservative python pundits out there who would quote the Zen of Python and say that f-strings are un-pythonic as there should be only one obvious way to do things. And, in this case there are two. But practicality beats purity and readability counts. I have now found just one obvious way to do it, that\u2019s f-strings!", "2. Lists and Dictionaries (Packing, Unpacking)", "Lists and dictionaries are two of the most used objects in python, especially if you are into data wrangling and analysis. They are also that much confusing to use. It is extremely important to use them in a lean way. In this case, we unleash the power of * and ** as the important arguments associated with lists and dictionaries for creating functions.", "Now let\u2019s check out how unpacking works for the above:", "As you see, it naturally considers the list as one positional argument. In order to do this correctly you use a * before the list and voila:", "Similarly, for dictionaries, it is **.", "It must be noted that the dictionary keys are matched with the function, if the keys were different, you would get an error.", "Let us see how packing works. For lists we can use pack arguments (args) with a *. In the same way, for dictionaries we use ** to pack key word arguments (kwargs).", "As you can notice, packing and unpacking of lists and dictionaries is exceptionally easy and can simplify your code a lot!", "I know it sounds like the latest trending fashion, but in Python it is way cooler. Did you know that Python allows you to create classes on the go with \u2018type\u2019? Here is how it is done and it is more awesome than you can imagine:", "which is exactly the same as:", "Of course, I have simplified the example here for your easier understanding of the great power of dynamic classes. You can really create advanced classes with ease using this functionality.", "I cannot enumerate the number of times I have been thankful to the python gods for creating this. It tests a code block and allows us to handle errors in a simple and effective way!", "When your code becomes larger, it becomes pertinent that you use this more often along with the logging functionality. In any case, never do the following:", "The Python Gods will never forgive you for that!", "This is a nifty little trick that has more benefits than it appears to have and a bigger potential for errors if not followed correctly than you initially imagine. Here is a code sample to make you see what I mean:", "You see, the list gets appended every time you use this function. Instead, you should use a default value denoting \"not indicated\" and replace with the mutable you'd like as default:", "Trust me, knowing how to use mutable default arguments beforehand will save you a lot of painful hours of debugging!", "I vaguely remember that when I learned Java, the basics that we were introduced to swapping values was to create a third temporary variable.", "a = 1, b =2. Wanna swap values? Create a temporary variable c. Then c = a, a = b and b = c. How annoying! Here\u2019s how it would look in Java:", "Well, we have python tuples to the rescue. Why create a third variable when we can swap them in place!", "It is not a huge deal, but sometimes, knowing the simple basics can help us a lot in the long run.", "7. Replace white spaces with braces?", "Yes, folks, you heard that right! All belonging to Java Camp out there, we know you hate the delimiting blocks that are spaces and would love to have those curly brackets. Finally, there is a way:", "Once you run the above, you get", "Gotcha! That\u2019s never gonna happen. So long suckers!", "Excuse me for delineating and starting this subsection with an Easter Egg, I couldn\u2019t help myself.", "But the __future__ module is more helpful than you might imagine. For real this time! It helps in compatibility with latest versions of python. Take for example here:", "If you are using Python 2.7", "Now, you can import the print function from the latest Python version.", "The future module has a whole range of functions included. You can check it out here:", "That\u2019s it folks! The listing above contains only a few of the many elegant functionalities available in Python. I hope you found them useful, your coding peers will definitely find your code easier to review if you apply these.", "Your home for data science.
