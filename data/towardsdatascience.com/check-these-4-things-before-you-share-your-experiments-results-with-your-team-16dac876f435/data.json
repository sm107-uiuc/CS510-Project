But through that I\u2019ve collected a checklist of some common pitfalls in analysis, whether of experiments (A/B tests) or observational data.", "That mouthful just means you see an effect that is an average of different effects for different populations of users. For example, maybe the new version of your website is much better at converting men than women: The conversion rate for males is 23% higher than it used to be, while it is slightly worse (-2%) for females. But if your website\u2019s audience is made of 80% women, you will think the new version was a good idea: The average conversion rate is up 3%. In reality, most of your users like it slightly less, and it is only better for a small segment of users.", "To avoid this, there is often no other way but segmenting your users by whatever dimensions you\u2019ve collected (e.g demographics, geography, devices, etc.) and looking for major differences in effect size between groups. However, if you overdo this, you need to be careful of multiple comparisons (essentially, discovering non-existing effects by random).", "In some cases though, you can test for this more directly by plotting the distribution of effects: What % of users experienced what effect from the treatment they were assigned. For instance, when measuring a repeat activity like \u201cAverage number of days the user visits your service in a month\u201d, you can check whether an experiment shifted everyone up by 3% (Orange line) or whether there was an average effect of +3% but a wide distribution of actual effects, with some users hurt by the change (Purple). Then, try and figure out what differentiates these users.", "A related issue I check for is when plotting data over time. One of the worse errors is an incorrect trend: If the data is \u201cdirectionally\u201d correct but wrong by a constant (so, you think something\u2019s up when it\u2019s up, just not as up as you think), that\u2019s usually okay for most business decisions. But when you think something is down when it\u2019s up, you might turn off a successful activity or lean into a harmful one!", "Mix shifts occur when there is both a heterogenous effect (so two or more groups have different outcomes, e.g retention rates) and over time one group is growing as a proportion of the total. This creates a false trend over time coming in from the shift in the populations rather than the shift in behaviour. In the example above, if your website started churning its women users (who\u2019ve had a worse experience after the change we made), you\u2019d think the overall conversion rate is improving \u2014 when really it\u2019s just the remaining men who are converting better, not an overall improvement in the success of the business.", "A very subtle topic but a reality of online experimentation is that sometimes we separate out when we log that a person was randomly assigned an experimental group, and when their actual experience changes. Here\u2019s an example: On an e-commerce website, I might have an experiment where half the users who log in will receive a 10% discount upon checkout, and half won\u2019t. Naively, I may divide the user population into the two experimental groups, A and B, the minute they entered the website, and log this in our database. Then, I run an analysis about which groups, A or B, had a higher checkout rate, and compute the power of the experiment \u2014 essentially making sure I had enough users go through the experiment to draw a statistically significant conclusion about its effect. Right?", "Well, almost. The thing is, I logged which experimental group users were on when they first visit the website. But a large portion of them (say, 90%), don\u2019t even end up buying anything. So they actually don\u2019t see the coupon \u2014 they have the exact same experience as the control group that didn\u2019t get a coupon at all. As a result, of course, their buying behaviour doesn\u2019t change. But the math behind computing the power of the experiment is misleading here: We\u2019re diluting the effect of the experiment with a lot of people who didn\u2019t buy regardless of the coupon. As a result, we end up thinking the experiment was ineffective, or not get to our desired level of statistical significance, and ditch it. This is \u2018overexposure\u2019 \u2014 you\u2019re registering people into the experiment who didn\u2019t actually get the treatment.", "In the rarer, converse case we might be exposing the user before logging he was on an experimental group \u2014 this could happen in complex setups where, for instance, we only logged the exposure when they actually checked out, not when they first saw the coupon in their cart \u2014 and as a result we underexpose and also dilute the effect of our experiment (or worse, can arrive at the wrong conclusion if the exposure is correlated with some behaviour).", "The bottom line is to always make sure you are clear on where did the user first encounter any possible effect of the experiment, and logging their inclusion in an experimental group (or control) only then.", "We know we can incorrectly discover an effect (as XKCD so well put in an experiment testing for the link between different coloured jelly beans and acne). But we can also miss an effect that\u2019s there because our experiment is underpowered (It\u2019s extremely hard to discover something you did improved conversion rates by 0.1%, because that usually requires hundreds of thousands of users). And while a 0.1% improvement is not in general critical for the success of the business and we shouldn\u2019t focus on it, 0.1% degradations happen all the time, are hard to catch, and will accrue. Here\u2019s an example: Imagine we\u2019re a growth team experimenting with various parts of our app, and many of these tests have great outcomes on our daily active users.", "But, we\u2019re not silly \u2014 we also check for effects on long term retention. If an experiment had a statistically significant negative effect on retention, we would reject it. However, long term retention is a noisy metric with less users and less power to measure it with, and the effects are often subtler. They often pan out slightly negative or slightly positive on average, but with confidence intervals that mean they are statistically insignificant: We can\u2019t be certain they\u2019re negative. Many of them might, though. We might be unknowingly accruing small, negative effects on retention. Hence, \u2018death by a thousand (statistically insignificant) cuts\u2019 (coined by a colleague at Facebook).", "The main way to protect against this is with a long term holdout. A long-term holdout is a set of users who don\u2019t receive any new experiments even as these are rolled out to the rest of the user population. You can then measure the effect of all the other experiments taken together on the long-term holdout and see whether the other users\u2019 experience diverged significantly from the holdout \u2014 essentially the holdout is a control for the effect of many experiments together.", "I wondered why it took me years into my career to learn of these, and it turns out they just don\u2019t happen in classic experimentation, where all participants are usually put in a room together at once, treated, and then never seen again after the outcome is measured. Hence, all the literature about experiments usually skips over these considerations. But if you\u2019re doing online A/B testing, then keeping a small % of users on a \u2018permanent control group\u2019, looking at the distribution of treatment effects and not just the average treatment effect, fixing cohorts when you look at treatment effects over time and double checking your assignment and exposure logging are simultaneous will help you avoid many of the common pitfalls.", "Your home for data science.
