Scott used this approach to learn the entire MIT undergrad computer science coursework in a single year (it usually takes four) and pass all of the exams.", "Ultralearning: A strategy for acquiring skills and knowledge that is both self-directed and intense.", "Scott has 9 principles of Ultralearning. In this article, I will highlight a few of the most relevant ones (Metalearning, Focus, Directness, Feedback, and Experimentation) for your study of data science. If you want to learn about the rest (Drill, Retrieval, Retention, and Intuition), I highly recommend reading the book. This article goes nicely with my Stages of Learning Data Science Article (link), so if you enjoy this one you may want to read that one afterwards.", "The first principle in the book is called metalearning. This is what sets the groundwork for your learning journey. You should take the time to get a broad understanding of the field and to create a learning roadmap. Scott suggests that you should actually spend up to 10% of your total learning time on this step.", "First, you should think about what exactly you want to achieve. Do you want to build a specific app using data science? Do you want to learn enough data science to get a job? Here, the more specific you can be, the better.", "Next, you should start to map a learning path to get to this destination. I look at this very similarly to building out your own curriculum for a self study course.", "At its foundation, data science is just a combination of programming and math. I have made a few videos to help you with where and how to learn these concepts: How to Learn Math for Data Science & How to Learn Programming for Data Science.", "I would also recommend looking online for data science course curriculums. Most universities post these online, and you can see what classes or concepts these schools are recommending that students take. From this, you can figure out what concepts you need to learn to meet your specific learning goal.", "After you have a learning path, you need to find a way to sit down and actually do the work.", "This isn\u2019t specific to data science, but focus is a valuable skill to learn. That\u2019s right, focus is a learned skill not something that you are born with. There are two main components, building up your ability to focus and limiting distractions.", "To build up your focus, you should dedicate time for work without distractions. This is a concept that Cal Newport talks about in his book Deep Work. When you schedule work time and you stick to that schedule, you are training your brain. Young also recommends the Pomodoro technique in which you work for 25 minutes and break for 5. Scheduling your break-time was a huge break-through for me.", "To limit distractions, I recommend controlling your environment. Having a dedicated space where you work is a great first step. Your phone is probably the biggest distraction that you own, so leaving it in a different room and turning off notifications on your computer will do wonders for your ability to focus.", "This is my favorite principle by far. It suggests that you should just dive in and start doing the actual activity you are striving to learn. When you get your hands dirty with a real world data science project, you almost immediately understand your own shortcomings. I constantly recommend projects, and I maintain that they are the most efficient way to learn data science.", "When starting out on a new project, I usually work until I get stuck on something. Once I do, I open a few Google tabs, learn about the area I was struggling with, and figure out how to apply it back to my project. This approach guarantees that you are learning exactly what you need to complete the project at hand. Sometimes we get stuck because we are trying to learn too much to solve our problems. Narrowing things down and being direct can help us make our learning process more efficient.", "Directness can be extremely intimidating. You will struggle and be frustrated with the things that you don\u2019t know. That is completely normal and part of being a data scientist in general. This feeling doesn\u2019t go away, even when you have progressed far into this field.", "This can be scary and uncomfortable, but it is extremely important. Data science is nice because there are many clear feedback sources. With programming, you get an error most times you do something wrong. You should read these errors carefully because they usually give you a hint about what is going wrong. I also recommend using Google and Stack Overflow to debug code. You can usually just copy and paste your error messages into the browser to find out how other people solved the same problem you are facing.", "Another way to get valuable feedback is to ask for it via social platforms. Kaggle and Reddit are both great for this. There are many data science beginner forums that are awesome for building communities that promote constructive feedback.", "Usually the best feedback comes from an expert. You can ask data scientists in your network, professors, or other people who have done similar projects for feedback on yours. I find that this type of help is the most difficult to get, but can help you improve the most.", "Experimentation can take your data science work from good to great. When we learn the field, we generally only use a single approach to solving each problem. In truth, there are many different approaches to analyze each project. When you experiment, you look at the same problems from different angles. This helps you to figure out which approach is best for the task at hand.", "When you experiment, you often have to actually forget some of the things that you knew before. If you only have a hammer, everything is a nail. If you lose your hammer, you will need to find unique ways to build. Some of these different ways could save you time/computing resources and could actually produce better results.", "Experimenting helps you to stretch your understanding of concepts and to approach a higher level of learning.", "Hopefully these principles will help you look at your data science learning journey in a new light. I wish I could have started my own learning process with these in mind. Again, I recommend reading this book if you would like to explore all of these principles in more depth.", "*The link to Ultralearning at the top is an amazon affiliate link.
