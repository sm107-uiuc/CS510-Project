But, it can act as a double-edged sword if not used properly. From \u2018Sampling Biases\u2019 to \u2018False Causality\u2019 (Correlation does not imply causation), there are numerous fallacies that may encompass Data and Analytics. \u2018How Not to Be Wrong\u2019, \u2018How to Lie with Statistics\u2019, and \u2018Innumeracy\u2019 are some of the good reads that educate us on such fallacies. Watch out for these when interpreting the data.", "Consider this scenario. It\u2019s a Friday night and you are planning to watch a movie. It comes down to two movies. Movie P and Movie X. You decide to check the reviews. Movie P says 90% of the users liked it. Movie X has 82% on the same metric. You decide to go with Movie P, because, obviously! But, what if you get further information that Movie P was rated by only 10 users and the movie X by 10000 users. Will that change your decision? Probably! The examples can go on. The point is that you need to watch out for such inconsistencies when analyzing data even in simple everyday decisions like deciding a movie to making more complex decisions such as what career to choose or which city to move to. Always be curious to dig deeper! Now let\u2019s try to understand one such fallacy.", "Before we get into the technical definition of Simpson\u2019s paradox, let\u2019s go back to November 2016 and try to remember the US Presidential Election. Do you remember how Donald J. Trump won the election beating Hillary Clinton? Okay. Now, let\u2019s drill down deeper into the total number of votes (popular vote) and their percentage share.", "Look at the table below with the percent share of the popular vote of each state. The states listed on the left are the states with a higher Republican (REP) vote share and the states on the right are states with higher Democratic (DEM) vote share. If we glanced at it, we see almost 30 states with Republicans majority and about 20 with Democratic majority. We\u2019d conclude that the Republicans (red color) clearly have the higher popular vote, right? Don\u2019t think so? Keep scrolling!", "Maybe looking at the following map will help! The red-colored states have a Republican majority and the blue ones have a Democratic majority. The majority is decided based on a higher popular vote for that state. In congruence with the above voting table, the below map reinforces our initial belief that the voting share is higher for Republicans (Red states).", "Now, let\u2019s look at the actual total popular vote.", "Yes, Hillary Clinton had a higher popular vote than Donald Trump. This phenomenon of trend reversal when the data is aggregated is basically Simpson\u2019s paradox. The key to avoiding such issues in the analysis is to look for inconsistencies or missing data. In this case, the voting population (sample size) of each state.", "Simpson\u2019s paradox, which also goes by several other names, is a phenomenon in probability and statistics, in which a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined.", "Alas! They use \u2018Electoral vote\u2019 instead of \u2018popular vote\u2019 to decide the winner!", "If this got you intrigued, read more about Simpson\u2019s paradox in this published paper or here at Stanford\u2019s Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
