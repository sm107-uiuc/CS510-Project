Before I begin I would like to outline the data science process:", "I was tasked with creating a machine learning model to predict the price of a home using Kaggle\u2019s Ames Housing data set. Wanting to make the data science problem more realistic, I added the need to improve Zillow\u2019s Zestimate accuracy (star rating) for areas like Ames with 3 stars (Good Zestimate). This would be due to a supposed increase in user web traffic to properties with 3-star accuracy Zestimates.", "The data set contained information from the Assessor\u2019s Office used in computing assessed values for individual residential properties sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2010. The data set contained 2051 rows and 81 columns (features) of information. This data was gathered and provided by Kaggle. If the data were not provided my approach to gathering it would have been to do research to see if it was publicly available or pull it down via Zillow\u2019s API.", "Next, I performed my data cleaning and exploratory analysis. For the former, I checked for and made decisions on null values and data entry errors. For the latter I visualized the data to better see and understand relationships and distributions.", "Below are two visualizations of my target variable, Sale price. I wanted to understand its distribution.", "I took the log of the target and fed that into the models later. I did this because the model will try to find a happy median of our target, but if left alone it would consistently under-guess on the outliers which would negatively affect the R-squared score. Based on the R-squared formula, the more wrong our model is the, more it will be punished because the residuals (errors) in the numerator are being squared. So making predictions on our logged target will allow the model to have just as many over-guesses as under-guesses or more normally distributed predictions.", "Next, I wanted to understand the relationship of my features to my target variable so I plotted a heat map of my features with correlations to Sale Price of 0.50 or higher. There were none that were inversely related to Sale Price with correlations of -0.50 or lower.", "I wanted to examine those relationships further so I graphed scatter plots of six of the features from the correlation heat map above.", "As you can see overall_qual which had the strongest correlation to Sale Price at 0.80 displays the strongest linear relationship among the six chosen.", "In this step I split my data into training and test sets, chose my features to feed into the models, methods of feature engineering, and the models. I initially started with a forward selection process \u2014 selecting one feature, running my model, checking performance, and repeating the steps. I also manually created a few interaction terms, dummied (turning a categorical feature into a boolean matrix), and mapped (scoring/weighing categorical features) a few of my categorical features. Each feature I chose to feed into my model as is or manually engineered was intentional. Most of my reliance was on the feature\u2019s strong correlation to Sale Price and intuitive assumptions I made about whether or not a feature would have an impact on Sale Price. With this method I had gotten great results, but then I got eager and I made the (incorrect) assumption that all of my features would perform best for my model if I dummied or mapped every categorical one then applied polynomial features (en masse interactions terms) to all after they were numerical.", "I checked the correlations of my newly engineered features to my target variable, Sale Price. You can see the results of a few below.", "As you can see, the features I mapped (second picture) had much stronger correlations to Sale Price than the features I dummied. Still I maintained my assumption and proceeded to feed my model with all of my features (except of course for Sale Price).", "I chose three machine learning algorithms which were Linear Regression, RidgeCV, and LassoCV. I knew with a large number of features I would enhance my potential of overfitting so I wanted to include the latter models as they have harsh methods of regularization. I also assumed polynomial features would take care of any multicollinearity among my features.", "The model I went with was LassoCV. It achieved an R-squared of 94% on my training data and 86% on unseen data. The RMSE for my testing data was 37,334. This means two things: 1) 86% of the variability in the data is explained by the model and 2) the model is overfit.", "Below you can see the distribution of my predictions (yhat) overlaid against the target variable (y).", "The final model was not my best model. I, unfortunately, overwrote the features from my best model \u2014 the one where I was intentional in my feature selection and engineering process \u2014 as the incorrect assumption was made that converting all features to numeric and using polynomial features would yield even better results.", "The LassoCV model handles unseen data fairly well so I would use it to predict the price of a home.", "One recommendation I would make would be to continue to test/learn to improve the model by:", "Check out my code and my presentation.
