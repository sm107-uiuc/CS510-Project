The notion of stationarity of a series is important for applying statistical forecasting models since:", "The stationarity of the process can be verified by visually checking the time series plot or variogram of the series. Statistical tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test can be performed to check the stationarity of a process. This article verifies the stationarity by visually checking the time series plot and variogram.", "Time series plot \u2014 A given time series plot can be considered as a stationary process if it shows constant mean and variance over the period of time.", "Variogram \u2014 is a graphical tool to check the stationarity of time series data. If the variogram of a given process (time series) shows stability after a certain number of lags, then the process is defined to be a stationary process.", "If the original time series does not show stationarity then it can be stabilized by implementing transformation (e.g. log transformation) and differencing the series.", "We will apply the ARIMA model to a real-world dataset \u201cDaily Average Exchange Rates Between US Dollars and Euro\u201d. The dataset is given in the book \u201cTime Series Analysis and Forecasting by Example\u201d by Sorren Bissgard and Murat Kulachi. A snippet of the dataset is given below:", "Stationarity: Original time series and its\u2019 Variogram", "Figure 1 and 2 illustrates the original time series and its variogram, respectively. Fig. 1 shows that the series is not stationary as it does not follow constant mean and variance. The variogram in Fig. 2 does not show stability as after around 80 lags it shows a decreasing trend and in the long run, it may not able to maintain a stable pattern which indicates the process is not stationary.", "Figure 3 and 4 illustrates the time series of the one differenced process of the original series and its variogram, respectively. Fig. 3 shows that the one differenced series follow constant mean and variance indicating a stationary series. Additionally, the first differenced variogram in Fig. 4 shows the characteristics of stationary series as it demonstrates settling down in the long run. Hence, the one differenced series would be appropriate to be used for further analysis.", "You can read this article \u2014 Time Series Analysis: Identifying AR and MA using ACF and PACF Plots \u2014 to understand how the orders of ARMA models can be selected using ACF and PACF plots.", "Fig. 5 and 6 show the ACF and PACF of the one differenced series. The ACF cuts after one lag and the PACF also cut off from the start of the series. Thus, ARIMA(p,d,q) could be a candidate model where p = 0, d = 1, q = 1. However, we also experimented ARIMA (1,1,1), ARIMA (0,1,2), and ARIMA (1,1,2) to investigate models\u2019 performance. After applying different models, we will consider AIC as a performance metric to select the optimal model.", "Fig. 6, 7, 8, and 9 show the results of the 4 different aforementioned models we implemented on the one differenced series. The variance and standard error for all the candidate models are approximately similar. The AIC also shows similar values for all four models. The lowest AIC of -1398 was achieved for ARIMA (1,1,1) model (Fig. 8), though all the estimated parameters are not statistically significant. The ARIMA (0,1,1) and ARIMA (0,1,2) can be considered as an optimal mode as their AIC was the second-lowest, but the estimated parameter for ARIMA (0, 1, 2) is not significant. Thus, we finally select ARIMA (0,1,1) as the optimal model (Fig. 6).", "The following plots are for the final model ARIMA (0,1,1). The white noise probability shows the significance of the white noise and the residual plot shows the normality. The IACF does not show any instability and the white noise probability is significant. The Q-Q plot follows a linear pattern and the residual distribution follows a normal curve as well which suggests that the model satisfies the normality assumption.", "Table 1 shows the forecasted value for the rate. The standard error shows the stability of the forecasted values as all the standard errors are insignificant. Fig. 10 demonstrates the plot for a predicted value of 7 days indicating a stable curve. Table 2. compares original rate values with the predicted value. Square Error (SE) shows the squared error between original values and predicted values. The SE for each of the forecasting rates displays that the forecasting rates are extremely close to the original rates which indicates a quality prediction by the ARIMA model.", "Your home for data science.
