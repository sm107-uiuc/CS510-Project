However, it\u2019s not so simple to set up an effective data science team because they come in all shapes and sizes. Today I want to share some insights I have gained in this field and hope that can help you set up the right data science team for you.", "Just like any other team in an organisation, there is no one size fits all solution to building your data science team, but here are some key factors that can help you make the right decision.", "Data science has to be use case driven and that is where you need to start. A team to help you improve your targeted media campaign and a team to help you optimise your core business algorithms will look vastly different. While it might be tempting to just hire for everything, we know that hiring for everything usually ends up hiring for nothing and that\u2019s not a great way to start your team. If you are not sure what use case you can tackle at the start, it might be helpful to seek external help to support you to define the problem first, since that should be a pre-requisite when setting up a data science function.", "Many data science teams fail to bring value because they can\u2019t integrate with the organisation and senior stakeholders often underestimate the level of change required to make it work. The size and maturity of the organisation is a key factor that determines how much change management is required here. It is more common for large and long-standing organisations to be slower and more reluctant to change, but just because you are a startup, doesn\u2019t mean that you can change rapidly. Data science is based on the fundamental principle of test and learn and it requires the organisation to have a culture that is willing to change and learn from the data. It is as important to think about how you can bring change to the organisation as the actual change you are going to bring. So while you are building a data science team, be sure to invest the same amount of time and effort into the organisation change culture.", "It is tempting to just create an independent team that focuses on \u201ctransformation\u201d and \u201cinnovation\u201d but this approach doesn\u2019t work because innovation can\u2019t happen in a siloed environment. On the flip side, there will be no common standards and efficiency gains if each functional team starts hiring their data scientist. The debate on whether data science should be a centralised or a distributed function has been around since the beginning but I think as Andy Groove suggested in High Output Management, dual reporting in a matrix management structure will be the inevitable solution that solves the tension between mission-oriented teams and functional teams. Data scientists should be reporting into both the Data Science Lead and also the functional team lead that they are working with. Of course, it is not a silver bullet and managing that structure will make the process more complex, but the benefit should outweigh the costs if done well.", "While it is beneficial to have domain knowledge, I would argue that it is not strictly necessary that the entire team is required to have experience working in the domain your business is in. A high performing team brings together individuals with different background and it\u2019s the collaboration that sparks new ideas. The level of domain knowledge required will depend on how specific your domain is, the more specific and technical your domain, the more likely that you will require people who understand it. Industries like medicine and biochemistry would likely benefit from having a higher proportion of people with domain knowledge than industries like retail and banking.", "With all those factors considered, you should be thinking about your first hire. It is important to get the first hire right because it sets the tone of the team and she will also be proving the value of data science within your organisation. While there are plenty of technical things to assess and consider, I think these following attributes are often overlooked.", "Generalists are often overlooked because they don\u2019t excel in a particular area, but they are tremendously useful resources in the early phases of a project. People who have experience doing a range of roles within the space are great first hire because they can wear different hats easily and make things happen without a huge team. Your requirements will vary, but having someone who has a good level of understanding across data, analytics, product and technology will help you piece the puzzle together.", "The first hire is not only there to get hands-on with the data, but she will also be the core to build up the team. I have seen lots of companies hiring for a technical data scientist with the hope to transition to a team leadership position when they want to scale. I don\u2019t think that approach works because a technical leader and a team leader are two completely different roles and that distinction matters. If the team sponsor has a strong understanding and vision on what data science should look like and have the capacity to lead, you might be able to get away with hiring a team of technical resources. However, there are huge benefits to hiring someone who understands the value of leadership within a technical context and can dedicate all of her efforts into leading the data science team. Leadership should not be an afterthought and your first hire needs to be able to lead if you want the team to grow.", "In the ideal setting, we would have data science focusing on getting value from the data, data engineering focusing on building a scalable robust data pipeline and the software engineers to build out the rest of the systems. However, things are rarely ideal, especially when it is at the start of something. Your first hire needs to at least understand how all the disciplines mentioned above fit together because without all of them working together, the value of data cannot be realised. If you already have an existing capability on one or more of them, the new hire should supplement the missing skillset to have all those areas covered. There should be some positive tension between data science and engineering due to the nature of their work, but if that tension is leveraged well, you will be able to build innovative solutions that are robust and scalable. Candidates with a good understanding of both sides will help maintain a healthy balance.", "Data science is a constantly evolving field but that makes hiring people very difficult because there are so many ways to achieve similar outcomes and there is usually no absolute right or wrong. However, here are some traits that I have seen from others who worked well in this field.", "With many different tools and methodologies being developed every day, expertise with specific tools is no longer as valuable as before. Great data scientists focus on the problem rather than the tools because that\u2019s what data science should be about. The ability to understand and break down the problem and come up with the right methodologies is the true value that a data scientist should bring. This can be assessed by asking the candidate to walk through a problem he solved in the past and look out for what he emphasised on.", "Innovations often come from looking at the problem from a different perspective. Data scientists with a wide range of experience will be able to bring knowledge from different domains and use cases and apply them creatively to different problems. This is a particularly difficult trait to find due to the immaturity of the industry, however, the underlying skill can be tested by asking the candidate to solve a problem that he has no previous experience in and evaluate whether he can work out the problem logically and apply the knowledge he has learnt from other fields.", "The real world is messy and there is no substitute for actual hands-on experience. More universities and MOOCs are taking advantage of the data hype and offering educational resources to train people in this field. However, the focus on advanced theoretical techniques in an academic setting is far from applicable to actual data generated by businesses out there. It takes practice and failures and perseverance to learn the skills required to apply data science in a business setting and experience is tremendously valuable.", "Experimentation and learning put \u201cscience\u201d in data science. To be called data scientists, we need to constantly experiment often and learn from our failures. The field is evolving rapidly and those who can stay on top of the curve are the ones who will be bringing in the most value. Candidates who are passionate about learning and testing new ideas are much more valuable as the industry grows into the future.", "Data science relies on many other disciplines to be useful and great data scientists bring those teams together. Cross-functional teams are set up precisely for this reason because it is the combination of all the different components that make a solution work. Candidates with experience working with people across disciplines and backgrounds are more productive when it comes to delivering solutions. I found people who understand and appreciate the skillsets from the other side are usually most productive.", "Building a data science team is hard, but it can bring a lot of value to the business if done correctly. As a business leader, it is important to know how data can support your vision and find the right people to execute that. While it seems like everyone is building a data science team and you might be tempted to rush the process. Taking the time and effort to build the right team will ensure that you deliver on the results that you are hoping for.", "If you have enjoyed my content, sign up for more at https://jchoi.solutions/subscribe", "Your home for data science.
