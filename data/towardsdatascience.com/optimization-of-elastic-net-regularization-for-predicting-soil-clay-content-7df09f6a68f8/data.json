In this\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["A lot of research has been devoted recently to examine the potential of spectroscopic and machine learning methods for predicting soil particle size fractions \u2014 sand, silt, and clay percent. In this regard, LIBS is considered a useful and advantageous analytical technique as it offers features such as, for example, simplicity, speed, minimally invasive, and the possibility to perform in-situ analysis eliminating the need for soil sampling, which is typically time-consuming and error-prone. In LIBS, a micro-plasma is produced by focusing a high-power laser beam onto a material surface in order to induce characteristic atomic emission lines, which enables direct determination of the elemental composition of the material.", "In this article, 300 soil samples, collected from a study area, were first analyzed by LIBS and were randomly split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets. Each sample is provided with its corresponding clay content previously determined by the standard hydrometer method. However, one of the main issues affecting the modeling of LIBS spectral data is the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d and multicollinearity as its corollary. In order to tackle these issues, a regularized regression model based on the elastic net algorithm is developed using a repeated double cross-validation procedure. In this procedure, 100 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation were carried out using the training set, and the resulting model prediction ability is tested using the testing set. The procedure is repeated 5 times with different random splits.", "Elastic net is the compromise between ridge regression and lasso regularization, and it is best suited for modeling data with a large number of highly correlated predictors. Let\u2019s consider a data matrix X of size n \u00d7 p and a response vector y of size n \u00d7 1, where p is the number of predictor variables and n is the number of observations, and in our case p \u226b n. Elastic net aims at minimizing the following loss function:", "Where \ud835\udf06 is the regularization parameter and \ud835\udefc is the mixing parameter (or percentage). The \ud835\udf06 parameter is nonnegative, i.e. \ud835\udf06 \u2208 [0, \u221e). When \ud835\udf06 = 0, the regularization plays no role. In other words, the only aim is to minimize the loss function. As \ud835\udf06 approaches infinity, the regularization effect is strengthened, the only aim becomes to keep the coefficients \ud835\udefd small instead of minimizing the loss function. Whereas \ud835\udefc \u2208 [0, 1]. When \ud835\udefc = 0, the elastic net is the same as ridge regression (the coefficients of a group of correlated predictors are shrunk towards zero in a similar manner), on the other hand, when \ud835\udefc = 1, the elastic net is the same as lasso (one of the correlated predictors has a larger coefficient, whilst the rest are shrunk to zero).", "A grid search was carried out for training elastic net models with each pair (\ud835\udf06, \ud835\udefc) in the Cartesian product of these two sets and evaluates their performance on the cross-validation from the training set, in which multiple models are trained per pair. Finally, the grid search algorithm outputs the settings that achieved the highest score (RMSE) in the repeated cross-validation procedure.", "I used a sequence of 20 values of \ud835\udefc between 0.05 and 1, and more than 300 values of \ud835\udf06 between 0.0001 and 10. Mean values of the (\ud835\udf06, \ud835\udefc) pair that gave the minimum cross-validation error were (0.0053\u00b10.0005, 0.90\u00b10.03). Interestingly, the final model is close to lasso, but the elastic net has the advantage over lasso for yielding more than n nonzero coefficients in our ill-conditioned linear least squares problem.", "Your home for data science.
