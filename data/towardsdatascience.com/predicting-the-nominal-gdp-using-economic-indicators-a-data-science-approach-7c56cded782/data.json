The problem statement was to gather data from authentic sources, perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), train a model and predict the Nominal GDP (Canada). As an IT person, I had little knowledge about these economics-associated terms. That is why the first thing to do was to get familiar with these concepts. Next was to learn and execute this project in R programming language and get acquainted with popular R packages such as tidyverse, ggplot, caret and others. In practice, good use of online resources makes it easy to get accustomed to R and its syntax.", "Stepping into the task, I came across various economic statistics aka indicators, classified as lagging and leading indicators. Economic indicators are something which may have a direct impact on the Nominal GDP of a country. Our approach here was to use these indicators to predict the Nominal GDP of Canada. After researching these indicators from various online blogs, articles and papers, the following indicators were finalized:", "PopulationRefugee PopulationReal Interest RateNumber of Domestic CompaniesTravel Services ( % of Import Services -BoP)Tax RevenueHousing MarketLabor ProductivityGovernment Bond Yield 10yr ratePersonal Remittances (Received & Paid in USD)Passengers carried by RailwaysPassengers carried by Air TransportsInflationIncome GrowthUnemployment RateGovernment DeficitConsumer Price IndexCommodity Price IndexEUR to CAD conversion rateUSD to CAD conversion rateToronto Stock Exchange traded valueToronto Stock Exchange traded volumeIncoming International Tourists", "Data was fetched from sources like Statistics Canada, World Bank, Statista and others. These indicators were assumed as features and data was collected for these features between from year 2009 to 2018. The data set was divided into two parts, a traning set and a testing set.", "After the dataset was assembled, cleaned and neatly arranged, exploratory data analysis for the data set was started. Data normalization was done using the probability density dnorm function for a standard normal distribution. To check whether the data is normal, Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test was applied on each feature. All variables except 3 were having their p-value greater than 0.05, which indicated that they are normal. In order to analyze the correlation between the dataset features, findCorrelation function of caret package was utilized and highly correlated attributes were removed. As the data points were less i.e. 8 (2009\u20132016), the dimensionality of the data had to be reduced. This was done by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using prcomp function. At this point, EDA was concluded. Let's proceed with modelling now! Refer the GitHub link\u2026Click here!", "In this type of modelling, PCA values were used to train the simple linear regression model using the lm() function. The resultant model was summarized using the summary function. The key observation was that the p-value was less than the significance level (< 0.05). This means that I could safely reject the null hypothesis as co-efficient \u03b2 of the predictor is zero. Furthermore, the F-statistic value of the model was 428.6 (more the better). Hence, it was concluded that the model was statistically significant. To validate the model, I tested it on the values of 2017 and 2018. The overall accuracy of the model was 98.31%. A table at the end of the article provides more details about the experiments.", "For this modelling, randomForest library of R language makes it easier to select the features and create a random forest model. The importance() function finds and displays the importance of each feature according to the data leaf node impurity. These were stored in a new dataset which was the sorted on basis of the importance values. The trick here is not to select the features whose importance values are only higher or lower, but to select values to neutralize the spectrum i.e. combination of higher, lower and mid importance values to maintain the balance. Six features were picked using trial and error method.", "Personal Remittances (Received) Real Interest Rate Travel Services Imports  Government Bond Yield 10yr rateGovernment DeficitNumber of Domestic Companies", "The model was trained by using the randomForest function. mtry parameter was set to 6 (no of features) and number of trees (ntree) to 1000. The model forecasted the 2017 and 2019 NGDP with an average accuracy of 95.68%.", "This was the final one on our experiment list. In order to utilize the SVM modelling in our use, we used the e1071 package of R that provides the svn function to model. As our use-case was not a classification one, the regression option had to be applied. For this, the svm() function provides a type parameter which enables us to opt in our choice. Accordingly, the eps-regression type was opted and kernel parameter was set to radial. For more details on kernels, click here. The average accuracy forecasted here was 98.18%. The graph and table below provide more details about the experiment.", "To conclude, despite having a small data set, all models predict with 95% + accuracy. As the linear model is trained using the PCA values, the resulting output is better than other. Whereas, the Random Forest can be considered to be least reliable as it uses minimal features of the dataset. If not the accuracy or reliability, the results at least advocate the significance of economic indicators in the prediction of Nominal GDP.", "PS: This experiment was a part of the submission for Statistics Canada Business Data Scientist Challenge 2019/2020.", "Your home for data science.
