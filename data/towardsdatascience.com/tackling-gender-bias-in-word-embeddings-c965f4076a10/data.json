Imagine googling \u201ccool programmer t-shirts\u201d and Google responds with only male-form tees. With BERT, which has shown signs of gender bias, being incorporated in Google Search, one doesn\u2019t need to imagine. Keeping the \u201cintelligence\u201d that defines AI, inherently bias-free is imperative as we continuously see increased usage of these systems in our daily lives.", "This is the same relation that sent the computer science community into disbelief when Word2Vec first promulgated its achievement. The concept of vector representation of words was engraved as one of the mainstays of NLP. However, it is these word embeddings that can imbibe even the biases of the human world.", "(In)famous results such as the above truly pinpoint the implicit nature of the issue. In reality, it is the corpora, which is nothing but human literature, on which these gargantuan models have been trained that are biased.", "Bolukbasi et al. in \u201cMan is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings\u201d throw further light into some analysis of this gender bias and how we can try to overcome it. Fortunately, these models contain enough information to even mitigate this bias to a certain extent.", "Essentially, the corpus that the model is trained on has some gender-neutral words like \u201csoftball\u201d, \u201creceptionist\u201d, and \u201cprogrammer\u201d. There are also some gender-specific terms like \u201cbusinesswoman\u201d, \u201cfather\u201d and \u201cmother\u201d. It is observed that the gender-neutral terms acquire stereotype and bias due to the context in which they are present in the corpus.", "As an example, suppose the search query is \u201ccmu computer science phd student\u201d for a computer science Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University. Now, the directory offers 127 nearly identical web pages for students \u2014 these pages differ only in the names of the students... However, word embeddings also rank terms related to computer science closer to male names than female names\u2026The consequence is that, between two pages that differ only in the names Mary and John, the word embedding would influence the search engine to rank John\u2019s web page higher than Mary.", "The goal is to \u201cde-bias\u201d these gender-neutral vectors while preserving identical semantic relationships among the embeddings.", "The bias itself is of 2 types, direct and indirect.", "Direct Bias can be classified as terms such as \u201cfootball\u201d being inherently closer to males and \u201creceptionist\u201d being closer to females. Indirect Bias stems from the nuanced correlations in the corpus, leading to \u201cbookkeeper\u201d being closer to \u201csoftball\u201d than \u201cfootball\u201d, due to their larger female associations.", "The gender-neutral terms, as shown above, should be equidistant to the he-she pairs, and the gender-specific terms should continue to convey the embedded gender information in them.", "First, the subspace of this gender embedding was captured. This is done by taking the difference of some pre-known sets that define the concept of gender itself.", "SVD was performed on a subset of such opposite gender pairs, to finally obtain the direction or subspace of this bias. This smoothing is done to negate the effect of different meanings of some terms, like \u201cman\u201d.", "The vectors lying in this subspace (the gender-neutral terms) are \u201cneutralized\u201d such that they remain equidistant from equality pairs like \u201che-she\u201d. Technically, what happens is that the projection of the embedding on the bias direction is subtracted from the vector.", "The embeddings outside this direction (the gender-specific terms) are \u201cequalized\u201d, or averaged out to have the same vector length. This is done to ensure that the neutral terms are equidistant to ALL equality pairs. For example, the term doctor should be equidistant to both guy-girl and man-woman.", "It is possible that sometimes the gender-specific terms contain more meaning that is required to be captured, eg: to grandfather a regulation. In this case, we might only want to \u201csoften\u201d the effect of gender bias on the embeddings based on a parameter, say \u03bb.", "Here, we do not completely neutralize the embeddings but do so only to the extent of \u03bb. If \u03bb = 0, then it is essentially the same as hard debiasing.", "The results shown above resonate with the objective of the task, successfully removing bias from the embeddings without affecting performance. There are other approaches to the problems described too, like cleansing the corpus itself.", "In all essence, debiasing word embeddings can help contribute to the ever-increasing demand for a bias-free world. At the very least, machine learning should not be used to inadvertently amplify these biases, as we have seen can naturally, happen.", "Using the code published on GitHub by the authors of the paper, I hard-debiased the Google News vectors that I used earlier and obtained the following results.", "We see how the evident bias has been reduced by this approach, using neutralization and equalization.", "There are some who argue that gender biases in the embedding capture useful statistics. However, there is a huge possibility that machine learning algorithms could amplify gender stereotypes and discriminations, and it is best to operate on bias-free systems.", "With gender being only one of the biases exhibited by word embeddings, identification of racial or ethnic biases could follow suit, a huge step towards truly #EthicalAI", "T Bolukbasi, K Chang, J Zou, V Saligrama and A Kalai.
