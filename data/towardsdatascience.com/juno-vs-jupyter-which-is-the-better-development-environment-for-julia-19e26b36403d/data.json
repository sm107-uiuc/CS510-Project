This is especially true for Data Science, as Data Scientists more often need to analyze and process data prior to executing any code as part of an application. Having a great setup that works for you can mean the difference between getting something done in an hour or a full day.", "Typically when discussing Julia IDE\u2019s for Data Science, there are two major choices that come into play:", "IJulia is a Jupyter kernel for Julia that can be added with Pkg:", "With Jupyter Notebooks comes a host of great advantages over Juno. Firstly, cell-level execution is fantastic. With cells, you can choose which code to run when and even avoid running certain cells to get a certain result. Additionally, Jupyter output is rather convenient and easy to deal with.", "Another advantage that comes with using notebooks is the ability to use IJulia\u2019s \u201c magic\u201d commands. While these are not technically \u201c magic\u201d commands, but instead are Julia functions that are exported from IJulia, they are certainly a great thing to have on hand in a pinch. On top of that, using macros to run bash commands is far superior to being stuck in a REPL and having to open a second terminal window like you would in Juno.", "Probably one of the biggest advantages in my opinion to using notebooks, however, is", "Notebooks are a great tool for teaching and spreading information. This is made even more true with the ability to add mark-down cells for large chunks of text with explanations. This is for the most part why I typically use notebooks to demonstrate ideas and code in my articles here on Medium, though subjectively I do prefer to use Juno.", "Debugging packages can be incredibly difficult inside of a Jupyter Kernel, as anytime a package needs to be reloaded from within a Jupyter Kernel, the kernel will need to be restarted, and all of the code will need to be executed again.", "Kernels are also quite taxing compared to running a simple Julia executable. Not only can this attribute to performance loss, but can also make multi-tasking rather difficult when working with Jupyter Notebooks. To top it all off, it is far easier to kill a kernel than it is to time-out a REPL, so there is always potential to face code that cannot be executed without going to the REPL first.", "The last disadvantage to using Jupyter is that your code will be stored in notebooks. While this is both a blessing and a curse, the curse part can be felt by anyone who doesn\u2019t use notebooks. For anyone who doesn\u2019t do Data Science, a notebook could be an entirely foreign concept, meaning that your code can\u2019t reach a larger audience while also being rather limited until it is copied into a standalone JL file, or saved as one.", "Juno is an integrated development environment for Julia that can be added as an extension for the Atom text editor. You can add Julia by going to edit>Preferences in the menu-bar in Atom, and then selecting extensions and searching for \u201c Juno.\u201d", "Having a Julia REPL at your disposal is a very powerful tool. Using the Julia REPL you can also access the Pkg REPL, which is a lot more convenient than going importing Pkg, pre-compiling Pkg, and then using a Pkg method. Additionally, with a greater focus on your local file-system, managing virtual environments and .jl files is made far easier.", "Another big advantage to Juno is the \u201c Plots\u201d pane. The \u201c Plots\u201d pane takes any image output from Julia and puts it into an iframe. This is really convenient because you can zoom and scale the plots in real time. Additionally, all of the plots used in your current session are saved into this pane, making flipping through data visualizations effortless.", "Another great thing about Juno is how easy it is to start a new session. As I touched on in the disadvantages of using IJulia, it can be pretty tedious and annoying to constantly have to restart the kernel. With Juno, you can very quickly restart your Julia session with an Interrupt Exception by pressing ctrl+D.", "In Juno, you can also use the \u201c Documentation Browser\u201d pane, which provides a slick UI for searching Julia documentation of all your added packages.", "Another cool feature is automatic formatting. At any point in Juno, you are able to highlight and format your code by clicking Juno>Format Code. On top of that, you can execute single blocks of code, making it incredibly convenient to utilize text buffers with Julia code inside.", "As icing on the cake, you can also start remote Julia processes from within Juno.", "Though this certainly isn\u2019t a disadvantage for me \u2014 as I love Atom, and it is my text-editor of choice, those who prefer VSCode or another alternative might find it a bit pesky that Atom is required to use Juno. I can definitely see how Atom could take some getting used to for those who haven\u2019t used it before.", "Let\u2019s face it \u2014 typing functions into a REPL is a lot less convenient than typing them into a text buffer. While it\u2019s certainly possible to type all your functions into the Julia REPL, it is certainly slower than typing them into a Jupyter cell. Additionally, you lose the power of copy and paste. You could mitigate this issue by putting your functions into a .jl file inside of your Atom text buffer, but then you would have to include() or re-run your file every-time a function is added or modified.", "Both Jupyter and Juno are incredible tools, and in a lot of ways, they both trade blows in short-comings and advancements. There are a lot of things I wish that Juno had that Jupyter has and a lot of things that Jupyter has that I wish Juno had. Overall, I don\u2019t think that it is as much of a question of \u201c which,\u201d as it is a question of \u201c when.\u201d I think there are cases where Juno is a better choice and situations where Jupyter is a better choice. Personally, I prefer to use Juno for its surprising versatility. It would be rather difficult to develop packages in Jupyter, but surprisingly effective to do data-analysis in Juno. However, this isn\u2019t to say that I would not rather use Jupyter for data analysis and use Juno for packages accordingly, in fact, that is typically what I do.", "Obviously Jupyter has been very useful for me in my informative articles as well. It would be a lot more difficult to firstly demonstrate, and secondly, share my work using .jl files and REPL sessions. Jupyter\u2019s biggest disadvantage is likely dead kernels, and Juno\u2019s biggest disadvantage is likely reproducibility. Overall, in a lot of ways I think which tool you use might be closely correlated to what it is that you desire to do.", "Your home for data science.
