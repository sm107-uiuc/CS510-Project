So I will be able to earn lots of money and buy a big house\u201d. Apart from the worrisome materialistic mindset at such a young age, the obvious survivorship bias behind this reasoning made me smile.", "Yes, if you look at all the footballers on TV you might think that it is a particularly profitable profession; however, this reasoning is biased because you don\u2019t take into account those who don\u2019t make it into stardom.", "Are kids the only ones prone to survivorship bias? No, adults fall easily into this trap too.", "Maybe you have already heard about survivorship bias before: one famous example is the story of Abraham Wald, a statistician studying World War II airplanes. The army told Wald that many planes were suffering crashes and that the returning planes had a lot of bullet holes. The army kept track of the location of the bullet holes on the returning planes to know where to reinforce the planes.", "Suppose that the bullet holes on returning planes were distributed as follows:", "Where would you reinforce the planes when you look at this graph?", "The army initial approach was: \u201cOk, we look at the planes coming back, we see where they were hit the worst: so we should reinforce these weakened parts, shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d. According to the graph above, we should reinforce the wings, shouldn\u2019t we?", "However, Wald said no, that would be precisely the wrong decision.", "Wald had realized that this conclusion was only made based on the survivors, but what about the planes that didn\u2019t come back? In fact, the holes showed that these planes were hit and were still able to come back. So the information that we had was incomplete. Planes that were hit and didn\u2019t come back had more accurate information on which were the parts to reinforce.", "The misconception: You should focus on the survivors if you want to learn how to survive.", "The truth: If you don\u2019t look at the failures, you can\u2019t know what made a survivor different from a failure.", "However, if the army made an error like this, does this mean that we may be also prone to this bias in our everyday life? Yes, of course.", "We can see survivorship bias in many other examples in our everyday life.", "Survivorship Bias can happen whenever there are two categories in your study and one that you can tag as the \u201csurvivor\u201d: in business, it can be successful vs the non-successful; in medicine, it can be the living vs the dead; in a game, it can be the winner vs the losers.", "If you decide to build a start-up having only in mind those that have succeeded, you forget that the majority of start-ups fail during their first two years.", "In medicine, leaving out bias is especially important: doctors should remember the times the treatment did not work as expected as well as the times it worked, lest they remain oblivious to something crucial.", "For example, it seems obvious to us now that bloodletting is useless and doesn\u2019t help to cure any illness (it does more harm in fact). However, this practice, which was based on the belief that withdrawing blood could help the body maintain balance and health, had been performed over 2000 years until the late 19th century. Why for so long? Well, that is precisely because of survivorship bias: in some cases, bloodletting might have resulted in a positive outcome, and without a throughout scientific approach, only the survivors were taken into account.", "This fact is especially important to remember now as we are all anxiously waiting for a cure for the COVID-19: some treatment may claim to be successful, but without a control group it is hard to prove it scientifically. Hope shouldn\u2019t cloud our judgment.", "Or maybe a more simple example: you have heard about people successfully trying on a new diet, and are thinking about trying it out to lose weight. However if some people have managed to lose weight by eating only apples for a week (for example) and are talking about it on their blogs, you won\u2019t hear about the people who have tried out the same diet and for whom it didn\u2019t work out so well.", "In our society, we tend to flock to people who are successful in their area, and we are not looking for advice from people who have failed (even if they could give us interesting advice about what you should not do).", "\u201cA stupid decision that works out well becomes a brilliant decision in hindsight.\u201d \u2014 psychologist Daniel Kahneman in Thinking Fast and Slow", "Now, what is there to learn from these lessons for a data scientist?", "As a data scientist, you work with the data you have been given. You are expected to draw insights from the data you have. So, the conclusion you give depends on the data you have. So what if you are missing some important information because the most important data is not the one you have?", "Recently, I had to build a churn model for a certain industry.", "However GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) had just begun to be implemented in this company and for example, the data of some churners were not available anymore: because they had churned a long time ago, for privacy reasons the data could only be stored for a certain number of years unless we had some form of consent from the clients.", "So, for example the dataset was constructed in 2020. I had customers data back to 1990 and are still, as of 2020, customers in the dataset. But I didn\u2019t have the data of the customers who left before 2015. Is there a survivorship bias here?", "In fact yes, I didn\u2019t have the data of customers between 1990 and 2015 and who churned during that period. So how to deal with that?", "In this case one simple way is to have the same reference for all the population and to start your analysis by taking only the population who have a starting date of contract superior or equal to 2015.", "In other cases there might not be one simple solution, and so you might have to stop your analysis before giving biased conclusions because some important data is missing.", "In summary, Survivorship Bias is defined as \u201ca cognitive bias that occurs when someone tries to make a decision based on past successes while ignoring past failures.\u201d Science is a way of filtering out the real from the apparent. What may seem intuitive at first may not be a good answer.", "Your home for data science.
