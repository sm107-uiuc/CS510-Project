New offerings are being developed by young startups to address the lack of monitoring and alerts for everything data-science. However, they are mostly addressing data-scientists or -engineers, which are, of course, the first personas that feel the pain of managing multiple models. However, I will try to argue that the impact of data-science observability should be aimed toward decision-makers such as high & mid-level managers, the people who are responsible for spending, funding, managing and most importantly are accountable for the impact of the data-science-operation on the company\u2019s clients, business, product, sales, and lets not forget the company\u2019s bottom line.", "In my previous post, I have written about the many use cases and the monumental importance of monitoring & alerts, specifically from a data-science-researcher point-of-view. However, in this post we will cover several personas that are influenced by DS processes, most importantly high-level executives such as Investors & CEOs that invest a lot of money into DS infrastructures, teams, development and DevOps, but are not fully aware of the various impact points that DS has on their business. I will argue that high-level management needs to care about DS-related metrics similarly to metrics that are observed for business, financial, sales, marketing, and product management, metrics such as life-time-value (LTV), customer-acquisition-cost (CAC), Customer Retention Cost (CRC), Daily Average Users (DAU), Monthly Average Users (MAU), Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), etc.", "Let\u2019s start with a few personas that have a shared or full responsibility for anything related to DS and discuss the scope of it.", "We can divide this list into two parts. In the first part, are technical people such as SRE\u2019s, DevOps, data engineers, and data scientists. In the second, are DS managers, product managers, CEOs, and Investors. The technical personas share the end-to-end responsibility that begins with providing the data, processing, creating algorithms and deploying them. Many companies are already starting to offer solutions for this group of people, with data-scientists as the main focus.", "The second group, which includes decision-makers such as CEOs and Investors, should closely observe KPIs that are directly and indirectly connected to the heart of data-science production, similarly to what is done today with APM metrics. A revolution in observability that has risen due to new technology from companies such as New Relic.", "In terms of cost, maintaining core-DS production is quite expensive. We are talking about highly paid technical professional, expensive infrastructures that may need auto-scaling and a direct business impact that is influenced by the quality of algorithms. It may be easy to calculate the cost of an algorithm until it hits production, generally its the time spend on it and the infrastructures used in the process.", "However, it is far more difficult to observe projected costs and measure the impact of DS on the business and product after a DS project hits production.", "These examples are just the tip of the iceberg, but they show the importance, hidden costs and impact that DS flows have on business & product KPIs, and that they should be given a front seat in your organization's daily agenda, reports, and dashboards. Finally, high-level-managers should be aware of these silent influences and demand to know the full impact of DS processes on their operation.", "I would like to thank my fellow colleague Dor Sasson for a fruitful discussion.", "Dr. Ori Cohen has a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus on machine-learning. He is a lead data-scientist at New Relic TLV, doing machine and deep learning research in the field of AIOps.", "Your home for data science.
