Having a machine be able to parse and generate plausibly human sounding language is both of enormous practical value and also notoriously difficult. Human language is messy, filled with the sort of irregularities that computers can\u2019t handle. Even relatively simple tasks like tagging what part of speech a given word is can be hard and context dependent (is \u2018permit\u2019 a noun or a verb?).", "Even the most powerful and successful implementations of NLP can feel a little off. I still remember very clearly watching IBM\u2019s Watson playing Jeopardy with all-stars Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. Watson\u2019s performance was truly impressive, and Watson ended up winning handily over the two days of play, yet at times it felt like the machine wasn\u2019t really performing the task it had been designed to do \u2014 properly interpret natural language \u2014 very well at all. During one game\u2019s final Jeopardy, Watson couldn\u2019t come up with the correct response in the category of \u2018U.S. Cities\u2019 and guessed Toronto:", "Had Watson really been able to understand the task, it presumably would have at least guessed a city in the right country, though I\u2019m not entirely convinced it wasn\u2019t making an intentional joke. I also remember a clue during regular play that asked for the name Maxwell, of Beatles\u2019 song-silver-hammer-wielding fame and Watson responded with the entire phrase \u2018Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer\u2019. They gave Watson the points for that response, but maybe they shouldn\u2019t have. Watson could make enough connections to tell which song the clue was asking after, but not tell what the clue was actually asking for.", "All this is just to reiterate that natural language processing is hard! Feeding a state of the art supercomputer the entire contents of Wikipedia is easy. Having even a state of the art supercomputer understand basic English requires a tremendous amount of ingenuity.", "I am particularly interested in the ability of computers to generate text. Watson had it relatively easy, since Jeopardy responses follow a strict pattern. What about having a computer generate longer and more complicated passages, particularly those that require proper conjugation and agreement? In this and possibly a series of future posts I want to explore what goes into generating text like this with an eye towards creating topical limericks.", "The inspiration for this post is the inspired twitter account Limericking. The anonymous genius behind Limericking writes limericks after news stories. For reasons I cannot entirely articulate, I think the best of Limericking\u2019s limericks are truly brilliant, some of the best modern poetry that I know of:", "I\u2019ve been thinking about everything that would go in to automating something like Limericking\u2019s output. Could you feed in a news article and have the computer produce a topical limerick? Other attempts to produce styled text like this have taken the route of using recursive neural networks trained on input corpuses which they will attempt to mimic. This data scientist trained an RNN on Shakespeare, for instance, and after some 35 thousand training steps over 19 hours the computer produced this snippet of text:", "Tow now, what maans thes saeet tnd dead of me?", "What would you a the eoence?", "The results are at once very impressive and totally lacking. The text is unmistakably Shakespearean, but it\u2019s non-sense. This non-directed manner is good at mimicking style, but not great at producing \u2018meaning\u2019. You can imagine training an RNN on enough limericks for it to get a sense of the format, but how deep would the network need to be in order for it to be able to create legible content? Or for it to process a news text into a legible summary limerick?", "It may seem intuitive that a better process would be more procedural. You can imagine a function or series of functions that would do the following steps in order:", "The trouble is that each of these individual steps is in itself something of a tricky data science problem. Take the first step: reading the text and finding the topic or central figure. How does a computer know how to assign a text to a particular topic? Typically this might be done with something like a Naive Bayesian Classifier looking at the frequency of particular words in any given topic (a text containing the word \u2018gigabyte\u2019 is more likely to come from an article about tech, say, while an article mentioning the United Nations is more likely to be about world affairs). This requires a large, well labeled dataset to train your model on, meaning, like many big data problems, that it\u2019s not just a data science problem, but a data production problem as well. (There are unsupervised ways to cluster text as well, though letting the computer decide what the groupings are comes with its own risks).", "Perhaps, you think, there\u2019s an easier way. You can probably cheat a little bit and reason that the main subject of an article is going to be represented by a name or noun that will appear relatively often in the text. You\u2019d do much better than random chance by assembling the most commonly appearing proper nouns in the text and guessing that one of them was the main topic. This too is itself a complicated classification problem, because while it\u2019s easy for the computer to count instances, it\u2019s hard for the computer to tell what is a proper noun.", "Luckily if, like me, you suddenly develop a passion for limericks and want to dive in, numerous resources already exist. The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a powerful library of text manipulation and analysis tools for Python and contains, among many other things, a part of speech tagger that is already quite good (in addition to tools to build your own tagger if you think you can do better). Over a series of posts I want to explore each of the tasks that goes into parsing and producing text to see if I can slowly build up something like an auto-limericking function.", "To that end, I decided to start simply. Rather than build the necessary tools from the ground up, to start playing with some of the tools that come out of the box with NLTK and to work on producing a much simpler text type. Rather than a limerick which comes with both meter and rhyme and an expectation of grammar, how about something like a haiku which requires only meter. Given how short they are, haikus even seem to work best when they are impressionistic so there\u2019s no need to focus too much on grammar. And, as Bill Murray tells us, it\u2019s ok if a haiku doesn\u2019t make sense:", "Here\u2019s how my starter haiku generator works:", "It is a testament to the flexibility of language and the creatively suggestible nature of the human mind that this simple program produces some surprisingly suggestive results. Given this article about Amazon considering using delivery drones to provide home surveillance, it correctly gleans that the topic of the article is \u2018Amazon\u2019 and produces this haiku:", "Which kind of gets to the heart of the matter and almost looks human. Indeed, I think that by simply adding an \u2019s\u2019 to the word \u2018plan\u2019, the results would even look grammatical. Given this article about Eldorado Resorts buying Caesar\u2019s of casino fame, the results are not quite as compelling, but not horrible either:", "Of course, it\u2019s easy to look impressive when the form is short and impressionistic. Building up the longer and more grammatical output of even a not very good limerick will be substantially harder.", "Your home for data science.
