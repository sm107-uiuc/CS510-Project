Notes on the series can also be found here.", "Data Scientist\u2019s have the ability to find patterns and insights in oceans of data, akin to an astronomer looking out into the deep space with telescopes to find new planets and galaxies and black holes in the midst of billions of stars and other galaxies. Data Science, fundamentally like science, is used to answer questions about the world by combining different fields, ie Mathematics, Computer Science, Philosophy, etc., along with distinct methodologies and novel technology to augment and enhance our ability to answer them well.", "Whether you\u2019re a beginner who\u2019s new to Data Science, or you\u2019re a working Data Scientist, it\u2019s always good to go back to the central theme of what Data Science is all about. It\u2019s easy to get sidetracked or distracted by new tools or the monotony of work that we forget the principal notion of Data Science and the amazing possibilities that it creates. So this article could serve as an intro to Data Science, and it could be a refresher to it as well. Nonetheless, I hope you learn something from it and have fun reading it.", "In broad terms, Data Science is about using data to answer questions. And to answer those questions, a data scientist uses an amalgamation of skills \u2014 Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, data wrangling, cleaning, visualization, analysis, etc.", "Based on the report by The Economist Special:", "A data scientist is broadly defined as someone who combines the skills of software programmer, statistician, and storyteller/artists to extract the nuggets of gold hidden under mountains of data.", "It\u2019s the mastering of all these skills that makes a data scientist valuable in this era of big data. More importantly, what makes Data Science crucial is its ability to form a connection from numbers and figures and turning them into insights that aid in fact-based and faster decision making which is crucial in this fast-paced world. Like a machine that turns simple carbon into precious diamonds, companies and businesses are now able to utilize data, which were fruitless by itself, in many ways.", "Aside from business that equips data scientists for the purpose of profit and expansion, data science (prediction and inference) also has myriads of uses that contribute to social good with predictions and inferences and tell stories with beautiful visualizations of data \u2014 such as predicting diseases, natural disasters, or crime, and visualizing the latest updates of the COVID-19 figures, the slow rise of global temperature due to the effects of climate change or the gradual decline of poverty or hunger at a global scale.", "According to the infamous Data Science Venn Diagram by Drew Conway, Data Science can be equated to:", "Hacking Skills + Math and Statistics Knowledge + Substantive Expertise", "Substantive expertise = asking the right question and formulating the problem well", "Hacking skills = extracting and mining data, cleaning and formatting data, visualizing and analyzing data, writing concise machine learning and deep learning code, making use of tools and packages.", "Math and Statistics = underlying knowledge for performing analysis and using statistical learning techniques to transfer information into something useful (prediction and inference) and making decisions", "Data Science actually has a long history that goes way back into the 60s. But the reason it\u2019s so popular now is (1) firstly, due to the exponential growth of data (big data), according to Moore\u2019s Law, and (2) the rise of inexpensive computing due to innovation and advancements in technology.", "Both these reasons were the perfect ingredient to create the quintessential environment to enrich data as well as the tools used to analyze it, upgrading computer infrastructures(memory, processors, software, etc) along the way. What we\u2019re able to do today, with could infrastructures and supercomputers would\u2019ve been fiction back then, and we\u2019re still making breakthroughs and breaking barriers each day", "Data Science is closely related to Big Data, since the more data you have, the more accurate your conclusion is on your analysis.", "An explanation as to why data science is wouldn\u2019t be complete without introducing the concept of Big Data.", "According to Oxford Languages, Big data is defined as:", "Extremely large data sets that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behavior and interactions.", "In other words, big data is simply defined as a large collection of data.", "There are 3 characteristics of big data, a.k.a the 3Vs of Big Data that can help you understand more about the term.", "Now that you have a brief idea of what Data Science and Big data is, let\u2019s go back to the fundamentals and breakdown what Data, the central ingredient for all the magic, really is.", "Data is the ingredient for data science processes, and by understand what data is can help you to be more efficient and appreciate what data science is all about.", "1. According to the Cambridge English Dictionary:", "Information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making.", "A set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables.", "Based on the definition by Wikipedia, data can be broken down into the terms set, variables, qualitative and quantitative.", "Taking the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, let\u2019s say we want to visualize the number of confirmed cases in the US with a simple scatter plot,", "The result of the plot can also be used to depict the relationship between X and Y, either a positive or negative correlation. With the use of statistical learning techniques, algorithms such as linear regression can be used to build models for predictions and inference purposes.", "As you advance in the field of data science, you will realize that data is messy and unstructured, and it takes skills, patience, and time to clean data and structure it so that it\u2019s ready to use. Take image data, for example, if you were to build a facial recognition model that detects a face, the input images could be dark, grainy, or blurry, etc. These messy image data can be difficult to deal with. Another aspect is missing data, data-mined, or collected from the real world is often bombarded with missing information, and several techniques are implemented to deal with them.", "Data comes from many places, especially in this time where smartphone usage has dramatically increased due to social media, and the rise of streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify. Data can be categorized into internal or external, where internal is information generated within a business, such as finance, and external is information from the customer, usage analytics, etc. Good data is also often hard to find, in most cases, you\u2019ll have to mine it from the internet to perform analyses, and lots of cleaning is required for it to be useful.", "The most important rule for that data scientists should adhere to is to always ask questions first before seeking out data. Just as the scientific method starts off with a hypothesis, data science starts off with questions that are crucial to solving the problem at hand.", "\u201cIf I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask\u2026 for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.\u201d", "Similar to the scientific method, Data science has a process that turns data into insights.", "The process can be briefly summarized below.", "Data Science starts off with (1) generating questions which helps you to understand the problem well, after questions are well-formulated it\u2019s time to (2) gather the data from relevant sources using data science techniques. After data is collected, it\u2019s time to (3) clean the data, which formats the data and prepares it for the next step, which is (4) analysis and exploration, where statistical methods are used to discover hidden patterns and relationships. After this is (5) modeling, where machine learning models are constructed for prediction and inference. Lastly, the (5) results are communicated to inform others and used for decision making.", "Data Scientists have far-reaching applications in multitudinous areas. But to give have an idea of how Data Science contributes to society, let\u2019s take a look at Nate Silver, the founder and editor in chief of FiveThirtyEight, who uses statistical analysis to convey compelling stories and topics mainly about elections, politics, sports, science, economics, etc.", "One of his most notable work was on the 2016 election, which produced accurate predictions based on statistical techniques. You can also check out the website\u2019s forecast on the 2020 Election for the United States.", "Forecasting the elections certainly isn\u2019t a simple task, and the primary model used by Silver is complex, to quote,", "It involves a lot of path-dependency and a lot of nonlinearity, and the candidates\u2019 performances can interact with one another in fairly complicated ways.As we see it, we don\u2019t really have much choice in the matter. Our primary model is necessarily complex because the primaries themselves are a complex process.", "In other words, there are myriads of factors involved that aren\u2019t necessarily linear (not a direct relationship between X and Y), and they interact in different ways. If you want to read more about how his model works, click here.", "One important lesson from that example is that data science tools and methodologies do merely increases efficacy and speed, but to really make use of it requires the knowledge and ability to choose the right factors, while eliminating the wrong ones, to produce the right conclusion. And to do so requires one to ask the right questions in the first place. This is something you have to understand if you\u2019re deciding to go into this field.", "This methodology of Data Science \u2014 the use of data to answer questions \u2014 is just as intuitive as us making decisions based on our preexisting knowledge. We all try to answer questions in our lives, whether big or small, based on the information we hold, and when mistakes are made, it\u2019s due to the lack of information at that moment in time. The questions we\u2019re able to ask is also limited to the information we have.", "But now, the sheer size and amount of data created each day, traveling from the source to source are astronomical, and with the advent of Data Science and novel techniques created to make use of the data, we now have the capability to discover the answers to previously unanswered questions, and even engender new questions that were inconceivable back then.", "As Data Science becomes more accessible and democratized, the dangers of misinformation and faulty conclusions follow. Thus, it\u2019s of the utmost importance to start by asking questions and learn the skill of asking the right ones as well.", "By asking the right questions and getting the relevant data, alongside the power of Data Science tools and Machine Learning algorithms, we\u2019re able to unravel the hidden patterns of the world and decode the mysteries that were once unfathomable.", "In part 2, I will be writing about why use R for Data Science", "Thanks for reading and I hope this article was educational and useful!", "If you want to be updated with my latest articles follow me on Medium.", "Follow my other social profiles too!", "Be on the lookout for my next article and remember to stay safe!", "Your home for data science.
