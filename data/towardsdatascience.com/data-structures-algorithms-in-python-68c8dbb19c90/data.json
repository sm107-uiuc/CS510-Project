Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.", "The purpose of this article is to give you a panorama of data structures and algorithms in Python. This topic is very important for a Data Scientist in order to help him or her to design and solve machine learning models in a more effective way.", "We will see together with practical examples the built-in data structures, the user-defined data structures, and last but not least I will introduce you to some algorithms like traversal algorithms, sorting algorithms, and searching algorithms.", "As the name suggests, data structures allow us to organize, store, and manage data for efficient access and modification.", "In this part, we are going to take a look at built-in data structures. There are four types of built-in data structures in Python: list, tuple, set, and dictionary.", "A list is defined using square brackets and holds data that is separated by commas. The list is mutable and ordered. It can contain a mix of different data types.", "Below there are some useful functions for the list.", "A tuple is another container. It is a data type for immutable ordered sequences of elements. Immutable because you can\u2019t add and remove elements from tuples, or sort them in place.", "Set is a mutable and unordered collection of unique elements. It can permit us to remove duplicate quickly from a list.", "Dictionary is a mutable and unordered data structure. It permits storing a pair of items (i.e. keys and values).", "As the example below shows, in the dictionary, it is possible to include containers into other containers to create compound data structures.", "Now I will introduce you three user-defined data structures: ques, stack, and tree. I assume that you have a basic knowledge of classes and functions.", "The stack is a linear data structure where elements are arranged sequentially. It follows the mechanism L.I.F.O which means last in first out. So, the last element inserted will be removed as the first. The operations are:", "The queue is a linear data structure where elements are in a sequential manner. It follows the F.I.F.O mechanism that means first in first out. Think when you go to the cinema with your friends, as you can imagine the first of you that give the ticket is also the first that step out of the line. The mechanism of the queue is the same.", "Below the aspects that characterize a queue.", "Trees are used to define hierarchy. It starts with the root node and goes further down, the last nodes are called child nodes.", "In this article, I focus on the binary tree. The binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. Below you can see a representation and an example of the binary tree with python where I constructed a class called Node and the objects that represent the different nodes( A, B, C, D, and E).", "Anyway, there are other user-defined data structures like linked lists and graphs.", "The concept of the algorithm has existed since antiquity. In fact, the ancient Egyptians used algorithms to solve their problems. Then they taught this approach to the Greeks.", "The word algorithm derives itself from the 9th-century Persian mathematician Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b, whose name was Latinized as Algorithmi. Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b was also an astronomer, geographer, and a scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad.", "As you already know algorithms are instructions that are formulated in a finite and sequential order to solve problems.", "When we write an algorithm, we have to know what is the exact problem, determine where we need to start and stop and formulate the intermediate steps.", "There are three main approaches to solve algorithms:", "Trees in python are non-linear data structures. They are characterized by roots and nodes. I take the class I constructed before for the binary tree.", "Tree Traversal refers to visiting each node present in the tree exactly once, in order to update or check them.", "There are three types of tree traversals:", "Here D is the leftmost node where the nearest root is B. The right of root B is E. Now the left sub-tree is completed, so I move towards the root node A and then to node C.", "In this case, I move to the root node A and then to the left child node B and to the sub child node D. After that I can go to the nodes E and then C.", "I go to the most left node which is D and then to the right node E. Then, I can go from the left node B to the right node C. Finally, I move towards the root node A.", "The sorting algorithm is used to sort data in some given order. It can be classified in Merge Sort and Bubble Sort.", "There are other Sorting Algorithms like Selection Sort and Shell Sort.", "Searching algorithms are used to seek for some elements present in a given dataset. There are many types of search algorithms such as Linear Search, Binary Search, Exponential Search, Interpolation Search, and so on. In this section, we will see the Linear Search and Binary Search.", "Now you have an overview of data structures and algorithms. So, you can start going to a deeper understanding of algorithms.", "The beautiful image of the Vitruvian Man I have chosen for this article is not casual. The drawing is based on the correlation of the ideal human body in relation to geometry. In fact, for this representation, Leonardo da Vinci was inspired by Vitruvius who described the man\u2019s body as the ideal body to determine the correct proportion in architecture.", "For what concerns algorithms, the Vitruvian Man hides a secret algorithm used by the artists for centuries to certify that their works were inspired by the divine proportion.", "Sometimes I like to think that maybe Leonardo da Vinci, through his wonderful works, wanted to define the most important algorithm which is the algorithm of life.", "Thanks for reading this. There are some other ways you can keep in touch with me and follow my work:", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data Analyst, Data lover & Dreamer. My aim is to make Data Science accessible to everyone.
