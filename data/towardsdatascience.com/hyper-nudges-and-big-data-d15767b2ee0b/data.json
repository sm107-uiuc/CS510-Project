For instance, if we want to increase pension contributions, we could make the higher contribution product the default option. For everyone.", "Nudges like this have been quite effective, but they\u2019re not perfect. Saving more might be great if you struggle to put money to one side, and because you struggle, nudges might be just the fix. But what if you\u2019re an over-saver? Might the nudge mean you end up having less fun with your money? Or, how about dieting. Smaller plates can decrease the amount of food people eat, which could be great if you\u2019re on a diet, but not so much if you\u2019re already uncomfortable with your weight or have an eating disorder.", "Since the idea of nudge became popularised, behavioural economists have had to take the carpet-bombing approach. They\u2019ve had to be utilitarian, implementing nudges which they think \u2014 on average \u2014 will improve outcomes.", "But what if there\u2019s another way? What if, instead of carpet bombing, we could use a precision strike? (the language here is a bit incendiary, but just as those who think bombing is bad but accept it exists prefer precision strikes, those who dislike nudges but accept they exist will want greater precision also \u2014 there is a purposeful parallel) By combining nudges and big data, hyper-nudges may be exactly that.", "The relationship between nudges and big data is a long but quiet affair. While big data has had the scale and technical expertise to view our world like never before, behavioural insights have always functioned as the tool to utilise those insights. Harvard Law scholar and Nudge co-writer Cass Sunstein imagined this relationship growing ever closer, to the point where big data and algorithms could choose what was the best nudge to use, and option to nudge towards, for each individual.", "Right now, we\u2019re halfway there. Emerging research utilising initial sampling and simulation modelling has been able to effectively associate various behavioural traits from psychometric testing with different nudge strategies to nudge each person in the most optimal way. For example, some people are very conscious of others, and are more likely to be nudged by a social norm nudge than they are a default option.", "With the ever-expanding breadth of big data, the number of inputs into our nudge algorithms will grow massively, and thus the precision of the nudges we use. Technically, however, there are two major challenges:", "The latter point will be a huge area of behavioural research in the coming years. In areas such as personal finance, where face-to-face contact and document completion can be scarce, connecting information such as view-time on specific webpages and transaction history will become important datapoints to relate to behavioural phenomena.", "Such strategies will probably help us design nudges such as personalised defaults too, but this challenge will be more context dependent, and so demand significantly more data. For example, innocuous data such as hours slept gleamed from a health tracker might prompt systems to not only nudge differently, but to present the whole UI differently.", "Technical challenges aren\u2019t the only problems this hyper-nudges will face. Firstly, there\u2019s the data concerns. Namely, collecting so much data, and using data in strange and potentially unnerving ways, will raise huge ethical questions and demand a strong regulatory framework. The apparent bias algorithms already have towards white men (who predominantly create them) is just one example of big data rubbing up against our social fabric.", "Secondly, we should consider nudges themselves. The carpet-bombing approach of nudges has not been a big point of outrage amongst behavioural economists. Instead, many have voiced concerns about transparency and coerciveness. Insofar as these are legitimate concerns, the carpet-bombing approach is actually an advantage \u2014 everyone is equally under Nudge. Hyper-nudges change this calculation.", "We might choose to allow people to opt-out of hyper-nudges, just as we let people de-personalise their social media timelines. On paper, this solves most of the problems around data security and ethics. But what if hyper-nudges are so good, opting out becomes a really costly idea? What if, without hyper-nudges, the services we use become noticeably worse? In other words, what if we have no choice?", "This is a classic economic-technological problem, and we\u2019ve already seen it play out on social media. Facebook, trustworthy or not, is a better service when fed lots of information. Personalised, targeted ads may be off-putting, but if you have to see an ad, why not one you might actually find useful?", "Hyper-nudges offer many advantages, and used correctly, will streamline cumbersome parts of our lives and improve our decision making. But challenges remain, both technically, ethically and socially, and no amount of nudging will make them go away.", "Stuart Mills is a PhD researcher in Behavioural Economics and Metacognitive Nudge Theory at Manchester Metropolitan University", "Your home for data science.
