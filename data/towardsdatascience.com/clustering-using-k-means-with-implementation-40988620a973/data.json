He may not know the names of all of them, but he can still identify that there are four different types and he can do this independently, without the help of an adult. As we don\u2019t need an adult to supervise, clustering is an unsupervised technique.", "The three motivations can be listed as follows.", "Underlying Structure: We can understand that there are different groups, within the groups, there is less variation and between the group, the variation is lesser.", "Natural Classification: We know that there are four different types or groups of animals.", "Summarization: If we now, think of some strategy for maybe their shelter or food, I don\u2019t need to think for all the animals, because a sheep\u2019s food requirement will be different from a Panda, Giraffe or Rhyno but not so much different from another sheep. This can be very important when any company is trying to come up with a customer group specific strategy.", "k-means is arguably the most popular algorithm, which divides the objects into k groups. This has numerous applications as we want to find structure in data. We want to group students, customers, patients, products, movies, tweets, images, and whatnot.", "Let\u2019s now see how it works.", "Input: Data will be given and the value of \u2018k\u2019 will be given", "Step 1: Initialize random \u2018k\u2019 points from the data as the cluster centers, let\u2019s assume the value of k is 2 and the 1st and the 4th observation is chosen as the centers.", "Step 2: For all the points, find the distance from the k cluster centers. Euclidean Distance can be used. The following table is used as an illustration. C1 and C2 columns indicate the distance from the centers respectively.", "If for the 2nd observation, we want to determine the distance from centroid 1, the calculation will look like the following", "Step 3: Every point is assigned to the cluster center it is nearest to and then the cluster center is again computed using arithmetic means", "For the first two points, they are assigned to the cluster 1, the third point is randomly assigned and the last four points are assigned to cluster 2.", "This Step 2 and Step 3 is repeated until convergence", "Essentially, we are trying to find k best representative points. These are selected by taking mean. Hence, we are trying to find the k best representative points iteratively. Hence the name k-means.", "Some of the issues of k-means are", "A good cluster is one where the points are close to the center. How can we find the closeness? We can find the euclidian distance of all the points in that cluster from the cluster center. Now we need to extend this to all clusters. This idea is represented in the equation above and is called the within-cluster sum of the square. Ideally, we would want this to be small. The extreme case, we can have one cluster for each point resulting in WCSS as 0. It also turns out as we increase k, WCSS continues to decrease. Technically, this is called as monotonically decreasing.", "We want to rather stop, where there is a steepest fall or forming kind of an elbow when we are plotting WCSS in the y-axis and the number of clusters in the x-axis.", "Standardization: All distance-based algorithms need the data to be standardized so that no one attribute gets undue importance just because the range of the values is more. The code snippet is given below.", "Clustering: The code snippet is given below", "The code snippet is given below.", "For plotting against the number of clusters", "k-means is here to stay, because of its simplicity, ease of implementation. It easily appears in the top 10 algorithms of ML in any survey. There are shortcomings and also way around to make k-means robust.", "Your home for data science.
