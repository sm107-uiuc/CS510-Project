A manager at the bank is disturbed with an alarming number of customers leaving their credit card services. You have been hired as a data scientist to predict who is gonna get leave their company so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers\u2019 decisions in the opposite direction. A data collector hands you this data to perform Data Analysis and wants you to examine trends & correlations within our data. We would like to do model & predict who will leave our companyNote: Exit Flag is the discrete target variable here for which we have to create the predictive model, but we will also use Credit Limit for another modeling example walkthrough for a continuous predictor.", "In Part 1 of 3 of Data Wrangling, we read in our data file & install all required libraries/packages for our project. We also examine if there are any problems with our dataset, & hence see that there are no issues.", "In Part 2 of 3 of Data Wrangling, we manipulate the data to get only the columns we want & to remove NA & Unknown values in our data. We also examine the dimensions & unique values for our discrete variables.", "Note: We will also remove any rows/entries with a \u201cUnknown\u201d/NA value.", "We see here we initally have 10,127 rows & 23 columns, but we truncate that too 8348 rows by 9 columns.", "In Part 3 of 3 Data Wrangling, we rename our predictor Column Attrition_Flag to Exited_Flag. We also rename the binary output values for this predictor from Existing Customer/Attrited Customer to Current/Exited, respectivley. We lastly, also see the cout of each discrete feature with our discrete predictor.", "Above, we can evidently see that Current Customers had higher mean credit limits than did churning customers.", "In part 1 of 2 in EDA, we reorder the Factor levels of certain discrete variables, because we want them to display in order in our graphs. We have 2 discrete variables plotted against each other, with 1 of the variables being a fill. We examine the count of each visually.", "In part 2 of 2 in EDA, we explore 2 violin plots with quantiles, a visualization for 2 discrete variables, & area distribution plot.", "Quantiles can tell us a wide array of information.", "The 1st horizontal line tells us the 1st quantile, or the 25th percentile- the number that separates the lowest 25% of the group from the highest 75% of the credit limit.", "Next, the 2nd line is the Median, or 50th percentile \u2014 the number in the middle of the credit limit.", "Lastly, the 3rd line is the 3rd quartile, Q3, or 75th percentile \u2014 the number that separates the lowest 75% of the group from the highest 25% of the group.", "Quantiles are shown both in the violin plots above & below.", "We have only 16.07% of customers who have churned. Hence, it\u2019s a bit difficult to train our model to predict churning customers. We will do our best with the data given, as with any model.", "Our goal in modeling is to provide a simple low-dimensional summary of a dataset.We use models to partition data into patterns and residuals. Fitted model is just the closest model from a family of models.", "Classification models are models that predict a categorical label. It will be interesting to study which characteristic(s) discriminates each category and to what extent. Predicting whether a customer will a customer will exit or stay with the company. Below we will use a logistic regression algorithm.", "First we must convert the non numeric variables (discrete variables) into factors. Factors are the data objects which are used to categorize the data and store it as levels.", "We fit the logistic regression model. The first step is to instantiate the algorithm. We declare binomial because 2 possible outcomes: exit/current.", "The significance code \u2018***\u2019 in the above below output shows the relative importance of the feature variablesAIC estimates the relative amount of information lost by a given model:the less information a model loses, the higher the quality of that model. Lower AIC values indicate a better-fit model,", "You have learned techniques of building a classification model in R using the powerful logistic regression algorithm. The baseline accuracy for the training & test data was 84 percent. Overall, the logistic regression model is beating the baseline accuracy by a big margin on both the train and test datasets, and the results are very good.", "Below I will show you another way to model this, using SVM (Support Vector Machine).", "Confidence intervals are of interest in modeling because they are often used in model validation.", "Next, we consider the 95% confidence interval of Credit Limit.As the Credit Limit is greater than 0, we narrow the confidence interval.There are 91.75% data locates within the confidence interval. We will keep the corresponding records and store the rest in another variable rest.data for latter analysis.", "#The following aims to build a model to predict the price. ## Evaluation We will use MSE as the criteria to measure the model performance.", "We Split 20% as test dataset and 80% as training dataset.", "To recal: AIC estimates the relative amount of information lost by a given model: The less information a model loses, the higher the quality of that model. Thus, the lower AIC values indicate a better-fit model,", "The AIC table shows the best model is Credit_Limit ~ Customer_Age + Gender + Dependent_count + Education_Level + Marital_Status + Income_Category + Card_CategoryWith a AIC of 72870.02, we want the lowest AIC.", "Gender Male, Income Categories, and Silver Card Card Categories were highly significant with respect to our predictor of Credit Limit.", "Here is access to the data set & code from my GitHub page:", "Your home for data science.
