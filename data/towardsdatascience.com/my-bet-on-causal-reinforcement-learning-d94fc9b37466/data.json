Causal modeling is the building of models that can explicitly represent and reason cause and effect (the recent popular science book The Book of Why provides an accessible introduction to the topic).", "In recent years, the machine learning research community has expressed growing interest in both fields. This interest in reinforcement learning has been fueled by significant achievements in combining deep learning and reinforcement learning to create agents capable of defeating human experts. Prominent examples include the ancient strategy game Go and team-based competitions in the fantasy computer game Dota 2. Some think deep reinforcement learning is the path to generalized AI.", "Speaking of playing games, human agents \u201cplay\u201d the \u201cgame\u201d of living life by forming causal models of their environment. These are conceptual models (\u201cthis is a baseball, that is a window\u201d) with causal relationships between objects (\u201cif I throw the baseball at the window, it will shatter\u201d). Causal models allows us transfer knowledge to new unfamiliar situations (\u201cI bet if I throw this weird new hard heavy thing at that strange new brittle glassy thing, it will also break\u201d).", "Humans reason with these models when deciding what actions to perform and not to perform. Have you ever thought about your actions in a given situation and thought, \u201chad I done things differently, things would have turned out better.\u201d That is called counterfactual regret, and it is a form of causal reasoning. You use a model of cause-and-effect in your head to mentally simulate how things would have played out if you had made different decisions. Counterfactual regret is the difference between this simulated would-be outcome and the outcome that actually played out. You are making use of powerful cognitive machinery when you make decisions you believe will avoid regretful outcomes based on causal reasoning about past decision-making.", "Some game playing agents, such as the one that recently defeated human poker experts in no-limit Texas hold\u2019em, do a brute-force version of minimizing counterfactual regret by simulating millions of games. This relies on far more experience and computing resources than a human player.", "I\u2019m focused on implementation. While there are endless deep reinforcement programming tutorials online. However, there is a lack of practical case studies on incorporating causal modeling in programming reinforcement learning. There is a bit of research (e.g. schema networks by Vicarious AI), but I haven\u2019t actually seen any code. For example, what is the best way to combine programming abstractions in causal modeling such as Pearl\u2019s do-operations with dynamic programming in reinforcement learning? My hope is that bringing the theory and methods of causal modeling to bear on programming RL may lead to building useful programming abstractions for building better RL agents, particularly those who can deal with unfamiliar situations with only a few real or simulated experiences, just like we humble humans.", "I say I\u2019m \u201cbetting\u201d on this instead of making a prediction because bets are predictions with skin in the game. I\u2019m working on this problem when I could be working on deepfakes or transformer networks (both highly worthwhile, lucrative, and somewhat horrifying pursuits) because I think this will pay-off.", "I see something of an arbitrage opportunity. Commercial applications of deep reinforcement learning are virtually non-existent, excepting for the massive amounts of money dumped into OpenAI and Deepmind so they can play video games (nothing wrong with that).", "However, the core theory in RL is the same theory that powers various elements of decision science; sequential experimentation, optimization, decision theory, game theory, auction design, etc. Applying these branches of theory to decision problems is precisely where data scientists have had the most impact, especially in tech.", "Causal modeling is the thread that connects all of these fields. It even brings in computational cognitive psychology, where one models the causal models humans have in their heads. This allows one to model human irrationality, like cognitive biases and fallacies, from data on how their behavior. In my eyes, advertisers spend a great deal of time getting people to spend their money irrationally.", "I think causal reinforcement learning will be the holy grail of marketing. Imagine a Black Mirror episode where they could spin up a cognitive clone of you in a digital pocket world and run a million simulations testing what products you\u2019ll buy. It\u2019d be like that.", "Your home for data science.
