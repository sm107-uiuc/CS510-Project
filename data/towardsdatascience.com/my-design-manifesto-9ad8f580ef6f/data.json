In this post, I will share my design philosophy and how I wish to approach a design problem in the future. I will be drawing from my experience of participating in four design sprints during class. Special thanks to Pablo Stanley for his beautiful comics on design.", "The design sprints ranged from redesigning a web app for mobile to creating tempting visualizations, and from using Leap Motion for something \u201cfun\u201d to using emerging technologies to build a better future. Following are a few of the results from my four projects.", "In a Computer Science curriculum filled with rigorous, technical courses, this course on HCI came as a relief to me. Almost. Clich\u00e9 as it sounds, I was encouraged to approach problems with a broader mindset. We made use of the double-diamond process of design thinking in our projects.", "In all creative processes a number of possible ideas are created (\u2018divergent thinking\u2019) before refining and narrowing down to the best idea (\u2018convergent thinking\u2019), and this can be represented by a diamond shape. But the Double Diamond indicates that this happens twice \u2014 once to confirm the problem definition and once to create the solution. \u2014 British Design Council", "In reality, the process is more complicated. There are many stages of user testing and feedback, each of which can significantly change the direction your project is headed. Sometimes, you come out with a usable product. At other times, everything is a hot mess.", "Following are a few of the lessons I learned over the course of the semester.", "You are not designing for yourself, so resist putting your preferences over your user\u2019s. By striving to understand your user, you take a big leap toward identifying the real problem.", "Designers are trained to discover the real problems. A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all: solve the correct problem. \u2014 Don Norman, Design of Everyday Things", "Acknowledge that your user may not be able to clearly communicate their issues. As Andrew Ko suggests in How to understand problems, conduct interviews to get a sense of the problem. Otherwise, take them out for lunch and observe them struggle with whatever it is that you are hoping to improve the design of. Institute of Design at Stanford has a guide on things to remember while observing users.", "Do not hold yourself back by worrying that the tools necessary to execute your ideas may not exist. Ideate as though you have all the resources in the world. Encourage participation within the team.", "Once the initial brainstorming is done, promote critique and feedback. I do not believe that all ideas are \u201cuseful\u201d or deserve the same level of consideration. You do want to reach consensus eventually, but no good is done without (respectfully) challenging ideas that you think need more thought.", "If you are short on ideas, look around and see what has already been built. As Austin Kleon aptly puts it, \u201csteal like an artist.\u201d", "Strive to understand the limits of your tools. Undoubtedly, knowing how to code adds value to the team, however, all designers need not learn to code. After all, they \u201conly\u201d need to be able to estimate the effort an engineering task may require. Of course, software development is notoriously unpredictable and this skill comes only after working alongside engineers for a period of time.", "In my experience, during the Leap Motion and VR sprints, we could have prevented a lot of communication headache had we all spent some time figuring out the constraints of the technology. It would have also enabled us to better empathize with one another.", "Users value the effort that you have put in. If you go with the first solution that works, you deprive yourself of the joy that comes from going the extra mile. You are then left to wonder what the project could have been.", "I experienced this first-hand during my Leap Motion project. Even though we did Wizard-of-Oz testing for many games, we chose Slither.io because it seemed straightforward to implement. The result? We did not feel accomplished, and as shown below, our users mostly reacted with a \u201cmeh.\u201d", "When you explore the limitless possibilities, as I wrote above, you can spark energy within your team. In the Design for the Future sprint, two of my teammates came up with an engaging narrative for our choose-your-own-adventure game. Although the storyline turned out to be too long to fully implement during the two-week sprint, it got all of us excited and even provided the breadth to experiment toward the end.", "This is a follow-up to the previous principle. In the real world, you do not always get to choose what you work on. But if you do, contribute first to whatever inspires you the most about the project. Duh!", "Some people like to think about the bigger picture, while others like to fix the details. Personally, I am a fan of adding what is known in design-speak as an affordance. It is a cue which suggests how an interface element can be used.", "How can a person know what affordances an interface has? That\u2019s where the concept of a signifier becomes important. Signifiers are any sensory or cognitive indicator of the presence of an affordance. \u2014 Andrew Ko, A Theory of User Interfaces", "Following are two signifiers that I particularly liked.", "Don\u2019t overcomplicate. Feature bloat is a real thing, and it occurs when you disregard how your users are going to interact with the new features.", "If your users do not care about a dark mode, the pro-redditer in you cannot justify adding one to your design.", "On similar lines, don\u2019t fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy. Oftentimes, it is tempting to keep pursuing a potential solution after having spent considerable effort into it. However, if you know of a way to simplify the existing design, consider getting an expert\u2019s opinion or even A/B testing on a small scale.", "I learned this the hard way during our visualization project. We had spent so many hours creating an animated world map using JQVMap that even after learning that Tableau could achieve a similar result within minutes, we stuck to our original plan. That was also a result of us not prototyping the right way. In his book Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design, Bill Buxton suggests that early prototypes are supposed to invite suggestions and should not contain personal biases or attachment. Had we been open to change, we could have saved time and utilized it to create a more compelling visualization.", "Once you receive feedback from your users, do not prioritize based on the time it takes for your team to make a certain change (fix). On your to-do list, place on top the tasks that maximize your users\u2019 joy of interaction.", "Usability is generally treated separately from aesthetics. \u2026 As the ease of use strategies do not appear to pay off, this has left us in the curious situation that we have products, which look good at first sight, but frustrate us as soon as we start interacting with them. We think that the emphasis should shift from a beautiful appearance to beautiful interaction, of which beautiful appearance is a part. \u2014 Taken from Let\u2019s Make Something Engaging", "If a change takes only ten minutes to implement then, by all means, go ahead. If it is any longer, pause and analyze which changes would enhance the user experience the most. To guide your analysis, take a look at the Laws of UX.", "An example where we had our priorities straight was with the sounds effects in the VR game. Before user testing, we knew that the transition between two scenes of the story could be smoother. Our testers agreed and stressed that the sounds needed to fade in or out to create a more organic feel. The VR web framework A-Frame did not have good documentation on the sound component, but we persisted and were able to implement a crossfade audio effect.", "Identifying your primary users is key. Recognize trade-offs and, if needed, let go of your secondary users.", "Trying to please everyone is a recipe for stress, misery, lost resources and frustration. So don\u2019t be afraid to lose people, be afraid to lose your vision. \u2014 Unknown", "In the redesign of Bucknell\u2019s Campus Theatre website, our goal was to tailor the app to the needs of the visitors of Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Due to limited time, we had to decide between a \u201cThings to do\u201d screen and an in-app ticket checkout. We eventually chose the former because we agreed that learning about ongoing activities made for an essential aspect of a visitor\u2019s experience.", "As I mentioned earlier, the principles are my lessons from only a semester of diving into the field of Human-Computer Interaction. I claim no expertise, but after this course, I am glad that I am starting to form my own opinions about what good design entails.", "Design thinking is messy and certainly not straightforward. It involves more than just beautiful user interfaces. Having clarity in your vision is as important as focusing on the users of your product. It enables you to really understand the problem at hand and make justifiable compromises. A good design does not necessarily involve an overly engineered solution. However, you need to follow the basics. Getting early feedback on your low-fidelity prototypes, coupled with good (sometimes selfless) prioritization, can set you up for success.", "In this course, I also learned a great deal about accessibility, an area I had not dealt with previously. It was refreshing to see problems from a different perspective, and I only wish we had more time for those problems in class. Design is a rapidly evolving field, so it is reasonable and quite common for newcomers, like me, to feel overwhelmed. It takes effort to go from bad design to good design, regardless of how one chooses to define them, but being open to new challenges can go a long way.", "If you liked this, please check out my other Medium posts and my personal blog.
