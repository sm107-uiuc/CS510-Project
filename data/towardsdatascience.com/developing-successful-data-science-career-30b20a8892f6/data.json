Enduring love is hard. Here are 5 facts you should know before going for the first date and building a long term relationship with Data Science. Finally, you can find out how committed the community is to Data Science via a live survey.", "Disclaimer: all opinions are mine. I use \u201cData Science\u201d, \u201cMachine Learning\u201d, and \u201cAnalytics\u201d interchangeably.", "Like What You Read? Follow me on Medium, LinkedIn, or Twitter.", "I came by an entertaining and provocative video by Wisecrack recently. It explores what true love is and the dynamics between modern-day couples. It reminded me of our relationships with \u201cData Science\u201d (or any career).", "Here is the gist in case you are busy:", "Let\u2019s draw a parallel to a career in Data Science.", "You fall in love with Data Science at first sight because it\u2019s so sexy \u2014 well, it\u2019s the sexiest job of the 21 century. Who won\u2019t get carried away? So, swipe right.", "Then, you go out for a date with the best suit, makeup, or whatever you want to do to impress. Data Science shows off all the fantastic possibilities and fancy gadgets. In fact, Data Science likes you so much and decides to give you an offer to explore things further.", "Next, you ended up getting married by signing the offer (oops). In a Disney movie, this is when Cinderella and Prince Charming live happily after. The movie ends; the curtain drops; the crowd claps and cry in joy.", "But in reality, Prince Charming gets lazy (and probably fat). Cinderella gets grumpy (and probably wrinkly). Baby Cinderella keeps crying. King Charming gets sick. Uncle Charming starts a civil war. Finally, the Prince runs away like a coward.", "Now, you start to question if Data Science is for you and start looking for new jobs. The vicious cycle begins. You fall in love with something else, get frustrated, look for a way out, repeat. Getting into Data Science is just like finding relationships using Tinder.", "So, why don\u2019t we focus on finding the right person (e.g. a data science career) and sustaining a good relationship?", "I believe everyone wants happy, fulfilling, and healthy relationships, personally and career-wise. The key to building such relationships is to understand and be honest about reality.", "Here are 5 important (pseudo) facts to help you do that:", "Fact 1: Data Science uses the best selfie filter. Employers want to portrait Data Science roles in the best light possible. This is understandable. So, ask about what they do every day. Don\u2019t get fooled by the profile picture.", "Fact 2: Chores never end. \u201cThere is no free lunch.\u201d Everything comes with a cost. Being in love and having a good relationship are no exceptions. Be aware of the boring stuff you have to do to enjoy the fun of Data Science.", "Fact 3: Family dynamics can be complicated. Many data science teams are trying to prove value to Business, Engineering, and Product counterparts. This can cause tension, confusion, and frustration.", "Fact 4: Dogs are cute; kids can be annoying. Making prototypes is like having a dog. It takes less work and heart-warming. In contrast, deploying ML to production is like having kids. It takes a lot more work and is annoying when things break, especially in the middle of the night.", "Fact 5: Change is the only constant. Just like us, Data Science changes over time. We don\u2019t know what it will become in the next 5 and 10 years. Being receptive and adaptive to change is critical in a relationship. Keep learning and be curious, or be left behind.", "Recognizing, understanding, and accepting these facts are major steps toward a healthy and sustainable relationship.", "\u201cLove is above all construction that lasts. Real love is that triumphs lastingly, sometimes painfully, over the hurdles erected by time, space, and the world.\u201d", "So, is your love for Data Science real?", "Like What You Read?
