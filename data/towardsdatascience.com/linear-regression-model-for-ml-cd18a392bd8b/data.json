While it is relatively simple and might not seem fancy enough when compared to other Machine Learning algorithms, it remains widely used across various domains such as Biology, Social Sciences, Finance, Marketing.

It will serve as an excellent guide for last-minute revisions or to develop a mindmap for studying Linear Regression in detail.", "Note: Throughout this article, we will work with the popular Boston Housing Dataset which can be imported directly in Python using sklearn.datasets or in R using the library MASS(Modern Applied Statistics Functions). The code chunks are written in R.", "Linear Regression is a statistical/machine learning technique that attempts to model the linear relationship between the independent predictor variables X and a dependent quantitative response variable Y. It is important that the predictor and response variables be numerical values. A general linear regression model can be represented mathematically as", "Since the linear regression model approximates the relationship between Y and X, by capturing the irreducible error term we get", "Here, we will use Linear Regression to predict Median House Value (Y/response variable = medv)for 506 neighborhoods around Boston.", "Using Linear Regression to predict median house values will help answer the following five questions:", "Depending on the number of predictor variables, Linear Regression can be classified into two categories:", "The simplicity of linear regression model can be attributed to its core assumptions. However, these assumptions introduce bias in the model which leads to over-generalization/under-fitting (More about Bias-Variance Tradeoff).", "An easy to remember acronym for the assumption of Linear Regression Model is LINE", "LINE \u2014 a simple acronym that captures the four assumptions of Linear Regression Model.", "A simple learning regression model predicts the response variable Y using a single predictor variable X.

Therefore, their relationship can be represented as", "The goal is to fit a linear model by estimating the coefficients that fits as close to the 506 datapoints as possible. The difference between the predicted and the observed value is the error which needs to be minimized to find best fit.
