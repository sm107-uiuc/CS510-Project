In this blog, I will take you through random variables. What if I say random variables are not variables but are functions which take up random values. I used the word function in the above definition. Let us start by understanding what functions are in mathematics.", "Imagine you have a juice vending machine and you have only 3 fruits: apple, mango and banana. You input apple to the machine and you get apple juice as output. Similarly, with mango you get mango juice and with banana, you get banana juice.", "Here we can see two sets:", "Both these sets are related to each other through the juice vending machine. Similarly, mathematical functions are also mapping between two sets: Input set and Output set. These are related to each other by a rule which is called f(x). Let f(x) = 2x + 1.Now if you input 1 to this function, you will get 3 as output. For -2, the output will be -3 and for input 5, the output will be 11.", "In the example of the fruit juice above, the input set was fruits and output set was fruit juices and these two sets were related to each other by the juicer machine which was our f(x).", "Random variables are also functions whose input set is the outcome of a random experiment and the output set is a set of real numbers. These are represented by a capital letter(Eg. X) Consider an experiment of tossing a coin. We can have two outcomes: Heads or Tails. Let us map Heads to 1 and Tails to 0.", "In the same way, we can map any experiment outcome to real numbers using random variables. Take another example where we have three balls of different colours in a box: Red, Green and Blue. So we map the outcome of the experiment in the following way.", "Now one will ask, why do we do such mapping? To understand this let me put a few probability questions:", "Don\u2019t you feel this approach of representing probability is tedious? We need to find a way to represent these probabilities in a mathematical form so that we can perform mathematical operations on them. This is achieved using Random Variables. Now I will rewrite the above probabilities using random variables.", "As we can see, the random variable approach is more compact and provides a convenient way of performing mathematical operations.", "But why is it called a variable and also random? Let us consider our fruit juice example above. Our input to juice machine is fruit. But which fruit? Fruit can be apple, banana or mango. So what can we say about the value of fruit? Is it fixed or variable? Since the value of fruit can take any value from fruit set, it is variable. So anything whose value is not fixed is called variable. If we take X as the outcome of tossing of a coin where Heads will be mapped to 1 and Tails to 0. So what values X can take? X can be 0 or X can be 1. In this way, random variables are treated as a variable.", "Let us now extend our fruit juice example. Now you own the juice shop which sells the 3 juices. So your customers will come and ask for any of the 3 juices. Can you as a shopkeeper tell with certainty which juice the next customer will demand? Based on your past experience you can only guess but cannot say anything with 100 per cent certainty. The demand for the type of fruit juice is random and can take any value. Similarly, when you toss a coin, can you say with certainty whether it will be Heads or Tails or when you throw a die, can you predict its outcome what number will come? So the random variables are called random because the value of this variable cannot be defined with certainty, we can only make a guess and this guess is called the probability of having a particular value of a random variable. In coin toss experiment, P(X=1) = 0.5. So we can only say that there is a 50 per cent chance of Heads.", "But then what is the difference between the variable x in the equation :", "and the variable X of tossing a coin. If I tell you the value of y=1, what can you tell about the value of x? Can\u2019t you say with full certainty that the value of x will be 0? So here the variable x is deterministic and not random. So this cannot be called a Random Variable.", "From the discussion above we can say a random variable is a function which maps outcomes of a random experiment to real numbers. Since this is the input set to the function so it is called Domain of the random variable and is represented by \u03a9. While the output set or Co Domain is a set of real numbers represented by \u211d. In function notation, it can be defined like this:", "For convenience, we omit the bracket part and write it simply as X = 0 or X = 1 which makes it look more like a variable rather than a function.", "I hope this has cleared the concept of random variables and now you can see why we treat Random variables more as a variable and not as a function, although random variables are actually functions!", "Your home for data science.
