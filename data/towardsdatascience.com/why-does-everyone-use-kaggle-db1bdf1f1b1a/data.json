Finding a community to share code, data, and ideas can seem also seem like an overwhelming as well as farfetched task. But, there is one spot where all of these characteristics come together. That place is called Kaggle. I was first introduced to this platform in school to see where I would place in an accuracy challenge for a machine learning model competition at the start of my first class in my program, and then again during my last class. I was working towards my master\u2019s degree in data science with a focus on machine learning. I quickly realized that there are hundreds and even thousands of data scientists trying to improve and submit their scores to various challenges. It was daunting at first to see the great number of intelligent and motivated people all competing. That was one way to look at it, but I changed my mindset and thought, this place is not just for ranking your skills, but a place where you can compare code and learn new ideas from those same bright minds. I was thankful I got this exposure during the nearly first week into my journey as a data scientist \u2014 because I would quickly learn that I would refer back to this website often.", "Below, I will list the benefits of Kaggle and why every data scientist should use it.", "What is Kaggle? Kaggle [3] is a website for sharing ideas, getting inspired, competing against other data scientists, learning new information and coding tricks, as well as seeing various examples of real-world data science applications. There are plenty of datasets that can be utilized for anything as simple as video game sales, to something more complex and important like air pollution data. This data is real and referenced, so you can train and test your models on projects that could eventually help real people.", "There are plenty of other useful features of Kaggle like data, code, community, inspiration, competition, and courses. I will detail these benefits down below so that you find some helpful use out of Kaggle.", "Kaggle includes several benefits, of which, I will list below. These are the reasons everyone uses this website, and why you should too.", "There are several datasets for use on Kaggle. Here [4], you can see a list of datasets, as well as search by name for specific datasets that can be ingested in your future data science model. Most of the datasets are in CSV file format. Less popular, but still useful, are the datasets in the JSON format, SQLite, archives, and BigQuery. It can be beneficial to practice working with various file formats, just how you would expect to at your data science job. Here are three examples of the \u2018hottest\u2019 datasets right now.", "\u2014 COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge", "\u2014 ProZorro. Ukrainian public procurement dataset", "Code is plentiful on Kaggle. If you want to see countless examples of code from other Kaggle users, you can easily search Notebooks that include code, as well as text where most users comment their code nicely. It is a great way to learn, practice, and see how others perform similar problems. I would say most people code in Python, but there are other programming languages such as R, SQLite, and Julia.", "Code is usually found in a notebook form, also known as a Jupyter Notebook, in a .ipynb file. You can see several examples that will show end-to-end machine learning models. Some including, data ingestion and cleansing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, base model creation, final machine learning model implementation, and output and interpretation of results. This process is commonly used by most data scientists in their careers because it is a simple and easy-t-follow format for other data scientists as well as stakeholders that you will eventually be working with.", "Like Medium, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and LinkedIn, Kaggle serves as a community where data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers can come to learn, grow, and network. You can post your work (data, code, and notebooks) that can be ultimately shared to grow your own community. Being a part of a community also has its own benefits, so I highly recommend starting on Kaggle to grow your own community and reach out to other communities as well.", "Because there is data, code, community, courses, and competitions, you may be subjected to awesome inspiration. Seeing others perform well in a competition that helps people or companies is highly inspiring. If you are stuck on what to learn next, or how to perform a certain function, perhaps see how someone would implement a certain model like random forest in a specific fashion, you can see all of this in one spot, ultimately inspiring you to create better work.", "If you want to test yourself, see how you rank amongst peers, look good on your resume, make some extra cash, or most importantly, help people, competitions are the way to go. Kaggle offers countless competitions serving all the aforementioned benefits. The above screenshot shows the top three competitions and their respective payout. As you can see, these are not just fun competitions, but they are also for the greater good (e.g. health).", "I used Kaggle competitions to see how I would perform with little data science knowledge versus performing with nearly two years of data science experience. As you can imagine, I improved considerably. In the Kaggle screenshot from the Kaggle section of my article, I show that I was in about the top 50% out of nearly 8,000 people \u2014 not bad for a few days of work. Now you can see how this could benefit a cause that can identify some health abnormality when thousands or even hundreds of thousands of data scientists compete to achieve the same goal.", "Somewhat new to me is finding out that Kaggle has data science courses. There are around 14 courses you can take, and they are listed below. I personally like how there are some SQL courses, because you will most likely need SQL as a data scientist, and not just Python. Also unique from other course websites are both the Machine Learning Explainability and Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning. Here [6] are all the courses found on their website as well:", "Kaggle offers plenty of resources for aspiring to advanced data scientists. Benefits of this website include, but are not limited to: data, code, community, inspiration, competitions, and courses.", "I hope you found this article interesting and helpful! Feel free to follow for more articles on data science. Thank you!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Sr/MS Data Scientist.
