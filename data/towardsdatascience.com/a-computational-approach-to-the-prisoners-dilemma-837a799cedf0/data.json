A few days later, the cops pick the two of you up and put you in two separate interrogation rooms such that you have no communication with each other. You think your life is over, but the police offer up a deal:", "Rat your friend out, and your sentence will be lighter.", "The catch is that your friend is offered this deal, too.", "More specifically, if you rat your friend out but your friend says nothing, they get a heavy sentence and you get a light one. If you rat each other out, there\u2019s a heavy penalty for both. If both of you stay silent, the sentences are light for you and your friend.", "The decisions must be made without communicating with each other, and both you and your friend only have two choices: \u201cdefect\u201d and rat them out, or \u201cwithhold\u201d information from the cops and stay silent.", "Take a look at the following diagram that describes your choices and sentences:", "The matrix describes the number of years the two of you get depending on what you and your friend independently choose to do. The first number represents your prison time and the second represents your friend\u2019s.", "For example, if you withhold information from the cops, but your friend chooses to rat you out, you get five years in a maximum-security prison but your friend only gets one.", "What would you do in this situation?", "What should you do in this situation?", "There\u2019s no easy solution to this problem and there are a lot of interpretations to this. A utilitarian might say withholding is the better option because it minimizes the total number of years either person spends in prison (5 + 1 or 3 + 3 as opposed to 10 + 10). What does probability say?", "I created a population of 1000 prisoners, each with a 50\u201350 chance of being a defector or withholder. I then simulated an interaction for 500 pairs of prisoners and took note of the outcomes. I repeated this experiment 200 times.", "As you can see, if the number of defectors and withholders is roughly the same, it\u2019s far better to attempt to withhold information. Most of the time, the payoff will be in your favor. The average number of years a defector spent in prison was 5.75 years vs. a withholders 4.01.", "We can make this a bit more interesting by varying the proportion of defectors and withholders. Say you\u2019re in a country where everyone is untrusting of one another and that 75% of the population is a defector vs. 25% withholder.", "Your best bet is to withhold information from the police. This makes sense, since if you were to defect as well there\u2019s a much higher probability that you\u2019ll end up with the worst option in the game \u2014 10 years a piece.", "Let\u2019s try one more. Say everyone is overly trusting (despite the fact that they\u2019ve just committed a murder).", "This one is more interesting. It seems that you\u2019d be slightly better off withholding information, but the payoff is wildly inconsistent (and in some cases ends up being worse than defecting!). This is because the possible sentences for withholding while the other defects can be either three or five years while the possible sentences for defecting while the other withholds can be either one or ten years. The difference between 3 and 5 is a lot less than the difference between 1 and 10 \u2014 so there\u2019s a lot more variance in the latter scenario.", "What would you do in this particular situation?", "If you enjoyed this article, you can follow me on Medium for more content like this.
