For those like me, who are plugging away on an older laptop \u2014 the main highlight is the free access to accelerated hardware GPU/TPU for larger projects.", "For the Phase 4 Project of my data science boot camp, I set out to build an image classifier to aide in diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-rays. Excited to embark on my first computer vision assignment (cue laser eyes), I hurried over to Kaggle to download the dataset. My computer informed me it would take 4 hours to download the zip file of almost 6,000 JPEGs. Oh no. As I watched the \u201cestimated time remaining\u201d continue to increase, I began to fill with dread about what this bode for the upcoming model training times. In the tenet of the greyscale society trapped in infomercials: \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be a better way!\u201d", "Enter Google Colab. Set up to run Python in a similar user style as Jupyter, Colab is optimized to assist with high processing needs by providing access to hosted GPU/TPU (see more here about runtimes). All you need to get started is a Google account. Your Colab notebooks will be saved in your Google Drive, but to access your files from Colab you will need to connect to (or \u2018mount\u2019) your Drive into your notebook at the start of each session.", "Colab\u2019s virtual machine operates out of the \u2018content\u2019 folder (shown left). Any data you wish to work with during your session should be stored in this folder.", "To keep the servers available for the maximum amount of users there are limits to usage at a free or paid tier:", "The kernel will time out after 30 minutes of inactively \u2014 meaning all variables will need to be reloaded.", "The entire contents of the virtual machine ( \u2018/content\u2019) will be cleared after 12 hours. Thus, the data will need to be reimported at the start of each 12 hour stretch.", "For about $10 monthly, the kernel inactivity time-out will increase to 90 minutes. The contents of the virtual machine will now be cleared after 24 hours.", "Alright, I\u2019ve got my driving gloves on and seatbelt buckled. I am ready to go full throttle. But how do I get my data into Colab when I can barely get it onto my computer? One solution is to download the data directly from Kaggle into Colab \u2014 bypassing my local computer entirely.", "Since Colab clears all data from \u2018/content\u2019 after 12/24 hours, I will download the dataset into my Google Drive for storage (and access from anywhere). I will also need to add some code to the top of my Colab project notebook to load it in from Drive for each session. The most efficient way to do this, is to keep the file on Drive in its compressed, zipped state. Even though they are both Google external machines, they do not operate on the same servers. You will need to copy the zip file from Drive to the Colab virtual machine (\u2018/content\u2019) at the start of each new session and unzip it there. Otherwise, you will need to load in each, individual file from Drive \u2014 and didn\u2019t we arrive here for speed?", "Once everything has been configured properly it is quite simple and quick to use. Below is the code to get it set up.", "4. Configure a \u2018Kaggle Environment\u2019 using OS. This will store the API key and value as an OS environ object/variable. When you run Kaggle terminal commands (in the next step), your machine will be linked to your account through your API token. Linking to the private directory in your Drive ensures that your token information will remain hidden to those you may choose to share notebooks with.", "This can be done one time in a seperate notebook. Once downloaded, you can store the data as long as needed on your Drive.", "2. Go to the competition page for your data. Copy the pre-formatted API command from the dataset page you wish to download (for example, this Xray image set).", "3. Navigate into the directory where you would like to store the data. Paste the API command. Keep the file zipped to save space on your Drive and to import to Colab more efficiently.", "When you are ready to use the data in Colab, you will need to copy it from long term storage location on your Drive (\u2018/gdrive/\u2019) to the temporary virtual machine ('/content') at the start of each session.", "You will be able to use this unzipped data with the Colab accelerated GPU/TPU for up to 12 hours (if free access) or 24 hours (if PRO). You can reload it from Drive as many times as needed.", "I was able to train TensorFlow CNN models for image classification in minutes using Google Colab. Downloading the data directly into Google Drive allowed me to spare memory on my machine and bypass a treacherous download time. Once stored on Drive, it was easy to import the data into Colab. All the time saved could be spent trying out additional model architecture or browsing the internet for pygmy versions of your favorite animals.
