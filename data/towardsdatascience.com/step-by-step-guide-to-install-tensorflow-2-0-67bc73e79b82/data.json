Before going forward it is important to know,", "I recommend reading [1] and [2] to know more details on the benefits of TensorFlow 2.0. In summary, TF 2.0 has brought the ease-of-implementation along with immense computational efficiency, and compatibility with any platform, such as, Android, iOS and embedded systems like a Raspberry Pi and Edge TPUs.", "Achieving these were difficult before and required investing time on finding alternate ways.
