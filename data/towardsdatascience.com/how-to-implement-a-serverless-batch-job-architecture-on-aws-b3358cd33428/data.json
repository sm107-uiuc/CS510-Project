The basic premise behind the architecture is that we want to use managed services of AWS to run batch jobs. If you want to know more about this architecture, go here for more details. The overall picture of this architecture looks like this:", "In short, the architecture consists of one block of components for development and another one for executing a batch job. For this blog post, we focus only on the managed services of this architecture. There is also a public code repository that allows you to reproduce the full service and all its parts based on Cloudformation scripts.", "Cloud providers advertise managed services with two central promises. First, the cloud provider manages maintenance and other low-level responsibilities. A customer can, therefore, focus on the functionalities and architectures. Second, managed services tend to be cheaper because you only pay for what you use without significant upfront investments.", "Managed services enable serverless designs. In other words, architectures that free you from many concerns related to your server stacks. This level of abstraction accelerates development and introduces an otherwise impossible level of flexibility concerning the service architecture.", "Let us start with a small primer to CloudFormation scripts. If you already have experience with CloudFormation \u2014 or similar concepts \u2014 you can skim or skip the next three paragraphs.", "CloudFormation is the AWS service for Infrastructure as Code. That is, you define a target infrastructure, push it to AWS, and AWS provisions it for you. You organize your resources in so-called stacks, making it easy to adjust, monitor, or delete them.", "You can write CloudFormation scripts in JSON or YAML files. All examples here and in the code repository are YAML files, but you could do the same thing in JSON.", "There is also a set of CloudFormation specific commands available to you. In the upcoming examples, I use four of them:", "The guiding principle of this architecture is a decoupling of development and production workflow. That is, there are two roles involved here: developers are responsible for implementing business logic, cloud engineers ensure stable operations.", "The development workflow consists of three functionalities \u2014 a code repository, which is the primary tool for collaboration between developers. A build environment clones the repository and turns the code into a container. Finally, an orchestration tool triggers new builds whenever the codebase changes and pushes the result to an image registry. As long as developers make sure the master branch reflects the current state of their work, the container updates automatically.", "The batch job workflow covers two functionalities. First, a computation resource needs to load the container and run it. Second, a trigger needs to start the computation in the required interval.", "The only overlap between the two workflows is the image registry. This reduction to a minimal overlap ensures decoupling between development and production.", "I grouped the implementation details into three subsections that mirror the big picture described above. For each managed service, I explain their role in the architecture and their most relevant parameters. I also provide CloudFormation snippets so that you can link my explanations to actual code.", "Note: these explanations cover only the managed services. but leave out networking and access management. See the two related posts on networking and IAM roles and policies if you want more details.", "The first component of the development workflow is a CodeCommit repository. The only particular configuration for it is the Code section. This section allows you to provide an initial codebase as a ZIP file on S3. I used this in the example to make the whole workflow start directly, but it is optional. However, if you specify a location for your code that is unavailable or not accessible, the stack creation fails. Here\u2019s the related CloudFormation script:", "Second, there is a CodeBuild project. It turns a Source into an image and pushes the result to a container registry. In this case, the source is the CodeCommit repository defined above. The project uses the repository\u2019s HTTP URL to clone it. Note that the specifications of the build come from a buildspec.yml file that is part of the cloned code.", "Once CodeBuild cloned the repository, the image built happens within an Environment you need to specify. There are several parameters you have to understand to make it work as intended:", "Compare this list with the Cloudformation script for further details:", "Finally, there is a CodePipeline for orchestration. It consists of two stages that include a name and a list of actions. Different types of operations require different sets of configuration parameters, so I focus on the main ones here.", "Every change in the master branch triggers the source stage. This stage serves as an initializing stage for the pipeline. The main parameters are the name of the repository, the branch you want to monitor for changes, and a flag that indicates whether the pipeline should pull for changes. If you set this to true, new runs start automatically whenever the repository is updated.", "If sourcing was successful, the build stage begins. All the pipeline needs is a valid reference to the CodeBuild project described above.", "Here\u2019s the part of CloudFormation script that covers the pipeline:", "There are way more actions available to CodePipeline than the ones I listed. For instance, you could replace the source repository with one on GitHub or Bitbucket and replace the pulling for changes with a webhook. Consider this setup as a starting point for your experiments.", "Using the Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is easy. All you need to do is to define the name of a repository:", "As you can see, choosing the registry as a link is a powerful way to decouple development and execution. As long as the development workflow pushes images to the image repository, it does not break the batch job workflow.", "The computational heart of the batch job is the Fargate task. But we need a managed place to run them first, namely a cluster on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). Fortunately, all we need to implement that is its cluster name:", "However, there is more configuration involved in the task definition. There are two groups of values to set: general parameters and container definitions. Let\u2019s start with the general settings:", "These parameters define the frame in which the image runs. Let\u2019s have a look at the exact container definitions next:", "Now that the task is in place, we need to add a way to trigger it regularly. This function is taken over by a CloudWatch rule. The ScheduleExpression defines how often the trigger fires. The State parameter specifies whether the trigger is active once CloudFormation deploys it. The more substantial part of the configuration are the targets of the trigger, so I want to provide you with more details:", "Here is the complete specification in CloudFormation:", "For the sake of completeness, here is how I specified the two S3 buckets in a CloudFormation script. Be aware that it is possible to define lifecycle policies or other more nuanced configurations:", "I hope this post helped you to understand better how each managed service contributes to the serverless workflow. Again, if you want to know more about the architecture, refer to the conceptual post. If you\u2019re going to rebuild it, look at the public code repository.", "Let me know your thoughts and experiences in the comments. I am also happy to connect on Twitter and LinkedIn.
