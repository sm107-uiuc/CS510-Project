Having always written code in R, people often tend to dismiss me for not being a \u2018real Data Scientist\u2019 or probably not knowing anything about NLP. However, this is very far from reality.", "NLP is literally the processing of textual data to gain insights from it. The beauty of programming languages like R and Python is that they have a variety of packages that can derive meaning from human languages. This includes, but is not limited to, grammar, translation, and sentiment analysis.", "This article goes through the basics of NLP in Python with code examples to complete common NLP tasks.", "The most common packages used for NLP in Python are SPACY and NLTK. To import these packages into your script, refer to the below code block.", "NLTK is a large package and as such you need to download various components of it (such as stopwords) for text processing.", "Now, let\u2019s look at common tasks that you may need to carry out when dealing with text.", "It is always a good idea to pre-process text to get rid of special characters, punctuation, replace empty strings, remove numbers, and convert everything to the same case (lowercase for example) so that identical words are not seen as distinct words because of their case. The following code block can be useful.", "Often, we may want to summarize the text by determining the average number of words and average number of characters for all strings in a given column.", "Regular expression matching or looking for words or phrases within a string is a common function that is performed. We can do this by simply checking to see if one string is within another. I have done this within a function below where my score allocation is based on the number of substrings that are found within \u201cmy_string\u201d.", "We can also look for exact matches of strings using the \u201cfindall\u201d function. In the code below, I am looking for bi-grams (phrases consisting of two words) within my column of interest. I use \u201cset\u201d to only retain unique matches. The function \u201clen\u201d is used to count these matches.", "There are smart ways to check whether two strings are similar and Python has an entire package devoted to it called textdistance. The package contains more than 30 algorithms that allows one to compare strings. In the example below, I have used cosine similarity to measure the similarity between the summary text between two documents. This metric calculates the dot product between the vectors of two strings in order to find the cosine angle between them. It judges similarity based on the orientation between the strings rather than magnitude/length of the strings.", "Cosine similarity requires a string to be split into tokens or words in a sentence for comparison.", "I often get asked to determine word frequencies. Yes, word clouds are good for visualisation, but what if you wanted to list this information and store it in .csv file.", "In the code below, I take a column called \u201cDescription\u201d and join all the text into one long list. I then remove stop words (commonly used words that do not carry meaning such as \u201ca\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d, \u201cthen\u201d etc). I also perform lemmatization. This is to remove words that are identical in their purest form such as typing and type, organizations and organization.", "I then use the \u201cCollections\u201d package to find the top 200 words and bi-grams by their frequency, which I then output into a csv file. Python is nifty in that it has functions that allow you to measure the frequency of n-grams (unigrams, tri-grams, etc).", "Hopefully, you can now successfully do the following:", "Let me know what you think of this blog post and other common NLP functions that you have come across.
