Some of us hold an obsession with that time. They had their own numeral system. Recently, I was watching a TED Talk, \u201cThe Skill of Humor\u201d by Andrew Tarvin.", "Now, he has a joke about Roman Numerals at 18:30 with the basic idea of forming English words with Roman Numerals (taken as alphabets).", "Now, Romans with their gift of many Latin roots in English have a good share of English words in their bag. But, what if we just focus on the premise of this joke.", "What can you do in terms of data science in this regard? Well, you can find all such words and then, do sentiment analysis judging what kind of words you come up with (positive or negative). While you are at it, you can also see what kind of words (positive or negative) start with mostly which alphabet. That\u2019s exactly what I did.", "Well, for Data Science, you need DATA, period!", "I got my data from this great link in GitHub. It has over 466K words in the list, but they contain numbers and symbols, which we want to avoid. But, fortunately, a list with words having just alphabets has been provided. In it, you have 370K words.", "Added to that, they have been provided in a dictionary for fast-access in Python \ud83d\ude03.", "To read the data, I use this:", "We have already read that data, the next step is to actually create a test function that tests whether a word contains only the letters in Roman Numerals (\u2018i\u2019, \u2018v\u2019, \u2018x\u2019, \u2018l\u2019, \u2018c\u2019, \u2018d\u2019, and \u2018m\u2019).", "So, here is the test function, I created:", "If you got surprised by Counter here, it is a useful data structure in Python that can enumerate the occurrences of various unique elements in any string or list you provide, in a dictionary for you.", "Whenever you are dealing with strings, Counter can be helpful! Do give it a thought next time.", "Now, back to the Roman Numeral words. I ran this test function as a filter against the 370K words I had.", "The result was JUST 126 words.", "As you can see, most of them are numbers in Roman numeral form (things are coming full circle, I see).", "The other words, you see here our own lingo i.e. cmd, cli, mv, vim, div etc., one emoji (xd), some SNS (dm), an extension (midi), some maths (lcm), and some words in general use also (civic, civil, did, dim, ill, mid, mild, mill).", "A special mention to this article\u2019s inspiration: livid.", "All in all, this looks like a well-rounded set with words from every walk of life. Let\u2019s see what sentiment analysis says about it.", "First of all, what is Sentiment Analysis? Let\u2019s define that.", "The assignment of a polarity (negative, positive, or neutral) for a given sentence(s) or phrase, or word.", "Usually, you would do Sentiment Analysis on a set of sentences e.g., tweets, customer reviews etc. It is seldom done on words (but, the sentiment of a word is derived from the context it is used in).", "For Sentiment Analysis of these words, I went with TextBlob.", "Here in this one line, I computed the average polarity over the whole list. As we can see, it is very negligible in the positive direction.", "Yes, it does. Romans and many of us today are following Stoicism, the neutral path. The neutral path that Romans followed, even shows even if you try to create a disparate connection such as this.", "This path has and is being touted as a good thing, hence, the smallest nudge towards positivity. But, for a Stoic, the good or the bad both is nothing, hence, the negligible nudge towards positivity, I guess!", "Such is the beauty of connectedness that can be justified by Data Science.", "Now, given we already have words from a dictionary right here in a nice dictionary, why not go further with this idea!", "Let\u2019s get the answer to these questions also.", "In this section, we answer the following questions:", "For this, we again use TextBlob.", "First of all, I get out the lowercase alphabets in English from Python\u2019s string library.", "Next, there is a 3-step list comprehension to extract the mean polarity of the words starting with each alphabet.", "Let\u2019s see the winners or the answers to our questions:", "Which alphabet houses generally positive words?", "We see the occurrence of two vowels a and e along with a consonant l in the top three contenders.", "For a, we can visualize the word-clouds of positive and negative words starting with it:", "Apart from a, we have e and l as the second and third winners in the race, along with other competitors namely c, f, k, o, p, s, w, and y.", "But, the odds run in the favour of positivity here.", "Which alphabet houses generally negative words?", "We see the consonant d as the winner (thanks to de- prefix and the word death in English, despite having destiny on its side (the irony \ud83d\ude05)) and the vowel u as the second contender (thanks to un- prefix in English) along with the consonant t for the third place.", "For d, we can visualize the word-clouds of positive and negative words starting with it:", "But, still having the DEVIL inside, the polarity of d overall goes towards the negative.", "Which alphabet houses generally neutral words?", "The x and z come out as the neutral guys.", "To be fair, these guys are understaffed i.e. they are inert. Except for x-rays and zebra crossing, it is quite seldom you listen to words starting with these guys. They have more time to grow to polarise themselves, so, let\u2019s give them time \ud83d\ude03.", "What is the English language as a whole, positive or negative?", "Answer: -0.005. Slightly negative. In absolute terms, this is more than the Roman sentiment value by a factor of 10.", "Let\u2019s bring maths back to real life. This says English is a tad bit negative!", "To be fair, language can be steered in any direction. You have had both John Keats and Jack the Ripper, you can stir up eternal love for nature and eternal, expectant fear for your own life with words.", "It is our choice to be more inclusive and positive towards the people we are directing our words to.", "From a mathematical perspective, if I just sample some words over the distribution of words in this language. The overall sentiment of the words I pick up shall be a tad bit negative.", "From a cultural perspective because more words that have a negative polarity are coming up. It means as a culture for this language, it was thought a bit more important to articulate the negative more precisely. Hence, such sampling of words. We may have focused more on the negative throughout the evolution of this language but still at a subtle level.", "But, in the end, it is our choice to be more inclusive and positive towards the people we are directing our words to.", "The first thing I want to say is not to waste even a moment to not get the answers you want if you have been given the gift of mathematics (programming/data science/machine learning/data analysis/deep learning) or just sheer inquisitiveness, go dive deep for your answer for it is there either in data or Google. It is more fun just the data way! \ud83d\ude03", "Today, I watched a TED Talk that led to this post and I connected his single joke to a whole data analysis. For that, a heartfelt thanks to the humorous Andrew Tarvin.", "We understood how to answer a question which you may think abstract through a data way. How to reach the answer? I had a lot of help from the Github repo which provided me with a list of English words.", "Then, I added my own spice of some Python, and thanks to TextBlob again for providing me with the infrastructure to do Sentiment Analysis.", "And now, I can answer the questions that arose in my mind and my thoughts upon the results that I got. I invite you to give your own thoughts about this!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "I am a Data Scientist.
