We tried trifacta, a beautifully crafted tool that let you apply transformation in a visual way with a click and point interface. The problem was that the script language available was not enough to handle the data the way we like.", "We also try the amazing Pandas library, but our data was big enough to make it cry.", "So, almost a year ago we launch Optimus. Powered by Spark (Pyspark), Optimus lets you clean your data with your own or a set of pre-created data transformation functions, profile it and apply machine learning, all easily and with all power of python available.", "Now, we are ready to launch Optimus v2. With a total ground-up rewrite and powered by Apache Spark And Pyarrow, Optimus offers a single way to access, transform data and create Machine learning and Deep Learning models at scale.", "For this new version and after our amazing user feedback we decided to work on three main goals:", "We were running a pool for almost a year. The conlusion, Pandas an Spark are the main libraries used for data cleansing. So our goal with Optimus was to create a predictable and easy way to access and process data. No matter if come from Pandas, Sparkling.data or Spark.", "The table below shows Spark, Pandas and what we create with Optimus.", "A couple of things we see here:", "So the first step was to create a consistent foundation of what we believe are core data operations:", "Other basic functions are read() and write() operations to load and save dataframes. Because we consider that the Apache Spark API is consistent and powerful we map it directly to Optimus without change.", "Below an example of all basic operations:", "Besides this basic operations, we identify other ones over columns. The idea here is the same, create an easy and coherent way to manipulate data. All the operations are designed and named as close to pandas as possible. Also, you can easily apply operations to single, multiple or the whole columns dataset.", "Let\u2019s start with aggregations. We expand Apache Spark operations and create and easy way to access statistical functions.", "With Optimus, you can chain not only Optimus transformation but Spark operations too \ud83d\udc4f . Let's check this out:", ".rows and .cols can feel a little verbose, but look how you can see easily see what going on with your data, which columns or rows have been affected, and what transformations are going to be applied.", "With chaining, you can leverage the power of Spark lazy evaluation. Chain the transformation and apache Spark will take care of the better way to process this via Catalyst.", "This are operations that create a new columns from multiple ones *->1. nest() can compact to string, array or a vector column.", "Operations that create multiple columns from a single one 1 -> *. unnest() can expand string, array and vectors columns.", "Spark have multiples and rich ways in which you can transform your data:", "The issue here is that you have to learn the detail of how to deal with every API. Optimus has a couple of functions apply() and apply_expr() in which you can implement functions(UDF or Pandas UDF) or Column expression as you which.", "Comlumn Expression are fastest so always try to use them with apply_expr()", "If you need more flexibility you can use apply() to transform your data. apply() is going to try to use Pandas UDFs if PyArrow is present, if not Optimus is going to fall back to the standard UDF.", "Pandas UDFs are a lot faster than standard UDF. Check the benchmark below:", "As shown in the charts, Pandas UDFs perform much better than row-at-a-time UDFs across the board, ranging from 3x to over 100x. https://databricks.com/blog/2017/10/30/introducing-vectorized-udfs-for-pyspark.html", "Optimus present the notion of abstract UDF in which you can use Column Expression, UDF, and Pandas UDF without worrying about the underline implementation. abstract udf function is what powers apply() and apply_expr().", "You can get fancy and use some arguments:", "Or just use a Column Expression", "As you can see is posible to use abstract udf with standard Spark functions.", "If you feel comfortable using SQL you can easily be used it via df.sql(). For example:", "Let\u2019s review the pool chart again:", "From a total of 106 voters 73% use Pandas as a data cleaning library. This gives us a great insight into the path we should take with Optimus. Let Optimus be as friendly as possible to Pandas .", "From a total of 106 voters 73% use Pandas as a data cleaning library.", "Taking this into account we search and find this amazing work from Devin Petersohn from riselab. He publishes a post about the more used Pandas methods in Kaggle (https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/pandas-on-ray-early-lessons/). We use this to enhance and tweak Optimus. Bellow you can find this function and how this compares with Spark and Optimus.", "We implemented almost all the functions that can be applied to Spark(Not get or subtract for the moment). Some like reset_index() is not possible because Spark not handles indexes.", "This must be enough for every Panda newcomer to catch up with Optimus\ud83d\ude4c", "Optimus has a powerful built-in data profiler that besides all the basic operation give you something unique. You can see how many data types exist in a specific column.", "For example, you have 1 million rows with color values white, black, red and on hundreds of more colors. How can you be sure that there is not a \u201c1\u201d number in the one million rows? This feature is an extra step that can help you to make your data is in perfect shape to do yours ML and DL models.", "But we want to go a step further. Although Jupyter Notebooks is an incredible tool for data transformation and model creation we feel that the data exploration area can be greatly improved. The work area never seems enough to visualize your stuff, you have a lot of plot options like plotly, seaborn, matplotlib an a big, etc, everyone with a different API and you have to do a lot of work to make them interactive.", "We want to give users the best tools to explore data.", "Bumblebee is a GUI build with Vue.js that works in tandem with Optimus and shows you exactly what you need to make a decision about how to transform your data.", "Bumblebee is not attached directly with Optimus. In fact, Bumblebee can be used with any data processing library from Pandas to dplyr(R). If you want to create a \u201cconnector\u201d from your favorite library you just need to write a JSON file with the bumblebee format.", "For more info about bumblebee go to the Github repo.", "We want Optimus/Bumblebee to become the facto library to process, explore and make models for big data. For this we need your feedback, so we are launching Optimus v2 in beta version for a few weeks to hear your opinion about the path we have taken.", "If you want to contribute please:", "Here we are only exploring the surface of what Optimus can do.
