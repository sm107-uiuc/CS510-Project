Therefore, to build a system that can recognise sign language will help the deaf and hard-of-hearing better communicate using modern-day technologies. In this article, we will go through different architectures of CNN and see how it performs on classifying the Sign Language.", "The dataset can be accessed from Kaggle\u2019s website. The training dataset contains 27455 images and 785 columns, while the test dataset contains 7172 images and 785 columns. The first column of the dataset contains the label of the image while the rest of the 784 columns represent a flattened 28,28 image.", "Let's look at the distribution of dataset:", "The input layer of the model will take images of size (28,28,1) where 28,28 are height and width of the image respectively while 1 represents the colour channel of the image for grayscale.", "The output layer of the model will have 26 neurons for 26 different letters, and the activation function will be softmax since it is a multiclass classification problem.", "The Training Accuracy for the Model is 100% while test accuracy for the model is 91%. This is clearly an overfitting situation. In the next step, we will use Data Augmentation to solve the problem of overfitting.", "There can be some features/orientation of images present in the test dataset that are not available in the training dataset. And Hence, our model is unable to identify those patterns. This is can be solved by augmenting the data. Data Augmentation is an essential step in training the neural network. For example, in the training dataset, we have hand signs of the right hands but in the real world, we could get images from both right hands as well as left hands. Data Augmentation allows us to create unforeseen data through Rotation, Flipping, Zooming, Cropping, Normalising etc.", "Tensorflow provides an ImageDataGenerator function which augments data in memory on the flow without the need of modifying local data. This also gives us the room to try different augmentation parameters. We will Augment the data and split it into 80% training and 20% validation.", "After Augmenting the data, the training accuracy after 100 epochs is 93.5% and test accuracy is at around 97.8 %.", "This has certainly solved the problem of overfitting but has taken much more epochs. Is there a way we can train our model in less number of epochs? Yes, Batch Normalisation is the answer to our question.", "Batch Normalisation allows normalising the inputs of the hidden layer. As from the above model, we can see that though, with data augmentation, we can resolve overfitting to training data but requires more time for training. Batch Normalisation resolves this issue, by normalising the weights of the hidden layer. You can read more about how it affects the performance of a model here.", "The Training accuracy after including batch normalisation is 99.27 and test accuracy is 99.81. And this requires just 40 epochs, almost half of the time without batch normalisation.", "If we carefully observed graph, after 15 epoch, there is no significant decrease in loss. Therefore we can use early stopping to stop training after 15/20 epochs. That is almost 1/5 the of the time without batch normalisation.", "Problem: The validation accuracy is fluctuating a lot and depending upon the model where it stops training, the test accuracy might be great or worse. This is due to a large learning rate causing the model to overshoot the optima. This can be solved using a decaying learning rate which drops by some value after each epoch.", "We can implement the Decaying Learning Rate in Tensorflow as follows:", "Both the accuracy as well as the loss of training and validation accuracy has converged by the end of 20 epochs. And this allows us to be more confident in our results since the graphs are smoother compared to the previous ones. The training accuracy using the same the configuration is 99.88 and test accuracy is 99.88 too.", "There is not much difference in the accuracy between models using Learning Rate Decay and without, but there are higher chances of reaching the optima using Learning Rate decay as compared to one without using Learning Rate Decay. And Hence, more confidence in the results.", "You can find the complete project along with Jupiter notebooks for different models in the GitHub repo: https://github.com/Heisenberg0203/AmericanSignLanguage-Recognizer", "If you loved this article please feel free to share with others.", "Your home for data science.
