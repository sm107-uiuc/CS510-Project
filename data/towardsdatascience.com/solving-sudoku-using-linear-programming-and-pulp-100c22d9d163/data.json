Below is an example of a sudoku puzzle from Wikipedia", "As you can see, there are 9 rows and 9 columns (81 boxes), some boxes are filled with a number while most are empty. The goal of the game is to fill the empty boxes with numbers such that all the constraints are satisfied. The rules of the games are below", "We will be using the PuLP library in Python to solve the above sudoku puzzle, if you are unfamiliar with PuLP, I recommend you to check out my tutorial below", "In each box, only one value can be present and the other values won\u2019t be present. Therefore we can think of it as a binary variable having a value 0 if the number is not present and 1 if it is present. The variables will be in a format as below", "Suppose we select a box, i.e we set the row and col as constant, the value can range from 1 to 9", "In the below example, in the top left corner box (1,1 in a 1-indexed array), the value of \u20185\u2019 would be 1 while the rest of the digits from 1\u20139 would have the value 0.", "Since the row and the column can both range from 1 to 9, there can be 81 different combinations of (row, col). Each combination will have 9 binary variables. Therefore, there are a total of 729 different combinations or variables", "Out of these 729 different combinations, only 81 of them will have the value 1 while the rest will have a value 0. Since we are already given some of the values on the board, we already know which variable will have a value 1 in those boxes. We are given the values for 30 of the boxes, which means we already know the values for 270 of the variables. We need to find the values for the other 459 variables.", "A sudoku puzzle doesn\u2019t have an optimal solution, i.e we do not have to maximize or minimize any functions. Therefore we can define our problem as Lp.maximize or Lp.minimize and set our objective function to 0.", "As I mentioned before, our variables are formatted as below:", "To ensure that each box has only value, we can keep the row, col constant and vary the value from 1 to 9. The sum of the binary values should be equal to 1 since only one variable will be equal to 1 and others must be 0.", "We will need to perform this check for all different combinations of row, col", "For this case, we can keep the value and row constant while variying the col from 1 to 9", "For Example, we want to check the number 1 is present only once in the first row", "Similary we set the value = 1 and row = 2 and repeat the process, we need to do this for all possible combinations of val, row", "This is really similar to our previous constraint and instead of keeping value and row constant, we keep value and col constant.", "Our sudoku board has 9 smaller boxes and similar to the row and column constraint, each value from 1 to 9 must be present in the subgrid and no number can be repeating", "First, we will create a variable to store the 9 boxes", "The code looks complicated but it essentially divides our board into 9 subgrids. The variable Subgrids will have 9 lists each representing one of the subgrids. Each list will have a list of the coordinates of the boxes in it.", "For example, Subgrids[0] represents the first subgrid and contains the coordinates of the boxes in it.", "For Subgrid 0 , we keep the value constant and iterate over the list to get the row, col co-ordinates and check the binary value. The sum should be equal to 1 for each value from 1 to 9", "We are already given the nunbers in 30 boxes, we will need to add this to our constraint as well.", "First, we will create a variable to store the given numbers in the format [value , row , col ]", "Now we add them to our constraints", "You can use the below function to store the solved sudoku in a text file", "It takes in our Lp variable, the file object to write the sudoku into and the range of numbers from 1 to 9.", "Note: the numbers be in a string format", "The solution for the puzzle in Wikipedia is below", "You can confirm that our solution matches that given on the wiki \ud83d\ude03", "Ways to further build on top of this:", "Thank you for reading the article, do let me know if you have any questions :)", "I recently created a blog using WordPress, I would love it if you could check it out \ud83d\ude03", "Originally published at https://realpythonproject.com on December 6, 2020.", "Your home for data science.
