Like most of Amazon\u2019s offerings, Amazon Redshift is very popular, and for good reason: not only is it currently the fastest cloud data warehouse, but it gets faster every year.", "Here at Knowi, we offer broad native integration to Amazon Redshift for analytics and reporting. This enables our users to leverage the speed and scalability of Redshift without any constraints, and to quickly analyze data from Redshift and form valuable insights. If you\u2019re interested in learning how to use Knowi to analyze data from Amazon Redshift, you\u2019ve come to the right place.", "After logging into your Knowi trial account, the first thing you\u2019re going to do is connect to an Amazon Redshift Datasource and confirm that your connection is successful. This is how:", "1. Find \u201cData sources\u201d on the panel on the left side of your screen and click on it.", "2. Head down to \u201cData Warehouses\u201d and click on Amazon Redshift.", "3. We don\u2019t need to change any of the parameters here; Knowi automatically enters all of them for us. Just click \u201cTest Connection\u201d at the bottom of your screen.", "4. Once you\u2019ve confirmed that your connection was successful, click \u201cSave.\u201d", "Your data source is now set up. Good work!", "Your datasource is now set up, which means it\u2019s time to start querying your data. Here\u2019s how to do this:", "1. After saving your datasource, you should\u2019ve received an alert at the top of your page that said \u201cDatasource Added. Configure Queries.\u201d Click on the word queries. (Otherwise, you can go back to the panel on the left side of your screen, go right below \u201cData Sources\u201d and click on \u201cQueries.\u201d Then select \u201cNew Query +\u201d from the top right.)", "2. Give your report a name inside \u201cReport Name*\u201d on the very top left of your screen. We\u2019re going to analyze an email campaign here, so let\u2019s call this one \u201cEmail Campaign.\u201d", "3. In your Query Builder, click inside the \u201cTables\u201d bar. Scroll down to \u201cpublic.demo_sent\u201d and click on that. This will automatically set up a Redshift query that returns the data within this table.", "4. Head over to the bottom left hand of your screen and click on the blue \u201cPreview\u201d button in order to preview the data. You should see the results of an email campaign that includes various data such as the number of emails sent, opened, and clicked on, as well as the message type and the customer.", "5. Once you\u2019ve looked over your data, scroll to the bottom right corner of your screen and click the green \u201cSave & Run Now\u201d button.", "As soon as your query was successfully completed, Knowi automatically saved the results of your query as a virtual dataset and then stored the results of that query as a dataset within its elastic data warehouse. Knowi does this every time you run a query.", "Although you spent a little bit of time looking over your data, it\u2019s unlikely that you learned anything from it in the format that it was in. There are a ton of things that we could figure out with our data, but let\u2019s say we had to answer a burning question: do emails sent to certain customers have a higher conversion rate? Knowi allows us to efficiently answer this question and then visualize our results with the following steps:", "1. Head to the top of the panel on the left side of your screen and click on \u201cDashboards.\u201d Click the orange plus icon and name your dashboard. We\u2019ll call this one \u201cEmail Visualization.\u201d", "2. Head back to the panel, just below \u201cDashboards,\u201d and click on \u201cWidgets.\u201d Select the \u201cEmail Campaign\u201d widget that you just created and drag it onto your dashboard.", "3. Right now, the visualization that you see is just a data grid. We\u2019re going to change this to something a little easier on the eyes, but first we have to add the metric that we\u2019re looking for. In order to do this, scroll to the top right corner of your widget. Click on the 3 dot icon, then scroll down to \u201cAnalyze\u201d and click on it.", "4. Head to the top left corner of your screen and find \u201c+Add Function.\u201d The function that we\u2019re looking to create is very simple: it\u2019s called \u201cconversion rate\u201d and it\u2019s calculated by dividing \u201cconversions\u201d by \u201csent.\u201d In order to calculate this, click on \u201c+Add Function,\u201d then set \u201cName\u201d as Conversion Rate and \u201cOperation\u201d as (conversions/sent)*100.", "5. Right now, all we see is the conversion rate of each individual email campaign. What we want to see is the conversion rate of all email campaigns grouped by customer, and we also want our data sorted by conversion rate. First, we need to drag the \u201ccustomer\u201d bar from the left side of the screen over to the \u201cGrouping/Dimensions:\u201d box and let go.", "6. Now we just need to drag our new \u201cConversion Rate\u201d metric from \u201cFields/Metrics:\u201d over to \u201cSort by:\u201d and change the direction to descending in order to sort our data from the highest conversion rate to the lowest. As you can see, Facebook emails have a conversion rate of just over 1%, while Netflix emails have a conversion rate of less than 0.5%.", "7. Now it\u2019s time to visualize everything. Head back to the top of your screen and click on \u201cVisualization.\u201d Change your visualization type from \u201cData Grid\u201d to \u201cColumn.\u201d", "8. Now you can see each customer ranked by the conversion rate of their emails. Head to the top right corner of your screen and click on the \u201cClone\u201d icon which looks like two pieces of paper. Name this one \u201cEmail Campaign \u2014 Conversion Rates\u201d and click the orange \u201cAdd to Dashboard\u201d button.", "Just like that, you\u2019ve turned your raw data into a visualization that contains valuable information. The knowledge that Facebook\u2019s conversion rate is about two and a half times higher than Netflix\u2019s may be factored into future decision making.", "The next step to improving our visualization is to make it more interactive and navigable by adding drilldowns. Drilldowns are a powerful feature within Knowi that allow the user to take a deeper dive into a filtered section of the raw data with just one click. Here\u2019s how we\u2019ll add a drilldown to our widget:", "1. Click on the 3 dot icon in the top right corner of your new widget, scroll down to \u201cDrilldowns\u201d and click on it.", "2. Set your Drilldown type as \u201cWidget,\u201d set it to drill into \u201cEmail Campaign\u201d when \u201cCustomer\u201d is clicked, and set customer = customer in your optional drilldown filters. Click the orange \u201cSave\u201d button at the bottom right corner of the Drilldowns popup.", "3. Test it out by clicking on Facebook, the customer whose conversion rate is the highest. As you can see, this returns every campaign where Facebook was the customer. Then get back to your original visualization, head back to the top right corner of your widget and click on the left arrow icon in the middle of that corner.", "Your dashboard is set up, which means you\u2019re fully prepared to query your data using search-based analytics. This means you\u2019re ready to share your dashboard and your data with anybody who speaks English, even if they\u2019re unfamiliar with Knowi. Here\u2019s how to query your data using search-based analytics:", "1. Head to the top right corner of your original \u201cEmail Campaign\u201d widget and click on the 3 dot icon. Scroll down and click on \u201cAnalyze.\u201d", "2. Let\u2019s say you want to monitor email activity by month in order to see if things looked any different in different months. In order to do this, head to the search bar at the top of your screen and type \u201ctotal sent, total opened, total clicks, total conversions by month\u201d and then hit enter. Knowi\u2019s natural language processing will quickly provide you with what you\u2019re looking for.", "3. Now it\u2019s time to visualize this data. Head back to \u201cVisualization\u201d and set the visualization type to \u201cArea.\u201d This will show us the total number of emails sent, and the total number of conversions per month. The conversions are so low that it\u2019s hard to see any movement in the number with our naked eye, but that\u2019s okay.", "4. Head back to the top right and click on the \u201cclone\u201d icon once again. Name this widget \u201cSent and Conversions \u2014 Area,\u201d clone it, and then add it to your dashboard.", "5. Last, head back to your dashboard. Drag your new \u201cEmail Campaign \u2014 Area Visualization\u201d widget to the top of your dashboard, which will bring the original \u201cEmail Campaign\u201d widget to the bottom.", "This data conveys another valuable piece of insight: these email campaigns receive a low number of opens and clicks and an extremely low number of conversions for every email that they send. While these numbers remain consistently low every month, they do seem to increase alongside the number of total emails sent.", "It\u2019s also important to remember that we didn\u2019t need extensive coding knowledge or experience with Knowi to do what we just did. The low barriers to usage here makes Knowi\u2019s dashboards accessible to any curious English speaker.", "In summary, we connected to an Amazon Redshift Datasource and made a query on our new datasource. This stored the results of our query in Knowi\u2019s elastic data warehouse. We then analyzed and visualized our data, and added drilldowns to our visualization that allow the user to drill in on a filtered section of the raw data that they\u2019d like to learn more about. Lastly, we used search-based analytics to answer another question and visualize our answer.", "Your home for data science.
