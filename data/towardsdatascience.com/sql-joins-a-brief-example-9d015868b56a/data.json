But it turned out to be long enough to warrant its own post (and way too verbose for a side-note). It\u2019s not meant to be a full-on primer on SQL joins, but rather an example to help those new to SQL and relational databases begin to grasp what it means to join 2 tables.", "Why bother with joining at all? Can\u2019t we just dump everything into a spreadsheet and sort things out there? Perhaps\u2026 but it would be incredibly time consuming, tedious, and error prone.", "Relational databases are designed to be joined. Each table in the database contains data of a specific form or function. For example, one table might have basic data on a company\u2019s customers such as customer ID (a unique ID that can be used to identify each customer), name, age, gender, date of first purchase, and address. While a separate much larger table stores detailed transaction level data \u2014 transaction ID, date of transaction, customer ID, product category, product ID, units sold, and price.", "A given customer (or customer ID) could have hundreds or even thousands of transactions, so it would be extremely redundant to store that customer\u2019s basic information over and over again for each row in the transactions table. The transactions table should be only for data relevant to transactions. Having too much overlapping data between tables is wasteful and can negatively impact system performance.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t care about the linkages between tables. Given how specific each table is, analyses that involve only a single table are generally not useful. The interesting analyses come from datasets that combine multiple tables. For example, we might want to segment transactions by age or geography. To do this, we would need data from both tables. And that\u2019s where join comes in.", "When we join two tables, we are linking them together via a selected characteristic. Let\u2019s say we have two tables. The first one, Employee, lists out an employee\u2019s unique ID number, name, and job title. The second one, Sale, lists out data on who made what sale by attaching the employee\u2019s ID number and the units sold to a unique sales number:", "(I omitted the underscores from the column names in my graphics for legibility)", "Now let\u2019s join the two tables. To link the two tables, we need to pick a column (or combination of columns) that serves as the point of intersection \u2014 let\u2019s call the chosen column the join index. Table entries that share the same value for the join index are joined together. Note that the intersection does not have to be one to one. For example, Tony has made 2 sales, so upon joining the tables, both of his sales will be linked to Tony (a.k.a. Employee ID 1).", "When we join tables, we generally want the join index to be unique. If the join index were not unique, quirky stuff might occur. For example, let\u2019s say we had a second employee named Tony (along with the tables below), and he was a megastar salesman. If instead of joining on \u201cEmployee ID\u201d we joined on \u201cName\u201d, then we would mistakenly link Tony the Megastar\u2019s sales to me, making my bonus way too high:", "And Tony the Megastar would get credit for my pitiful sales as well (not that he needs it). So to avoid this, we join on a column with unique values such as \u201cEmployee ID\u201d (I removed Tony the Megastar as he was only there to illustrate what not to do, and his incredible successes made me feel unworthy):", "There are various types of SQL joins and I will not go into the details of all of them here. In this example, we will use a left join, meaning that we prioritize the rows in the left table. So our output will include every row in the left table (the one with \u201cName\u201d and \u201cTitle\u201d) regardless of whether there is a match with the right table \u2014 thus employees that have not made a sale will still have a row in our output, but there will be no values (NULLs to be exact) for the \u201cSale Number\u201d and \u201cUnits Sold\u201d columns.", "Let\u2019s take a look at our output (we are selecting only \u201cSale Number\u201d and \u201cUnits Sold\u201d from the right table and sorting by \u201cEmployee ID\u201d):", "The output of our join now includes data from both tables. Tony\u2019s sales data has been linked with his employee data (thanks to Employee ID) as has Lisa\u2019s. Notice 2 things:", "And that concludes our brief example. Hopefully, this gives you a rudimentary idea of why we need joins and how they work.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data scientist.
