We only knew that he was part of the French Resistance. However, we didn\u2019t know what he had done in the Resistance and or the extent of his involvement.", "I always wanted to know what had happened to my family during the war years, and I constantly researched my family history. At some point, I gave up and stopped searching thinking that I would never find anything more than the ten-line biography that some of his friends had published in the book \u201cLes R\u00e9sistances juives pendant l\u2019occupation\u201d of Georges Loinger.", "Then, last month, for the first time I went on a \u201croots\u201d trip to Poland. It was very powerful and reminded me of the importance of passing on history, especially nowadays when Shoah survivors are less and less.", "\u201cFor the dead and the living, we must bear witness.\u201d, Elie Wiesel", "I always had the feeling that I needed to discover my family history and be a \u201cwitness of the eyewitnesses\u201d for the next generation.", "So after the visit, I started searching again. By chance, I found, on the internet, my grandfather\u2019s name mentioned in a document held by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC. I asked them to send it to me and two days ago I received it. I was wonderfully surprised to discover that It was my grandfather\u2019s testimony on his role among the French Resistance! A twenty-six-pages PDF draft of his story in French.", "I wanted to clean this text and to make it more readable by everyone to spread and preserve his memory and be able to publish it, to help the next generations gain insight and knowledge of Shoah history. We live in an interesting time, where fewer and fewer youth have the opportunity to hear from survivors as the population dwindles, but the technology that can give young people access to survivors is ever on the rise.", "As a Data Scientist, I have always tried to use my skills to do good and I stand fast by the belief that AI can be a great tool for social change. Using AI to help me share my grandfather\u2019s story was an obvious next step.", "To be able to correct the mistakes and his hand-written notes, I wanted a text document. I used a Deep Learning based Text Recognition: the LSTM based Google\u2019s OCR Engine Tesseract.", "In order to reproduce the following code, you need to pip install all the packages imported. In addition, you will need to install Tesseract.", "On top of that, I used some NLP techniques, methodologies, technology, algorithms to have a summary.

That\u2019s why I used some NLP techniques, methodologies, technology, and algorithms to automatically summarize the longer document. Here are some examples of extractive summarization with nltk and gensim.", "I then translated those summaries into English to give more people access to the text thanks to the Google Cloud Translation API.", "Both extractive summaries provide us the meaning of this first page, even if a one-sentence summary seems good enough. Using those techniques helped me achieve a Text Document to work on top of and to understand the key parts of the testimony.", "Like the internet and social media, years ago, AI should be also used to continue the important work of education \u2014 of the Shoah, and other past genocides, and of the atrocities occurring around the world still today.", "\u2018Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d, Winston Churchill.", "Moreover, it\u2019s time to bring AI into charitable and human organizations.
