Simple statements represent a collection of facts that are arranged as edges within the KGs, while quantified statements require a more advanced and expressive form to represent information. Ontologies define a standard formalism that enables this meaningful representation, specifying the semantics of entities and relations adopted to label nodes and edges of KGs.", "Deductive and inductive reasoning approaches allow extending a KG, improving its underlying knowledge. Deductive methods employ the simple statements and the set of rules defined by ontologies to derive additional knowledge. For instance \u201cSocrates is mortal\u201d, which is logically interpretable and understandable, combining \u201cSocrates is a human\u201d and \u201cAll humans are mortal\u201d. The main features related to deductive reasoning exploiting ontologies have been discussed in this article:", "Inductive techniques involve simple and quantified statements to create further knowledge and discover and generalize patterns available in the KG. These patterns can be inferred by the application of statistical learning methods on multi-relational data (statistical relational learning), which are less interpretable than deductive approaches, but they are capable of exploiting latent factors in the KG achieved by means of representation learning techniques.", "The main principle behind inductive methods indicates that machines are able to derive their own knowledge on the data, discovering and generalizing patterns within a set of input observations. Machines prove this capability, known as Machine Learning, by means of statistical learning approaches. The performance of machine learning algorithms strictly depends on the representation of the data, which is traditionally achieved by defining a hand-designed set of features. However, in many learning tasks such as computer vision, these features\u2019 manual detection is not an easy and effective process.", "Representation Learning improves the machine learning performance in these types of situations, deriving the set of features for representing data without human intervention. Namely, a representation learning algorithm\u2019s goal is to automatically infer latent \u2014 or hidden \u2014 features of the data. These features are represented as dense and low-dimensional vectors, known as embeddings, which are not directly extracted as quantities in the data, but whose variations influence every single piece of information we are able to observe.", "Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) are the result of specific representation learning models applied to KGs. The goal of KGE models is to embed the KG components \u2014 entities and relations \u2014 into a continuous and low-dimensional vector space. The latent factors projected into KGEs have an essential role in analyzing and mining additional soft-knowledge in KGs. In fact, for each pair of entities {s, o} \u220a E and any relation r\u220aR, it is possible to determine if a statement (s, r, o) is true according to the embeddings learned by KGE techniques.", "Traditionally, the KGE approaches define a scoring function for each KG statement (s, r, o).", "In general, KGs include only true statements, while non-existing statements can be considered either missing or false (Closed-World Assumption). As a consequence, the scoring function returns a higher score for existing statements and a lower score vice-versa. Considering this type of scoring function, in most cases, the training goal can be formalized as a binary classification problem. Therefore, the entity and the relation embeddings are learned by minimizing the cross-entropy loss:", "KGE techniques encode the interactions between entities and relations through models that are not natively built for encoding graph structures. However, a novel family of neural architectures has been proposed to address this limitation. In this context, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are becoming the key framework for learning the latent representation of graph-structured data.", "The operating principle behind GNNs is based on the analogy between NNs and graphs. In fact, neural architectures are formalized as weighted and directed graphs, whose nodes define the computational units \u2014 or artificial neurons \u2014 and edges are the weighted connections between these units. Nevertheless, the topology of traditional NNs is a priori structured for a specific purpose. For instance, the feed-forward architectures provide a fully connected and homogeneous sequence of layers: each node of the previous layer is linked by a weighted edge to all the nodes in the next layer. On the contrary, the graph data structure is heterogeneous because the topology is directly driven by the edges defined between the nodes. GNNs are based on neural architectures designed following graph data topology, where the weighted connections of the NN match the edges available in the graph structure.", "The most-adopted class of GNNs is known as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). The goal of the GCNs is to update the representation of nodes from one layer to the other on the basis of the following transformation:", "Therefore, the goal of the GCNs is to update the representation of nodes from one layer to the other on the basis of the neighborhood structure. An example of code implementation of the main principles behind GNNs is available in the following article: https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-building-blocks-of-graph-neural-networks-intro-56627f0719d5.", "The key idea of GNNs is that the representation of a node in the graph is updated with the features of its neighbors, through the convolution operation computed with shared parameters (or weights) across the local structure. This computation is performed in parallel for all nodes at each network update. Moreover, by stacking up several layers, it is possible to capture and encode the relations between nodes across multiple hops in the graph.", "A s previously mentioned, KGE techniques are not able to encode the graph structure: the embeddings representing entities and relations are directly optimized during the training process. On the other hand, GNN models are natively built to encode the local neighborhood structure into the node (or entity) representation. Considering their respective characteristics, GNN models and KGE techniques can be incorporated into an end-to-end architecture, also known as Graph Auto-Encoder (GAE). Goodfellow et al. in the \u201cDeep Learning\u201d book describe the auto-encoders as a quintessential example of the representation learning algorithms. An auto-encoder combines two different components: (i) an encoder, whose goal is to transform the input data into a different representation, typically for feature learning and dimensionality reduction tasks; (ii) a decoder, whose objective is to employ this new representation to reconstruct the original data. In the domain of this thesis, the GNN models play the role of the encoder, which produces an enriched representation of all entities within the KG, accumulating the neighborhood features; the KGE techniques play the role of the decoder, exploiting this enriched representation to reconstruct the edges within the KG. Based on the notation adopted in this thesis, the real-valued vector of the subject entity corresponds to the representation of the i-th node:", ", where h_i^L is the latent representation at the last-stacked layer of the GNN. The real-valued vector of the object entities corresponds to the latent representation of N are:", "The scoring function introduced at the beginning of the article can be updated as follows:", "The cross-entropy loss is then computed per edge and allows us to obtain valuable embeddings for the link prediction task.", "For further readings on Graph Representation Learning, you can follow my series at the following link: https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/grl-series.", "If you like my articles, you can support me using this link https://medium.com/@giuseppefutia/membership and becoming a Medium member.", "Your home for data science.
