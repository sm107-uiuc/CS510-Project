Come join my Super Quotes newsletter. \ud83d\ude0e", "Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. Given a set of data points, we can use a clustering algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group. In theory, data points that are in the same group should have similar properties and/or features, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.", "In Data Science, we can use clustering analysis to gain some valuable insights from our data by seeing what groups the data points fall into when we apply a clustering algorithm. Today, we\u2019re going to look at 5 popular clustering algorithms that data scientists need to know and their pros and cons!", "K-Means is probably the most well-known clustering algorithm. It\u2019s taught in a lot of introductory data science and machine learning classes. It\u2019s easy to understand and implement in code! Check out the graphic below for an illustration.", "K-Means has the advantage that it\u2019s pretty fast, as all we\u2019re really doing is computing the distances between points and group centers; very few computations! It thus has a linear complexity O(n).", "On the other hand, K-Means has a couple of disadvantages. Firstly, you have to select how many groups/classes there are. This isn\u2019t always trivial and ideally with a clustering algorithm we\u2019d want it to figure those out for us because the point of it is to gain some insight from the data. K-means also starts with a random choice of cluster centers and therefore it may yield different clustering results on different runs of the algorithm. Thus, the results may not be repeatable and lack consistency. Other cluster methods are more consistent.", "K-Medians is another clustering algorithm related to K-Means, except instead of recomputing the group center points using the mean we use the median vector of the group. This method is less sensitive to outliers (because of using the Median) but is much slower for larger datasets as sorting is required on each iteration when computing the Median vector.", "Mean shift clustering is a sliding-window-based algorithm that attempts to find dense areas of data points. It is a centroid-based algorithm meaning that the goal is to locate the center points of each group/class, which works by updating candidates for center points to be the mean of the points within the sliding-window. These candidate windows are then filtered in a post-processing stage to eliminate near-duplicates, forming the final set of center points and their corresponding groups. Check out the graphic below for an illustration.", "An illustration of the entire process from end-to-end with all of the sliding windows is shown below. Each black dot represents the centroid of a sliding window and each gray dot is a data point.", "In contrast to K-means clustering, there is no need to select the number of clusters as mean-shift automatically discovers this. That\u2019s a massive advantage. The fact that the cluster centers converge towards the points of maximum density is also quite desirable as it is quite intuitive to understand and fits well in a naturally data-driven sense. The drawback is that the selection of the window size/radius \u201cr\u201d can be non-trivial.", "DBSCAN is a density-based clustered algorithm similar to mean-shift, but with a couple of notable advantages. Check out another fancy graphic below and let\u2019s get started!", "DBSCAN poses some great advantages over other clustering algorithms. Firstly, it does not require a pe-set number of clusters at all. It also identifies outliers as noises, unlike mean-shift which simply throws them into a cluster even if the data point is very different. Additionally, it can find arbitrarily sized and arbitrarily shaped clusters quite well.", "The main drawback of DBSCAN is that it doesn\u2019t perform as well as others when the clusters are of varying density. This is because the setting of the distance threshold \u03b5 and minPoints for identifying the neighborhood points will vary from cluster to cluster when the density varies. This drawback also occurs with very high-dimensional data since again the distance threshold \u03b5 becomes challenging to estimate.", "One of the major drawbacks of K-Means is its naive use of the mean value for the cluster center. We can see why this isn\u2019t the best way of doing things by looking at the image below. On the left-hand side, it looks quite obvious to the human eye that there are two circular clusters with different radius\u2019 centered at the same mean. K-Means can\u2019t handle this because the mean values of the clusters are very close together. K-Means also fails in cases where the clusters are not circular, again as a result of using the mean as cluster center.", "Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) give us more flexibility than K-Means. With GMMs we assume that the data points are Gaussian distributed; this is a less restrictive assumption than saying they are circular by using the mean. That way, we have two parameters to describe the shape of the clusters: the mean and the standard deviation! Taking an example in two dimensions, this means that the clusters can take any kind of elliptical shape (since we have a standard deviation in both the x and y directions). Thus, each Gaussian distribution is assigned to a single cluster.", "To find the parameters of the Gaussian for each cluster (e.g the mean and standard deviation), we will use an optimization algorithm called Expectation\u2013Maximization (EM). Take a look at the graphic below as an illustration of the Gaussians being fitted to the clusters. Then we can proceed with the process of Expectation\u2013Maximization clustering using GMMs.", "There are 2 key advantages to using GMMs. Firstly GMMs are a lot more flexible in terms of cluster covariance than K-Means; due to the standard deviation parameter, the clusters can take on any ellipse shape, rather than being restricted to circles. K-Means is actually a special case of GMM in which each cluster\u2019s covariance along all dimensions approaches 0. Secondly, since GMMs use probabilities, they can have multiple clusters per data point. So if a data point is in the middle of two overlapping clusters, we can simply define its class by saying it belongs X-percent to class 1 and Y-percent to class 2. I.e GMMs support mixed membership.", "Hierarchical clustering algorithms fall into 2 categories: top-down or bottom-up. Bottom-up algorithms treat each data point as a single cluster at the outset and then successively merge (or agglomerate) pairs of clusters until all clusters have been merged into a single cluster that contains all data points. Bottom-up hierarchical clustering is therefore called hierarchical agglomerative clustering or HAC. This hierarchy of clusters is represented as a tree (or dendrogram). The root of the tree is the unique cluster that gathers all the samples, the leaves being the clusters with only one sample. Check out the graphic below for an illustration before moving on to the algorithm steps", "Hierarchical clustering does not require us to specify the number of clusters and we can even select which number of clusters looks best since we are building a tree. Additionally, the algorithm is not sensitive to the choice of distance metric; all of them tend to work equally well whereas with other clustering algorithms, the choice of distance metric is critical. A particularly good use case of hierarchical clustering methods is when the underlying data has a hierarchical structure and you want to recover the hierarchy; other clustering algorithms can\u2019t do this. These advantages of hierarchical clustering come at the cost of lower efficiency, as it has a time complexity of O(n\u00b3), unlike the linear complexity of K-Means and GMM.", "There are your top 5 clustering algorithms that a data scientist should know! We\u2019ll end off with an awesome visualization of how well these algorithms and a few others perform, courtesy of Scikit Learn! Very cool to see how the different algorithms compare and contrast with different data!", "Your home for data science.
