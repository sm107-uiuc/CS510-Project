Life isn\u2019t split into the determined and the uncertain. The two are always entangled, at all levels, and this is what forms the world as we know it.", "The question is not knowing if we can or cannot trust a prediction, but rather, the real questions are:", "To illustrate this, let\u2019s look at the example of the weather. Based on all the evidence available to us, the different phenomenon\u2019s of the weather are complex enough that we can categorise them as being part of the world of uncertainty, as defined by Knight.", "As such, we attach a certain level of credibility to weather forecasts. The level of confidence we place in them is important for the first few days and then slowly falls as the date passes.", "The information given by the weather forecast and how much we trust it are linked and are both essential to guide us to make decisions, ranging from the simple planning of a BBQ with our friends the following weekend to the date of a rocket take-off to launch astronauts into space.", "Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of multiple successful books dealing with uncertainty such as the \u201cBlack Swan\u201d or \u201cFooled by Randomness\u201d, who is often referenced by Philippe Silberzahn, suggests the Knight definition of uncertainty is utter madness in the 2015 publication titled \u201cSilent Risk\u201d.", "\u201dThe entire distinction (between risk and uncertainty) is a lunacy\u201d \u2014 Nassim Taleb in \u201cSilent Risk\u201d", "This distinction between risk and uncertainty could have an impact on the quality of decisions.", "By encouraging decision-makers to entirely abandon all probabilistic thoughts when faced with uncertainty, people\u2019s intuition will ultimately become the only tool they have available to make a decision.", "Today\u2019s decision-makers are in a precarious situation, where they must reason with tangible arguments, give sense to things, and not just allow themselves to follow their intuition, regardless of how intelligent they are.", "Remember that Albert Einstein\u2019s intuition, one of the greatest minds of our time, lead him to reject the existence of black holes and to then do the same to the indeterminism inherent to quantum mechanics. History caused him to be wrong on these two points, both of which are now universally considered key amongst the scientific community.", "When it comes to intuition, the same reasoning that we previously discussed can be applied: the question is not knowing if we can or cannot trust our intuition. The question is under which conditions can our intuition be trusted?", "Nowadays, science gives a clear answer to this question thanks to the works of Daniel Kahneman, psychologist and economist and winner of the 2002 Nobel prize of economics, on the two systems of thinking and cognitive bias.", "Daniel Kahneman tells us that intuition only deserves our trusts in an acceptably regular and repeatable environment which offers substantial opportunities to learn and get quick feedback. These conditions are never both present during uncertain situations.", "\u201dIntuition cannot be trusted in absence of stable regularities in the environment\u201d \u2014 Daniel Kahneman", "We can find other issues in Philippe Silberahn publications, such as the fact he references the Nassim Taleb\u2019s Black Swan in relation to COVID-19.", "The Black Swan indicates an unpredictable and rare event that, if it occurs, has consequences of a considerable and exceptional range.", "In an interview with the NewYorker, Nassim Taleb was annoyed by the link made by several analysts between the Black Swan and COVID. Indeed, the pandemic we are experiencing was predictable.", "Of course, it is impossible to know in advance when it was to happen. But did we really need to know WHEN in order to prepare for it?", "In the same way, you don\u2019t need to know the exact day you\u2019re going have a car crash to take out an insurance policy.", "As such, the only thing we need to know is the likelihood of an event happening in order to be able to decide how we are going to prepare for it according to our apprehension for risk.", "This is how Nassim Taleb\u2019s expression should be understood, encouraging us to invest in preparation more than prediction. He has never suggested we abandon all thought surrounding probability in highly uncertain situations, but in fact the opposite. Nassim Taleb is the author of multiple scientific publications on the mathematical tools which allow us to better grasp situations of high uncertainty.", "The French state has previously anticipated other pandemics, possessing 1 billion surgical masks in 2009, but the decision was taken to pay less attention to this risk and to let the stock of masks decrease.", "A huge digitalisation of small businesses could also have been part of a risk preparation plan, but all these preparation actions have a cost and our politicians made the choice to direct these budgets to other more visible emergencies.", "Between 2010 and 2014, French institutes dedicated to health monitoring and preparation for health emergencies saw their budgets fall by 24%.", "Another idea that often comes up is that prediction is not possible until the phenomenon in question is repeatable and that we do not have enough data from the past.", "Let\u2019s look at a counter-example to illustrate why this is not always true. Meteorologists who want to predict the likelihood that a Level 4 hurricane will reach France in the next 10 years can rely on the physical models that they already have. They will then take several global warming assumptions (from the most pessimistic to the most optimistic) and will carry out hundreds or even thousands of simulations to calculate the proportion of cases where such an event could occur. This would calculate a likelihood that could be used by decision-makers to choose the measures to be taken according to the level of risk they are willing to accept.", "To navigate an uncertain world, you must adopt its language, the language of probabilities.", "It is urgent that decision makers and experts are able to develop probabilistic thinking. We do not need arrogant experts announcing a third wave of COVID, but rather humble experts capable of attributing probabilities to each of their predictions, who are able to express what they know and what they do not know.", "There are also calibration techniques that can train experts to reduce the distance between what they think and what they really know. A perfectly calibrated person, responding with a 90% confidence level to 10 questions, will have, on average, 9 good predictions out of 10.", "The mathematician Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot, at the origin of Fractals theory, reminds us through the quotation below how probability theory can be an extraordinarily powerful and practical tool to approach the unknown and uncontrollable.", "\u201cThe theory of probability is the only mathematical tool available to help map the unknown and the uncontrollable. It is fortunate that this tool, while tricky, is extraordinarily powerful and convenient.\u201d Benoit Mandelbrot, The Fractal Geometry of Nature (1977, 1983)", "This discussion about uncertainty began in the form of comments following a publication of Philippe Silberzahn. But I couldn\u2019t develop my point of view like in an article.", "In this article, I focused my attention on my areas of disagreement with Philippe Silberzahn. But this cannot hide all the agreements we may share, of which there are many. In particular all his work around effectuation and entrepreneurial thinking comes to mind.", "I also share the same irritability towards the proliferation of pseudo-experts predicting everything and anything. But it is not because there are Gurus that we have to abandon medicine.", "Your home for data science.
