It only took one or two research-binges before I realized the vast depth of the field in front of me. I knew eventually I\u2019d have to understand things like the architecture of a convolutional neural network, the process of numericalization for NLP, or the underpinnings of principal component analysis. However, rather than jumping into the minutiae of these concepts in a void, I\u2019ve always needed to develop a rock-solid contextual foundation of knowledge first. I\u2019ll call this approach context-based learning.", "I will loosely define context-based learning as learning a concept by first focusing on its contextual elements. In other words, understanding the big picture before delving into the deep theory. It\u2019s important to emphasize \u201cfirst\u201d in that definition, as learning the context is analogous to building the chassis of a vehicle. Although the chassis is an essential element, it is not a car, and is non-functional on its own. Rather, it is the bedrock from which the car is built. In the same way, a contextual framework is the bedrock from which technical content is laid on top of.", "This style of learning leverages a fact well supported by research in the psychology of learning \u2014 humans retain knowledge most effectively by associating them to something they have a firm grasp on rather than memorizing new concepts in a void. In short, we learn by association.", "The late educational psychology professor Dr. Barak Rosenshine at the University of Illinois emphasized the importance of these contextual frameworks in education in Principles of Instruction:", "\u201cWhen one\u2019s knowledge on a particular topic is large and well-connected, it is easier to learn new information and prior knowledge is more readily available for use.\u201d", "The amount of background knowledge you have is also correlated to how well you comprehend new material. Therefore, to learn most efficiently, one must develop a strong foundation of background knowledge prior to delving into the details.", "So what is the background knowledge, or context, of data science? Well, I always begin context-based learning by asking a lot of questions. Specifically, I try to ask broad, conceptual questions, as opposed to detail-oriented ones.", "The following is a handful of questions I first asked myself at the beginning of my data science journey, as well as the answers I provided. I want to emphasize that my answers fulfilled my context gaps of knowledge at the time. In the same way, you should answer these and other questions in a manner that relates to your educational and personal background directly.", "Data science is an interdisciplinary field that leverages math, programming, business, and domain knowledge to tackle difficult data problems. The overlap between data science and my major (cognitive science with machine learning & neural computation) rests on math (which is necessary for machine learning), programming (which provides computational functionality for the field as a whole), as well as data analysis techniques, such as those used in computational neuroscience. The \u201cscience\u201d in data science comes from its use of various scientific methodologies, such as statistical significance.", "All data scientists go through a process known as the \u201cdata science pipeline\u201d, essentially a step-by-step, end-to-end process outlining the workflow of a data scientist. Acronyms like OSEMN make the basic pipeline easy to remember, but generally, pipelines vary in their subtleties. The basic structure is as follows:", "Machine learning (ML) is a field that studies computer science algorithms that are not traditional \u201cclosed\u201d algorithms. Instead, ML algorithms \u201clearn\u201d from data. This reliance on data is what makes ML so integral to data science. ML is in the \u201cmodel building\u201d and \u201cmodel deployment\u201d category of the data science pipeline.", "There are many fields that contribute to data science, but the most fundamental disciplines that make up data science are computer science, statistics, machine learning, and linear algebra. Although business and domain knowledge are also critical, the academic scope of data science relies on the original sub-disciplines mentioned. Furthermore, the sub-disciplines themselves often have their own sub-disciplines, such as calculus being necessary to understand how machine learning algorithms work.", "One important dichotomy I discovered early on during my undergrad math studies was the distinction between calculations and conceptual understanding. For example, in the case of statistics, memorizing how to calculate this", "is far less important than understanding the use case of a chi-square test statistic in testing hypotheses between categorical variables. Or, for calculus, understanding that this", "describes an area underneath a quadratic curve is far more important than memorizing fancy methods to solve it by hand. (*ahem*)", "I actually find building programs to be an incredibly accurate analogy of this. When learning to program, it is evidently clear early on that trying to learn every implementation of every function is impossible. A much more efficient strategy is to understand the inputs and outputs so that you may piece together snippets of code to make things work.", "Even in the cases you don\u2019t google or use StackOverflow, courses like fastai abstract the vast majority of implementation away so that you may build an end-to-end framework of understanding first (in fastai\u2019s case, build an end-to-end model), and only after do you go back to try to understand the fundamental details that underlie the abstractions.", "In this way, learning the concepts as opposed to the calculations is an application of context-based learning, as the contextual framework is built up so that when you do need to learn the calculations, they are compartmentalized properly.", "Following the context-based learning approach, once we have figured out the sub-disciplines of data science, we should dig into their context to understand how they fit in with the overall scope of the field.", "Why are all data science projects so coding-heavy?", "Modern statistics dates back to the 19th century, yet the application of statistics was confined to small samples as there was no efficient means of organizing large amounts of data and calculating parameters. The computer was that means.", "Furthermore, the advent of GPU parallel processing enabled machine learning models to train hundreds of times faster. In essence, incredibly powerful tools for statistics became accessible via the computer, thus the heavy emphasis on coding.", "FURTHER Qs: What programming languages are the most important for data science? How much programming do I need for data science?", "Why is statistics important for data science?", "Given that most of data science is simply computational statistics, this field lays out the groundwork and toolset for rigorous mathematical analysis of data.", "FURTHER Qs: Just what the hell is all this talk about Bayes? What specific statistics libraries do data scientists use?", "What is linear algebra and how does it relate to data science?", "Linear algebra is simply the study of linear equations. Multiple linear equations stacked together can be expressed as a matrix. Matrices, collections of numbers in rows and columns, are essentially equivalent to tabular data (data in a table). Moreover, image data is nothing but an n-dimensional vector of tuples (i.e. a list of a list of numbers). This is why a good understanding of linear algebra provides an understanding of the structure of data itself.", "FURTHER Qs: What is a tensor? How is linear algebra used in deep learning?", "What is the link between calculus and machine learning?", "A critical component of calculus is the study of optimization. Since the objective of all machine learning algorithms is to minimize an error function, calculus provides the tools to understand how that minimization occurs.", "FURTHER Qs: What is gradient descent? What is back-propagation? Why is calculus involved in it?", "Ask yourself conceptual questions. Lots of conceptual questions. These questions will vary for everyone as their aim should be to patch the gaps of knowledge for how data science fits into your overall understanding of the field.", "Get creative. A colleague of mine mentioned that visualization maps really helped her understand the context of AI, machine learning, and deep learning and how they all fit together. Similarly, use maps and flowcharts to understand any topics in data science you\u2019re currently struggling to piece together.", "After you\u2019re armed with a strong contextual understanding of data science, go ahead and dig deep into the nuances of various supervised algorithms, the best practices for data preprocessing, or the creation of beautiful dashboard visualizations with Tableau.", "Just try to make sure every new concept is put into context along the way.", "Your home for data science.
