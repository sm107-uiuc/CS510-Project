Like, you can\u2019t find a model that fits, or you\u2019re having problems with the data formats, or the leaders are not happy with the timelines?", "Sometimes I\u2019ve been in those situations. It\u2019s normal. Analytics is complex and things don\u2019t always go as you had hoped and planned.", "But it drives me mad when people think the solution to these problems is \u201clet\u2019s just get a(nother) data scientist onto this\u201d. There is so much wrong with that way of thinking. It gives away a fundamental misunderstanding of what data science is, and betrays a lack of regard for the skills needed to practice data science well. Here are a few reasons why you can\u2019t just \u201cget another data scientist onto it\u201d.", "Despite the explosion in the field, and the various education programs now being offered, good competent data scientists are not easy to come by. The market is highly competitive, and those who are most fluent in their craft are in high demand. If you are lucky enough to have strong data scientists in your organization, chances are that their plates are already very full.", "\u201cGetting another data scientist onto it\u2019 can often mean pulling in resources that are not really very qualified to call themselves data scientists, just for the sake of a quick fix. Like someone who has done an online Python course once a few months back and can pronounce the words Machine Learning. There are lots of those folk out there, but involving them can end up delaying the effort rather than helping it. And if the intention was to provide more capacity to help existing data scientists, it could be counterproductive because they will have to spend a lot of time hand-holding someone with a very low knowledge base.", "Data science is an exceptionally broad church. Sometimes you say you want a data scientist when it\u2019s actually a data engineer that you need. Sometimes you need an NLP expert, or someone who can do GLMs. Sometimes what you need is more akin to a front end developer to build apps. There is no data scientist that can do everything well.", "\u201cGetting another data scientist onto it\u201d is not prescriptive enough, and can result in HR bringing on board temporary or permanent employees whose backgrounds and skill sets are not a match for the problems being addressed.", "Similar to point 2, a data scientist is rarely effective if they don\u2019t have a knowledge domain to support their technical skills. Data scientists who analyze financial risk would use an entirely different set of tools and approaches compared to those that might analyze talent and people, or clinical trial results.", "Strong data scientists usually are supported by a level of experience and expertise in their specific domain. They know the typical data issues faced, the specific statistical phenomena that frequently occur. They can deal with them more fluently and quicker.", "\u201cGetting another data scientist onto it\u201d risks putting people under pressure to assign someone without domain expertise for the sake of filling the needed capacity. This can be devastating to the quality of the work and the potential solution.", "So much good, efficient analytics is enabled by a strong toolchain. The languages, the version control, the agile tracking and the publishing and sharing norms are all part of a smooth data science operation. Many data scientists can come on the scene who are not familiar with the specific toolchain being used, or who are inexperienced in any toolchain.", "\u201cGetting another data scientist onto it\u201d can put the existing workfow at risk or cause delays because a new resource is thrown into the effort who has no experience working with the tools being used. Combined with some of the issues above, this can be exceptionally risky.", "Solving organizational or business problems using analytics requires more than just data scientists. It requires engagement from experienced individuals from the business side who can help make judgments about what to model and not to model, and about what kinds of results would be most useful. It needs people who can help the data scientist by prioritizing which parts of the work are critical and which can be dropped if the data is poor or difficult to obtain.", "\u201cGetting another data scientist onto it\u201d can often disguise a deeper problem that there is not enough engagement from the business side, and that the existing analytics professionals are not receiving sufficient guidance on priorities and outputs. Another data scientist won\u2019t help with this.", "Data scientists are not a universally-available magic cure to all problems. Throwing more onto a problem can often make the situation worse, not better. So next time you hear someone say \u201clet\u2019s just get a(nother) data scientist onto it\u201d, don\u2019t be afraid to pull them up on it!", "Originally I was a Pure Mathematician, then I became a Psychometrician and a Data Scientist. I am passionate about applying the rigor of all those disciplines to complex people questions. I\u2019m also a coding geek and a massive fan of Japanese RPGs.
