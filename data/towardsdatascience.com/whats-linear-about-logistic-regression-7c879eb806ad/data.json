For a more complete explanation of this awesome algorithm, here are some of my favorite resources:", "Now let\u2019s get to the gist of Logistic Regression.", "Like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression is used to model the relationship between a set of independent variables and a dependent variable.", "Unlike Linear Regression, the dependent variable is categorical, which is why it\u2019s considered a classification algorithm.", "Logistic Regression could be used to predict whether:", "The applications listed above are examples of Binomial/Binary Logistic Regression where the target is dichotomous (2 possible values), but you could have more than 2 classes (Multinomial Logistic Regression).", "These classifications are made based on the probabilities produced by the model and some threshold (typically 0.5). E.g. A student is predicted to pass if her probability of passing is greater than 0.5.", "Let\u2019s start digging into how these probabilities are calculated.", "If we visualize a dataset with binary target variables, we\u2019d get something like this:", "There are a couple of reasons why fitting a line might not be a good idea here:", "So, instead of a straight line, we model it with an S shape that flattens out near 0 and 1:", "This is called a sigmoid function and it has this form:", "This function returns the probability that an observation belongs to a class based on some combination of factors.", "And if we solve for the linear function, we\u2019d get the log of the odds or the logit:", "But wait a minute, where did this magical function come from and how did the linear model get in there? To answer that, we\u2019ll take a look at how Logistic Regression forms its decision boundary.", "Behind every great Logistic Regression model is an unobservable (latent) linear regression model, because the question it\u2019s really trying to answer is:", "\u201cWhat is the probability an observation belongs to class 1 given some characteristics x?\u201d", "Let\u2019s take a look at an example.", "Supposed we want to predict whether a student will pass an exam based on how much time she spent studying and sleeping:", "Let\u2019s understand our data better by plotting Studied against Slept and color code our classes to visualize the split:", "Looking at this plot, we can hypothesize a few relationships:", "The idea here is there\u2019s a clear line separating these two classes, and we\u2019re hoping Logistic Regression is going to find that for us.

Since our threshold is set at 0.5, I\u2019m holding the logit at 0. This also allows us to view the boundary in 2d:", "Here\u2019s what it looks like on our scatter plot:", "That looks reasonable! So how does Logistic Regression use this line to assign class labels? It looks at the distance between each individual observation and the linear model. It would label all points above this line as 1 and everything below as 0. Any points on this line could belong to either class (0.5 probability), so in order to classify a point as 1, we\u2019re interested in the probability that the distance between this line and our observation is greater than 0.", "As it turns out, in Logistic Regression, this distance is assumed to follow the logistic distribution.", "In other words, the error term of the latent linear regression model in Logistic Regression is assumed to follow the logistic distribution.", "To calculate this probability, we take the integral of the logistic distribution to get its cumulative distribution function:", "Oh hey! It\u2019s the sigmoid function :).", "Tada! You should now be able to walk back and forth between the sigmoid function and the linear regression function more intuitively.
