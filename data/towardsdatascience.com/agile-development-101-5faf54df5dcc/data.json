Using an agile method gives developers the tools in order to be adaptable and flexible in a time when a client could change their objectives overnight. Using agile will allow the team to adapt without batting an eyelash.", "Agile development refers to a group of methodologies that have a focus on iterative development. The requirements and solutions during the development evolve throughout the process. This evolution is spurred on by the collaboration between teams of different functions. A couple of these methods are scrum and kanban. Both encourage frequent reflections on a project so that the development process aligns with business needs, such as a customer objective.", "When a development method claims to be agile aligned, it is based on the Agile Manifesto. The manifesto was created in 2001 at a ski lodge in Utah by 17 individuals. Before their meeting, the main method of development was called the Waterfall method. This traditional method has become obsolete due to the need for continuous updates. Agile supports this critical business need.", "The Agile Manifesto is basically a declaration of their intent to help developers and businesses find a method that works for both. A way for the business to continue to grow and adapt without burning out the developers.", "4 values are at the core of the manifesto:", "The manifesto states that the items on the left (in bold) carry more value than the items on the right. Both are important, but put more weight on the left.", "When a team agrees to apply an agile method, they adhere to these values and principles.", "Scrum is a subset of agile development that relies on daily meetings throughout a sprint. A sprint usually consists of 1\u20134 weeks for a project to be completed. During this sprint, a team will meet on a regular basis to touch base on their progress. This quick meeting is a time for developers to state what they have accomplished, what they plan on getting done before the next one, and if they are facing any roadblocks. These meetings are lead by a Scrum Master, whose main job is to help developers get through the roadblocks. These quick meetings are called stand-ups because it is done with everyone standing. Depending on your team, they may or not follow this.", "Each team and business will have its own variation of Scrum. It will usually include a daily standup, sprint, and a sprint review which occurs at the end. Some will have the developer write out a user story for the reason behind a new feature. The structure between each version will have the same skeleton.", "Kanban is a visual agile method. It relies on using cards and a board, think Trello or sticky notes and whiteboard. This allows for the team to see what the workflow will consist of and give an early opportunity to find a bottleneck. This could be needing a team member at some point or needing to buy equipment. It\u2019s a very proactive method.", "The board, aka Kanban board, will have columns on it. These columns are called Kanban swimlanes. Each will give a card to be categorized to distinguish tasks and items. Some swimlanes could be To-do, Doing, and Done. This visualization allows the entire team to be on the same page of the flow of a project with limited meeting time.", "That is a great question. Even though each method has its own blueprint, each will have some elements in common. Here are some agile practices:", "By its name, it is when two programmers work together at the same time on the same code. This usually consists of one programmer being the typist and the other asking questions on what their thought process is. This could also just be troubleshooting a program. When doing pair programming, having a time interval to switch roles will help keep both from burning out.", "Communicating with the customer about the progress of a project is critical for return business. Agile development gives the chance for a customer to be involved with the current development. Not in a literal sense, but for quick and easy understanding of where the project is. If the customer were to call in and ask how the project is proceeding, the project manager would be able to quickly know what to let the customer know.", "Burndown charts are a great way to visualize how much project is left with the time remaining. If there are too many elements of a project left, then it gives the development team a chance to adapt to the situation. This could be letting the project manager and communicating with the customer or prioritizing certain elements.", "Test-Driven Development is the practice of taking the requirements and making those into test cases into the next iteration. This allows for previous requirements to not become obsolete and forgotten with a rush to band-aid the feature. Definitely not a situation that anyone wants to be in.", "Agile development is a method of iterative methods that assists in continuous updates/releases. These methods allow developer/human needs and business needs to meet in the middle and be understood (hopefully).", "Your home for data science.
