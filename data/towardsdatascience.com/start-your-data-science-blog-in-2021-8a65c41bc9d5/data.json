It can be as simple as Linear Regression using scikit-learn or as complex as NLP. My first article published on Towards Data Science was a tutorial on Selenium for building a bot. I didn\u2019t know much about Selenium but I knew how to scrape Google Search results and wrote a tutorial on it.", "Myth: You need lots of time to maintain a blog", "Truth: If you can devote a few hours a week, it\u2019s good enough. Your first few articles might need you to dedicate a lot of time but once you get comfortable writing articles, it should only take you a few hours to write a good article. I usually spend only 5\u20136 hours a week writing articles.", "Myth: You need to be working in Data Science for X years", "Truth: Nope! I am a 4th-year Undergrad Computer Engineering currently on a co-op term with 0 years of industry experience related to Data Science. Most of my experience is related to web dev and I just started learning Data Science in the summer.", "Myth: Your articles need to be perfect", "Truth: Most articles are not perfect. Not everyone is blessed with the mind of a coding prodigy or impeccable grammar and that\u2019s OK! I am pretty sure if you read this article thoroughly, you will probably find quite a few mistakes.", "\u201cIf you can\u2019t explain it simply, you don\u2019t understand it well enough.\u201d \u2014 Albert Einstein", "When you write an article on a topic, you end up knowing more about the topic than you did before you started writing your article. When you write about a concept, you research on it and read other articles further understanding the topics. The best way to learn something is by teaching it to others :)", "If 2020 has taught us one thing, it\u2019s never to be dependant on only a single source of income. You need some side hustles and Blogging is a good side hustle. There are various ways to earn money", "It\u2019s been 4 months since I started writing articles consistently and I just crossed 100 bucks on Medium this month.", "Having a Blog gives you an authority in your domain. This increases your chances of employability as well.", "WordPress makes it really easy to set up a blog and monetize. It has a lot of plugins and you don\u2019t need to have any knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS. There are multiple themes available. You can check out my WordPress blog for inspiration", "You can start a blog on medium in a few minutes and it\u2019s FREE. Publishing to large publications such as Better Programming, Towards AI and Towards DataScience can get you a lot of views even if you don\u2019t have many followers", "You can use React or any other popular framework. This gives you a lot of flexibility and the ability to customize your website as you wish.", "Although not scientifically proven, most people love reading listicles. You can list down your favourite Python Libraries or the top 5 Data Science Side Projects.", "If you know how to build something or recently completed a side project, you should consider writing a tutorial on it. It helps you find places in your project you can improve/optimize on and also creates a great blog post", "If you recently resolved an issue or successfully did something after spending hours on stack overflow, you can write an article detailing how you did it. This might be really helpful for others. You can also write articles on Python Libraries", "You can compare product with similar use-cases and give your opinions on which you think is better.", "If you recently had experience using a product or working with a library, you can write a review on it", "Reading library docs is tiresome and most of us are looking for cheatsheets, a good cheatsheet is a life-saver.", "Mention the resources you used to learn about a subject,Programming Language etc", "If you recently landed a job or a freelance client, consider writing an article about it for the benefit of others. You can mention the resources and strategies you use, your experience interviewing at XYZ company", "As mentioned above, starting a blog has numerous advantages. The first few articles are always the hardest to write, it is not smooth sailing from there on but it gets easier to spend time writing. The first few months are going to be rough but just be consistent :)", "You can Sign Up for my newsletter if you wish to receive tutorials related to Data Science or Python Project Tutorials.", "Your home for data science.
