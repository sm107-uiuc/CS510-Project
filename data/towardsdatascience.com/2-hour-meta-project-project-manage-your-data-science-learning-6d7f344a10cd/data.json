We\u2019re told that we need to learn so many things that at times it can be overwhelming. Recently, I\u2019ve felt like there could be a better way to organize my own learning path as a data professional. This weekend, I decided to create and finish a meta-project to guide my own professional development journey. Luckily, I rediscovered the project management tool Monday.com to help me.", "monday.com is a project management tool that enables organizations to manage tasks, projects, and teamwork.", "I was introduced to Monday.com when I worked as a project manager in the civil engineering industry. We used it to track leads and keep tabs on our project portfolio\u2019s performance. Whenever we would gain a new lead, we\u2019d add it to our \u201cLeads\u201d dashboard. When we won a contract, we\u2019d add it to the \u201cOngoing Projects\u201d dashboard. Even our CEO used it to track monthly and quarterly sales performance. It didn\u2019t occur to me until recently that I could use it to project manage my own data science journey.", "Note: I am in no way affiliated with Monday.com or Udacity.com.", "Here\u2019s my own learning management board that I created in 1.5 hours.", "This has helped me lay everything out that I want to learn, set hard deadlines for when I need to complete projects, and visually assess what\u2019s a high priority.", "I challenge you to create your own free personal Monday.com dashboard. Ideally, this meta-project should take you less than 2 hours \u2014 if it takes more than that, your tasks are too granular and you need to step back and think about the big picture. By completing this meta-project, you\u2019ll not only be organizing your own learning, but you\u2019ll also be able to show employers that you have project management skills and soft skills that are often overlooked in traditional data science curriculums. Discussing your learning management dashboards will show that you\u2019re organized, serious about learning, and forward-thinking.", "There are a number of varying roles that data professionals can take on. However, the bulk of employers are looking for people who:", "By creating your personal work dashboard, you can show that you\u2019re prioritizing learning X over Y (prioritizing tasks). You\u2019re also acknowledging that you may not be able to do X project before learning Z skill (work dependencies). Your own learning journey may present topics that have competing priorities (stakeholder management).", "Should I learn this new machine learning algorithm before improving the existing work on my GitHub profile? Your answer: No, it\u2019s a higher priority to improve the documentation of current projects in my repositories first.", "Do I really need to complete this project before I apply for jobs? Your answer: According to my job search timeline, I need to have my work portfolio ready by September 25th. So yes, I do need to spend more time finishing this project because it will be crucial to discuss it in my application.", "You can even create a board for applying to jobs, interviewing, and networking. I went from this:", "Parting thoughts. I hope this project gives you some clarity on how to manage your learning. It definitely has helped me look back and celebrate my achievements, and to also envision the path ahead.
