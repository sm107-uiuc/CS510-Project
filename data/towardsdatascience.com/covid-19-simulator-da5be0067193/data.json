It is revealed that by wearing masks, R0 (the number of secondary infections each infected person typically causes) will potentially drop to < 1 (each infected person will infect less than 1 person in average), which strongly indicates that the virus spread could be significantly reduced.", "Covid-19, a susceptible animal-originated virus, quickly swept across the world since the first reported case on December 31 in Wuhan, China. There has been over 2 million people infected in the US during the last 6 months, causing the downshift of the economy as well as national wide social anxieties. Based on the unemployment data from U.S. department of labor, the unemployment rate surged from 4% to 14% from Feb to Apr, with 15 millions people lost their jobs.", "How can we reduce the risk of being infected during our public activity? Especially we already saw the second wave of pandemic after states reopen", "CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) suggests very general routine prevention procedures: washing hands, wearing masks and social distancing. This is old school knowledge that we learned since we were kids, but to what extent these procedures will reduce our chance of being infected? Herein, we developed a Covid-19 simulator to simulate the spread of virus in the indoor environment, and compared the number of newly infected people and minimum time needed for a new infection in different scenarios: 1) not wearing masks, 2) partially wearing masks, and 3) all wearing masks.", "People are shopping in an indoor market. The market has only one entrance/exit. The number of people in the market (number of people in the market) is constant: Once people reach the enter/exit, they will exit and will not be back. Meanwhile, the same amount of new people will enter the market. Suppose there is one random person infected by Covid-19, and he/she coughs/sneezes only once during the shopping time. We would like to know how many new people (R0) are infected by this initial Covid-19 carrier and how fast it is to have the first new infection, in order to evaluate the mask effectiveness.", "3.

Each position maintains a list of people at this position. It also has addPerson(Person person) and leave() functions to add/remove persons from current position.

We evaluated the total number of newly infected people and minimum steps needed for new infection in different scenarios by tuning the input parameters of space model: 1) number of people (numOfPeople), 2) number of initially infected people (initialSick), 3) Percentage of people wearing masks (maskPercent), 4) probability of being infected if wearing masks (maskSickPercent), and 5) probability of being infected if not wearing masks (unMaskSickPercent).", "Space(int size, int numOfPeople, int initialSick, int maskPercent, int maskSickPercent, int unMaskSickPercent) {\u2026}", "The output files are csv files, \u201cround\u201d represents the step number, \u201cid\u201d is the person ID, \u201crow\u201d and \u201ccol\u201d represent position in the matrix, \u201ctimeStampIfSick\u201d is the round number when the person gets infected (-1 indicates this person is not infected), \u201cstay\u201d indicates whether or not this person is in the market, \u201cmask\u201d indicates whether this person wears masks, color represents whether this person gets infected (red if infected, green if healthy).", "We can visualize people\u2019s health conditions (infected and healthy) in the market as we described previously. Briefly, we modeled the market space as a 10 * 10 matrix, each crossing represents a 6 feet * 6 feet area. Entrance/Exit is located at (0, 0), healthy people are represented by green circle, while infected people are represented by red circle. The affected area is marked as a bigger red circle. In a single simulation (market capacity at 50, initial number of infected people at 1, mask percentage at 0%, sickIfWithoutMask at 100%), we observed that in round 0 (0 indexed first round), there is only 1 person being infected; while after 100 rounds, 20 people are infected, which indicates R0 is 19. In other words, if there are 50 people in a 3600 Sq Ft market, 19 people will be infected by only 1 person if no one wears mask.", "The number 19 itself does not look terrible, but if the R0 for disease is 19, it will be disastrous", "Let\u2019s use R0 equals 2 as an example, which means the disease will infect two people. Suppose after 2 days, the infected people become contagious. So for each 2 days, the number of patients will double. If the disease is left uncontrolled, after 66 days, it will infect over 8 billion people in the worst scenario, which is much more than the current population in the world! In consideration of this, R0 in our case (19) is a terrible number, and we would like to see if masks can efficiently bring down R0, as well as slow down the spread of Covid-19.", "It turns out that there is a linear relationship between the number of newly infected people and market capacity: they grows at the same rate. In contrast, the number of newly infected people shows a logarithmic growth as the initial number of infected people increases: Starting from 1 initial infected person, the virus will infect 19 people at market capacity of 50, and the newly infected people will increase to 32 and 43 if the initial infected people increase to 2 and 3 respectively, and will plateau after the initial infected people reach 4.", "For the spread of Covid-19, both the increase of market capacity and initial infected people speed up the virus spread (indicated by the decrease of steps taken for new infection). If the initial infected people is set to be 1 with varied market capacity, the minimum steps for new infection will decrease exponentially from 12 steps at capacity 10 to 0 step for capacity at 100. If market capacity is set to be 50 with varied initial number of infected people, new infection occurs no later than step 1.", "Both the newly infected people and the spread speed of Covid-19 will increase with the increase of market capacity (more crowded in the market) and initial infected people (more infected people initially in the market). But which factor has a larger impact?", "It seems like reducing initial infected people in the market is a more effective way than reducing the market capacity to slow down the spread of Covid-19. But unfortunately, compared with limiting the number of people in the market, it is much more difficult to identify infected people before they enter the market, especially when they do not show any symptoms. According to a research from Scripps Research Translational Institute, 40%-45% of infected people are asymptomatic. In other words, even if one is infected with Covid-19, there is almost 50% chance that this person does not show any symptoms, such as fever, cough or short of breath, but this person are able to spread the virus to others.", "Given the situation where the initial number of infected people entering the market is difficult to control, will masks significantly reduce the spread of Covid-19 ? Or barely?", "The following figures show the growth of total number of newly infected people vs. market capacity and initial number of infected people in different scenarios: 1) no masks, 2) partial mask with 50% of people wearing mask, 3) All wearing masks with 80% level of protection, 4) All wearing masks with 95% level of protection, and 5) All wearing masks with 99% level of protection. By saying 99% level of protection, it means if a person wears masks and goes to the affected area, there is 1% probability that this person will be infected.", "Herein, we can clearly see that as more people wear masks and masks with higher level of protection, the total number of newly infected people tends to be \u201cflatten\u201d (less virus spread). In the case where only 1 initial infected person is in the market, if all people wear masks of 95% level of protection, the number of newly infected people will only increase up to 4 people even when the capacity increases 10 fold from 10 to 100. When the level of protection increased to 99%, only 1 people will be infected at Market Capacity 100 (most crowded situation). Similar situations are also observed when there are multiple infected people initially: when 20 people out of 50 are initially infected, only 4 people are newly infected if all people wear masks, compared with 41 if no one wears mask.", "In addition, masks will also greatly slow down the Covid-19 spread , even if there are multiple initially infected people in the market. It is observed that if no one wears masks, virus spread almost instantly as the market capacity and initial number of infected people increase. In contrast, when people wear masks and masks with higher level of protection, it takes longer and longer for virus for a new infection. If the market capacity and initial number of infected people are well controlled, the virus even cannot find the next host in its life cycle. This strongly indicates that masks will help to reduce or even stop the spread of Covid-19 on a large scale.", "This project is to quantitatively evaluate how effectively masks can reduce the spread of Covid-19, given different scenarios: 1) no masks, 2) partially wearing masks, and 3) all wearing masks. Covid-19 simulator was designed to model real marketplace and data was generated based on our assumptions. It is revealed that if all people wear masks, the number of newly infected people will be potentially reduced to 0, even when the market is very crowded, has multiple initially infected people and/or difficult to keep social distance. Although the infection rate might be exaggerated, especially considering even when there are no people wearing masks, people should not be 100% infected when they enter the affected area. However, the take-home message here is that wearing masks in public is not only responsible to protect yourself, but also responsible to protect others.", "Thank you for reading this article.
