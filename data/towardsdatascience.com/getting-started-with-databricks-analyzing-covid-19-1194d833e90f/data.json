In this article, we will analyze the COVID-19 data of Brazil by creating a data pipeline and indicating the responsibilities of each team member.", "To complete the next steps, you will need to have access to a Databricks account. The simplest way of starting one is by creating a Databricks Community account at https://community.cloud.databricks.com", "The first step is to configure a cluster. Databricks is a Spark-based platform, which is one of the most popular Big Data analytics framework. Spark is, by nature, a distributed system, and that\u2019s why the cluster creation process involves the selection of virtual machines for the driver and the worker nodes. Basically, the driver is the orchestrator of the cluster, and the worker nodes are responsible for the heavy work.", "The platform administrator is responsible for selecting the appropriate family of virtual machines based on the use case, the spark version, number of worker nodes, and autoscaling configurations. ETL processes may need memory-optimized devices, and heavy Machine Learning training processes may run on GPUs, for example.", "Go to the Clusters page and create a new cluster using the 6.6 ML runtime. If you are using Azure Databricks or AWS, you will need to select the VM family of the driver and the worker nodes. For this tutorial, you can choose the cheapest ones.", "Data ingestion can be a challenging area. Usually, companies have data stored in multiple databases, and nowadays is really common the use of streams of data. Fortunately, Databricks, in conjunction to Spark and Delta Lake, can help us with a simple interface for batch or streaming ETL (extract, transform and load).", "In this tutorial, we will start with the most straightforward type of ETL, loading data from a CSV file.", "First, we need to download our Dataset.
