NLP techniques are constantly evolving and promising applications are increasingly implemented by organizations to solve a wide range of problems.", "What exactly are companies using NLP for? What are exciting NLP techniques in a practical context and what are the challenges when applying them?", "We talked to thought leaders applying NLP in different industries about their favorite NLP techniques, the biggest trends, as well as opportunities and challenges of NLP in 2020. Here\u2019s what they said:", "\u201cTraining larger and larger models while data is changing constantly. The features we roll out are increasingly complex, which means that they often need larger ML models to support them, which in turn has consequences on infrastructure and training time. Simultaneously, especially with COVID, the information we need to be serving to users is changing constantly, which means we need to make sure our models are constantly updated. Luckily we\u2019ve been able to adapt our development and data maintenance processes to accommodate frequent but longer training times, but it\u2019s been quite a challenge to keep up.\u201d \u2014 Christine Gerpheide, CTO at Bespoke", "\u201cThe accuracy of AI and NLP is primarily based on ample and diverse training data, which is not available for many organizations. Synthetic training data can only go so far. Hence, enabling our customers to collect ample and diverse training data has become our priority.", "More specifically, bringing an ethics-first approach to training data collection has helped our customers further improve their ability to personalize customer experiences across chat, email, web and mobile.\u201d \u2014 Peter Stadlinger, Head of Product for Freshworks CRM at Freshworks", "\u201cTo create high-quality production-ready NLP applications, lack of enough & format/labeled data, and affordable compute/GPU machines are still the biggest challenges for the majority of the industry. With the advent of transfer learning/pre-trained models, more applications powered by NLP techniques will come to the market sooner. We will start to see new and improved digital and virtual assistants (next-generation modern robotics and chatbots) entering the market in the next 1 to 3 years. Vertically target businesses using NLP in areas such as real estate, law, and education will start to proliferate in the near future.\u201d \u2014 Vamsi Sistla, Director of Data Sciences at Unify Consulting/UC Berkeley", "\u201cThe challenge of healthcare or any other specific domain is the unique terminology used in the documents and limited datasets to be able to train existing models. Currently, the industry is in process of collecting and preprocessing raw data and I think in the next 1\u20133 years we will see a lot of new implementations of Name Entity Recognition models, as well as classification and summarization.\u201d \u2014 Alina Petukhova, Senior Data Scientist at John Snow Labs", "\u201cWe make a chatbot communication platform for the tourism sector and for emergency communication. Right now, a lot of communication is still performed via phone, contact centers, or on paper. These media are a pain for many, especially for those using other spoken languages. I think one of the biggest opportunities for NLP to advance society in these sectors is improving natural language understanding enough so that we can rely nearly entirely on automated, instant customer service for both travel and emergency advice. This idea is not new per se, but the research is there now, so within product companies we need to stay full throttle ahead, leveraging that research, to realize this ideal.\u201d \u2014 Christine Gerpheide, CTO at Bespoke", "\u201cI\u2019m very interested in how NLP can improve automation with \u201cstructured\u201d text, like programming languages and professional communications (I\u2019m thinking of how pilots and air traffic controllers communicate, for example.) What can we understand from analysis of these kinds of language? Can we automate detection of errors, such as errors in software or miscommunications in air traffic control?\u201d \u2014 Dean Wampler, Head of Developer Relations at Anyscale", "\u201cWhile chatbots have been on the rise for a number of years and have received wide adoption, they are still very basic in nature and cannot be easily enhanced or expanded, let alone self-train. There is no denial that breakthrough technologies such as GPT-3 will fuel the advancement and adoption of the next generation of chatbots \u2014 conversational chatbots. These will be able to continuously self-improve and handle more sophisticated conversations.", "In business software, this will enable brands to dramatically improve their customer experience while maintaining or even reducing cost. My team and I are at the forefront of developing and democratizing such chatbots.\u201d \u2014 Peter Stadlinger, Head of Product for Freshworks CRM at Freshworks", "\u201cLarge language models like BERT, GPT, or other derivatives will become mainstream and will benefit all industries across the board. Their ability to capture large amounts of a language\u2019s structure can be used as the basis for many applications. Transfer learning or fine-tuning of these language models will lead to leaps in performance in many forms of supervised learning NLP tasks.\u201d \u2014 Sebastian Reitz, Machine Learning Engineer at Adarga", "\u201cNatural language processing poses some exciting opportunities in the healthcare space. Implementation of natural language processing in healthcare is the future as these technologies are improving care delivery to a great extent.", "One of the most exciting ideas for me personally is its rule in clinical decision making as natural language processing and machine learning in health care help physicians make better medical decisions for their patients as NLP is used to help them in checking symptoms, diagnosis, medications, allergies, procedures and side effects and every possible cause to the case being treated.", "Another fascinating application is computer-assisted-coding as NLP promises to improve coder accuracy as computer-assisted coding extracts information about all the symptoms, diagnosis, procedures and medications to capture every code possible and to maximize claims hence both of these uses very beneficial to the patient and to the overall healthcare system.\u201c \u2014 Marianne Mak, Clinical Data Researcher at John Snow Labs", "\u201cTransformers-based language models such as BERT or GPT are a breakthrough step for NLP. However, they are very large, containing many millions of parameters. Fast and large-scale inference is hence slower or more costly, the larger these models get. Smaller model versions such as ALBERT or DistilBERT are great techniques to counter this. They still capture an extensive amount of structural and semantic knowledge while allowing more rapid fine-tuning and inference.\u201d \u2014 Sebastian Reitz, Machine Learning Engineer at Adarga", "\u201cControllable generation. There have been substantial recent advances in NLP and ML in generating natural dialog. However, in travel and especially emergency communication, there is often specific content we need to return or return in a certain tone. So one of the biggest technical challenges we have is merging curated dialog content, which is high-quality but labor-intensive to produce, with generated content, which is automated but unpredictable. So I\u2019m really excited about recent advances and the potential of controllable generation to help us achieve generated, natural-sounding content while preserving the details or nuances we need.\u201d \u2014 Christine Gerpheide, CTO at Bespoke", "\u201cI was very excited by the idea of applying methods we used in convolution neural networks for the image classification to the text processing, such as CNN layers and the Attention mechanism. And now my focus of interest is in the application of Graph Neural Networks for NLP.\u201d \u2014 Alina Petukhova, Senior Data Scientist at John Snow Labs", "\u201cIf I have to pick one: Bridging R&D and other parts of an organization, to make sure product companies efficiently leverage research. There\u2019s a lot of amazing NLP research these days, and interest in that career path has skyrocketed. But now we need to make sure we know how to scope NLP use cases to those that will benefit real customers. The most straightforward examples are making sure we aren\u2019t over-engineering when something simple would do, and that we target use cases that have the right security, privacy, and reproducibility requirements to be suited to NLP or ML.", "Even more pernicious in my opinion though, is failing to take processes into account when choosing research areas. For example, your R&D team may develop a killer new model, but if it can\u2019t be maintained with current company processes, that must be solved before it can be useful. Updating org-wide processes is no easy task and I\u2019ve seen it kill promising research projects in the past.\u201d \u2014 Christine Gerpheide, CTO at Bespoke", "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear lack of training data for many supervised learning tasks \u2014 especially so in the defence and security industry. This is exacerbated by a need for high specificity and reliability in the training data in this industry. Hence, the tagging of training and testing data would need to be done by subject matter experts \u2014 like in many NLP tasks. This makes acquiring data more difficult and more costly.\u201d \u2014 Sebastian Reitz, Machine Learning Engineer at Adarga", "\u201cIn business software, there are many \u201csmall data\u201d problems in NLP, which can only be solved by enabling businesses to gather more granular and relevant training data from their employees and customers \u2014 seamlessly via the user interface. The user interface has clearly become the new battleground for AI and NLP in business software.\u201d \u2014 Peter Stadlinger, Head of Product for Freshworks CRM at Freshworks", "\u201cThe breakthroughs in NLP in the last 2 years are mainly driven by BERT-like architectures, namely Transformers. However, these methods require significant computational resources (memory, time) during pretraining, downstream task training and inference compared to classical pretrained embeddings. Moreover, what is most concerning for me is that the researchers are getting away from the NLP fundamentals while trying to beat the latest BERT benchmarks with another BERT. My hands-on experience on customer facing real work projects tells me that transformers are not a magic wand that would create wonders at every problem. Sometimes, even a simple count vectorization does better than a complex BERT approach.", "Another issue is that transformers are only understood well enough by a handful of researchers and the people working in industry use these tools without worrying much about their inner mechanism thanks to high level easy-to-use packages and wrappers. Without understanding how it works and what is going on under the hood, these block box models are usually failing to solve real world cases coming from a specific domain, in which more simple models with a little bit of feature engineering would do better with less efforts as well as easy to maintain and modify in the long run.\u201d \u2014 Veysel Kocaman, Lead Data Scientist and ML Engineer at John Snow Labs", "\u201cManaging all artifacts, including data and models, especially to meet the needs of controlled production deployments is a challenge. It\u2019s one thing to do ad hoc experiments, it\u2019s another to do carefully controlled model development and deployment to production, then monitor how they are doing. You need full lifecycle management.\u201d \u2014 Dean Wampler, Head of Developer Relations at Anyscale", "Did you enjoy the reading and want to dive deeper into practical NLP applications and trends?
