APIs are powerful tools that allow the user\u2019s server to make a call to another server and directly pull large sets of data without ever leaving the user\u2019s website or program. Users can also set up automated API calls, which allow them to pull data from a foreign server over a specified set of time intervals.", "While most data from REST APIs comes in JSON format, some data comes in CSV, SQL, or NoSQL format as well. Knowi has broad native integration to not only JSON, but also to CSV, SQL, and NoSQL data, which makes Knowi uniquely equipped to efficiently make API calls and eliminate tedious ETL processes.", "Once you\u2019ve logged in to your Knowi trial account, the first step is to connect to your target REST API and ensure you\u2019ve got a connection. Here\u2019s how to do this:", "1. Use the panel on the left side of your screen to click on \u201cData sources.\u201d", "2. Scroll all the way to the bottom, and in the middle \u201cExternal\u201d section, click on {REST}.", "3. Make sure to name your new datasource. For the purpose of this tutorial, let\u2019s call this \u201cCoronavirus Datasource.\u201d", "4. Enter the URL for your API REST host in the top right corner. For this tutorial, we\u2019re going to use a Github repository that includes various files that come directly from Johns Hopkins University. Use this link for your REST host:", "5. Scroll down to the bottom and find the blue button titled \u201cTest Connection.\u201d Click on this, and once you do, you should receive an alert at the top of your page that says \u201cConnection Successful.\u201d", "6. Once you\u2019ve ensured that you have a connection, move over to the right of the \u201cTest Connection\u201d button and click \u201cSave.\u201d", "Congratulations! You\u2019ve set up your first datasource.", "Now that you\u2019ve finished setting up your first datasource, it\u2019s time to start making queries on your data. Here\u2019s how you do this:", "1. When you finished saving your datasource, you should\u2019ve received an alert at the top of your page saying \u201cDatasource Added. Configure Queries.\u201d Click on the word queries. (Alternatively, you can go back to the panel on the left side of your screen and click on \u201cQueries\u201d which is right below Data sources, and then select \u201cNew Query +\u201d from the top right.)", "2. Before you start doing anything else, make sure to name your query under Report Name*, and to select your datasource if you didn\u2019t go directly to the query after you saved your datasource. Let\u2019s call this report \u201cAPI Call.\u201d", "3. Scroll down to the settings and add the end point for your API Call and under \u201cEnd Point.\u201d The end point that we\u2019re going to use here returns a large CSV file with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from every county in the United States. Use this end point:", "4. Find the blue \u201cPreview\u201d button at the bottom left corner of your screen and click on the little up arrow on the right. Scroll up to 100 and click on that to quickly preview 100 rows of your data.", "5. Our data set has an individual column for each date, which isn\u2019t what we want. This means it\u2019s time for us to use Cloud9QL \u2014 Knowi\u2019s powerful built in query language \u2014 to query our data and present it in the form that we want. Scroll up to \u201cCloud9QL Query\u201d to start using it.", "6. Let\u2019s say that our end goal is a table with two columns: date, and new confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States on that day. Cloud9QL will allow us to do this in just four easy steps:", "7. Once you\u2019ve pasted that syntax into your Cloud9QL Query, head back to the blue \u201cPreview\u201d button and preview the first 100 rows again to make sure the data is in the format that we want it. You should see a two-column table with the date and the number of new COVID-19 cases on that date.", "8. Once you\u2019ve confirmed the data is in the format that you want, select the bar that currently says \u201cData Grid\u201d just below your preview and change the visualization type to \u201cLine Chart\u201d in order to see a more compelling view of the 100 rows that you just previewed.", "9. We\u2019ll get back to visualizing the rest of our data later. For now, click the green \u201cSave & Run Now\u201d button to save your query.", "After you\u2019ve saved your query and ran it at least once, Knowi used the query results to create a virtual dataset and stored that dataset within its elastic data warehouse. Knowi will do this every time you run this query.", "Now that you\u2019ve set up one REST API as a datasource and queried it, doing the same thing with another should be easier. To start, we\u2019re going to repeat the process that we used to set up our first REST API:", "1. Use the panel on the left side of your screen to click on \u201cData sources.\u201d", "2. Click on the orange button in the top right corner of your screen titled \u201cNew Datasource +.\u201d", "3. Scroll all the way to the bottom, and in the middle \u201cExternal\u201d section, click on {REST}.", "4. Make sure to name your new datasource. We\u2019ll call this one \u201cStock Market Datasource.\u201d", "5. Enter the URL for your API REST host in the top right corner. We\u2019re going to use Alpha Vantage\u2019s API that provides us with real-time stock market data. Use this URL:", "6. Scroll down to the bottom and find the blue \u201cTest Connection\u201d button. Click on this, and once you do, you should receive an alert at the top of your page that says \u201cConnection Successful.\u201d", "7. Once you\u2019ve ensured that you have a connection, move over to the right of the \u201cTest Connection\u201d button and click \u201cSave.\u201d", "Now we\u2019ve got two datasources set up: Coronavirus Datasource and Stock Market Datasource. It\u2019s time to join our stock market data with our Coronavirus data. Here\u2019s how we do this:", "1. Go back to the panel on the left hand side of our screen and go back to \u201cQueries.\u201d", "2. Instead of creating a new query, we\u2019re going to append our current query with a query of another datasource and join data from the new query with the data that we already have. Start this process by clicking on the pencil icon at the right of our existing query in order to edit it.", "3. Once you\u2019ve opened your query, scroll to the bottom and click on the blue \u201cJoin\u201d button.", "4. You\u2019ll notice that a new query builder has appeared. Select the new Stock Market Datasource that you just created as the datasource for this portion of your query.", "5. Scroll down to the settings within the query builder and set your end point. We\u2019re going to use /query, which lets the API know that we\u2019ll be querying its data. Copy and paste this and set it as your end point:", "6. In this case, Alpha Vantage requires the function that we want our query to run, the symbol that we want to run our query on, an API key, and the data type that we want our query to return. This means we need to set our URL Params before we make our API call. We want our query to return daily time series data from NASDAQ (NDAQ) in CSV format. In order to get this, copy and paste the following syntax into your URL Params:", "7. Click on the eye icon to the left of your query builder to preview only this portion of your query. As you can see, we\u2019ve got our data listed as \u201ctimestamp,\u201d alongside NASDAQ\u2019s open, high, low, and close prices, as well as the trading volume on that day.", "8. Scroll back up to where you selected your second datasource and find \u201cJoin Builder\u201d to the right of your datasource. Click on the Join Builder to get the join process started; it may take some time for Knowi to retrieve the fields from each data set.", "9. In the mean time, set your Join Type to \u201cInner Join.\u201d Once Knowi has retrieved the fields, set \u201cDate\u201d equal to \u201cTimestamp.\u201d", "10. For the sake of this exercise, we just want three columns: the date, the number of COVID-19 cases on that date, and NASDAQ\u2019s close price on that date. In order to trim our query down, we\u2019ll use Knowi\u2019s Cloud9QL Post Query feature, which allows the user to make additional queries to their data after everything has been extracted and joined. Enter the following code into your Cloud9QL Post Query:", "11. Click on the preview button again in order to make sure that you\u2019ve got the data in the format that you want it. You should see three columns: Date, COVID-19 cases on that date, and NASDAQ\u2019s Close Price on that date.", "12. Scroll back to the bottom right corner of your screen and click \u201cSave & Run Now.\u201d", "You just completed a query that calls two different APIs, pulls different data from each of them, and returns it all in one table. Nice job!", "Before we get into visualizing our data, it\u2019s important to think about what we\u2019re trying to visualize. Our end goal is a dashboard that allows us to compare trends between the NASDAQ stock exchange and COVID-19 cases and monitor new trends as they arise. We could set up a dashboard right now that would allow us to visualize what has already happened as of today, but that dashboard would be limited because the latest data would always be from the last time that we manually made the query.", "Because we want to monitor things in real time, we want to set up our query so that it automatically pulls new data and allows us to monitor the latest data every time we open our dashboard. Knowi makes it easy to automate this process in just three steps.", "1. Click on the pencil icon on the right side of your query to return to the query that you just created. Scroll down to the bottom and find \u201cScheduling.\u201d", "2. Configure the scheduling process based on how frequently you want to make this API call. Since close price is only updated once per day, set your query to update daily starting tomorrow.", "3. Don\u2019t forget to click the green \u201cSave & Run Now\u201d button.", "Your query is now set to automatically pull data from two separate APIs every day and automatically join the data from each of them. The last step is to create a visualization for your data to see how things move in real time.", "Even if you weren\u2019t previously curious how NASDAQ\u2019s stock price has moved as COVID-19 has grown in the United States, this tutorial has probably piqued your curiosity. Knowi makes it simple to create visualizations from our dataset so that we can quickly make note of any critical trends. Here\u2019s how we do this:", "1. Head to the top of the left panel and click on \u201cDashboards.\u201d Click the small orange \u201c+\u201d button and name your dashboard. We\u2019ll call this one \u201cJoint API Call Visualizations.\u201d", "2. Head back to the left panel and just under dashboards, select \u201cWidgets.\u201d In widgets, you should see the new widget that you created. Click on it and drag it over to your dashboard.", "3. Click on the 3 dots in the top right corner of the widget, and then select \u201cSettings.\u201d", "4. Click on \u201coptions\u201d to open up your options menu, scroll down to \u201cSecondary Y-Axis\u201d on the left side of your options menu, and select \u201cClose.\u201d This will create a secondary Y-Axis for NASDAQ\u2019s stock price that allows you to see how it has trended.", "5. Use Knowi\u2019s visualization settings to make your chart look more professional. Use \u201cModify Colors\u201d to change New Cases to #CE0000 and close to #CECECE, change your Legend Alias to something that describes the data in more detail, and add a title for your primary X and Y axes.", "6. In the top right corner of the screen, click on the orange \u201cSave\u201d button.", "Once you close your widget, you\u2019ll see that you\u2019ve now got a dashboard set up to visually monitor and compare trends in the movement of COVID-19 cases in the United States and the NASDAQ stock exchange.", "Because you\u2019ve scheduled your query to automate daily API calls, you\u2019ll be able to use your dashboard to monitor these two variables as time passes.", "Now that you\u2019ve got your dashboard set up, you\u2019re ready to use Knowi\u2019s natural language processing abilities to query your data using search-based analytics. You\u2019re also ready to share your dashboard with somebody else and let them use search-based analytics to query your data \u2014 even if they\u2019re not familiar with Knowi. Here\u2019s how to run search-based analytics on your data:", "1. Head to the top right corner of your widget and click on the 3 dots, then scroll down a bit and click on the \u201canalyze\u201d button. This will show you your data in table format.", "2. From here, use the search bar above your data to ask your data questions and receive quick answers. Let\u2019s say that we want to see weekly averages of each number in order to eliminate some noise from the daily numbers. All we need to do in order to see weekly averages is type \u201cshow me average cases, average close by week\u201d into our search bar in order to quickly transform our data into the format that we want it.", "3. Now it\u2019s time to visualize our data in this new format. Switch over to \u201cVisualization\u201d and change your visualization to a Line Chart. Make sure to set \u201cAverage Close\u201d as your secondary y-axis so that you can clearly see the movement in that variable as well.", "4. Head over to the top right and click on the \u201cclone\u201d icon. This will create a new widget with the edits that we\u2019ve made to our original widget.", "5. Once you\u2019re done with your clone, click on the orange \u201cAdd to Dashboard\u201d button.", "As you can see, this process doesn\u2019t require much more than curiosity and a basic knowledge of the English language. The ability to ask data questions in plain English and return answers can help bridge the gap between data scientists and management, and make Knowi\u2019s dashboards accessible to anybody who speaks English and wants to know more about data.", "To summarize, we just set up two separate REST APIs as datasources within Knowi, wrote a query that calls each of these REST APIs and returns data in a digestible format, and then scheduled that query to make API calls and return new data every day. We then created a new widget from the dataset that was created when we ran our query, as well as a new dashboard, and stored our new widget within our dashboard. We also used search-based analytics to create a separate, smoother visualization that shows us weekly averages of our two variables. Now, all that we have to do in order to monitor NASDAQ\u2019s stock price alongside new COVID-19 cases in the United States is log into our Knowi account.", "Your home for data science.
