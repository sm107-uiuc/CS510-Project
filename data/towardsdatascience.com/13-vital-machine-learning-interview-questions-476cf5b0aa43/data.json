In this story, I have listed the typical questions I and other developers got while applying for jobs in the field.", "Machine Learning is a practice of using algorithms to organize data, learn from it, and make predictions about real-world problems. In comparison to finding a solution to each specific problem, the machine is trained using large amounts of data to find solutions on its own.", "Deep Learning is a form of Machine Learning that is based on the principles of the human brain. In short, Deep Learning is a technique for implementing Machine Learning. Neural networks are an essential part of Deep learning, which is based on the principle of interconnected neurons.", "To put it in simple terms, precision is the number of relevant entries over the total number of entries. Precision signifies the percentage of the results which are relevant. So if you search for \u201cbrown dogs\u201d in Google and only seven out of ten images are brown dogs, then the precision is 7/10=0.7.", "The recall is the number of retrieved instances among all relevant instances. In this case, we are looking for correct entries that were displayed to us from the total number of available correct entries. Say there are fifteen correct pages about brown dogs. Since we only got seven, our recall is 7/15=0.47.", "In statistical analysis, F1 is a measure of a test\u2019s accuracy. In the case of Machine Learning, it refers to the model\u2019s performance.", "It is calculated as a weighted average of the precision and recall of a model. The results closer to 1 are the best and closer to 0 are the worst. F1 score is best when we need to seek a balance between precision and recall, and there is an uneven class distribution.", "This is a rather simple trick question, of which there could be many. Model accuracy is only part of the model performance. The accuracy and performance are directly proportional. Therefore, better performance leads to more accurate predictions.", "There certainly is no superior algorithm that can be used in every single scenario. That is the reason why there are so many and each one is targetted towards a certain problem or data set. To decide which one to use, consider the following questions:", "Based on these questions, here are some examples of algorithms for each case:", "The ability to summarize complex ideas and explain them in a simple yet understandable manner is often tested on interviews. For these types of questions make sure you have several algorithms you could explain well. Also, practice explaining them in short periods of time.", "If you find missing or corrupted data in the dataset you could either drop those rows or columns. Alternatively, you could choose to replace them with another value.", "For example, in Pandas isnull() and dropna() will help you find columns of data with missing or corrupted data and drop them. You could also use fillna() to replace those values with zeros.", "Data structures are tested in all types of interviews, so it is generally a good practice to prepare for such.", "An array is a set of similar data objects stored sequentially under a common variable name.", "A linked list is a data structure that contains the sequence of elements, where each one is linked to the next one. Each item in a link list commonly contains two fields: the data field and the link to the next item.", "The most notable difference is in the way these two are stored. An array has a fixed size, which has to be declared prior to its utilization. A linked list, on the other hand, can be stored separately, so it could always be extended.", "Decision trees build models as tree structures. The data is broken down into smaller subsets, which follow the structure of a tree with nodes and branches. Both the numerical and categorical data can be handled by decision trees.", "Pruning means simplifying or compressing a decision tree by removing redundant or unessential sections of the tree. It prevents overfitting and therefore improves accuracy.", "Pruning can be done in two ways(directions):", "Mentioning any pruning algorithm, such as reduced error pruning, would demonstrate a practical understanding of the concept. Make sure to explain it quickly, while mentioning the most important parts of it.", "These types of questions are aimed at finding whether you are actually passionate about Machine Learning. It is essential to keep up with the latest scientific literature to demonstrate your interest in the position.", "Search for some credible research papers and make sure you understand them well. As a general practice, it is best to actually read literature about your field of study and work.", "If you are truly passionate about the field, you must have done several projects on your own. This question is used to better understand your interest and it is a chance to show your knowledge and mention your past projects. Check out what is out there and be prepared to talk about it.", "As you might have noticed, not every question on the interviews is trying to test your programming skills. It is essential to have proper skills, however, the understanding of concepts and general interest in Machine Learning are no less important.", "You could never know which exact questions you will get on the interview, however, they tend to repeat quite often. It is quite likely you will get one of these questions or similar ones in your next interview. Make sure to practice and take your time to understand these concepts.", "Your home for data science.
