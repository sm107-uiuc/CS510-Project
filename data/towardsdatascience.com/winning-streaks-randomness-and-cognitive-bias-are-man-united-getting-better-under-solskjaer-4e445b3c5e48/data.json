Dirk Kuyt\u2019s hat-trick in 2011. Luis Su\u00e1rez tucking in Liverpool\u2019s third at Old Trafford in 2014. Pretty much everything to do with David Moyes. After enduring a pretty torrid 20\u201330 years, the last few seasons have been considerably kinder to those of us who aren\u2019t so keen on that particular shade of red.", "So, yeah, maybe I\u2019m not the most impartial of analysts who could be writing a post like this. I am willing to admit there may be a chance that I\u2019m more likely to pay attention to stats that paint United as a second-rate team with no hope of improving. We\u2019re all human, after all.", "Having said that, it does sort of feel like we\u2019ve had our fun by now. We\u2019ve had seven years of \u2014 let\u2019s be clear \u2014 thoroughly enjoyable schadenfreude, but there is something about it that\u2019s just starting to lose its edge. It\u2019s always great seeing your bitter rivals beaten into second place \u2014 but when they keep on being rubbish, it does start to make that rivalry somewhat less bitter. Beating the bad guys is only fun when there\u2019s a chance you might lose. And Pep Guardiola\u2019s team of slick, polite, attractive professionals playing their nice shiny passing football frankly just aren\u2019t villainous enough to properly replace them.", "So when The Athletic wrote \u2014 ever so tentatively \u2014 that we might have to start considering Manchester United as a \u201cgood\u201d team after their 2\u20130 win over Everton in the League Cup, my reaction was one of grudging acceptance. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s team have won three in a row for only their third time ever under his leadership. They\u2019ve won their last 14 away from home in domestic competition. The football fan in me isn\u2019t actively enjoying this run of form of course \u2014 but is at least relishing the thought of having a proper rival again.", "But the statistician in me...paused for a moment.", "Everyone loves a good fallacy. And one of the classics is the so-called \u201chot hand\u201d fallacy. First written about by economists in the eighties, the hot hand fallacy is the belief that things that are happening now will continue to happen in the future; that a run of good luck is bound to continue. The term itself comes from basketball, where a player who scored with a number of shots in a row was said to have \u201chot hands\u201d, and believed to be more likely to score with their next shot than if they weren\u2019t on such a good run. Here\u2019s legendary behavioural economist Richard Thaler briefly explaining it in the film The Big Short.", "Although later research has challenged whether this belief is always a fallacy or not, we can still say that a run of good results doesn\u2019t necessarily mean more good results are likely in the future. Humans are generally really bad at understanding randomness and probability. Even when events are randomly distributed, you\u2019ll often get far more streaks of the same result than you might expect. Flip a coin 100 times, for example, and there\u2019s an 85% chance you\u2019ll get ten heads in a row at some point.", "So the question is: is United\u2019s recent run of form evidence that they\u2019re actually improving over time? How likely is it that you\u2019d see this set of results if they weren\u2019t getting any better?", "This latter statement is our null hypothesis, and it\u2019s what we\u2019re going to test in the rest of this post.", "Fortunately, these are fairly trivial statistics to calculate. First up, we need to get some data on all of United\u2019s results under Solksjaer. We can get this from the excellent football-data site, and then do a little manipulation to get the results over time for Manchester United only.", "Next up, we can plot all of the league results United have achieved under Solskjaer as a sequence. (Note we\u2019re just focusing on the league here, for simplicity).", "We can see a couple of unbeaten runs in there \u2014 those sequences of green and grey bars \u2014 most notably at the start of Ole\u2019s reign, and in the most recent period.", "Next up, let\u2019s conduct a thought experiment. Let\u2019s imagine that United haven\u2019t improved during this period (our null hypothesis). If that were the case, then you would expect that their probability of winning a match, all being equal, would be the same this season as in the previous seasons since Sojskaer\u2019s arrival.", "From the start of Ole\u2019s tenure in December 2018 until the beginning of this season, United had won 30 of their 59 games. This means that, on average, their probability of winning a match in this period was 50.8%. This is, of course, a simplification \u2014 their actual probability of winning any one of those games would depend on a whole host of factors \u2014 but it\u2019ll do to illustrate the point we\u2019re looking at here. This season they\u2019ve won 8 out of 13, or 61.5%.", "The question then becomes: if United hadn\u2019t improved, and that probability of winning had remained constant, how likely is it that they would have won those eight games this season? How likely is it that they\u2019d have won four in a row, as they have done recently, and been unbeaten in their last seven?", "Let\u2019s start by looking at that overall record. If our null hypothesis is correct, then the team\u2019s games this season could be treated as independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials, with a probability of success on each trial (p) equal to 0.508.", "We can model this using a simple binomial distribution, to calculate the probability of united winning 8 or more of their 13 games this season if they hadn\u2019t made any improvement.", "This gives us a probability of around 14%. In other words, it looks unlikely but plausible that United could have won 8 out of 13 games this season without any improvement.", "But of course, football isn\u2019t just about wins. We should really look at whether their points per game is significantly greater this season, statistically speaking. For this, we can just run a simple t-test:", "The things to look at here are the mean values and the p-value. What we see is that United are achieving 2 points per game this season, compared with around 1.8 in the previous period (since December 2018). But the p-value is 0.627.", "This means that, if there were no genuine difference in the underlying distributions generating the points in the two period, there is around a 63% chance of obtaining results as extreme as this. In other words, if United hadn\u2019t actually improved, it\u2019s still entirely plausible, or even likely, that they could\u2019ve achieved the results they have this season.", "Sure, p-values and statistical significance are not the be all and end all, and we should retain a healthy degree of scepticism before relying too heavily on them. But what we can say is that the overall set of results this season isn\u2019t by itself entirely convincing evidence of a substantial improvement by United.", "Next, let\u2019s look at that run of four consecutive wins. How likely is it that you\u2019d get a run like that this season if the team hadn\u2019t improved?", "This gives us a probability of 49.9%. So this means that, without any change in their underlying winning probability, the chances of Ole\u2019s team achieving a four-game winning streak in the first 13 of this season was basically fifty-fifty.", "Again, this doesn\u2019t look like convincing evidence of the team getting better.", "Finally, we can take a look at that recent unbeaten run of seven games. Again, what we\u2019re asking here is \u2014 how likely is it that last season\u2019s United could\u2019ve achieved that? If the answer is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d, then that might be evidence that this season\u2019s team is better than before.", "There are a couple of different ways we can do this, but we\u2019ll use the same formula as before. Instead of using with win percentage for the p parameter, we\u2019ll use the win or draw percentage. For the December 2018 - September 2020 period, this was 78%.", "It turns out this is even less convincing evidence of improvement this season. We find that, even if the team\u2019s average chance of losing a game hadn\u2019t changed, they\u2019d actually have a 74% chance of achieving a seven-game unbeaten run in the first 13 matches of this season.", "So, what do we have. We have an unbeaten run that we\u2019re highly confident last season\u2019s United could have achieved. We have a four-game winning streak that they\u2019d have a fifty-fifty chance of managing. And we have an overall points-per-game that hasn\u2019t changed significantly, in statistical terms, and that the 2018\u201319 team could probably have managed without any underlying improvement.", "Of course, this is only part of the picture. I haven\u2019t looked at the quality of opposition that United have played, at which players they\u2019ve had available, at their expected goals or any other underlying performance metrics, at any of the qualitative attributes of their play or the attitude in the dressing room. All of these things are important too. But what we have shown is that, contrary to popular opinion, results alone can be misleading.", "And that\u2019s really the key message of this post. A run of good results doesn\u2019t by itself mean a team is suddenly good. A run of bad results doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the manager should be sacked.", "And fans of the red half of Merseyside might have to settle for comfortable smugness for a little while longer before we get our pantomime villains back.", "Your home for data science.
