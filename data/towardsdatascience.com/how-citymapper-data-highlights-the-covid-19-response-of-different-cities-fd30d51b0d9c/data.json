To contain the spread of the virus, many governments have prohibited us from visiting friends and family or travelling to workplaces, shops and restaurants. Commuting in cities across the world has ground to a halt.", "One way which we know that this has happened is because users of apps like Citymapper have stopped using them to plan journeys.", "Above is our latest data viz using Citymapper\u2019s journey planning data to compare one angle of the Covid-19 response from different cities. It is created by my partner Jo\u00e3o Silva and I, I\u2019ll briefly describe it here in two parts.", "Despite commuting starting to slow on the same day, London took one full week longer than Paris to reduce average journeys down to 20%", "In the first chart from this data viz we used a range plot to show when 12 cities started to reduce travel (when they hit 80% of average journey planning, shown in pink). You can then compare how long it took these cities to pretty much stop travelling (at 20% of average journey planning, shown in turquoise when it was mostly just key workers moving around).", "Here you can clearly see that citizens of Madrid, Paris and Istanbul dramatically decreased journey planning from 80% to 20%. At the other end of the spectrum, London and Sydney took 11 days, while Moscow and Toronto took 12 days.", "Using the percentage of Citymapper planned journeys appears to match reality for most cities. For example, on 25 March the day after London finally reached 20% of usual Citymapper journey planning, the Mayor of London announced that \u2018Tube ridership was already 88 per cent down yesterday compared to the same day last year and bus ridership 76 per cent down\u2019.", "When London slowed down there had been 422 deaths", "The second chart in the data viz shows the context that the reduction from 80% to 20% journey planning took place. It\u2019s a scatter plot using the city\u2019s national flags as dots to suggest how seriously city commuters and their national governments took the escalation of the virus in their countries.", "For example, Lisbon may have taken 50% longer than Paris and Madrid to reduce travelling, but the circumstances were much less severe with four Covid-19 national deaths when this happened compared to 175 in France and 196 in Spain.", "We also found interesting patterns with Turkey and The Netherlands (which we annotated on the chart), but the most interesting story is how in this chart the UK separates from the pack of cities that were slow to stop travelling. The UK had 422 Covid-19 deaths when London\u2019s journey planning dropped to 20% which is much higher than the range of 9 to 36 deaths in Australia, Canada and Russia when they stopped.", "The consequences of the UK government\u2019s slow lock down in March, as illustrated from one angle in this data viz, has been severe. The UK is now expected to become the worst affected country in Europe.", "We used the browser-based UI and UX design application, Figma, to design the data viz. We found the national flags images from Country Flags for the scatter plot.", "The Citymapper Mobility Index provided the fascinating journey planning data and we used Worldmeter\u2019s coronavirus statistics for the number of deaths on specific days.", "Citymapper is an incredibly well-known app, however its audience is unlikely to be exactly representative of a city\u2019s demographics. The data appears to follow what happened with London commuters as a whole but may be more of problem for cities with higher levels of income inequality such as Istanbul.", "Finally, the charity where I work has an urgent appeal for funds to help the staff and patients that have been affected by Covid-19 at five London NHS hospitals.
