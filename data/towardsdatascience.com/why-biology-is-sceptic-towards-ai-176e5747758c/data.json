Today I am going to explain what motivated this series of posts, and share why Biology and Medicine have conceptually different views on AI, something I have learnt working for many years with people having biological and medical background.", "I came to Machine Learning not because it is cool and everyone talks about it, but discovered it when looking for an alternative to Frequentist statistics. I was doing statistical analyses searching for genes associated with diseases via p-value based ranking when genetic variants from all genes are scanned for their correlation with a disease (Genome-Wide Association Studies) like on the Manhattan plot for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) below.", "If you are not familiar with Manhattan plots, one point is one genetic variant, x-axis is the position of the genetic variant on the human genome, and y-axis is -log10(p-value) of correlation/association of the genetic variant with the disease. The peaks on the Manhattan plot manifest genetic segments having strongest association with the disease. In this way, many genes related to human diseases were found, and the hope was that this knowledge can be used for Clinical Diagnostics for prediction and prevention of the diseases. However, very quickly it was realized that the genes found in association studies can not predict common diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular, schizophrenia etc. which I discussed in details here. I felt the failure was due to the p-value based ranking of genes and started coding my own algorithm which optimized predictive power instead of p-value of association. Later I realized that what I was coding is known as Random Forest in the research called Machine Learning. This is how I got interested in this fascinating area.", "However my enthusiasm about Machine/Deep Learning/AI was not shared by majority of my colleagues with biological background. When I argued to learn from Google Deep Mind to try to find answers to our rhetorical questions like the Missing Heritability problem, I felt how the negative silence suddenly embraced everyone in the audience and I quickly got encircled by academic professors explaining that Machine Learning is a hype, a black box, and \u201cwe do not need prediction but want to understand biological mechanisms\u201d.", "Many of them wondered why they should care about Deep Learning advances in Chess, Go and Star Craft which is typically emphasized when talking about Deep Learning. Indeed, for a typical biologist it is hard to see what Star Craft has to do with a living cell. There is certainly a connection between the general intelligence that AI people struggle to build and Biology but it is rarely explained in literature. When talking to biologists I usually try to give much more appreciated examples of Deep Learning knocking out the long-standing Protein Folding problem.", "Now let us briefly discuss the stereotypes about Deep Learning mentioned above. Well, regarding the hype I agree, but is it a bad hype if it improves our quality of life? Ironically enough, even biologists who do Deep Learning for microscopy image analysis often tend to dislike and distrust Deep Learning but they have to do it because a) it is a hype, and b) it gives a higher accuracy with automated feature extraction compared to the manual segmentation.", "Regarding the black box, any Machine Learning gives you features ranked by their importance for your biological process of interest, i.e. you get the key players of the process. If you know the drivers of your biological process, you should understand quite a lot about the process, shouldn\u2019t you? So I never understood why they call it a black box.", "Now we come to the cornerstone point of biologist and natural scientist mentality. Prediction. I try not to use this word when communicating with biologists due to its bad reputation in this community. It is typically thought that doing prediction AI people concentrate too much on the accuracy of their models and ignore the underlying mechanisms of the process they study. This has some ground but generally is an incredible stereotype.", "How can one do good predictions without understanding the underlying mechanisms?", "If a model can predict, there should always be a way to roll it back and look at what is inside the model and why exactly it predicts. Alternatively, Genome-Wide Association Studies provide a bunch of features/genes which make a lot of biological sense but they do not predict diseases meaning they can not be used for Clinics, so there is something wrong with the way they are selected. What is the point to select genes based on biological sense if they can not be used in the Clinics? Caring about accuracy, analysts indirectly care about the underlying biological mechanisms.", "In my opinion, this scepticism and conservatism slows down the progress in such exciting areas of Life Sciences as Population Genetics, Ancient DNA and Evolutionary Biology where Machine/Deep Learning/AI is basically absent. My prediction is that the Reinforcement Learning can be the future of computational analysis for Evolutionary Biology.", "In contrast, talking to my colleagues with medical background feels totally different. They are very enthusiastic and curious about AI even if they do not fully follow my reasoning on Neural Networks. This open-mindness is partly due to the fact that Machine/Deep Learning/AI is already there, widely used in Precision Medicine (where early disease prediction is one of the major goals), and makes advances in Radiologic Imaging for cancer diagnostics. One impressive clinically applicable algorithm has been recently released by the Deep Mind and offers 48 hours early prediction of acute kidney injury.", "Another reason for the keen interest in AI within the medical community is the desperate wish to help their patients using all available means. If AI can early predict a disease, this is the most important here now for saving people\u2019s lives as we do not have time to investigate deeply the underlying biological mechanisms. Indeed, being a few times in the Clinics and seeing people in pain opened my eyes a lot, I surely understood much more clearly why I am doing research.", "In this article, we have learnt that Machine/Deep Learning/AI is more clinically applicable framework compared to traditional p-value based statistical methods as it specifically optimizes the predictive power of the analysis which is of key importance for the Clinics. Despite its bad reputation in the biological community, prediction does not necessarily sacrifice the depth of biological understanding when trying to achieve higher accuracy.", "As usually, let me know in the comments your favorite area in Life Sciences which you would like to address within the Deep Learning framework. Follow me at Medium Nikolay Oskolkov, in Twitter @NikolayOskolkov and connect in Linkedin. I plan to write the next post about How to detect regions of Neanderthal introgression with Deep Learning, stay tuned.", "Your home for data science.
