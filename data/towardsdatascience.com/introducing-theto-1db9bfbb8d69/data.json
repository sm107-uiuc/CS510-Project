This post is about the process I followed to design the tool. If you just want to skip to the tool itself, you can see a demo notebook here. Otherwise, read through the post and I\u2019ll post the link to the notebook and other resources at the end.", "About a year and a half ago, I wrote about a precursor to Theto and explained some of the principles I tried to follow in creating the tool. I want to expand on that discussion here: in writing and organizing Theto\u2019s code, I needed to think systematically about what goals I was trying to accomplish, and especially about what things could prevent me from achieving those goals, and how I could build in a way that avoided those pitfalls. In other words, I needed to revise the design of the tool, and the revisions of the code grew out of that work.", "Putting in that design work has made the code much more straightforward to fix and improve, but more importantly, it has allowed me to spend a much greater percentage of my time using the tool instead of maintaining it. Theto is better now than it used to be, but that is largely the result of better design than better code. (For a more complete discussion of design as it applies to data science, read what I wrote here).", "So I want to talk about the kinds of work that I did often enough that I felt I needed a tool to help me. Then I want to talk about how good design principles helped me organize the creation of that tool. Then I\u2019ll go over some of the things Theto can do.", "A large part of my work at Valassis has to do with making sense of mobile location data. Location data is much easier to understand when you can look at it in the context of landmarks \u2014 buildings, roads, administrative boundaries, bodies of water, and things like that. It\u2019s difficult and expensive to get all of that contextual data into a place and format where it can be meaningfully compared to something like mobile GPS signals. It\u2019s much less difficult to plot those GPS signals on top of a picture that has many of those contextual signals, and then use my human brain to make sense of everything. For example:", "Our customers often find it valuable when we can attach location signals to meaningful spaces. For example, it\u2019s often useful to know that a location signal was in a single-family residence or a building that houses a Home Depot. The context helps us make better decisions. To get that context, we buy a dataset of parcels procured from city and county assessors offices, image recognition based on satellite imagery, and other sources.", "The left-top image above shows a subdivision. The white lines demarcate residential housing plots. The dark blue line demarcates the subdivision. Our data contained no metadata that differentiated between the two boundaries; the larger boundary fully contains all of the smaller boundaries, and the larger boundary is not fully filled with smaller shapes \u2014 there are gaps.", "The left-bottom image shows the boundary for a store. That data is fine. If you look closely in the middle of the image, you\u2019ll see a dark square. That\u2019s a dumpster. If you look even more closely up and to the left from that dumpster, you\u2019ll see a blue shape. That, as far as I can tell, is the dumpster\u2019s parcel. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s there, but it is.", "The middle image is the parcel for a river. Interesting, but not very valuable for our business. I\u2019ve also seen cases where cities have had one huge parcel for every road in town.", "The right-most image is simply wrong. The parcels don\u2019t even touch their buildings and seem to be improperly rotated.", "I built procedures to identify all of the above conditions and more. In some cases, we flagged them so we could fix them. In other cases, we flagged them so we could remove them. In all cases, we didn\u2019t know we needed to fix or remove anything at all until we\u2019d put the shapes on maps and understood what we were looking at.", "Shapes aren\u2019t the only problematic data in our business. Sometimes the location data itself is wrong.", "For example, look at the picture above on the left. You can see a lot of orange dots. Most of those dots \u2014 the small ones \u2014 are all clustered over the house at the top of the image. If you look closely, you can even see that the majority of those dots are over the section of the house right behind the driveway, which means that that person is much more likely to use their phone when they\u2019re getting into or of their car. It looks like there\u2019s a little activity next to the garage, which is probably the kitchen, and then a little at the other end of the house, which is probably a bedroom. All of that makes sense.", "Now look at the bottom of the image. You can see two big dots, practically on top of one another, in a neighbor\u2019s front yard. Those look a little strange, given the context. The size of dot reflects the number of devices reported at each location over a single week: each of those dots at the top were reported from a single device, while those two dots on the right were reported by several hundred devices each. That\u2019s just weird.", "I call the image on the right a crop circle. I have no idea what it is. Each square is a section of land roughly the side of two football fields placed side by side, but I\u2019m only showing the squares because you can\u2019t see both the nature and the scope of the problem at the same time. Each square itself contains a perfect grid, with each grid point only a few yards from another. So each square contains a few hundred grid points. The blue squares contain a complete grid. Yellow squares along the edge contain only partial grids. In other words, there\u2019s a huge grid.", "Every grid point comes from supposedly organic mobile location data. That data forms a perfect grid, with grid points spaced only meters apart, which spreads across a perfect circle around 2.5 miles in diameter. And as far as I can tell, there are only six of these in the United States. Most of them occur near city centers \u2014 there\u2019s one right in the middle of Birmingham, Alabama \u2014 but the one pictured above is in an empty field in Oregon.", "Everyone knows mobile location data can\u2019t be taken at face value. We needed to actually look at mobile locations over many, many different contexts to figure out what signals we could trust and which ones we couldn\u2019t.", "Sometimes we need to check the data after an analysis rather than before. The left image above shows the changes that happened when we redesigned one of our algorithms for assigning IP addresses to physical locations. Blue indicated places where the redesign resulted in more IP addresses being assigned. Red showed places where the number of assigned IPs decreased.", "The image on the right shows a similar post-analysis sanity check. We were working on identifying stores that sold similar products or services. The width of the black curved lines shows how similar we think certain stores are. That allowed us to then look at the store names and see if we\u2019d gotten the similarity score right.", "I don\u2019t just use visualization to figure out what data or results I\u2019m dealing with. I often use it to iterate over different design options for algorithms I\u2019m building.", "The above images show some parcel data. The image on the left shows the data as it existed when we received it from a county assessor. The white lines show the dividing lines between various parcels. It\u2019s pretty clear that those diagonal lines don\u2019t demarcate really weird apartments. Looking at the mailing addresses assigned to that building, we think the county assessor was trying to figure out how to explain that the building had three apartment plans, but four floors. It\u2019s a little problematic for us to not be able to tell what floor a mobile signal was on, but it would be really problematic to assign it to one apartment if it showed up in someone\u2019s living room and another apartment if it showed up in their bedroom.", "So I wrote a procedure to start with one parcel and crawl to adjacent parcels, at each stage to check for different metrics \u2014 for example, to see how square the total crawled space was. There was no right answer here \u2014 in some cases, it was difficult to tell exactly what the right combination was, even when looking straight at it. I even used visualization to try out different metrics:", "Given that I nearly always deal with problems in which there is no obtainable ground truth against which I can validate a model, I rarely develop an algorithm without also developing a way to visualize the results from that algorithm. Here\u2019s another example:", "The red dot is the location for a business. We didn\u2019t have a building footprint for that store (and many others like it). So we looked at mobile devices that came near the store and figured out where else they went nearby. We were able to use that to score patches of land with the probability that someone who showed up on a given patch would show up nearer to the store centroid. We were able to use that cloud of probabilities to construct a building footprint that not only captured the store but also captured the dedicated parking right outside the store\u2019s front door.", "All of the above examples are really just different flavors of a single, simple purpose: I need to put shapes on maps in a way that I can see context. That is purpose I needed a tool to facilitate. A good design shouldn\u2019t distract me from the things that could prevent me from accomplishing my purpose, and it should minimize the mental effort I spend on everything else. I\u2019ll come back to that point.", "Design is an interesting thing. A lot of good design principles apply to anything you\u2019re designing, whether that thing is software, a machine, or a building:", "Vitrivius was a Roman designer who wrote \u201cTen Books on Architecture\u201d, often referred to now simply as \u201cOn Architecture\u201d. In that work, Vitruvius three qualities of a good design:", "The first two are pretty self-explanatory \u2014 especially the first. A good design should be useful in the sense that it first a foremost accomplishes a purpose. I have often seen data scientists, particularly junior ones, design complicated workflows and processes to accommodate a particular method they want to use, without first confirming that that method accomplishes the purpose of analysis better than (often simpler) alternatives. I\u2019ve done this myself more times than I like to admit.", "Whether you\u2019re building a building or a piece of software, you want it to be \u201cfirm\u201d in the sense that it shouldn\u2019t break easily. In practice, this quality can be remarkably hard to achieve. In my own experience, I often find that I write code to fit a certain kind of input under certain conditions and provide a certain kind of output. Then the input changes or I require different outputs or the underlying conditions change and everything breaks. I redesigned my visualization code into Theto because I was tired of keeping multiple versions of essentially the same process, or searching for old version of code whenever an old requirement resurfaced. The code I wrote before wasn\u2019t firm. Theto still has a ways to go, but it\u2019s much more firm.", "The last quality \u2014 delight \u2014 is the least intuitive but, in my opinion, is the most important. In designing a building, the concept is more intuitive: the building should do more than just keep the rain out. It should look good. But that raises the question of what it means for an algorithm or a piece of software to \u201clook good\u201d?", "Frederick Brooks is probably best known for writing \u201cThe Mythical Man-Month\u201d and overseeing the design of IBM\u2019s System/360 family of computers, which was the first system to enable lowercase letter representation. Brooks has written a lot about design. He argues that Vitruvius\u2019s concept of delight is a matter of \u201clogical beauty.\u201d A design is logically beautiful if it reduces mental effort \u2014 it makes it easy to pay attention to the things that require our attention, and easy to ignore, or even remain completely unaware of, those things that do not require our attention. Books divides the notion of logical beauty into three parts:", "So, let\u2019s go back to what, as a data scientist, I\u2019m really trying to accomplish. My goal: explore shapes on maps to understand context. Not my goal: get shapes, get maps, put shapes on maps. None of those things are proper to my task, even though they obviously need to happen in order for me to accomplish my task. In fact, as I thought about it more, I discovered a huge number of tasks that were essential but not proper:", "A good design should minimize the mental effort I spend on any of the above tasks. They should happen as efficiently as possible, with as little work on my part as possible. That\u2019s the principle of propriety.", "So now we arrive at the principle of orthogonality. If I want to minimize the attention I spend on any of those above tasks, I need to organize them in a way that minimizes dependencies. I need to separate the tasks enough that if one thing breaks or fails to anticipate a need it doesn\u2019t derail all the other parts of the tool. There are a lot of ways to break up these tasks. This is what I chose:", "These are my points of interaction with the design: instead of needing to make decisions about all of those essential-but-not-proper tasks, I only need to make the above six decisions. That\u2019s less effort.", "And my last goal is to make each of those six tasks as separate as possible. That\u2019s where it\u2019s much easier to show instead of tell.", "Nearly all of the images in the post above were created using Theto, but here I\u2019ll walk through all of the major capabilities. Theto is built on top of the Bokeh library, which has certain amounts of built-in interactivity such as the ability to pan and zoom a plot. Other parts of Theto offer more advanced interactivity. Medium doesn\u2019t offer any straightforward way to embed Javascript, so if you want to see the interactive portions scroll down to the bottom of the post and click on the link for the notebook.", "Theto can automatically handle the following types of inputs:", "Bokeh has the ability to render glyphs (where the boundaries of the shape map to actual map coordinates, so if you zoom the image the shape will enlarge as well) and markers (dots or other shapes that map to a single point on the map and stay the same no matter how you zoom). Theto will take any of the above inputs and format them to be render-able as either a glyph or a marker \u2014 whichever you want.", "Theto also automates the appending of metadata. You can load all of the data you want as a Pandas dataframe and specify the column that contains the shapes, or you can load your shapes as a list of values, and then append metadata by including them as keyword arguments in the add_source method. You can load as many sources as you want, and render individual sources in multiple ways.", "Theto offers multiple ways to assign color to shape borders, shape surfaces, or both at once:", "If you pass a single color name or hex color code to the add_layer method, all the shapes will be that color. Or pass a list of values to assign to each shape individually. If you pass the name of a column in your data source and that column contains string values, Theto will automatically assign colors from a categorical color palette. (You can specify which palette when you instantiate Theto, but it also comes with a default). If the column contains numeric values, Theto will create a color gradient (including a gradient with middle-point color for columns that have both positive and negative values). All the color mapping takes place behind the scenes.", "Theto also offers several map types:", "Just use the appropriate keyword to get the map type you want. Also, if you feed a Google API key in when you instantiate a Theto instance, you can use any of the Google Maps map types (\u201csatellite\u201d, \u201croadmap\u201d, \u201cterrain\u201d, or \u201chybrid\u201d). Just be careful: Bokeh stores the API key in the Javascript object used to render the plot, so anyone looking at the source code of the page where you render the plot would be able to see your API key.", "Theto also has an add_path method that lets you add lines (curved or straight) between shapes. It can handle one-to-one relationships to show travel from one location to another, or many-to-many relationships to show other kinds of connections.", "As I mentioned before, Theto gets some interactivity out of the box just by virtue of being built on top of Bokeh. Other than panning and zooming, you can also feed a label into a legend keyword argument in the add_layer method, and this will create a legend where clicking on the label will toggle the relevant layer on and off.", "Additionally, there is an add_widget method that allows for more complex interactions to dynamically filter what shapes are displayed on the maps:", "If you just want to get started with it:", "You can see a demonstration of all of Theto\u2019s capabilities here:", "And you can look at the code, file issues, and create pull requests here:", "Co-founder @ aampe.co.
