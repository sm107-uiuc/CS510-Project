His initial purpose was to get comments and feedback about Linux from other people.", "People started contributing to and getting involved with Linux. The contributions were not only in the form of code but also ideas and comments. The community working together on Linux made it an open source project.", "Being an open source project has tremendously improved Linux and thus it has gained popularity among developers, programmers and companies. Linux is now in millions of computers and powering billions of devices.", "The best way to learn and operate Linux is through the terminal. Thus, it is imperative to learn the commands to become an agile Linux user. Furthermore, the commands are the building blocks of bash scripting which is the next step to become an advanced user.", "In this article, we will learn about 10 basic Linux commands.", "The ls command lists the files inside a folder. I\u2019m currently in the phase folder and can just type ls in the terminal to view the files.", "You can also view the files from the outside of the folder by providing the file path.", "The cd command stands for \u201cchange directory\u201d so it changes the directory we are working. We need to provide the path of the new directory.", "The following command will take me to the phase folder.", "Since the cd command takes me inside the phase folder, I can just type ls to view the files in the folder.", "The \u201ccd ..\u201d command will take us to the parent folder. Thus, the \u201ccd ..\u201d in the phase folder will take me to the projects folder.", "The touch command is used to create an empty file.", "We are in the phase folder now. Let us create a new text file and then run the ls command to see the file list.", "The pwd command prints the path to the folder we are currently working in.", "The mkdir command can create a folder or multiple folders.", "We are in the phase folder now, let\u2019s first go to the parent folder (projects) by using the cd command.", "We are in the projects folder now. Let us create two new folders.", "We can create nested folders by using the \u201c-p\u201d option of the mkdir command.", "If we run the ls command now, we can see the new files we have just created.", "We have created the phase3 folder with another folder in it.", "The rmdir command can be used to delete folders. Let\u2019s delete the folders we have just created.", "We are in the projects folder now. Here is the current list of folders inside the projects folder.", "The following command will delete the phase1 and phase2 folders.", "The rmdir can delete empty folders. Since there is another folder inside phase3, we cannot use just rmdir to delete it.", "If there is another file or folder inside, we can use the rm command with \u201c-rf\u201d option.", "The rm command can delete files and folders whereas the rmdir command can only delete folders.", "The mv command can be used to move or rename files.", "Let\u2019s first create a new folder in the projects folder.", "We can move the data folder into the phase folder as follows:", "The data folder is now inside the phase folder.", "If the second parameter indicates a new folder, the mv command moves the file in the first parameter into the folder in the second parameter. Otherwise, it will rename the file.", "For instance, we can rename the data file using the mv command:", "These commands can be used to open a file or folder (open for macOS and xdg-open for Linux).", "If you want to open the file you are currently working in, you can type \u201c.\u201d instead of the folder name.", "The echo command can be considered as print function.", "We can also use the echo command to write in a file.", "This command will append the given text to file11.txt. Let\u2019s open this file to view its content.", "We can also use the echo command to create a file. If used with \u201c>\u201d, it will create a file and adds the given content.", "The man command will bring up the manual for a command. Thus, if you want to learn about a command and its options, you can just call the man command with it.", "We have covered 10 basic commands for Linux. There are, of course, much more to learn in order to be an advanced user.", "However, these basic commands will help you get familiar with Linux. You will progressively improve your skills and knowledge by learning new commands.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
