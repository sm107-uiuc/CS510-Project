I am particularly interested if such comparisons could be used to help determine the best blends by increasing my understanding of how coffees relate to each other. Luckily, I found some data to investigate just that question.", "I have looked at two databases with coffee grades, and previously, I\u2019ve used the CQI database to investigate similarities between coffees. I\u2019m applying the same techniques here.", "I amended one of the databases from Sweet Maria\u2019s. I previously pulled their Q-scores, but they also had flavor ratings for each coffee. So I went back, and I pulled flavor ratings for all the beans. I ended up with a slightly larger database than previously at 407 coffees.", "This is the second of three articles using this dataset. The first one focused on how cupping grades and flavors relate to themselves and each other. The third article will focus on comparing Sweet Maria\u2019s cupping protocol to the SCA protocol using the CQI data base.", "Sweet Maria\u2019s has a slightly different cupping criteria than the SCA criteria summarized below. It is curious to see how sweetness, uniformity, and clean cup compare to the other data. Where these 3 metrics for the SCA scale start out perfect and points are deducted, Sweet Maria\u2019s metrics give a bit more insight into the coffee.", "In pattern recognition, a feature vector is used to compare two items, usually two signals or images. A score is computed between the vectors to determine how similar or dissimilar they are to one another.", "To compute a similarity score for two coffees, each vector of sub-metrics was compared to all the others using Root-mean-square:", "These scores were computed for all coffees vs all coffees as seen below colorized by score and sorted by country:", "However, in the breakdowns below, I adjusted each graph to be between 0% and 100%. 100% doesn\u2019t mean perfect match, and 0% isn\u2019t no match. It\u2019s relative to the data in each chart where 100% is the maximum similarity (most similar) and 0% is the minimum similarity (least similar).", "Let\u2019s start with comparing regions to each other. African beans are similar to none, not even themselves using Flavor. For cupping grades, they are very similar to themselves and Central America but not much else. There is an interesting region in cupping grades of South America, Central America, and Indonesia.", "Blends aren\u2019t similar to anything except for themselves. This is a little strange as I would expect them to be more similar to other regions simply because they are blends. Decaf though is very similar to itself and some to others. This could have something to do with how the beans are processed to make them decaf.", "We can look how the coffees were processed.", "Based on these similarity matrices, Honey Processing is more similar to Wet Processing than dry for both flavor and grade, which is odd to me. Honey processed coffee should be more similar to dry processed coffee because they both involve letting the fruit dry on the bean for some time. Dry processing is very different even from itself, and I suspect this is why African beans are so dis-similar to other beans because most of the African beans are dry processed.", "Edit: after talking to a few other coffee people, they aren\u2019t surprised honey processed is more similar to wet processed because to strip off a layer of the cherry requires a similar process to the regular wet process.", "I\u2019m not sure what is in the Other category, but I think some of decaf is included in there. Decaf has an additional processing to remove the caffeine.", "We can break down the main regions (without Decaf or Blends) with the main processing categories (without the Other category).", "Let\u2019s start with Flavor: Honey vs Honey seems to have the most homogenous similarity in flavor. Honey vs Wet for most regions is also very similar. Dry vs Dry especially for South America is an interesting row as they are very similar to themselves but not to other regions with the same processing.", "Now on to grade. Coffee grade has a similar pattern for honey vs honey, if not a stronger pattern. This is also true for honey vs wet. South American dry processed still has some interesting similarities to other dry processed beans.", "Part of what we really care about is the region vs itself for the same processing type or different processing type. I can well summarize that in the tables below which are pulled from the larger tables above.", "We can see how Dry vs Honey is very dissimilar for both grades and flavors. This is the most surprising result for me in how I assumed the tastes would compare to each other. Dry vs Others is very different across the board, but Honey vs Honey compares well for a region vs self or a region vs others.", "I think Dry vs Wet processing is the most interesting to look at because most coffees are dry or wet processed. For flavors, Dry vs Wet is lower than either Dry vs Dry or Wet vs Wet. However, for grade, Dry vs Dry has a lower similarity to itself. This can particular be seen in the Central America row.", "I used a similarity metric to compared coffees based on cupping grades and flavors. This similarity metric is one typically used in pattern recognition, and it seemed to work well here for the data available. I\u2019m hopeful that this type of analysis could be used to blend coffees better, which could in turn, influence how these coffees analyzed.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
