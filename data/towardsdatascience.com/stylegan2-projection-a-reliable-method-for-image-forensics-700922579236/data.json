Philosophers, artists, and others in all epochs have searched for the difference between truth and lie.", "In the Digital Age, we\u2019ve got severe news: the evidence is under question. The old-fashioned concept, \u201cA picture is worth a thousand words\u201d doesn\u2019t work anymore. We\u2019ve got #deepfakes, image generation, and other (audio-)visual constructive possibilities. We cannot be sure if the image we see right now represents the authentic occurrences, or if it was generated seconds before.", "And so we have to talk about Image Forensics.", "There are various ways to determine true images from fakes already:", "The most obvious (but not the most reliable) way is to train ourselves to detect fakes.", "How can you detect fake images?", "StyleGAN was an overwhelming development compared to BigGAN. Still, it had some flaws in face generation:", "<= This image shows various GAN glitches.", "With StyleGAN2 new standards were established. \u201cBubble artifacts\u201d were mostly fixed. Is it way too hard to detect fakes?", "StyleGAN2 developers added a brilliant method to detect fake: Projection.", "The method is smart. StyleGAN projects a given image to the latent space \u2014 the origins of generated images.", "It has some superficial similarities with the reverse image search (like using TinEye or Google Image Search for finding out, if the image is a stock photo):", "In some cases, it does lead not only to the original stock image provider but even to the unique person \u2014 like in the example above, the Stock Image Model Ariane (another story).", "StyleGAN2 Projection compares the image in question with latent space, where GAN images are generated and look for origins.", "In theory. In practice (and you can try it out in the Colab Notebook), it\u2019s\u2026 complicated.", "There are already amazing threads and tests with Projection, made by prominent artists and researchers like Gene Kogan, Jonathan Fly, Mario Klingelmann, Mikael Christensen, just to name some.

We are not reliable.", "There are possibilities to prevent Projection and Reverse Search, though. Therefore, developers still have to find out how not to bring our world into total chaos. (SPOILER: Too late).", "Speaking of Artificial Intelligence, I always mean ART within. You can do many innovative things you weren\u2019t able to do before (check out my Series AI & ART). There are new art methods one couldn\u2019t think out in the weirdest dream some years ago.", "With Projection we can do something we\u2019ve experienced with Google Deep Dream already. I call it ParAIdolia.", "In my definition:Pareidolia is the ability of the human brain to recognize patterns everywhere (even if they are not there). In the Stone Age, it was a crucial skill. Better we confuse a bush with a tiger another time, than if we won\u2019t recognize a tiger inside a bush.Stone Age is over, but we are still in this state of awareness, seeing Face on Mars and Jesus on Toast Bread.ParAIdolia is the ability of Neural Network (e.g., CNN) to recognize in patterns motives it\u2019s trained on. Even in white noise. That\u2019s why all those dogs in initial Deep Dream experiments.", "StyleGAN2 is rolling out, and the available Colab Notebook still provides a limited selection of models: faces, churches, horses, etc. But faces is an interesting one because we can try ParAIdolia.", "SideNote: Jonathan Fly experimented with non-faces and artworks, and StyleGAN can find more than just above.", "So if try to find out whether StyleGAN has dreamt about Ebisu Tower Ferris Wheel in Osaka:", "Fake Mario looks like an Emo:", "Tokyo becomes a pretty creepy face:", "And, finally, even decorative patterns become a funky nightmare:", "In this historical photo from the recent exhibition of the Metropolitan Museum of Art StyleGAN recognizes something extremely unsettling:", "A fascinating experiment does Jonathan Fly with Projection when he let StyleGAN look just a little bit, not till the end-result.
