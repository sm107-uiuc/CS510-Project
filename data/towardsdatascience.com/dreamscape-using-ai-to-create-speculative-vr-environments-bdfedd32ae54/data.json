Built out of research and investigation of machine learning\u2019s generative capacity within virtual spaces for architecture, urbanism, and game design.", "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more accessible and widespread in its implementation the opportunities it poses are ever-expanding. This paper explores machine learning tools such as generative adversarial networks, and their ability to speculate new dreamscapes, using data from the real world. I leverage creative AI as a generating agent to speculate cityscapes and visualize them within an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment. Leading to the creation of \u201cDreamscape\u201d, a tool for architectural investigation. Finally, I explore how the design of videogames in the future could be self-generative and their graphics user-driven.", "In 2010, the band Arcade Fire launched an interactive music video for their song We Used To Wait. Teaming up with Google they crafted a unique emotional journey through the viewer\u2019s past. The online experience starts by asking the viewer to enter their childhood address into a text box and then a music video begins to play, and the viewer is magically transported to said location. With a display of both aerial and perspectival footage, the neighborhood is brought to life using the rhythmic song as a backdrop. This emotional portal into the subjects\u2019 lives was a widely acclaimed creative use of Google\u2019s mapping technologies, giving a glimpse into the creative potential latent within the vast array of data being gathered and generated.", "With the recent advancement of remote sensing technologies, cameras and the technologies used to launch them into space have become more accessible leading to hundreds of sensors being deployed to click pictures from space. While a fleet of people, cars, and planes equipped with 360-degree view cameras help survey streets and terrane in all seven continents. An unprecedented amount of images have been obtained for google maps and street view. The street view platform has been successful in capturing the real world and has transformed it into digitized virtual space. Within a couple of clicks and the drop of a human-shaped icon, we are teleported to any part of the globe. Through this process, Google Technologies has attempted to digitize-reality. Leveraging mapping and projection technologies, our world is abstracted out into the digital sphere. Users have adapted well to this digital sphere, navigating seemly through it as if it were reality. In this paper, I will explore the creative potential latent within this data, pairing it with generative tools to explore new spaces and forms. Starting with the image distortions, we will take AI into the VR space, to help speculate on game design and architecture. Finally, through this exploration, I create a tool called Dreamscape, a methodology for visualizing speculative cityscapes within a VR environment, blends together the digitize-reality of Googles street view with latent space of StyleGAN. Before we dive into the experimentation, I will provide some basic background about meshes, projection, and style transfer. Skip ahead to methods if you have the handle on these topics.", "Google digitizes our reality is by abstracting data from captured images. They use a technique called depth map analysis and photogrammetry (the process of stitching together images of the same object from different sides) in order to generate a 3-D mesh. This 3-D mesh is then textured and has images mapped onto it making it look realistic. This is similar to techniques used by animators to create characters for games and in movies(see figure 3 below).", "As a texture map is wrapped on to the base form its visual qualities change. Without manipulating the 3-D mesh the outlook can be changed by distorting the base texture. Therein lies an opportunity to pair this technique with advancements in AI\u2019s image generating technology using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).", "The advancement in object recognition using CNN, and representation semantic information (allowing the separation of image context from style) became an integral process leading to the invention of creative AI agents. One of the earliest and most popular self-generative image tools within creative AI is Neural Style Transfer. In 2016, Leon A. Gatys wrote a paper outlining a framework for using CNN\u2019s to compute image to image style transfer. In the simplest terms, it used the style of image A (texture, color, etc) and grafted it onto image B. This has led to tools to replicate the look and feel of paintings by famous artists such as Picasso, which is popular among style transfer experiments. Archived by training AI to recognize the pattern and texture of image A while hybridizing it on to objects and features recognized within image B. For instance, in the example below, the middle set of images depicts a style transfer process on an image of a cat. The images labeled as output show how texture and tone from the style image have transferred onto the structure of the content image. The result is a blend, in which the silhouette of the cat is visible, while color, tones, and textures are dramatically varied.", "Building on processes found in style transfer and principles of texture mapping described above, an experiment in figure 5 attempts to distort the 3D form by manipulating the base image. By running a style transfer on the base texture image and mapping it back on to the bust. The resultant meshes show a loss in features and resolution compared to the original bust, while new details and creases are created. Early in my process for Dreamscape, I attempt to build on this rudimentary test, to explore how style transfer can be used to distort data from google street view.", "Fictional worlds and landscapes act as a backdrop for architectural speculation and gameplay. Well designed worlds in some cases are overlooked, often taking the back seat to host and create the immersive environment for other actions and interactions. In some instances, they are designed so well that they look and feel like our own environment, becoming the spatial vehicle for seamlessly integrating virtual and real through the users\u2019 actions. As vast amounts of data are gathered and exported into the public domain we explore its potential; going from the two-dimensional image planes, expanding to fourth-dimensional simulations using AI.", "Wait, did he say fourth-dimension? Is that even a thing?", "\u2014 Fourth-dimension in this experiment refers to aspects of time, space, growth and/or movement.", "Within the past few years, the rapid advancement in AI research has led to the emergence of new platforms giving access to user-friendly machine learning tools. Platforms such as Google Colab and prepacked software solutions like RunwayML have made the ability to explore creative aspects of AI far simpler. In this investigation, I explore four methodologies showcasing the potentials of creative AI:", "(1) StyleGAN to Explore Image Generation;", "(2) Dreamscape Generator \u2014 AI test in VR", "(3) Latent Space Exploration in VR", "(4)Workflow for 3-D Data Extraction from visualizations.", "In this section, I test out StyleGAN to generate unique and fictional images of maps, landscapes, and cities. StyleGAN is a generative adversarial network that fabricates new images based on features found in images of the training", "data set. This was a methodology created by a team NVIDIA in late 2018. For instance, a StyleGAN trained on a dataset of the face from flicker will start generating new faces with similarities of features from training dataset. Yet, each result from the GAN is unique, and nonidentical to any images within the original dataset. Depending on the size of the training dataset, the GAN model can produce extremely similar and convincing results. Currently, there are numerous pre-trained models ranging from nebulas to the interior of bedrooms available in the public domain. Figure 6 (above) shows an example of running StyleGAN, form a model trained on 10,000 images of landscapes, resulting in unique, and fictional worlds. Once trained, the GAN is capable of creating imagines with varied levels of similarity within minutes(when given the required amount processing power). The grid of 35 images in figure 6, took 92 seconds to generate. Handing new capabilities to digital artists to use as a tool for exploration.", "Each output from the GAN is an image for the viewer, but for the machine, it is no more than a sequence of numbers, ranging from a negative one to one. This string of numbers can be saved out as a JSON file. If I feed the same string back through the StyleGAN model again we will get the same image. And when we edit the string and put it back into the model, we get different images. This is done by accessing information saved within the latent space of the trained GAN model (I explain latent space further below). So, if this string of numbers making up our image incrementally edited in small steps and fed back into the system, the resultant image will be similar to the original output, while if we dramatically change the variable string, the output would be drastically different. We can automate the tweaking of the variable string using P5, the online version of Processing, and running it within RunwayML. Incrementally changing variables will help generate images with similar features that are still unique, and when the output is sequenced together in a video format it gives us a continuous range of visuals. One image blends into another creating a seamless and beautiful transformation. This form of output is based on a process of interpolation on latent space.", "Derived from mathematics, interpolation is a type of estimation between two data points and create a mean data point between them. Within computer graphics, this has been used as a way to create filler frames between two keyframes. Often used to increase frame rate, using semi-automated processed.", "Latent by definition means hidden. Latent space the visualization of compressed data. It is the visualization of compression that takes place within the layers of the neural network, the representation of dimensional reduction as features during the learning process are extracted. I imagine this as the memory bank of the GAN, we access this through encoding and decoding. The idea of it being \u201cspace\u201d is interesting and important, as seen in the experiment above, similar items with the latent space are located closer together, and dissimilar items are located further apart. It is essential to keep in mind (dis)similarity is resultant of what the GAN has learned from the training dataset, things that might seem obvious to us might not be to the trained model.", "Getting back to the experiment, the result in figure 10 (below) shows how interpolation can help explore latent space. As the video plays, new forms emerge out of the old, gradually changing in time. The resulting architecture builds on top of itself. The scene has a sense of unity and progression, expanding out with a logical build-up. New spaces appear out from spaces, showcasing a plethora of tectonic possibilities. With changes going from day to night, bright to dark, resonant of views from a window of a moving car. The singular images are brought to life, no longer one-off; but a continuum going beyond the still into a new dimensional realm with multiple spatial possibilities. Sticking with the idea of dimension, the next test explores the prospect further by testing StyleGAN in a 3-D environment.", "Leveraging StyleGAN and latent space, the next phase of the project led to exploration in the creation of an immersive experience using available AI tools. Softwares like Unreal Engine and Unity are designed to generate and visualize space for VR. As a starting point, raw data is harnessed from Google Street View, downloading 360-degree images that will form the base for visualization. This image is manipulated through StyleGAN and is intended to be experienced inside an immersive viewer such as Oculus, HTC Vive or Google DayDream. We will use the immersive component discussed above as a way to test the hypothesis of how interpolation of latent space can be used to simulate movement.", "In order to explore the seemingly straightforward task of viewing these images in an immerse environment. Some challenges arise as we begin the experiment. Firstly, the aspect ratio of the spherical image is 2:1. While most of the pre-trained models of the ratio 1:1 (usually 512 X 512 pixels or 1024 X 1024), or 4:3 (HD ratio). This is important to note as to when one trains new models, they are built on top of the existing model. This process is known as transfer learning. It helps save time and processing power, cutting it down to a quarter compared to what training a completely fresh dataset would take. Fisheye distortion on the image is also a challenge, not so much for the user, as we understand that this is an unrolled image, but more so for the machine. The inherent logic with deep learning \u2014 pattern recognition and feature extraction \u2014 does not understand distortion. This poses a limit to the current capabilities of the toolset. Yet, through some workarounds, we can get back to the task on hand in exploring StyleGAN in VR.", "Dreamscape \u2014 A tool to navigate the digitize-reality of google street view, with a choice of different styles to morph and change the context.", "We use a technique knows as box projection, a process of breaking our a special image. In the simplest terms, imagine you(the viewer) are inside a box, if an image is projected on all the sides of the box, that is seamless and uninterrupted at the corners, we could conceive the whole space as continues. Using this box projection technique, we are able to continue and test out the hypothesis. Using this workflow, I create the prototype for Dreamscape. A tool to navigate the digitize-reality of google street view, with the ability to choose styles to morph and change the context. In the above demo, (figure 12) the viewer moves from projected reality, into a styled fiction. They move from one to another with ease. In the next experiment, we combine the first two techniques, creating a dreamscape capable of dynamic change.", "This section explores the potential of using interpolation within VR. The potential for doing this is to bring to life the immersive environment. It could be used to simulate the dimension of time and/or simulate movement. Changing the visual spaces by transforming the images that we view. A simple example of this is can be seen in the timelapse gif on the left. The growth of the plant brings to life the image that we see.", "In order to start testing out this hypothesis, we first create our box projection images. We train the styleGAN and create interpolation beginning with said images and manipulating them. With the right equipment and live rendering capabilities, we can build up a system using Unity and assign triggers such as the movement of the head, to start and pause the interpolation. A concept to be tested in future experiments. But for now, the next method below will explore capacities to extract formal data from within this dimensional space.", "4) 3-D Data Extraction from Dimensional Space.", "The exploration up till now has focused on the issues relating to backgrounds. This experiment attempts to bring the background to life and make use of the generated data. To inhabit this data and explore it within game space and architectural design the following experiment speculative on methods of extracting 3-D information from the latent space. This if and when mastered, would be a powerful tool to create vast amounts go virtual space in a short amount of time. Using tools like edge detection, segmentation, and feature recognition (described below) I form the inputs required for manipulating base 3-D geometry. I speculate on a workflow that would lead to 3-D form creation, from latent space.", "In 3-D computer vision, a depth map is an image or image channel that contains information relating to the distance of the surfaces of scene objects from a viewpoint. Depth analysis becomes a process of using AI to project into the image gathering information and create a depth map from it. It is a fundamental process for many applications including scene understanding and reconstruction. In this experiment, it helps create a hierarchy of space with a given image. Segmenting out the foreground and from the background, helps create the first step in the process.", "Segmentation is the process of recognizing the different elements within the given image. For example, detecting buildings, dogs, humans, creating an outline around them, and separating them out. It is a combination of object detection and edge analysis helping us break down the components of the image.", "Similar to segmentation, feature recognition breaks down and identifies the element within the image. In this particular case, it breaks down the identified elements further for example in case of a building separating out windows, doors, and walls to give us specific information about the form and placement of features.", "Combing these processes, we can gather data to start manipulating the base forms. Using scripting within unity, the scene visualized can be recreated in 3D space. This would be a useful tool for architectural designers, a next step after the speculative process to take the design forward.", "The above experiments help breakdown the methodology of moving from 2D images into latent space generated by AI tools, specifically StyleGAN. Going beyond the flat 2D plane helps open up new possibilities of what can be achieved using this technology. Leveraging box-mapping techniques, an immersive experience of StyleGAN, in VR is possible. It helps generate what I term dreamscape, an unseen world, born out of real-world data.", "Some restrictions do come to light from these experiments, first and the most critical one being processing power. In order to run such dreamscape in realtime one would require an immense amount of processing power, but this will get more feasible as technology advances. Resolution and clarity of the output would be the second hurdle, but this too is linked to the question of processing power and processing of pre-trained data. This brings us to the third issue of curation, a much easier problem to solve, curation in this context relates to the number of styles we have access too. It is possible to create new styles and train a GAN given that you have upwards of 10,000 images. This is possible but requires processing time and vast amounts of curated training data. That being said, the possible implementation of this technology is wide-ranging. They go from new creative forms of storytelling to architectural speculation as well as gameplay graphics are just the beginning. In the next section, I conclude by talking about these possibilities while reflecting on current trends and examples that are already using similar technologies.", "In 2016, a team of programs created a game called No Man\u2019s Sky, a procedurally generated game born out of 600,000 lines of code fabricating planets, universes, and galaxies. The players are dropped onto one of those planets with 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 other unique planets to explore. The player\u2019s only purpose in the game to explore those plants.", "Wherever the players are, they are always at the center, even with some eighteen quintillion planets; the game renders only the player\u2019s immediate surroundings, hence nothing exists unless there is a human to witness it. No Man\u2019s Sky is powerful in that it is not only a generative AI, but it highlights the importance of the user/observer/viewer.", "AI is a tool with the potential to revolutionize the process for design and art in our lifetime, however, it can also just be used as an agent to help us speculate and create. Dreamscape is a tool to empower users handing them the capability to control graphics based on the individual\u2019s preference \u2014 enhancing the experience within games, and other digitized-realities. In the last part of the paper, I explore the implications of dreamscapes as an agent for game designers and architects.", "\u201cAI is a tool with the potential to revolutionize the process for design and art in our lifetime, however, it can also just be used as an agent to help us speculate and create.\u201d", "The applications of AI in game design are plentiful, ranging from machine-generated worlds to new story experiences visualized through avant-garde render mods. Using deep learning within computer vision to graft movement data from physical onto virtual models is well studied. While explorations with GAN\u2019s have let to the development of game characters using transfer learning(for example, GAN generated anime figures). Now new territory within deep learning is shown the potential of style transfer on the complete game environment. The example of which is seen within Chintan Trivedi\u2019s demo for its use for Fortnite into PUBG. Building the potential for games to offer different graphic packages for users to choose from and giving the ability for customization by the users themselves.", "Another possibility for AI is as a means to generate new seemingly familiar backdrops from the real world. If we switch the input with the output within the first experiment of Dreamscape, we could start turning backgrounds within games into a setting/location known to the user. For example, imagine playing a game like GTA \u2014 instead of experiencing Los Santos, you experience Dallas, Miami, or New York. Bring interpolation of latent space into the mix has its own set of possibilities. They could be an integral tool in the creation of ever-changing backgrounds leading to possibilities of self-generative games that go on endlessly. Backgrounds within games might become dynamic \u2014 changing, learning, and evolving based on the behavior and character of the user playing it. Within VR interpolation provides possibilities for simulating a sense of growth and maybe even elements of time and movement. These examples point towards a reassessment of render mods within videogames, we could be moving away from traditional means into a world where AI is the rendering agent, conjuring up live renders depending on the users\u2019 wants and moods.", "Within architecture and urbanism, the use of GANs opens up new methodologies for speculation and practice. They are turning into creative agents and assistants for design. Using pre-trained GAN models one has the ability to render out hundreds of options with a specific style and typology quickly. And through interpolation on latent space one can develop and explore those schemes further. This does not have to be limited to cityscapes, or facades. For example, figure 22 (shown below) depicts a visualization of a GAN transforming an existing floor plans. The machine runs through various possibilities, while the designer is left to curates inputs and chooses the ones that are the most successful iterations.", "Other architectural opportunities of AI were eluded to using Dreamscape earlier in the paper. The primary application for Dreamscape, when conceived of (as the name suggests), was to help people dream up possibilities for new realities. Its purpose is to help imagine and speculate beyond there current world and condition. Dreaming or imagination is the first step towards change. To dream and visualize change is a luxury that most people don\u2019t have, but once they can imagine it, it enters into the realm of possibility. Dreamscape is a tool to empower people, communities, and designers to speculate new possibilities, to visualize change outside the existing context, in the hope to conjure up different futures. And with the advent of VR + ML, architects, as well as people, will be able to engage within fully immersive design visualizations, that would be generated rapidly and brought to fruition. They will be able to feed inputs corresponding to typology and styles while being able to visualize the results at one to one scale within VR environments.", "This investigation has led me to further explore AI\u2019s capacity to create new worlds. We have just scratched the surface within the realm of possibilities of creative AI. The inquiries of using interpolation as a tool to explore latent space seem promising.
