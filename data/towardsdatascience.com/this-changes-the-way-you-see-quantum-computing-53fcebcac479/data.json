(Here\u2019s more on the qubit state). Once you observe it, there are distinct probabilities of measuring 0 or 1. In physics, this is known as the observer effect. It says the mere observation of a phenomenon inevitably changes that phenomenon itself. For instance, if you're measuring the temperature in your room, you're taking away a little bit of the energy to heat up the mercury in the thermometer. This loss of energy cools down the rest of your room. In the world we experience, the effects of observation are often negligible.", "But in the sub-atomic world of quantum mechanics, these effects matter. They matter a lot. The mere observation of a quantum bit changes its state from a superposition of the states |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9 to either one value. Thus, even the observation is a manipulation of the system we need to consider when developing a quantum circuit.", "Here\u2019s the code of a simple quantum circuit.", "When you run the code, you\u2019ll see the following output.", "Our circuit consists of a single one qubit (line 6). It has the initial state [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] (line 9) that we initialize our quantum circuit with (line 12).", "Here are the Dirac and the vector notation of this state:", "We add a simulation backend (line 15), execute the circuit and obtain the result (line 18). The result object provides the get_counts function that provides the probabilities for the resulting (observed) state our qubit.", "Let\u2019s have a look at our circuit. The QuantumCircuit provides the draw function that renders an image of the circuit diagram. Provide output=text as named parameter to get an ASCII art version of the image.", "This drawing shows the inputs on the left, outputs on the right, and operations in between.", "What we see here is our single qubit (q) and its initialization values (1/sqrt(2)=0.707). These values are both, the input and the output of our circuit. When we execute this circuit, our result-function evaluates the quantum bit in the superposition state of |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9. Thus, we have a 50:50 chance to catch our qubit in either one state.", "Let\u2019s see what happens if we observe our qubit as part of the circuit.", "We get a 100% probability of the resulting state 1. That can't be true. Let's rerun the code... (I know, doing the same things and expecting different results is a sign of insanity)", "No matter how often you run this code, you\u2019ll always get a 100% probability of either 0 or 1. In fact, if you reran the code many, many times and counted the results, you'd see a 50:50 distribution.", "Sounds suspicious? Yes, you\u2019re right. Let\u2019s have a look at our circuit.", "Our circuit now contains a measurement. That is an observation. It pulls our qubit out of a superposition state and lets it collapse into either 0 or 1. When we obtain the result afterward, there's nothing quantumic anymore. It is a distinct value. And this is the output (to the right) of the circuit.", "Whether we observe a 0 or a 1 is now part of our quantum circuit.", "The small number at the bottom measurement line does not depict a qubit\u2019s value. It is the measurement\u2019s index. It starts counting at 0. The next measurements will have the numbers 1, 2, etc.", "Sometimes, we refer to measurement as collapsing the state of the qubit. This notion emphasizes the effect a measurement has. Unlike classical programming, where you can inspect, print, and show values of your bits as often as you like, in quantum programming, it has an effect on your results.", "If we constantly measured our qubit to keep track of its value, we would keep it in a well-defined state, either 0 or 1. Such a qubit wouldn't be different from a classical bit. Our computation could be easily replaced by a classical computation. In quantum computation, we must allow the qubits to explore more complex states. Measurements are therefore only used when we need to extract an output. This means that we often place all measurements at the end of our quantum circuit.", "But how can a measurement change the state? In mathematical terms, measuring is an operation. (Here\u2019s more on qubit operations)", "In quantum circuits, we call the manipulating operators \u201cgates\u201d. Single-qubit gates are linear operators that transform a single qubit into another (possibly the same) qubit. Gates are the operations that change a qubit between these states.", "When we measure a qubit, it will collapse to either 0 or 1. Let's have a closer look at the observation in mathematical terms.", "As the name suggests, quantum state vectors are vectors. And how can we change vectors? Right, by multiplication.", "We know the state |0\u27e9 says our qubit will result in the value 0 when observed. And |1\u27e9 says our qubit will result in the value 1 when observed. And we know that", "The measures of quantum states are probabilities. The probability is a single number, called a scalar. There are different ways to multiply vectors. But one specific way of vector multiplication produces a scalar. This is called the inner product. And it results from multiplying a column vector |0\u27e9 with a row vector \u27e80|.", "The inner product is defined as:", "In the previous post, we introduced the Dirac notation and its \u201cket\u201d-construct (/k\u025bt/) (|0\u27e9) that denotes a vector. Now, we introduce the \u201cbra\u201d-construct (/br\u0251\u02d0/) (\u27e80|). The bra is a row vector.", "So, what\u2019s the probability of measuring 1 from the state |0\u27e9? Let's build the inner product to find out:", "And what\u2019s the probability of measuring 0?", "Great! Even though this is quite mathematical, it illustrates how we can obtain a value from our quantum state. By multiplying our state vector with a row vector.", "In this post, we explored the quantum observer effect. We learned how a system in a quantum superposition changes by the mere act of measurement. While the observer effect exists in the world we experience, too, it is often negligible and we do not need to care.", "But in the sub-atomic world of quantum mechanics, it matters a lot. And it matters in quantum computing. If you measured your qubit over and over again in your quantum circuit, you would keep it in a controlled state of either 0 or 1.", "To make use of the possibilities a quantum computer offers, you must allow your qubits to stay in the state of superposition until the end of your computation. You must not observe your qubit all the time", "\u2026 even though it\u2019s quite interesting what this little thing does\u2026", "This post is part of the book: Hands-On Quantum Machine Learning With Python.", "Get the first three chapters for free here.", "Your home for data science.
