Simply put Quicksight is a fully managed data visualization solution. Its competitors are Tableau, Looker, Domo, qLik, SiSense, and Microsoft Power BI to name a few. You write very little code, mostly use a GUI with drag and drop, and do not have to manage any servers, security, backups, etc\u2026.", "It offers a simple user dashboard that provides you the capability to create a variety of different visualizations, edit data on the fly, bring in data from a variety of different sources (mySQL, postgres, csv/xls/.json, presto, spark, etc\u2026) in addition you can use prebuilt 3rd party connectors (Salesforce, github, Twitter, Jira, Snowflake, and more), has out of the box compliance (HIPAA and HITRUST), and can be easily (???) embedded in other applications.", "Because I work within healthcare, AWS quicksight is a no brainer to try because it is compliant with HIPAA & HITECH, and is highly scalable.", "In the following post I am going to walk through (high level) how to connect a demo AWS Quicksight dashboard into a Wordpress instance.", "This will leave you with a solid MVP. You should have some familiarity with Wordpress (PHP, HTML), AWS (IAM policies), SSH (navigating around the terminal) to follow the steps.", "The tools that you will be utilizing include", "IMPORTANT : To fully complete this tutorial you will need to have an enterprise version of Quicksight enabled. AWS only allows the embedding of the dashboards within the Enterprise edition. The cost for enterprise with one creator will be $18.00 bucks per month. So if you can splurge a bit on this tutorial, do it\u2026otherwise I recommend you still follow along as I am hopefully AWS Quicksight will release this feature soon enough to their standard plan.", "For getting an instance of Wordpress up and running quickly without much hassle, I recommend AWS Lightsail (if you are already utilizing other AWS services). It\u2019s very simple setup. For example, with Lightsail you do not need to configure ports like :80 or :443 like you would a EC2 instance for the site to be viewable to external viewers on the internet, and it simplifies the process for domain name management and VPCs/additional networking needs.", "For our purposes, a linux platform with the Wordpress 5.3.2\u20133 blueprint will fit our needs. FYI / The flavor of Wordpress that AWS offers is a Bitnami image.", "If you are having trouble with this step, watch the video instructions here/", "After you create the image, you will want to SSH into the platform to install a couple tools. AWS makes this very simple, just HIT THE BIG BUTTON that says \u2018Connect using SSH\u2019", "This will then open up a terminal in your web browser that we will use to install a few programs:", "Tool 1: AWS CLI 2.0 : this is the command line tool AWS provides us to utilize their services via a terminal. You should be able to install it with two commands:", "You should now have AWS CLI setup. You can confirm that it has successfully installed by performing", "Tool 2: JQ (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is a command line tool that will help us parse JSON responses from AWS CLI within the terminal. Pretty cool! Installation of this program is as simple as performing:", "BONUS POINTS: To make this exercise more realistic I recommend you map a domain to your new Wordpress instance. So instead of navigating to 37.125.157.64 , you and potential users can navigate to something that is human readable like ilikedatastuff.com, or create a new sub-domain for a domain you already own (wordpress.ilikedatastuff.com).", "In addition, also enable SSL. Follow this tutorial if you are interested in free SSL for a Bitnami powered Wordpress site on AWS Lightsail.", "Lastly, you may have noticed there is the annoying Powered by Bitnami banner at the bottom right hand side of the site. To remove the banner SSH back into the server that is running Wordpress and execute the following commands:", "Tool 3: Insert PHP Code Snippet", "Now the last piece of tooling we will need to install on the Wordpress server is on the front end. Login to the admin portal of your Wordpress site (www.domainname.com/admin) with the credentials:", "password: the password is located in a file called bitnami_credentials on your Wordpress server. You can SSH into the folder server and do nano bitnami_credential to open it up using the nano text editing tool.", "If you are having trouble with this step, watch the video instructions here/", "Now go to the Plugin section of the admin portal, and search for the Insert PHP Code Snippet plugin. By installing this plugin we will be able to write a little bit of custom PHP code to automate the viewing of our dashboards into Wordpress.", "When you go install AWS quicksight, the first thing you will want to do is click on the top right hand side where the person avatar is and navigate to Manage Quicksight", "After enabling the Enterprise version you should see something that looks like this below, with the Edition: Enterprise.", "IF YOU DO NOT SEE all of the options displayed above, that most likely means that you do not have the enterprise version of quicksight enabled and will not be able to perform dashboard embedding until it is enabled.", "Now navigate to the Domains and Embedding section first.", "Here, we will whitelist the name of your domain by entering the domain name that you selected with both www.DOMAINNAME.com as well as DOMAINNAME.com without the www.", "This will ensure that once we embed our dashboards into our site, that they will have the proper secure permissions to display.

If you are using a subdomain, be sure to CLICK/ENABLE the checkmark box by Include Sub-domains? question.", "Luckily Quicksight already comes with a bunch of dummy data.", "When you are on the home screen under All Analyses you will see four sets of dummy data (dashboards) that contain a variety of different charts.", "Pick whichever one you want. To publish, once you have selected the dashboard (sample data you want to work with) go to the top right hand side there where there is a button labeled Share", "Give the dashboard a name. Under the Advanced publish option you can select the options that you wish to enable. I have selected all of them to fully test out all functionality.", "Next you will have the option to drill down into who has access to this specific set of data. Because this is a demo environment, and most likely you do not have any other users \u2014 you can leave the Share with all users in this account checked. Then click share.", "Woohoo! A big step is done. Now towards the top of your browser you have your URL bar, and now we need to copy part of the URL. For example, my link looks something like this below (i have modified the numbers slightly for security purposes):", "The part that will be relevant for us is the URL code that follows \u2026/sn/dashboards/{important-set-of-numbers}", "For me, it would be: 92301f69-e492-44fd-69cf-dfd79e6ffdc6 This part of the URL is STATIC and will be utilized by our AWS CLI tool on the Wordpress server.", "Now when an external application (node.js, python, php) tries to use this embedded URL, it also requires an additional security key to be attached to this static URL. This security key is generated via an API request to AWS which expires roughly ever 10 minutes (?) to maintain security. Why do I mention this?", "Because having this URL is NOT ENOUGH to get the dashboard embedding to work. You cannot just embed this URL into an iFrame and expect it to work \u2014 it will not because it is missing the security key.", "So to make this happen we have to create a few lines of custom PHP code that will allow our Wordpress site to call the AWS Quicksigh API and provide it with some user detail, and then receive the response that will contain our security key to display the Quicksight dashboard. If this doesn\u2019t make sense yet, that is ok. There is some documentation on AWS that walks through this.", "Log into the AWS management console and navigate to IAM and then Policies.", "We will want to create a new policy that we can attach to our existing account, (or another account) that grants permissions to 1) get a registered Quicksight user and 2) the embedded dashboard URL. For those following along, this is described in Part 2 of the AWS documentation.", "When you read their documentation you will see something like this:", "For the most part, we will be able to copy and paste this all into our new policy with the following exceptions. The parts we will want to change are bolded below:", "My dashboard is located in us-east-1 for instance, and my account number is found under users in AWS quicksight. The static URL should be replaced with your own that you previously saved .", "Once you have modified the policy save it. You should then assign this policy to the a user account that you have already created, or create a new user and then assign this policy to them. Be sure that you have that users access key ID (a 20 character key that looks something like AKIZX\u2026.LEUUG1) along with a secret access key (a 40 character key that looks something like XLUz\u2026.reQjnlAg3FY\u2026.NdDsHF).", "Login as admin to your Wordpress site and navigate to our PHP plugin that we installed in Part 1.", "You should see a menu that looks something like this:", "As you can see I have already created 2 short-codes that contain some PHP that are named dashboard1 and dashboard2.", "Click on the button Add New PHP Code Snippet and insert in the following block of code. I have bolded the sections that you will be inserting in your own data:", "First it creates three variables that contain the region, key, and secret for our AWS account (lines 2\u20134). It then utilizes putenv to store these as environmental variables (lines 5\u20137). Next we create a variable called cmd2 that will store a terminal command that utilizes our AWS CLI tool to request a new security key be generated along with our embedded URL (lines 8\u201310), and parses the JSON response returned with jq to extract our our new embedded url and security key. Then it runs the terminal command with shell_exec and saves the output in a variable called exec2 (line 11), makes that variable a string (line 12), adds double quotes to it (line 13), and finally removes any white space (line 14). The last line echo $regions then prints out our final, clean URL with the security code that can now be ingested by an iFrame.", "Now for the bolded sections. Let\u2019s fill in those variables. Below are some examples of fake data that contain the right structure and character count:", "So the final version should look something like this:", "Click save and give it some memorable name like I have, dashboard1 for example.

View it in HTML mode and insert in the following code, replacing the bold piece with your own PHP snippet name:", "What is happening here? We have utilized some of the code provided to us by the Official AWS documentation for embedding via HTML. You can see that it calls a javascript helper package created by AWS for Quicksight (https://unpkg.com/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk@1.0.2/dist/quicksight-embedding-js-sdk.min.js), and then half way down ingests a variable URL which is provided by our PHP plugin widget.", "Step 3: Click save and exit out of preview mode.
