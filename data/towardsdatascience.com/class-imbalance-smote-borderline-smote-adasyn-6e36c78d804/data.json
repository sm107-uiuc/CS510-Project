He was dealing with mammography images and his task was to build a classifier that will take a pixel as an input and will classify it as a normal pixel or a cancerous pixel. He was quite happy when he achieved 97% classification accuracy. His happiness was shortlived when he saw 97.6% of pixels were normal.", "You may be thinking, what\u2019s the problem? There are two issues", "So, why this problem is manifested it\u2019s because there is a great disparity between the frequency or count of the classes. We call such a dataset to exhibit class imbalance. The normal class is referred to as the majority class and the rare class is called the minority class.", "Does this exist in real-life applications? Take the example of spam detection, fake news detection, fraud detection, suspicious activity detection, intrusion detection, etc, where the class imbalance problem is manifested.", "The basic approaches are called resampling techniques. There are two basic approaches.", "We pick random samples from the majority class and make it equal to the minority class count. This is called the undersampling or downsampling of the majority class.", "Issue: It\u2019s not a good idea to ignore or let go so much of original data.", "Here, sampling with replacement is applied to the minority class to create as many observations as there are in the majority class and the two classes are balanced. This is called oversampling or upsampling the minority class.", "Issue: Repetition of the same minority class data leads to overfitting.", "The full form of SMOTE, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. Here Synthetic observations are generated from the Minority class", "Let there be two observations (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) from the minority class. As a first step, a random number between 0 and 1 is created, let\u2019s call it r. The synthetic point will be (x1 + r*(x2 -x1), y1 + r*(y2 -y1)). It\u2019s illustrated further with the following example.", "If there are observations in the minority class which are outlying and appears in the majority class, it causes a problem for SMOTE, by creating a line bridge with the majority class.", "This algorithm starts by classifying the minority class observations. It classifies any minority observation as a noise point if all the neighbors are the majority class and such an observation is ignored while creating synthetic data (Similar to DBSCAN). Further, it classifies a few points as border points that have both majority and minority class as neighborhood and resample completely from these points (Extreme observations on which a support vector will typically pay attention to).", "Issue: End up giving more attention to these extreme observations.", "ADASYN is a more generic framework, for each of the minority observations it first finds the impurity of the neighborhood, by taking the ratio of majority observations in the neighborhood and k.", "Now, first of all, this impurity ratio is converted into a probability distribution by making the sum as 1. Then higher the ratio more synthetic points are generated for that particular point. Hence the number of synthetic observations to be created for Obs 3 is going to be double that of Obs 2. So it\u2019s not so extreme as Borderline SMOTE and the boundary between the noise point, border point, and regular minority points are much softer. ( Not a hard boundary). Thus the name adaptive.", "This is also explained in the following video tutorial, please give it a watch", "Class Imbalance is a very practical problem. Resampling-based approaches not promising, which motivated researchers to develop SMOTE, which was gradually improved by borderline SMOTE, ADASYN, etc. For learning about more of the variants reference 2 is a great read.", "[1] Chawla NV, Bowyer KW, Hall LO, Kegelmeyer WP.
