Training Resnet-152, a modern computer vision model, is estimated to cost around 10 Billion floating point operations, which is dwarfed by modern language models. Training GPT-3, the recent natural language model from OpenAI, is estimated to cost 300 Billion Trillion floating point operations, which costs at least $5M on commercial GPUs. Compare this to the human brain, which can recognize faces, answer questions, and drive cars with as little as a banana and a cup of coffee.", "We\u2019ve come a long way. The first computers were special-purpose machines. In 1822, British Mathematician Charles Babbage created the \u2018difference engine\u2019, which had the sole purpose of calculating polynomial functions. In 1958, Cornell professor Frank Rosenblatt created \u2018Mark I\u2019, a physical incarnation of a single-layer perceptron for machine vision tasks. Hardware and algorithm, in these early days, were one and the same.", "The unity of hardware and algorithm changed with the introduction of the von-Neumann architecture, a chip design consisting of a processing unit for computation, and a memory unit for storing data and program instructions. This paradigm shift made it possible to build general-purpose machines, machines that can be programmed for any desired task. The von-Neumann architecture has become the blueprint of the modern digital computer.", "But, there\u2019s a catch. Data-intensive programs require a lot of communication between the memory and compute units, slowing down the computation. This \u2018von-Neumann bottleneck\u2019 is the reason why early attempts at AI failed. Standard CPUs are simply not efficient at large matrix multiplications, the core computational operation in deep neural networks. Because of the bottleneck in the existing hardware, early neural networks were too shallow and did not perform well.", "It is one of the ironies of history that the solution to this problem came not from academia, but from the gaming industry. GPUs, developed for accelerating video games in the 1970s, parallelize data-intensive operations with thousands of compute cores. This parallelism is an efficient solution to the von-Neumann bottleneck. GPUs enabled training deeper neural networks, and have become the status-quo hardware for modern AI.", "Research in AI has then a component of sheer luck to it. Google researcher Sara Hooker calls this, fittingly, the \u2018hardware lottery\u2019: early AI researchers were simply unlucky because they were stuck with slow CPUs. Researchers who happened to be in the field at the time GPUs came around \u2018won\u2019 the hardware lottery. They could make rapid progress by training deep neural networks, powered by efficient GPU acceleration.", "The problem with hardware lottery is that, once the field as a whole has settled on a winner, it\u2019s hard to explore something new. Hardware development is slow, and requires chip manufacturers to make large upfront-investments with uncertain return. A safe bet is to simply optimize for matrix multiplication, which has become the status quo. In the long term though, this focus on one particular combination of hardware and algorithm can limit our options.", "Let\u2019s circle back to the initial question. Why is current-day AI so expensive? The answer could be that maybe we simply don\u2019t have the right hardware yet. And the existence of hardware lotteries, combined with business incentives, makes it economically hard to break out of the current status quo.", "As an example, consider Geoffrey Hinton\u2019s capsule neural network, a novel approach to computer vision. Google researchers Paul Barham and Michael Isard found that this approach works reasonably well on CPUs, but performs poorly on GPUs and TPUs. The reason? Accelerators have been optimized for the most frequent operations, such as standard matrix multiplication, but lack optimization for capsule convolutions. Their conclusion (which is also the title of their paper): ML systems are stuck in a rut.", "There is a risk that AI researchers \u2018overfit\u2019 to currently existing hardware, which will inhibit innovation in the field in the long run.", "\u201cIt is possible that the next breakthrough will require a fundamentally different way of modeling the world with a different combination of hardware, software, and algorithm.\u201d \u2014 Sara Hooker, Google Brain", "In the human brain, memory and compute are not two separate components, but instead they happen in the same place: neurons. Memory emerges from the way neurons are wired together via synapses, while computation emerges from the way neurons fire and propagate information from sensory input. Hardware and algorithm are one and the same, much like early-generation computers. This is nowhere similar to how we do current-day AI.", "Deep neural networks powered by GPUs and TPUs, even though they perform extremely well at many tasks today, might not be the way forward in the long run. Perhaps they are just a local optimum in the vast landscape of possible combinations of hardware and algorithm architectures.", "The way forward starts with the realization that algorithms are not enough. For the next generation of AI, we need to make innovations in hardware as well as algorithm. Prior to GPUs, AI research was stuck. Without a new breakthrough in hardware, it is possible that we get stuck again.", "Your home for data science.
