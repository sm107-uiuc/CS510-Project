We\u2019ll also develop an understanding of the central limit theorem in this process. The R code used for generating examples in this post is available here.", "Let\u2019s begin our journey by assuming that we have N = 10,000 students in a country who studied Physics in their l0th grade. We noted the marks they obtained, out of 100, after their final exam and the histogram (with intervals of 10) of these marks is shown in Figure 1. This histogram represents our population distribution.", "Now, we can calculate population mean (\u03bc), and standard deviation (\u03c3) using following formulas:", "where x\u1d62 represents the marks scored by i\u1d57\u02b0 student, and N is the total number of students across the country. For the population distribution shown in Figure 1, \u03bc = 71.52 and \u03c3 = 16.15. These both are descriptive statistics because they describe some features of the data in hand. Mean represents centrality of the data (center is median) and standard deviation represents how much each point differs from the mean in the average sense. A small \u03c3 means that the values in a data set are close to the mean of the data, on average, and a large \u03c3 means that the values in a data set are farther away from the mean, on average. We can see that our population distribution has a longer tail on the left compared to the right and such distributions are known as left skewed.", "It should be noted that our population distribution requires data from all students across the country. This requirement is practically very difficult to fulfill and we usually do not have access to the population distribution (and associated descriptive statistics: \u03bc and \u03c3). In such situations we resort to random sampling to infer descriptive statistics of the underlying population distribution from the descriptive statistics of the sample distribution \u2014 let\u2019s understand this!", "Random sampling means that instead of collecting data from all students, i.e. entire population, we randomly select a few representative students across the country to do our analysis. Let\u2019s assume that in our first random sampling attempt s1, we selected n\u2081= 50 representative students across the country and noted down their marks. Let\u2019s denote the descriptive statistics for s\u2081 as \u03bc\u2081 and \u03c3\u2081, and let\u2019s also denote our first random sampling event as, s\u2081: n\u2081,\u03bc\u2081,\u03c3\u2081. Following this notation and the random sampling procedure we can randomly select multiple groups of representative students from our population distribution. Remember, the population distribution includes all students across the country and a sample distribution contains only 50 randomly selected students \u2014 each sample distribution is a subset of the population distribution.", "How the descriptive statistics of our sample distributions relate to the descriptive statistics of our population distribution? The answer is given by the central limit theorem, which in simple words states that \u2013", "For independent random variables, the distribution of the means of the sample distributions tends toward a normal distribution (informally a \u201cbell curve\u201d), irrespective of the shape of the population distribution.", "Now, let\u2019s apply this theorem to our example and see what can we understand through this exercise. Random variables in our case are the marks obtained by each student and these are indeed independent random variables because the marks scored by one student are independent of the marks scored by another. Going further, let\u2019s say we obtain r = 20 random samples, each with n = 50 students, from our population distribution and these sample distributions can be written as:", "Let\u2019s now plot the means of our 20 sample distributions and see what their distribution looks like. From figure 2, it is evident that the distribution indeed looks like a bell curve irrespective of the shape of our population distribution (which is actually Beta distribution, see code for details).", "The normality of the distribution of the sample means is much stronger if we obtain (r=) 80 random samples (each of size n = 50), instead of (r=) 20, as shown in Figure 3. The mean of the 80 sample means can be computed as follows-", "It is also evident from Figure 2 and Figure 3 that the mean of the sample means moves closer to the population mean as we draw more random samples. Notice, that with only r*n = 80*50 = 4000 student scores we can get a sufficiently accurate estimate (\u03bc\u2088\u2080means = 71.66) of the population mean (\u03bc = 71.52) of N = 10,000 student scores. This means that if we have sufficient number of random samples then we actually do not need the entire population distribution for our analysis.", "Q. Should we use multiple random samples, each with a smaller number of observations, or a single random sample with larger number of observations for an actual data analysis problem?", "We just saw that using 80 random samples, each with 50 observations (student scores), we can closely approximate the mean of the underlying population distribution. However, in practice, we usually work with one random sample containing sufficiently large number (n) of data points (student scores) such that n \u226a N, here, n represents the number of students in our random sample and N represents the entire population of students across the country.", "Now onwards, we\u2019ll work with a single random sample containing n students, and let\u2019s denote the standard deviation and mean of this random sample as s and \u03bc\u2091 (e as in estimate), respectively. Figure 4 shows that the principles of the central limit theorem still hold \u2014 for n = 4000, the distribution of our random sample is bell shaped and its mean \u03bc\u2091 = 71.58, is a good estimate of the population mean (\u03bc = 71.52).", "It is important to note that both, \u03bc\u2091 and s, are themselves random variables because their values depend on the strategy used for random sampling.", "Aforementioned observations have great implications for data analysis because we usually do not have access to the entire population and thus descriptive statistics of the population distribution are usually unknown. In such situations, the central limit theorem provides us with a way to do data analysis with randomly selected data points and preciseness of such analysis can be quantified using inferential statistics including standard error of the mean and confidence intervals, which are discussed next. These statistics are inferential because we use randomly sampled distributions to infer characteristics of the underlying population distribution.", "Standard error of the mean (SEM): From central limit theorem, we know that our sample distribution is normal with mean =\u03bc\u2091. But \u03bc\u2091 itself is a random variable as it depends upon the choice of our random samples. In other words, any change in our sample distribution changes our \u03bc\u2091. Standard error of the mean simply quantifies this change by computing the standard deviation of our estimate, \u03bc\u2091, of the underlying population mean (\u03bc). Formally, it can be computed as follows:", "Taking the square root on both sides of above equation we get the desired standard error of the mean:", "Notice, that we can use a single random sample with sufficient sample size (n) to compute standard error estimate of the population mean. If we have sufficiently large n we can obtain almost zero standard error. This means that if we have a large random sample of data points then the mean of our sample distribution accurately approximates the mean of the underlying unknown population distribution. Thus, a higher n is often desired in various machine learning and statistical problems for better generalizability.", "Confidence Intervals: A confidence interval is an interval around the estimated mean (\u03bc\u2091) that is likely to include the unknown population mean (\u03bc). Let\u2019s understand this \u2014 we want to estimate the mean, \u03bc, of the underlying population distribution and we have access to a random sample containing n observations with standard deviation s and mean \u03bc\u2091. Confidence intervals are constructed at a confidence level, such as 95%, selected by the user. The confidence level describes the uncertainty associated with a sampling method. Suppose we used the same sampling method to select multiple random samples and computed confidence intervals using \u03bc\u2091 of each random sample. We\u2019ll naturally have multiple confidence intervals (one around every \u03bc\u2091). Some of these interval estimates would include the population mean, \u03bc, and some would not. A 95% confidence level means that we would expect 95% of the interval estimates would include the population mean. Usually, we work with only one random sample containing large number of data points and in such case we have only one confidence interval estimate that can be computed as follows for 95% confidence level:", "Note that the term after plus-minus sign on right hand side of above equation quantifies the uncertainty in the estimate of population mean (\u03bc) in terms of sample mean (\u03bc\u2091). 1.96 is multiplied to the standard error of the mean because for a standard normal distribution, N(0,1), 95% of the data lies within 1.96 standard deviations around the mean as shown in Figure 5.", "Sometimes, 1.96 is rounded up to 2 for calculation purposes. Lastly, higher standard error leads to wider confidence interval, which indicates that the mean, \u03bc\u2091, of our random sample is not a good approximation of the mean, \u03bc, of the underlying population distribution.", "Your home for data science.
