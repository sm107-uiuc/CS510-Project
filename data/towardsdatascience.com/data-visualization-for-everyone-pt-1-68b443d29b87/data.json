That challenge presents itself today still \u2014 with the modern shift towards data-driven corporate frameworks. In spite of the logic-oriented goal, our \u201cright-brained\u201d history has some lessons we can apply today. AEC industries rely on communication to be the most effective and successful. Whether it\u2019s the rendering of a refined interior space or the model nuancing of a complex release valve, we all rely on some form of communication to convey our ideas. And in doing so, we\u2019ve become individually particular and highly skilled at our individual branches of communication.", "Our goal is translating that knowledge and fluency into another realm of communication: data visualization. In today\u2019s practice, data is all around us. Some practices have the luxury of collecting that data and devoting time to extracting information and insights from it, but many others have to be agile and find opportunities in their day-to-day work which will enhance their processes. This article will address both sides of the equation by focusing on data collection as well as visualization, and by presenting easily accessible tools for getting started as well as more complex solutions for the tinkerers among us.", "Data Visualization is a vast field with a profound body of work behind it. Although we can\u2019t embody every lesson there is, we can do well to combine our unique industry expertise with curated parts of it to push our capacity to communicate and collaborate further.", "Before even being able to think about data visualization, first we must ensure that we have data which is meaningful enough generate value through visualization. The collection process is often the first hurdle for companies and teams trying to make \u201cdata-driven\u201d decisions. Collecting clean, systematized data requires an upfront investment in terms of time and technology before it can truly be valuable. This may seem like a daunting barrier, especially for smaller teams and organizations, but luckily there is a full spectrum of solutions available to us today, covering a wide range of time/cost investment requirements.", "Since \u201ccollection\u201d can be a very different process between organizations and industries, this article will look at collection mediums and opportunities for the AEC industry. The same concepts can be applied to other markets however, with the data source being the differentiating factor.", "If you\u2019re currently not collecting data from your work due to time restrictions and/or a lack of domain-specific knowledge, you may find value in established commercial solutions which handle data extraction and collection. These products eliminate the need for domain-specific knowledge by packaging the core logic into a digestible and usable interface. The downside is that these products and services come with a cost, which may be just as prohibitive as the initial lack of expertise in the field.", "There are a number of these products in the market currently, and this guide will only highlight several key products as examples. It is highly recommended that you continue to research the product offerings in this space, as they\u2019re very rapidly changing.", "Pros: Save Time, Does Not Require \u201cExperts\u201d to UseCons: Cost, Limited Customization", "Minecart is Proving Ground\u2019s full-service data solution. They not only extract the data from BIM models, but also prepare the template dashboards and visualizations. This is one of the most comprehensive services in the space, and therefore can be applied to any team or organization, regardless of whether or not they have data science-specific knowledge. The cost of implementation is service-based, meaning that it will vary significantly based on firm requirements, level of customization, knowledge/training needs, and many other factors. Therefore teams are encouraged to understand the scope of their needs, and reach out to the service providers for the most accurate pricing information.", "Ideate\u2019s BIMLink is one of the most popular data extraction solutions for Autodesk Revit. The tool allows the user to select properties to export and format/filter from the BIM model, and is only truly reliant on the model having valuable data already in it to be effective. Unlike Minecart, this tool is only a data-extraction application. Therefore it is worth noting that following the data export, the team will still need someone with at least some domain-specific knowledge around data management and visualization to realize the full value of that data.", "If the established commercial solutions don\u2019t meet your data needs, it may be worth exploring custom solutions. Custom solutions are ones that the team or organization builds themselves \u2014 tailoring them to the specific needs of their work, and curating their data accordingly. The downside of custom solutions is that tailoring them to specific needs is a time consuming process \u2014 both the creation and the maintenance of these tools become significant time investments once they\u2019re deployed at scale. The creation and maintenance also comes with the requirement of having knowledge \u2014 the same knowledge that commercial solutions provide the user with \u201cup-front\u201d or behind-the scenes.", "There is an infinite range of tools and platforms which could be listed in this category and used by developers to create solutions, but we\u2019ll only highlight some of the more relevant ones for our AEC industry.", "Pros: Customizable, No Subscription/Cost, ExtendableCons: Time, Requires Specific Knowledge, Maintenance", "PyRevit is an Open Source software project by Ehsan Iran-Nejad which allows users to create their scripts or even add-ins for Autodesk Revit using Python. PyRevit comes with many tools by default, but its true power is in the ability of users to prototype and build their own logic using the accessible and powerful syntax of the Python language. Using the many libraries and packages available to Python, anyone can create a data mining script, or even a full-fledged data extraction application.", "The added benefit of using this tool is that data-science has been trending to Python for a long time. Accessibility and the \u201cunopinionated\u201d nature of the language make it a natural choice for data processing, analysis, cleaning, and even visualization. Therefore, learning Python to extract data using PyRevit would only set you up for more exciting work to follow after the extraction!", "Grasshopper and Dynamo are visual programming interfaces which allow users to create business logic similar to coding/software development, without the need to write textual code. These interfaces make it easier for those without domain-specific knowledge to prototype and create logic routines, automations, and other functions.", "In addition to the flexibility they offer to creation, there are also a number of packages offered for each which can extract data from BIM Models or CAD files. With both, the user also has the option of using the visual programming interface, or creating a more human-friendly interface using basic UI components. In either case, visual programming streamlines and democratizes access to a vast array of computational resources, many of which can be useful for data extraction or processing.", "Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment which allows a developer to build .NET applications using C# (and many other applications/languages too). For our use case, we can use Visual Studio to build full-fledged plug-ins for software such as Autodesk Revit, or McNeel\u2019s Rhino which can extract our data to any format or platform we select. Unlike Python, C# is somewhat less accessible, especially if the user doesn\u2019t have any coding/development experience. Although less friendly, it does offer the significant performance boost of a compiled language, and therefore is exceedingly useful for large data sets and/or larger applications.", "In addition to creating full-fledged applications, C# and Visual Studio can be used to create nodes and components for visual programming interfaces such as Grasshopper or Dynamo. Although the language isn\u2019t terribly popular in data-science workflows, you would be getting some extra value through this approach by being able to create more accessible/digestible resources for others through visual programming interfaces.", "After data is collected/extracted, another challenge arises \u2014 the challenge of keeping everything up-to-date, or at least knowing what is out-dated and when. This challenge scales proportionally with the size of an organization or team, with individual members breaking off from established practices and standards in favor of quick \u201csolutions\u201d.", "In today\u2019s climate of rapidly growing data, a number of companies have begun to address this problem at the organizational level. Microsoft\u2019s SharePoint/OneDrive and Google\u2019s Docs offering have been slowly migrating to a full-on cloud storage system, complete with semantic versioning, tagging, and other pieces of infrastructure which systematize and organize the data we put in them. In addition to the \u201coffice\u201d solutions, database providers such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have also added similar sophistication to their database offerings, making them easier than ever to work with.", "In this climate of product innovation, we must carefully select our approach without being distracted by features and services which don\u2019t meet our specific needs. As before, we can select from a broad spectrum of solutions ranging from full-custom, to full-user-ready.", "There are many out-of-the-box solutions that can be used to store and version data. The most familiar format for doing this is file-based, with collections of files making up a complete dataset, and versions of each file representing the history of the dataset. Even with a file-based approach, there are many best-practices we can apply that take us beyond the much too familiar \u201cData_FinalFinal2.csv\u201d paradigm, and help us extract more value out of the data.", "Pros: Quick/Easy to Use, Effective & IntuitiveCons: Limited to Files, Lack of Standards/Consistency", "OneDrive and Google Drive are both cloud file-storage solutions. They also integrate well with the respective, broader ecosystem of products they find themselves in (Microsoft Office Suite/ Google\u2019s G Suite). In addition to storing our files in the cloud, they also allow us share, consume, and keep a history of our files. This is exceedingly useful, as sharing/consuming is required for the ultimate data visualization and keeping a history is useful for asking deeper questions of the dataset.", "Although both are accessible and widely used, that can also make them risky for storing data. Data requires consistency to be useful \u2014 formatting, cleaning, etc. With a file-based system, the user is ultimately the point of responsibility when it comes to make sure data conforms to the standard. Therefore if the users in the team/organization don\u2019t take on this responsibility when using this technology, the data stored may be less than useful to the final application.", "Custom database solutions are \u201cdime a dozen\u201d in the current tech market. That is great for consumers, because it means we can pick from a full spectrum of options when trying to match technology to organizational needs. As with the previous topics, this guide won\u2019t cover every possible database solution, but will highlight some key offerings that provide a good balance between the ability to customize and the ability to democratize access.", "Pros: Standardization is Built-In, Ability to Scale, Can Integrate BroadlyCons: Cost, Requires Set-Up & Maintenance", "MongoDB is a cloud-based database, and is one of the most popular offerings in the market today. Its popularity comes from its comprehensive documentation, developer-friendly syntax, and additional tools such as graphic interfaces for managing your data. The MongoDB database can accept many different types of data, and can scale in parallel with the size of your dataset. Additionally, it has interfaces with most major programming languages, frameworks, and syntaxes, making it an easy \u201cdrop-in\u201d to any custom software solution.", "Firebase is yet another cloud-based database, and offers much of the same functionality as MongoDB (discussed above). Where it differs from MongoDB and other database solutions on the market today is its real-time feature. This functionality essentially means that an app or developer doesn\u2019t have to request the whole dataset every time there\u2019s an update, and instead just maintain a live (listener) link to the database. This makes it prime for datasets which are frequently changing and require users being updated about those changes. Use cases such as tracking a building\u2019s room areas, or counting mechanical diffusers are a good example \u2014 information which changes every time a designer or engineer works on the model.", "We\u2019ve covered a lot of ground, but we still haven\u2019t gotten to the \u201cfun\u201d part. Part 2 of this article will dive into the visualization process with the strong foundation we\u2019ve set up here. Even though data collection and storage might not be the most interesting or engaging parts of the process, they\u2019re some of the most crucial because they directly correlate to the ultimate effectiveness of our data visualization, and the communication of that information. Without a consistent and reliable data source, we simply don\u2019t have the agency to ask or answer the questions we want to be able to.", "Your home for data science.
