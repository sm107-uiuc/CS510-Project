We\u2019ve seen how Netflix portrays him, but how does the Tiger King depict himself on Twitter? I set out to find out who Joe Exotic is through scraping his Twitter and learning what words he uses.", "Netflix\u2019s Tiger King has America captivated during quarantine for better or for worse. If you\u2019ve somehow managed to escape hearing about the show, the documentary highlights the underground big cat game in the US, with the charismatic Joe Exotic (a.k.a. The Tiger King) and his nemesis, Carole Baskin, as lead subjects.", "Despite being the number one trending subject during #StayAtHome, Joe is still missing that true tell-tale of a celebrity; the blue checkmark on Twitter.", "So, what does The Tiger King tweet about anyway? After all, we do know one\u2019s Twitter is a good glimpse into what they care about. I set out to more fully understand The Tiger King through analyzing his tweets.", "I started off by installing twitterscraper. Of course, Twitter has its own API, Tweepy, but it has its limitations. Namely that you can no longer scrape Tweets older than seven days. That wasn\u2019t going to fly with me, thus the use of twitterscraper.", "Ahmet Taspinar, the author of twitterscraper, has actually done an incredible job in making it easy to pull Tweets. All I had to do was provide the account I wanted.", "And the tweets started to flow in.", "I then used some simple pandas commands to extract the data into a manageable dataframe.", "Once I had the tweets, I could move on to preparing them for analysis via Natural Language Processing.", "To perform some basic natural language processing, I imported NLTK, and tokenized his tweets.", "Then I did some slight clean up eliminating any links as those aren\u2019t real words I\u2019m interested in. Although maybe it would be interesting just to look at his links? Spin off project anyone?", "Let\u2019s start by seeing what words the Tiger King uses the most. We\u2019ll use NLTK\u2019s FreqDist function to do that.", "Now that we have these organized lists, let\u2019s make a line plot showing the number of times the top 40 words were used.", "We can see that small, common words are his most used; this makes sense. I still think this gives us a lot of good insight into the Tiger King. I see he uses \u2018\u2026\u2019 quite a bit, and lots of hashtags. He uses \u2018I\u2019 a lot which may imply a self-centered narratives. The use of question marks could suggest, he\u2019s asking the public questions. His beloved state of Oklahoma is used often, as well as a hashtag, #fixthisshit to indicate his feelings about the nation.", "Everyone uses the words like, \u2018the\u2019, \u2018to\u2019 and \u2018it\u2019, so let\u2019s add some stop words to eliminate them, as well as get rid of the punctuation marks and half-constructed contractions (n\u2019t, ect) while we are at it.", "And redo the graph one more time to see some more of uniquely Joe words.", "This adds more granularity into Tiger King\u2019s heart. What was he interested in? The tweets speak for himself: \u2018people\u2019, \u2018vote\u2019, \u2018Governor\u2019, and \u2018money\u2019.", "My next step was to make a word cloud. These are quite common, yet fun and decently informative to at least show what words the Tiger King uses to the most.", "Python has some great tools available to build word clouds. I really like datacamp\u2019s tutorial that utilizes the WordCloud library to generate them.", "It\u2019s able to do most the hard work for you\u2026.", "Bam! We see similar terms being used often, but in a more cute, artsy way.", "How would Joe look if the words he used the most, painted a picture of him? The Data Camp tutorial shows you how to shape the word clouds into shapes and images. So let\u2019s try it! I did a quick Google search for Joe Exotic and found this awesome pic.", "I then loaded the image into python, and turned the image into a Numpy array.", "Then using the ImageColorGenerator function from the WordCloud library, I created this word cloud based off of the colors in the photo.", "This does appear to mirror the colors from the picture and looks more interesting than the simple white word cloud, but still not sure it\u2019s the end portrait I\u2019m looking for.", "WordArt.com is another cool resource that allows you to custom shape or image word clouds, with no lines of coding. They also allow you to tune the hyper parameters to make finished project a bit more aesthetic. I imported the column of all Tiger King\u2019s words, uploaded the same picture, and made this visual:", "Much better! The actual visual is interactive too so scroll over some words to see it in action.", "Single words are powerful, but maybe we\u2019ll gain more insight into looking at commonly used paired-words.", "Boycott Walmart! Education system! Gun Control! Here are some very frequently discussed topics by the Tiger King himself. We could dive deeper into some of these. What happened June 26th? What deadlines is he talking about? What is a full day?", "When Joe Exotic is talking about the word animal, what is he saying?", "What about his best friend, our beloved \u201cCarole Cool Cats Baskin\u201d?", "WHAT! He\u2019s never mentioned Carole? Surely Baskin.", "Weird. Did he ever tweet about her? Did he delete them for legal reasons? Where are the Carole Baskin tweets!!!", "It appears Joe Exotic is a man who truly cares about state government, the election, and the governor. He cares about \u201cfixing this shit\u201d and cares about gun control, the education system, and boycotting Walmart. He is a man that informs his base with deadlines, dates, and news. And maybe, just maybe, he\u2019s not as crazy as Netflix portrayed him to be.", "Maybe he deserves to even be free? That\u2019s for you to debate in the comments.", "You can find all my code for this project at my GitHub Repo: https://github.com/AveryData/Tiger-King-Tweets", "Your home for data science.
