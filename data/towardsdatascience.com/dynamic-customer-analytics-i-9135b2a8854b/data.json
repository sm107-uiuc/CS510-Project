Apocryphal or not, the story went viral, swathed in those layers of wonder and anxiety that embody the popular view of AI. Most businesses do not require such intimate insights into customer behavior, but data science has revolutionized customer analytics.", "The recency-frequency-monetary (RFM) customer segmentation model is one of the fundamental customer analytics frameworks. The three facets of the model are:Recency: How recent was the last transaction (usually measured in days)?Frequency: How frequent were the transactions (in a specified period)?Monetary: How much was spent (in a specified period)?", "The RFM model is typically implemented in a static manner, namely classifying customers at the end of a period of interest, say quarter or year. Moreover, it is curious that amid the manifold \u201chow to\u201d treatises on the RFM model, few subject it to statistical tests. I think we can improve on these shortcomings, using longitudinal or panel data.", "In this article, I used Python to implement a dynamic RFM model using 90-day rolling windows to derive monthly RFM scores. The goal of the exercise was to construct a dynamic RFM model that is responsive to evolving customer behavior.", "The individual R-F-M scores were then blended into composite RFM indicators honed on particular customer metrics of choice. These were in turn subjected to hypothesis testing to ascertain if the model was of any business or financial utility.", "The RFM framework is widely discussed online. So for the sake of brevity, I won\u2019t go into an exposition of it here. The data for this exercise was taken from the popular online retail dataset covering transactions made from a UK online wholesaler between December 2010 and December 2011. The dataset is available from the UCI machine learning depository.", "There is only transaction data in the dataset, and there is no customer demographic information, apart from country of origin. The customers in this case were likely businesses. Still, demographic information such as the customer firm size and their physical location relative to the seller were likely to be important factors in determining how much and how often they made purchases. This was the key limitation of the data, but we could partly surmount this problem with panel data models.", "Each customer transaction(purchase/return) was recorded in the dataset with a unique invoice number, but each transaction could cover multiple product categories and multiple items in each category. A snapshot of the first few lines of the dataset is depicted below. The variables are:", "InvoiceNo: Unique invoice number for each transaction (purchases/returns);InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction;StockCode: Unique inventory code for each product category purchased; Description: Text description of the product category;Quantity: Number of items purchased in the product category; UnitPrice: Unit price of the item;CustomerID: Unique id for each customer; andCountry: Country where customer is located.", "There were originally over 540k rows of intraday transactions. To better refine the analysis, I focused purely on UK customers. I also deleted those observations that had null \u201cCustomerID\u201d values, as I needed this information for the panel data modeling later on. These whittled down the observations to around 362k. I then created a \u201cgross\u201d revenue (or gross spending by customers) variable by multiplying each row\u2019s \u201cQuantity\u201d with its \u201cUnitPrice\u201d.", "The dataset seemed relatively clean at first glance, coming in an Excel file and all that, but it was actually riddled with errors. Thus, the oft-quoted refrain that 80% of a data scientist\u2019s work is data cleaning is proven once more! For example, the maximum (positive) and minimum (negative) \u201cQuantity\u201d values in the dataset were for offsetting amounts that were entered within 12 minutes of each other on the same day for the same customer! This was an obvious \u201cfat finger\u201d error.", "The next error followed quickly on the heels of the one above. The second largest and smallest \u201cQuantity\u201d values were again for offsetting amounts that were separated by mere minutes (below). Another \u201cfat finger\u201d! There were quite a number of these positive/negative offsetting entries throughout the dataset, plus other apparent errors such as customers with only a single but negative transaction.", "These offsetting entries, some of which involved huge outlier values as illustrated by the examples above, mean that taking the expedience of deleting all negative transactions would introduce bias into the dataset and resulting analysis. Moreover, it was obvious that product returns were recorded in the transaction data as negative transactions, so another reason why we should not simply go about deleting all negative transactions.", "Following the data cleaning, I performed some exploratory customer and sales analytics, which underlined the importance of customer segmentation. The top quartile of customers, for example, accounted for 77.2% of gross revenues, while the top decile contributed 57.8% (\uffe13.92mln against \uffe16.78 mln). A clear classification of the customer pool was thus crucial for targeted marketing and retention strategies.", "I turned to Pandas\u2019 time series toolbox in Python to undertake the necessary aggregation of the dataset from intraday into daily frequency. I renamed the variables following the aggregation: id, date, invoices_no, categories, quantity, unitprice, gross. The new names were superficial changes to the original names, except for \u201ccategories\u201d which was a count of the original \u201cStockCode\u201d variable when the latter was aggregated into daily frequency.", "Proto-variables for each facet of the RFM model were then forged from the daily data using various time series tools. For example, below is the code for the \u201cdays_since_last\u201d variable, which would later be used to construct the Recency scores.", "Similarly, \u201ctrans_90d\u201d and \u201crevenue_90d\u201d variables were generated to capture the number of transactions and the total revenue respectively per customer over a 90-day rolling window period. Naturally, these resulted in the first three months of the dataset being dropped from subsequent analysis, given their starting point for the rolling window.", "These feature engineering measures culled many individual customers, as in unique \u201cid\u201d variable values, who were only recorded in the first three months of the dataset and/or had one observation in the remainder of the dataset, such that the proto-RFM variables above would have a null value. To be specific, the initial daily data had 3,947 unique \u201cid\u201d values, but this shrunk to 2,638 ahead of the monthly aggregation. If the dataset had covered a much longer time period, that might have resulted in less winnowing of unique customer records, but this was what I had to work with.", "Moreover, I fashioned an alternative proto-monetary variable, namely the average gross revenue for each customer per month. There was likely to be a strong positive correlation between \u201ctrans_90d\u201d and \u201crevenue_90d\u201d because more transactions should logically result in more revenue from the customer. A high degree of linear dependence is not desirable when we get to using regression to estimate the weights to construct a composite RFM score. As a result, some advocate the use of average revenue for the Monetary dimension. In any event, I generated this alternative variable (\u201cavg_revenue_90d\u201d) to see if it might be useful later on.", "The dataset was finally aggregated into monthly frequency. Why monthly one might ask? The average values of the \u201cdays_since_last\u201d and \u201ctrans_90d\u201d variables were 42.64 and 4.61 respectively in the daily frequency data. These suggest that the typical customer made about one-and-a-half transactions per month. Monthly periodicity was consequently the optimal time interval for customer analytics in this case.", "Following the monthly aggregation, I further deleted a number of outliers in terms of the key \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cinvoices_no\u201d variables. There were 163 observations that fell beyond 3 standard deviations above the mean of either of the two variables. There were no such observations below the mean. These 2% of the observations were dropped as outliers, resulting in a final monthly dataset of 7,892 rows.", "There are two broad procedures one could use to segment customers according to each RFM facet. The first is to sort the list of customers, place equal numbers into various buckets, typically quartiles or quintiles, and score them accordingly. The other is to cluster various groups of customers, with the K-means clustering algorithm widely used for this purpose.", "It\u2019s important to note the chief assumption that go into each procedure. The first procedure shoehorns equal numbers of customers into each segment. K-means clustering, by contrast, is an unsupervised learning algorithm, so it would likely result in imbalanced segments when used on socio-economic data, which are usually skewed.", "There is no right or wrong way, but I prefer to let the data express itself. I am nonetheless aware of the problem of long-tailed distributions, which can cause the majority of observations to cluster into just one or two segments when the skew is rather extreme. Over-clustering is not desirable either because it would reduce the granularity of the subsequent RFM scores.", "To deal with the long-tail problem, I transformed the RFM proto-variables by taking the natural log of \u201cdays_since_last\u201d (since it had only non-zero positive values), and the cube root of \u201ctrans_90d\u201d, \u201crevenue_90d\u201d and \u201cavg_revenue_90d\u201d. I picked a K-means of 5 clusters, and the subsequent clusters were scored on an ordinal ascending scale (i.e. 0 being the lowest score and 4 the highest).", "This approach reduced some of the skewness, but it still reflected an imbalanced customer pool, which was natural in my view. The top score had the smallest sized cluster across all three RFM variables, but as mentioned earlier, the top decile of customers accounted for more than half of the gross revenues.", "Following these steps, we arrived at distinct monthly Recency, Frequency and Monetary scores for each customer. Three snapshots of the resulting monthly DataFrame are presented below. The first is the sorted DataFrame, while the second and third depict the records for two specific customers (\u201cid\u201d==17611 & 13881).", "As may be observed, the monthly individual RFM scores vary depending on evolving customer behavior. Two possible paths beckoned from here. These individual RFM scores could be amalgamated to further pigeonhole individual customers into more specific sub-clusters, for instance into the \u201cfrequent-but-low-spending\u201d group or the \u201cinfrequent-but-high-spending\u201d group.", "Alternatively, we could use these scores to fashion a composite RFM indicator. Given my aim of subjecting the RFM model to statistical tests in a following article, I decided to trod down the second path.", "It\u2019s worthwhile to take some care and thought about the how and why we might want to devise a composite RFM indicator. In fact, the how and why are inextricably intertwined because how we weigh individual scores for aggregation into a composite indicator would have a decisive effect on what it ends up indicating.", "This is why composite weighting models need to be made explicit and transparent. Some commonly commonly used methods for weighting include:Equal weights;Principal component analysis;Regression analysis;Theoretical considerations; andExpert opinion.There is unfortunately neither strong theory nor expert consensus on how we should proceed.", "As an illustration, let us consider what would happen if we took the expedience of simply adding across the three R-F-M scores in each month, so taking the equal weights approach that is the prevalent practice. I constructed such a monthly \u201crfm_equal\u201d variable, and its correlation matrix (of monthly data) is depicted below.", "What is immediately apparent is that \u201crfm_equal\u201d has a much stronger positive relationship to \u201cinvoices_no\u201d (number of transactions/purchases per month) than \u201cgross\u201d (total spending per month) at +0.56 versus +0.34. The chief reason is that the RFM model inherently emphasizes regular customer activity, embodied by the Recency and Frequency facets, and an equal-weight of all three facets would give free rein to this tendency.", "Although the RFM model might have been originally devised to score the regularity of customer activity, an alternative composite construction method might both improve it and make it more flexible. There is of course nothing wrong with focusing on customer activity, but I wanted to show that it is possible to craft a composite RFM indicator of alternative customer metrics. If indeed we could use the same data for different purposes, then that would reduce the need for additional data collection, or would allow for the novel use of existing data.", "Furthermore, notice the difference in the correlation coefficients with regards to the \u201cmonetary\u201d and \u201cmonetary_avg\u201d scores. The initial suspicion that \u201cmonetary\u201d would be highly correlated with \u201cfrequency\u201d was confirmed. In fact, \u201cmonetary_avg\u201d has lower correlations to both \u201crecency\u201d and \u201cfrequency\u201d than the original \u201cmonetary\u201d variable. Consequently, I would be using \u201cmonetary_avg\u201d as the default Monetary facet of my dynamic RFM model from here on.", "I turned to panel data regression modeling to construct the composite RFM indicators of choice. Panel data analysis comes in many names and guises. Also known as longitudinal, clustered or hierarchical data, panel data is distinguished by the combination of cross-sectional data (data taken from many unrelated subjects at one point in time) and time series (data taken from the same subject across several points in time). Panel data is usually differentiated from time series by having observations across many more subjects than time periods.", "One major advantage of panel data is that it allows one to use the subjects to serve as their own control. When you observe the same subject under changing conditions over time, you can obtain a better estimate of how those changes effect its behavior. Even better is when you can add this observational dimension to the (typical) cross-sectional analysis of different subjects.", "In other words, panel data analysis can be used to estimate both intra-subject variation (in each customer over time in our case) and inter-subject variation (across different customers), which leads to the additional jargon of the \u201cwithin\u201d and \u201cbetween\u201d estimators respectively. These advantages could allow for stronger inference about causal relationships in the data, which is why panel data techniques are widely used in biomedical research.", "I used only the \u201cwithin\u201d estimator panel data model in this article. The model basically fixes the subjects\u2019 time-invariant attributes while estimating how the time-varying explanatory variables effect the dependent variable. This is widely known as the fixed effects model in econometrics. The coefficients from such a model capture the effect of the time-series variation on each subject, while controlling for all time-invariant attributes without having to list them explicitly.", "The customers in this case were other firms. The chief limitation of the dataset is the lack of customer demographic information. It is easy to suppose that factors such as the customer firm size, customer business model, and physical distance from the seller could be highly important in determining how much and how often purchases were made. Failure to include such potentially significant factors in a regression could cause the coefficient estimates to be distorted by omitted variable bias.", "The benefit of the fixed effects model in this case was that these \u201cfixed\u201d attributes of each customer would all be controlled for in the model! All the customer\u2019s unchanging demographic factors (within the time period under analysis) were accounted for in the model when running the regression. I could thus undertake statistical inference safe in the knowledge that these time-invariant factors would not exert bias on the parameter estimates.", "The first composite RFM indicator I constructed had monthly customer spending as its target metric. Generating sales is indubitably the raison d\u2019etre of businesses. For this purpose, the monthly \u201cgross\u201d revenue was used as the target variable for the regression analysis.", "The target monthly \u201cgross\u201d variable was heavily right-skewed. It had a mean of \u00a3459 but a maximum value of \u00a35540. It also had negative values, remember that product returns were captured in the transaction data. I thus transformed it by taking its cube root, which unlike the log transformation may be used on zero and negative values. The transformed distribution, \u201cgross_cubic\u201d, was indeed more symmetric, if very slightly bimodal.", "The composite RFM score was built and tested in one procedure. I first sorted the dataset by time period from earliest (starting March 2011) to latest (ending December 2011), then split it in half. The sorting before splitting ensured that the data\u2019s temporal order would be respected. The individual RFM coefficients plus regression intercept were estimated from the upper half of the sample. These estimates were then used to compute the composite RFM indicator.", "Only the lower half of the dataset was used for the hypothesis tests on the composite indicator. In this fashion, I would be testing if the composite weights obtained from the earlier \u201ctraining\u201d half of the dataset were generalizable to the latter \u201ctest\u201d half of the data. It was a blend of a train-test split with hypothesis testing, which traditionally tend to be performed on the full data.", "The fixed effects panel data regression was done with a minimum of two observations (over time) for each customer, who are referred to as \u201cEntities\u201d in the summary results. Only the customer effects were fixed, there were no time effects included in the regression, so it was a one-way fixed effects model.", "To keep things compact, I only show part of the summary results, in particular the parameter estimates with their respective standard errors and t-statistics. All three RFM variables were statistically significant. The full summary results, including the F-test on poolability, are available at my GitHub page, with the link at the bottom of the article.", "I fashioned the \u201crfm_gross\u201d variable from the intercept and coefficients above. Then took the lower half of the dataset, and ran two regressions models on it. The first model had only \u201crfm_gross\u201d as the regressor of interest, while the second model included \u201cinvoices_no\u201d, \u201cquantity\u201d and \u201ccategories\u201d as additional control variables. After all, one would expect the number of transactions, number of items bought and number of product categories purchased to exert some impact on the \u201cgross\u201d spending. So it was fitting that \u201crfm_gross\u201d be tested in the company of these other regressors.", "The first model\u2019s \u201crfm_gross\u201d coefficient was a pleasing +0.8830, or near to 1, which implied that it had an almost one-to-one relationship with the dependent variable \u201cgross_cubic\u201d, and was also statistically significant. The second model\u2019s \u201crfm_gross\u201d coefficient dipped to +0.6543 in the presence of the other regressors, but it remained statistically significant. The null hypothesis of poolability, meaning that fixed effects were not required, was also rejected in both models.", "The results demonstrated that:1) \u201crfm_gross\u201d was a good (coefficient near 1 and statistically significant) bivariate (within) predictor of \u201cgross_cubic\u201d in the test set; and2) \u201crfm_gross\u201d remained a robust (within) predictor of \u201cgross_cubic\u201d despite the addition of other control variables.", "I subsequently turned to see if I could improve upon the original purpose of the RFM model, which was to track the regularity of customer activity. Could we do better than using equal weights to construct a composite RFM indicator? To answer this, I largely retraced the steps above, but using \u201cinvoices_no\u201d as the target variable instead.", "So first splitting the dataset into halves, with the earlier half of the data used to run a panel data regression with one-way fixed effects. All three RFM variables were again statistically significant. The intercept and coefficients were then used to compute a composite RFM indicator, \u201crfm_invoices\u201d, which was tested in the latter half of the dataset.", "I again ran two models: one with just \u201crfm_invoices\u201d as the regressor of interest, and another with \u201ccategories\u201d and \u201cquantity\u201d included as additional regressors. I assumed that \u201cinvoices_no\u201d, which is the number of transactions, would be effected by how many products and how many items a customer purchased. This time \u201cgross\u201d was not included because I assumed that the causal arrow went from \u201cinvoices_no\u201d to \u201cgross\u201d rather than the other way around.", "The coefficients for \u201crfm_invoices\u201d in both models were close to one, at +0.9734 and +0.8838 respectively, and statistically significant. In this regard, the composite indicator \u201crfm_invoices\u201d was more robust in the presence of other regressors than \u201crfm_gross\u201d, which confirmed that the RFM model is best suited for tracking customer activity.", "Still, was this \u201crfm_invoices\u201d better than the initial equal-weight \u201crfm_equal\u201d indicator? One way to test this was to subject \u201crfm-equal\u201d to the same test procedure as above. The results are below.", "We see that both coefficients of \u201crfm_equal\u201d at +0.1423 and +0.1328 were statistically significant. While their quantum were smaller than the coefficients of \u201crfm_invoices\u201d, they were similarly robust in the face of the additional regressors. This suggested that the \u201crfm_equal\u201d composite indicator was not much more inferior to \u201crfm_invoices\u201d.", "A strong positive relationship between \u201crfm_equal\u201d and \u201crfm_invoices\u201d was confirmed by the pairplot charts below. Given the simplicity of its construction, we are perhaps better off just using the \u201crfm_equal\u201d when targeting the number of customer transactions.", "The project begun with the endeavor to build a dynamic RFM model that would provide monthly Recency, Frequency and Monetary scores on evolving customer behavior. To do so, I aggregated the original intraday data into daily frequency initially, and then into monthly frequency. Monthly periodicity was identified as the optimal frequency for customer analytics in this case.", "Following this, I used panel data econometrics to fashion RFM composite indicators, to target first customer spending and second the incidence of customer transactions. I then subjected the RFM model to hypothesis tests, which confirmed its usefulness in measuring the customer metrics of choice contemporaneously. The tests further confirmed that the simple equal-weighted RFM composite score was an effective predictor of customer transactions.", "Further work might involve building an alternative model that could be more effective in tracking customer spending, perhaps by replacing Recency with the quantity of items purchased. Alternative panel data models, in particular Bayesian hierarchical modelling, might also help in improving the RFM model.", "(The full Python code for this exercise is available at my GitHub repository.
