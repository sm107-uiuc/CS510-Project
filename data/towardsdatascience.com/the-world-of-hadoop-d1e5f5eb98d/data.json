It\u2019s a huge system which comprises of different components which can be contrasting as well as complementing to each other. Understanding how these different components are interconnected is a must have piece of knowledge for anyone willing to utilize Hadoop based technologies in a production level big data application. Hadoop ecosystem possesses a huge place in the big data technology stack and it\u2019s a must have skill for data engineers. So, let\u2019s dig a little deeper into the world of Hadoop and try to untangle the pieces of which this world is made.", "Starting with a formal definition for Hadoop can help us getting an idea of the overall intention of Hadoop ecosystem:", "Hadoop is an opensource software platform for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters", "As the definition indicates, the heart of Hadoop is made of its ability to handle data storage and processing in a distributed manner. In order to achieve this, the overall architecture of Hadoop and its distributed file system has been inspired by Google File System (GFS) and Google MapReduce. The distributed nature of Hadoop architecture makes it suitable for very large data, specially by removing a single point of failure when processing these large amounts of data.", "Now let\u2019s try to walk through different building blocks of the Hadoop ecosystem and understand how these pieces are interconnected.", "I tried to organize the entire Hadoop ecosystem into three categories.", "2. YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator): YARN is the resource manager which arbitrates all available cluster resources. It also follows the master/slave approach. YARN has a resource manager (master) per cluster and then a node manager (slaves) per node. The Resource Manager is the authority that mediates resources among all the nodes in the cluster. It keeps the meta data about which jobs are running on which node and manages how much memory and CPU is consumed and hence has a holistic view of total CPU and RAM consumption of the whole cluster. The Node Manager is the per-machine agent who is responsible for monitoring their resource usage (cpu, memory, disk, network) and reporting the same to the Resource Manager. ApplicationMaster is the instance of a framework specific library which allows different applications to negotiate requests to resources. Containers are the abstractions of resources which are allocated for requests. More details about YARN can be found here: https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html", "3. MapReduce: The entire programming model of parallelism in Hadoop is based on the software framework called MapReduce. This model allows processing large data sets in parallel on clusters of commodity hardware. MapReduce jobs first splits data into a set of independent chunks called map tasks which can be executed/processed in parallel. Then the sorted outputs of the map tasks are input into a reduce task which will produce an aggregated result. Hadoop\u2019s parallel programming model is based on this concept. More details about Hadoop MapReduce can be found here: https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html", "On top of HDFS, YARN and MapReduce there are various data querying, processing and ingesting technologies which can be used to build big data applications in real-world. Now let\u2019s look into those technologies. These technologies are intended to serve various purposes but can be integrated into a one large application too.", "The technologies described above are the main components of Hadoop data manipulation layer. What technology to use has to be decided based on the business requirements and the features they offer. The above technologies can be used separately as well as in combination with each other to work on top of Hadoop and its distributed file system.", "On top of Hadoop Core and its related data driven technology stack there should be a mechanism to manage and coordinate things, especially due to the distributed nature of Hadoop. For that also there are different platforms provided.", "My main attempt through this article was to summarize and structure the ecosystem of Hadoop based on technologies and their intended purposes. When I was a student, I found it slightly difficult to grasp a summarized view because the Hadoop ecosystem is huge and diverse. I have organized the entire Hadoop ecosystem into certain parts here in a way that was easy for me to grasp personally. I believe it will be helpful for someone else too. So, if you are interested in diving deeper into big data engineering, then this might be the starting point.", "Your home for data science.
