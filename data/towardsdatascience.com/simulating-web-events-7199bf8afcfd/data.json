This POC should allow you to demonstrate some of the functionalities, in this case, generate real-time metrics. However, there is a limitation: you can\u2019t use production data on a POC. How do you solve that?", "If your answer was to generate fake events, then you are right. It will probably be the best solution. Then you create some random events and push then to the pipeline. You\u2019ll soon realize that random is not the same as fake. You certainly don\u2019t want to show a chart like this to your managers:", "Random events don\u2019t make a point; they don\u2019t sell anything. Let\u2019s have a grasp at another metric created on top of random events:", "Now let\u2019s say you want to build your portfolio for an Analytics Engineer position. You possibly need to show that you are capable of creating web sessions, measuring conversion rate and splitting metrics by campaign or source. How do you build your damn portfolio if you don\u2019t have data? And again, generating random data won't allow you to measure anything.", "Thinking about those problems, I decided to create a python package to generate fake events that are not entirely random. They follow a set of constraints and allow you to create beautiful things with fake data that looks like real. Look again at the page-views over time chart:", "If we look at the page-views funnel, we would expect to see more visits on Home and much less on payment and confirmation, right? Let\u2019s check if that is true.", "Is quite simple! The package is available on PyPI and source code on GitHub. To install you do pip install, as you would for any other package:", "It is also simple to use. See the example below that will print events to stdout.", "You can do anything you want inside the loop. Send it to Kafka or Kinesis. Process it with Spark streaming and create some metrics. Save to a Postgres and build some dashboards using Metabase. Show off your SQL skills on your portfolio. Or get that POC approved.", "An event created by this package will look like this:", "Fake Web Events is using Faker to create some data; other fields are randomly generated based on predefined weights (that you can customize in a YAML file).", "I assume you might be interested in understanding how those events are created and in what is the logic behind it. I can tell you straight away that it\u2019s not Alien technology :).", "We start by creating a pool of users. Some fields are entirely random (coming from Faker), others follow a set of predefined weights. For example, the user will get a browser assigned using the following weights:", "Meaning that Chrome will appear on roughly 50% of users and Firefox on 25%.", "A user has essentially the same JSON structure than an event, except by the fact that it doesn\u2019t contain timestamps or page information. When we run the simulation, users will be randomly picked from the pool to start \u201cnavigating the website\u201d. Users might return to the site later, that\u2019s why they are chosen with reposition.", "To create events, we simulate sessions. There are a few \u201cpages\u201d created in the simulation. The user will start either at Home, Product A or Product B pages. At each iteration, the user could stay on the same page, move to another page, or finalize the session. Below are the probabilities for a user that is currently on Home:", "The simulation tracks all users and generates an event every time it reaches a new page. Once the user reaches Session End, his session is dropped. Follows a diagram of the possible user events during the simulation:", "The simulation will run in batches, and its internal clock will usually go much faster than the standard time. The exception is if you are running it with very large user_pool_size and sessions_per_day.", "The simulation will create a generator object. It won\u2019t run or use resources until you start iterating over it.", "I do have a few ideas on what to do next on this project. Some are simple bug fixes or improved implementation of how events are generated and tracked. But there is one broad idea that I would like to explore more:", "Producing microservices events on top of web events.", "My idea is to add another module to the simulation that would create different events based on the microservices architecture. I can think of events like this:", "Microservices events would be useful to create fake transactional databases that are bonded to web events. I think it would be useful for a lot of people as it would allow even more use cases.", "If you like this project, please show your love by starring it on GitHub.", "Everyone can also contribute: create some issues, feature requests, or even Pull Requests if you are comfortable in touching the code!", "Your home for data science.
