Let me brief you on what we are about to do:", "We will be looking at a new class of deep learning neural networks called the Convolutional Neural Network. They are most commonly used in Computer Vision applications which makes it perfect for the task in hand.", "To put it simply, CNNs enable the network to see the input image as a composition of edges, corners, colors essentially capturing the content of the image.", "To look into CNNs from a more technical standpoint, I would suggest you go through this article.", "We won\u2019t be looking too much into how CNNs work in this guide but will focus on how we can implement it in code using TensorFlow and Keras.", "Here are the completed Colab Notebook and the GitHub repo.", "Like in the previous guide, we will be using the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
