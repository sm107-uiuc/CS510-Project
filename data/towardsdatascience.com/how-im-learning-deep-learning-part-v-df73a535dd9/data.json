One of the best I\u2019ve ever taken.", "Many people have reached out and asked if it\u2019s enough on its own to get a role somewhere.", "Slightly longer answer: Yes, if you\u2019re able to effectively communicate what you\u2019ve learned through a project of your own or some other extra-curricular endeavour.", "Where I believe the job-readiness comes in is from doing a course such as Andrew Ng\u2019s deeplearning.ai or Udacity\u2019s AI Nanodegree and then using the knowledge you\u2019ve gained to seek out a project of your own. Something which interests you enough to work on for a while and share your journey with the world. I\u2019ve yet to properly do this.", "There are some great online courses but nothing quite prepares you for when you\u2019re working on a problem and you have to seek your own answers.", "I started learning Python with deep learning. Kind of like being dropped at the top of a mountain without climbing the rest of it.", "Since starting at Max Kelsen, much of my time has been spent cleaning and preparing datasets to use machine learning and deep learning techniques on.", "Basics is probably the wrong word. But after some hands-on experience, I\u2019ve found deep learning to be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to data. There\u2019s no point having an epic deep learning model ready if your data looks like the local dump.", "But it\u2019s the role of a budding machine learning engineer or data scientist to change the saying around.", "To help with this, I got a book on using Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney. The parallels in it to what we\u2019ve been working on lately are astounding.", "My brother and I are taking the Applied Data Science with Python specialisation on Coursera. It complements the book. I even used the exact function I learned in one of the lectures at work the other day.", "fast.ai Part 1 was epic. I love the way Jeremy teaches. He\u2019s a real practitioner.", "Though, before going on to Part 2, I\u2019m going to go through Jeremy\u2019s machine learning lectures and Rachel\u2019s (co-founder of fast.ai) lecture series on computational linear algebra.", "After these, I\u2019ll be looking for some genomics and AI themed courses. The crossover between health and technology fascinates me. At Max Kelsen, we\u2019re starting a venture soon to analyse whole-genomes in an attempt to find more personalised treatments for cancer patients. I can\u2019t wait.", "In the near future, I plan on bringing these skills to the field of nutrigenomics, or nutrition matched with your DNA.", "As always, these will be viewable on my Trello board.", "If you want to learn deep learning and machine learning. Great. You\u2019re in for a hell of ride.", "But beware, not all the data you find outside of an online course comes in a neat little package.", "Be sure to compliment your deep learning and machine learning abilities with the ability to take a dataset, manipulate it, dress it up nicely and take it out for dinner and you\u2019ll have a dangerous (in a good way) set of skills on your hands.", "The programming language doesn\u2019t really matter either.
