There are various steps involved when doing EDA but the following are the common steps that a data analyst can take when performing EDA:", "This article focuses on EDA of a dataset, which means that it would involve all the steps mentioned above. Therefore, this article will walk you through all the steps required and the tools used in each step. So you would expect to find the followings in this article:", "For beginners to EDA, if you do not have a lot of time and do not know where to start, I would recommend you to start with Tidyverse and ggplot2. You can do almost everything about EDA with these 2 packages. There are various resources online like DataCamp, Setscholars, and books like Introduction to Data Science and so on.", "In this article, I would walk you through the process of EDA through the analysis of the PISA score dataset which is available here.", "Before importing the data into R for analysis, let\u2019s look at how the data looks like:", "When importing this data into R, we want the last column to be \u2018numeric\u2019 and the rest to be \u2018factor\u2019. With this in mind, let\u2019s look at the following 3 scenarios:", "These are 3 ways of importing the data into R. Usually, one with go for the df.raw1 because it seems to be the most convenient way of importing the data. Let\u2019s see the structure of the imported data:", "There are 2 problems that we can spot immediately. The last column is \u2018factor\u2019 and not \u2018numeric\u2019 like what we desire. Secondly, the first column \u2018Country name\u2019 is encoded differently from the raw dataset.", "Now let\u2019s try the second case scenario", "The last column is now \u2018numeric\u2019. However, the name of the first column is not imported correctly.", "As you can see, the first column is now named properly and the last column is \u2018numeric\u2019.", "This allows R to replace those blanks in the dataset with NA. This will be useful and convenient later when we want to remove all the \u2018NA\u2019s.", "This allows R, in the laymen term, to read the characters as correctly as they would appear on the raw dataset.", "We want to do a few things to clean the dataset:", "Now let\u2019s see how the clean data looks like:", "Similarly, we can rank by science score and reading score too, just change the name accordingly.", "If we use the dataset above, we will not be able to draw a boxplot. This is because boxplot needs only 2 variables x and y but in the cleaned data that we have, there are so many variables. So we need to combine those into 2 variables. We name this as df2", "Great! Now we can make boxplots", "geom_jitter() allows you to plot the data points on the plot.", "You can play around with the code above to get various plots. For example, I can change from \u2018color = Score\u2019 to \u2018fill=Score\u2019:", "The plot looks a bit messy. A better visualisation would be to separate Subjects and Genders and plot them side by side.", "Since we want to separate Subjects and Genders from a column containing \u2018Subject.Gender\u2019 (e.g. Maths.F), we need to use strsplit () to do this job for us", "Now S is a list of 408 components, each of which has 2 sub-components \u2018Subject\u2019 and \u2018Gender\u2019. We need to transform S into a data frame with 1 column of Subject and 1 column of Gender. We will name this data frame as df3", "We now need to combine this df3 with df2 we created earlier, and name the result as df4", "Awesome! Now the data looks clean and neat. Let\u2019s create multiple plots with the use of facet_wrap() function in ggplot2", "Here, we categorized the plot by Gender, hence facet_wrap(~Gender,nrow = 1)", "We can also categorize the plot by Test by changing facet_wrap(~Test,nrow = 1)", "By looking at these plots, we can make some insights about the performance of males and females. Generally, males performed better in Science and Maths, but females performed better in Reading. However, it would be naive for us to make a conclusion only after looking at the boxplot. Let\u2019s dive deeper into the data and see any other insights we can get after manipulating the dataset.", "Since I want to compare the performance of Males and Females in each subject across all participating countries, I would need to calculate the % difference in terms of the score for each subject between males and females and then plot it out to visualize.", "How would I do this in R? Use mutate() function", "Let\u2019s look at the original clean data set that we have, df", "We will now use the mutate() function to calculate, for each country, the % difference between Males and Females for each subject.", "Now let\u2019s plot this out to visualize the data better", "This plot represents the % difference in scores using Females as reference. A positive difference means males scored higher, while a negative difference means males scored lower. The black line represents the mean difference across all countries.", "Some interesting insights one can draw from here:", "We can do the same thing for Reading and Science score.", "To create correlation plot, simply use cor():", "We can calculate p-value to see whether the correlation is significant", "The smaller the p-value, the more significant the correlation.", "The purpose of this section about correlation plot is to introduce to you how to calculate correlation between variables in R. For this dataset, it is obvious that all the variables are correlated", "The stronger the color and the bigger the size, the higher the correlation. The result is similar to the one we got earlier: All the variables are intercorrelated.", "That is it! Hope you guys enjoyed and picked up something from this article. While this guide is not exhaustive, it will more or less give you some ideas of how to do some basic EDA with R.", "If you have any questions, feel free to put them down in the comment section below.
