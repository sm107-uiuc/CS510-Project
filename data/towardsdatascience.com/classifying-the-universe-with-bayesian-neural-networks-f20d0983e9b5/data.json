Fortunately, artificial intelligence may finally help resolve this frustratingly persistent question. Here\u2019s how.", "Everything that we can see with our telescopes, including every planet, star and galaxy, comprises but a tiny percentage of the total constituents of the Universe. There is definitely more stuff out there. Astronomers know this because where there is matter there is a gravitational pull, even if the matter is invisible. This pull influences the movement of galaxies and even light. From observations such as these, we now know that approximately thirty percent of the Universe is filled with this dark matter.", "If this wasn\u2019t strange enough, the attempt to understand what remains has caused many a headache in the cosmology community. Labelled dark energy, this mysterious substance is thought to drive our Universe\u2019s current phase of accelerated expansion. Our best guess is that dark energy arises from a constant energy inherently associated with empty space, although getting this idea to fit into a cohesive theoretical framework has proved doggedly difficult. Another possibility is that we do not yet understand how Einstein\u2019s theory of General Relativity works on the vast cosmological distances where dark energy begins to dominate. In the same way that the movement of electrons in an atom isn\u2019t affected by gravity, an additional \u201cfifth force\u2019\u2019 could kick into gear when we consider the size of the observable Universe, potentially driving cosmic acceleration.", "Theoretical physicists require a well-functioning imagination to wrap their heads around these ideas, and these imaginations have produced a plethora of possibilities which attempt to explain what dark matter and dark energy, collectively known as \u201cthe dark sector\u2019\u2019, really are [1]. But how does one go about separating the theoretical wheat from the theoretical chaff?", "One key method is to look at how strongly dark matter clusters together at different length scales in the Universe, quantified by something called the dark matter power spectrum. Different theories give characteristic predictions for the shape of this power spectrum. Imagine a theory which slightly strengthens gravity and thus enhances the pull a clump of dark matter exerts on the surrounding dark matter. If this were the case, one would hope to see this in the dark matter power spectrum.", "The astute among you may have gathered that, by virtue of being dark, astronomers cannot directly measure the shape of the dark matter power spectrum. Rather, it must be inferred from the influence dark matter has on say, galaxies or light trajectories. Generally speaking, the more galaxies tend to group together or light seems to be bent, the more dark matter there is at that particular spot.", "Over the next decade, many new cosmological surveys will map out the positions of literally billions of galaxies, providing us with the most detailed map of the cosmos ever produced. Cosmologists hope to use this galaxy map to create a map of the Universe\u2019s dark matter and thus provide us with our Universe\u2019s very own dark matter power spectrum. The question is, once we obtain this data, how can it be translated into a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of the dark sector?", "Theoretical physicists are a busy bunch. In between coffee breaks, many have been occupied during the past decade developing computational tools which predict the shape of the dark matter power spectrum in a variety of theories and, most crucially, can now do it rapidly. Give them a theory and they\u2019ll give you the corresponding power spectrum.", "With my collaborators at the University of Geneva, we used one such tool [2] to generate a dataset of hundreds of thousands of dark matter power spectra, each representing a different Universe. Some had shapes consistent with current observations while others had slight modifications coming from their underlying theory. With such a large dataset of different Universes a natural question arose: how capable are neural networks in classifying dark matter power spectra according to their underlying theory and, more importantly, to what extent can such classifications be trusted?", "Knowledge of measurement uncertainty in any science is critical if one wants to be sure any result can be relied upon. This is no less true for artificial intelligence. Traditional neural networks are not well suited to estimating prediction uncertainty as they can only provide a single prediction for the class of a single test example. Training the network on slightly different training data or adding modified noise to a test example might dramatically affect a prediction given by a neural network [3]. In an attempt to tackle these issues Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) were developed which, rather than obtaining fixed values for the weights during training, result in a trained probability distribution for each weight in the network [4]. By passing a test example multiple times through the BNN, with each pass sampling a different draw from the weight distributions, one obtains a distribution of predictions which, in effect, quantifies how the prediction might vary had multiple traditional neural networks attempted to classify the same example.", "We therefore trained a BNN to classify power spectra according to the underlying theory. When testing the network, we were able to associate a classification confidence with every prediction which took into account uncertainty from the noise in the data, our network architecture and choice of optimisation algorithm among other sources of uncertainty. Our results were highly encouraging.", "In some instances, the BNN was able to pick up the presence of a modification with a size one-hundred times smaller than what is currently believed to be achievable. In fact, for every theory that we tested the BNN on, it performed at least as well as current estimates of whether particular theories should be detectable in cosmological datasets.", "What is more, it was also able to determine that a spectrum generated by a theory excluded from the training set did not belong to any of the theories in the training set. This is important because, as imaginative as theorists are, there is always the possibility that no current theory will eventually be convincingly favoured over any other.", "Finally, once the BNN has been trained it takes no time at all to obtain an estimate on whether a particular power spectrum looks like a particular theory. Standard techniques used in cosmology today generally could take many hours if not days to reach similar conclusions. By using BNNs it is perhaps not unfeasible to imagine that, on the day the power spectrum of our Universe is measured, comfortably wrapped in a zip file and emailed to one lucky cosmologist, we could know within minutes which theories survive and which to throw into the theoretical dustbin.", "As promising as these results are, much remains to be done. There are many theories out there, and our BNNs were only trained on four of them. Including additional theories in the training set may be an intimidating endeavour, with everything from exotic dark matter particles, primordial black holes or extra dimensions of space thrown in the mix, but it is also eminently feasible.", "The Universe may appear to be a messy and complicated place, but it is an astonishing fact that only six parameters can explain the large-scale properties of our Universe today [5]. As our measurements become more refined this picture could change, and artificial intelligence may well be at the forefront of this cosmic redraft.", "So will light soon be shed on the nature of the dark sector? Sadly, in the words of the theoretical physicist Leonard Susskind:", "\u201cEventually when the Universe expands enough, all that will be left is the dark energy.\u201d", "Even so, we can be cautiously optimistic we\u2019ll know before then.", "Our paper can be found here, with the code available here and the training and test data here.", "[4] Y.
