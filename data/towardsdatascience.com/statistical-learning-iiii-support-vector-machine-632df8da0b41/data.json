However, SVM is also a machine learning algorithm applicable to linear problems. After knowing the concept of SVM such as hyperplane and kernel, you\u2019ll better know how to apply the model for both regression and classification problem!", "In this article, you will learn:", "(1) Tackle linear problem on SVM with maximal margin classifier", "(2) Introduction of kernel for SVM for non-linear problem", "(3) The application of SVM on text classification in Python", "When data points are disseminated across more than 2-dimensional space, a hyperplane is applied to divide them into two halves. From the plot below, it shows two classes of observations as blue dots indicate 1 class and purple ones stand for the other. For the left one, it shows there are 3 hyperplanes separating the data points into 2 classes. For the right one, data points are split into half with yi=1 fall into blue class and yi=-1 assigned to purple class. Thus, the data points are classified into two classes followed by the equation:", "Maximal margin classifier comes across to decide optimal hyperplane based on the value summing up the margin within data points and hyperplane. The classifier chooses the hyperplane by taking the furthest from the training observations. The equation of maximal margin classifier is defined below:", "M is the margin of the hyperplane which shall be maximized.yi, \u2026 \u2026, yn \u2208 {\u22121, 1} belong to labelsx1,\u2026,xn \u2208 Rp belong to training observations", "The classifier would maximize M through choosing B0, B1, B2, \u2026., Bp to optimize the problem.", "However, in terms of the non-separating problem, there is no hyperplane used to calculate value M >0. To generalize such a dilemma, a support vector classifier is used to calculate the soft margin for non-separable cases.", "Support vector classifier, also named soft margin classifier, allows some observations to appear in the opposite side of the hyperplane or margin.", "M is the width of the margin; C is the nonnegative tuning parameter ;\u03b51, . . . , \u03b5n allows observations to be in an incorrect side. If \u03b5i >0, the ith observation appears on the wrong side. C sums up values of \u03b5i and it determines the range of severity that the margin is able to tolerate. When C becomes higher, the margin becomes wider and it tolerates more violations to the data, which results in high bias and low variance. On the other hand, when C decreases, the margin shrinks, and fewer observations appear in the incorrect side, which results in low bias and high variance. Therefore, C determines the bias-variance trade-off of the support vector classifier. From the plot below, it shows that C shrinks from plot1 to plot4, allows fewer support vectors to appear within the narrow margin of the hyperplane.", "Noted: Support Vector Classifier only supports for 2-classes classification if the boundary is linear to separate the observations.", "Noted that Support Vector Classifier works for only separation of 2-class problem while Support Vector Machine (SVM) is able to cope with more complex non-linear problem with more than 2-class classification.", "The support vector machine enlarges the feature space using kernels with a non-linear boundary between more than 2 classes. We\u2019ll walk through the mathematic concept of the support vector classifier for linear and non-linear problems on top of using the kernel approach.", "From the equation below, it represents the linear support vector classifier as SVM requires the inner product of the observations. There are a_i\u22ef a_n training observations. To optimize the F(x) function, we need to conduct an inner product of new point x and the ith observation point.", "Kernel is applied for the generalization of the inner product of <x, x_i>. From equation 1, k(x_i, x_i\u2019) is referred to as kernel function, used to quantify the similarity of two observations. To tackle the polynomial problem, kernel function from equation 2 is fit to accommodate higher dimensional space with polynomial degree d >1. A polynomial kernel function is able to draw flexible decision boundaries for datapoints spreading across the non-linear patterns.", "Radial Kernel is another popular non-linear function. From equation 3 below, \u03b3 is a positive constant. Given a new test observation x_ij, the radial kernel function calculates the Euclidean distance with the training observation x_i\u2019j. When the test data points are far away from the training data points, taking exponential on the negative constant of the squared distance of two further data points results in small value. As \u03b3 is larger, the support vector classifier can output with better performance. Therefore, the output of k(x_i, x_i\u2019) would place little influence to support vector classifier f(x) function, defined as equation 4 below. In other words, only nearby test observations x_ij to the training observation x_i\u2019j would essentially influence the predicted class of test data.", "When the kernel is applied, it reduces the computation while it only focuses on support vectors lying on the margin for kernel function on K(x_i, x_i\u2019). On the other hand, the enlarged feature space method is required with large computation power since there would be infinite data points falling into the space with a higher dimension.", "We\u2019ll walk through support vector classifier on example dataset with python Sklearn package. The dataset includes 50k movie reviews from IMDB for natural language processing or text analytics. This is used to predict whether news is positive or negative. Links to the Kaggle website: IMDB dataset. SVM works well for text classification, so this would be our primary predictive text classification model. Before diving into the predictive methods through a support vector classifier, let\u2019s walk through some basic methods to have the train and test data prepared for the prediction.", "The input text features are required to convert into numerical features for the machine learning model. The example below shows the Bag-of-Words Model method through the CountVectorizer function. It calculates the occurrences (count) of the words appear in an entire document and output the encoded vector. The output vector is usually sparse.", "The example below shows the input embedded text features into the SVM model.
