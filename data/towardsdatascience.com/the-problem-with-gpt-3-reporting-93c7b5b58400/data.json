I even wrote one. The language model is a significant development in AI, so it\u2019s only natural that writers want to share their excitement with the world.", "Here\u2019s the problem: the ability of GPT-3 \u2014 namely the quality of its writing \u2014 is often exaggerated by published samples. In fact, there are not one, but two filters keeping the AI\u2019s worst results from wide dissemination.", "Selection bias wouldn\u2019t be a problem if any interested reader could access the GPT-3 API and make their own observations of its ability. However, access is currently severely limited. (AI Dungeon is often used to test GPT-3 by those of us without the full version, but its creator has recently outlined ways backdoor access to GPT-3 is being prevented.)", "When reporting \u2014 and I use that term in its broadest possible interpretation to mean any writing about GPT-3 \u2014 is the only source of public information, selection biases ought to be considered in our understanding of the product. Here, I outline the obvious bias, and a less-obvious bias which exacerbates the issue.", "Say I\u2019m writing an informative piece on GPT-3. I want to demonstrate that it can put together coherent strings of sentences, so I give it a prompt and examine the output.", "If I don\u2019t like what I see, I\u2019m likely to try again with a slightly different (perhaps longer) prompt. Even if I\u2019m not actively selecting particular sentences that suit the purpose of my article, massaging the output creates a biased sample of writing that is not representative of GPT-3\u2019s overall quality.", "In the context of creating a narrative about the AI, it makes sense to showcase its best work rather than a fair representation of its limitations. This is the first problem.", "Consider the case where something does gets written about a function GPT-3 cannot perform. It might be a list of writing fails, or code that doesn\u2019t compile.", "To me, that wouldn\u2019t be an interesting piece, and I suspect it wouldn\u2019t intrigue others either. I\u2019m sure Tweets, Reddit posts, and longer articles detailing GPT-3\u2019s unexpected failures are out there, but the fact of the matter is they\u2019re not getting read.", "On the surface, this doesn\u2019t seem like a problem. It definitely isn\u2019t necessary to read about everything that GPT-3 can\u2019t do. The real problem is when positive results are favoured over negative ones for the same task. For example, if someone reported positive results for getting GPT-3 to write a legal document, this would undoubtedly receive more attention than an instance where the AI fails to generate a coherent document.", "In essence, the way GPT-3 reporting currently works is analogous to running scientific trials without pre-registration. Publication bias, where statistically insignificant results don\u2019t get published, can cause absurd findings to be accepted as solid research.", "To be clear, I don\u2019t think there is an imperative for writers to publish more negative results from GPT-3. There is, however, an obligation to contextualize samples with the way in which they were generated and how many negative results were obtained in the process.", "After all, human selection \u2014 on the level of individual pieces of writing or how the larger body of work gets consumed \u2014 of an AI\u2019s output is a combination of our intelligence with that of a computer program, and that\u2019s a beautiful thing.", "Your home for data science.
