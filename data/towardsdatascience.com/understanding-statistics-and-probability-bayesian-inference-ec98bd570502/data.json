It is a technique whereby the prior probabilities of an event are updated when the new data is gathered. Bayesian inference is a data-driven technique.", "The Bayesian models are traditionally one of the first models to use. They are used as the baseline models as they are based on the simplistic view of the world and enable the scientists to explain the reasoning easier. Consequently, Bayesian inference is one of the most important techniques to learn in statistics.", "This article will introduce readers to Bayesian inference. It\u2019s one of the must-know topics.", "This article will provide an overview of the following concepts:", "Bayesian inference is used in a large number of sectors including insurance, healthcare, e-commerce, sports, law amongst others. Bayesian inference is heavily used in classification algorithms whereby we attempt to classify/group text or numbers into their appropriate classes.", "Furthermore, it is growing in interest in banking and in particular in the finance sector.", "Before I explain what Bayesian Inference is, let\u2019s understand the key building blocks first.", "I will start by illustrating an example.", "Let\u2019s consider that I have a computer that stopped working. There are two computer engineers in my neighborhood who can fix the computer.", "Both of the engineers claim to have different techniques to diagnose and fix the problem.", "The first engineer has a model, made up of a mathematical equation. This model is built based on the frequency of an event. The model requires a set of inputs to compute the diagnosis of why the computer stopped working.", "The way the first engineer diagnoses the problem is by asking questions that the model requires as inputs.", "As an instance, the engineer would ask about the computer specification such as the operating system, hard disk size and processor name. He would then feed the answers to the model and the model would then give the reasons of why the computer broke down.", "The model will use the observed frequency of the events to diagnose why the computer stopped working.", "The second engineer has a slightly different mechanism to diagnose the issue. He also uses the same model that the first engineer was using but along with the model, he also takes advantage of the prior history of the event to diagnose the problem. Therefore, the engineer would ask the same questions as the first engineer does but he would also inquire about the prior history of the problem.", "As an instance, the second engineer would ask about the computer specification such as the operating system, hard disk size, and processor name. Additionally, he would ask questions about the historical history of the computer such as whether it has stopped working in the past and the reasons why it happened if known along with the number of times the event occured.", "The engineer would gather the appropriate history of that individual computer to get a better understanding of the problem. This technique is known as Bayesian inference. In a nutshell, in Bayesian inference, we use the prior history along with the known model to compute posterior results.", "The first engineer used the Frequentist approach and the second engineer used the Bayesian inference approach.", "The frequentist approach is not accurate with a small sample size as it is based on the observed frequency of positive events occurring whereas the Bayesian approach relies on the prior belief regarding the probability of an event occurring. Having said that, the frequentist approach is easier to implement and understand than the Bayesian inference and is typically used for large sample sizes.", "Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes\u2019 theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. Bayesian updating is particularly important in the dynamic analysis of a sequence of data.", "The technique of Bayesian inference is based on Bayes\u2019 theorem. Bayes\u2019 theorem can help us update our knowledge of a random variable by using the prior and likelihood distributions to calculate the posterior distribution.", "This brings us to the second part of the article.", "In simplistic terms, the Bayes\u2019 theorem calculates the posterior probability of an event. It uses the prior probability along with the likelihood probability of the event.", "Let\u2019s consider that we want to estimate how a target variable behaves. This target variable can be random in nature. Therefore, we begin by gathering data for the random sample. This data is our sample set with its own sampling distribution. As each sample has different data points, the distribution can help us quantify the errors in our sampling techniques.", "Once the samples are gathered and the experiments are performed, we can now use the Bayes\u2019 theorem to obtain new information to update our prior understanding.", "Bayes\u2019 theorem is a framework that enables us in calculating the probability of one event occurring given that the other event has already occurred.", "Bayes\u2019 theorem for two random variables A and B is:", "The above formula states that there are two events: A and B", "We are trying to find the conditional probability; the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred. This is known as the posterior distribution.", "2. Finally, we divide the joint probability by the probability of event B occurring.", "Bayesian inference derives the posterior probability. It assumes that the posterior probability is a result of two main inputs\u00a0(for\u00a0simplicity): a prior probability and a likelihood function. The likelihood function is derived from a statistical model itself. Bayesian inference computes the posterior probability according to Bayes\u2019 theorem.", "2. What we already have is P(B). This is the probability that event B has already occurred.", "3. Finally, P(B|A) is the likelihood probability. It is the probability that B is occurring given that A has already occurred.", "Every time we want to predict a random variable, we already have a prior known distribution. As an instance, we have a prior distribution that if we toss a coin a million times then the number of times we\u2019ll see heads is approximately 50%", "The goal of Bayesian statistics is to compute a posterior distribution.", "With the prior distribution, we use the Bayes theorem to obtain a posterior distribution. This is our updated understanding now that we have seen the data. Using the posterior distribution, we can summarise our understanding of the data.", "Bayesian inference is data driven because the prior distribution and the posterior distribution is driven by the data", "I believe in applying the concept to solve practical problems because only then we can understand the concepts thoroughly.", "Let\u2019s consider that you are training to run a 5km race within 25 minutes.", "You want to know the probability of achieving the target time for the run if you train in the gym.", "Let\u2019s use the Bayesian formula to find out the probability", "At a high level, we need four numbers", "Question: What is the probability of achieving the target time of running a 5km run within 25 minutes given you train in the gym?", "Therefore the question is to find P(R|T). We know it is calculated as:", "Let\u2019s consider that we work in a financial organization and want to find the probability of a bond X defaulting given that another bond Y has already defaulted.", "We can create a probability matrix to visualise the problem:", "It is really straightforward to solve using the probability matrix.", "Therefore there is a 50% chance that the bond X will default if the bond Y has already defaulted.", "Let\u2019s assume we know that we have X number of readers reading this blog on a daily basis. I want to calculate the probability that a reader is a Python developer given that he/she is a data scientist.", "Let\u2019s refer to A as a reader who is a data scientist.", "Let\u2019s refer to B as a reader who is a Python developer.", "What is the probability that a reader is a Python developer given that he/she is a data scientist?", "Therefore, we can start by collecting the required data for a day.", "There were 200 readers who read this blog today", "The question is then \u2014 what is the probability of a reader being a Python expert given that he also is a data scientist? P(B|A)", "We can compute a tree to visualise it:", "The probability is therefore calculated as:", "Therefore, there is a 25% chance that the reader is a Python developer given he/she is a data scientist.", "Lastly, I wanted to introduce the readers to the Naive Bayes model. Naive Bayes model is used as the benchmark/baseline model in most classification data science\u00a0projects,\u00a0in\u00a0particular\u00a0in\u00a0text\u00a0mining\u00a0projects.", "The model is probabilistic in nature. It is based on the concepts that I have explained above. Hence it uses Baye\u2019s theorem to calculate the results.", "The model is called Naive because its foundation is on an extremely simplified version of reality. It assumes that the features in the data are independent of each other given the class label. This assumption is not entirely true for most of the data set.", "As an instance, the features might be linked together. To explain, words like National History Museum or Buckingham Palace or White House or Black Day amongst others, have a completely different meaning when they are written together than when they are written separately in different sentences. Hence it shows that there is some form of dependence on the features.", "The Na\u00efve Bayes model assumes that all of the features are independent for simplificity. Sometimes a model that can be explained in more important than an accurate model that can\u2019t be explained", "The Bayesian models are traditionally one of the first models to use. They are easy to explain as they are based on the simplistic view of the world. Furthermore, the parameters are easy to understand. Hence why Naive Bayes classifier is seen as the baseline model.", "This article explained what Bayesian inference and Bayesian theorem are.", "In particular, it provided an overview of the following topics:", "Bayesian inference is used in a large number of sectors including insurance, healthcare, e-commerce, sports, law amongst others.
