The bad news is that since my audience is primarily data science enthusiasts, the other ~34% should know better than to fall for the conjunction fallacy!", "Besides yet another way for otherwise-intelligent people to misinterpret facts and let their prejudices run rampant, the conjunction fallacy is a classic example of cognitive heuristics (rules of thumb) gone wild.", "Option 2 gives you an extra opportunity to be wrong.", "The ideal heuristic would be to choose option 1 (Heather has a PhD) because option 2 (Heather has a PhD AND Heather owns a dog) gives you an extra opportunity to be wrong. The more opportunities you have to be wrong, the more caution you should apply. Unfortunately, not everyone uses that rule of thumb, preferring to jump to conclusions instead.", "The more elaborate you make your conclusion, the more flimsy it becomes.", "Statisticians and scientists are trained to appreciate that more elaborate conclusions require more evidence. Otherwise, the more ornate you make your conclusion, the more flimsy it becomes.", "The conjunction fallacy lets your prejudices run rampant.", "The question was never about whether Heather does or does not have a dog. Rather, it was about whether you realize that one conclusion is more elaborate than the other.", "The question was never about whether Heather does or does not have a dog.", "Since \u201cHeather has a PhD\u201d is part of both options, the question is essentially asking you, \u201cDoes Heather own a dog with MORE THAN 100% PROBABILITY?\u201d Probabilities live between 0 and 100%, so that is unpossible; you can be 1000% sure that the answer is no. When you logic it out, the answer is as obvious as P(A) \u2265 P(A \u2229 B).* If you\u2019re not used to this notation, I\u2019ve added a footnote below on how to read these hieroglyphics.", "The difference between a data newbie and a scientist is that the scientist comes to conclusions with extreme reluctance.", "The illusion that tricks you here is that whenever an elaborate conclusion fits your stereotypes, it can feel like the less elaborate option to you. Unless you\u2019re paying attention, you won\u2019t realize you\u2019ve sailed right past the complexity level your evidence justifies and now you\u2019re mostly clutching at straws. Newbie analysts are notorious for this, cheerfully sucking 200 extrapolations out of 10 data points until they\u2019re potty-trained by their more competent elders to follow the golden rule of analytics.", "Stereotypes + availability bias = jumping to conclusions", "The trouble is that when you don\u2019t logic it out, you\u2019ll fall back on your stereotypes. Stereotypical exemplars are easier to picture, so they might trigger a feedback loop with availability bias: \u201cthe easier it is to bring an example to mind, the more probability you assign to its category.\u201d", "Here are some examples of silly things that availability bias makes you say:", "(If you\u2019d like me to write an article explaining availability bias and why such statements tend to be wrong, retweets are my favorite motivation.)", "The conjunction fallacy adds insult to injury: your mind acts as though it is allergic to the idea that there may be exceptions to your availability-driven rules of thumb.", "Are you allergic to the idea that there may be exceptions to your rules of thumb?", "As a result, we behave as if there are more people in a category who fit our triggered stereotype than the total number people in that whole category. How can there be more PhD dog owners than PhDs? When you stop to think about it, you\u2019ll see that this reasoning is bizarre, but unfortunately we often don\u2019t slow down long enough to be surprised at ourselves.", "Your biases trick you into making excessively elaborate conclusions.", "Let me show you two more examples which I hope you\u2019ll resist falling for.", "Linda** lives in New York City. She had a nasty cough in March and had to take some time off work to recover. She wants to know if she had COVID-19 and gets tested for antibodies.", "Which is more probable about Linda?", "Now that you see the pattern, you\u2019ll notice that this kind of thinking is a lovely way for your brain to trick you into \u201clearning\u201d more than you did. Perhaps she got tested by a palm-reader. Perhaps her doctor used a test kit with an iffy sensitivity and specificity profile. (What are you assuming about the quality of current antibody tests?) Stay alert and have the discipline to stop yourself from appending that little conjunction to the information you\u2019re drinking in from your social media feed.", "Cassie loves art, theatre, and travel. She took history and humanities classes in college. She has a large collection of poetry books and spends many of her evenings composing essays.", "Which is more probable about Cassie?", "For those of you who got here without noticing the author\u2019s name, hi! Your author, Cassie, has a graduate degree in mathematical statistics, so I hope you won\u2019t hold her poetry collection against her.", "If you\u2019re wise, you\u2019d treat (1) as more likely than (2). The more cautious conclusion is always the safer one. If you can\u2019t keep your biases under control, you might not realize that you\u2019re being overconfident in concluding (2) based on prejudice instead of evidence.", "The more cautious conclusion is always the safer one.", "Whenever there\u2019s uncertainty, you are allowed to keep an open mind. No one forced you to take a stand on whether Heather has a dog or Cassie is good at math \u2014 the open-minded option was always made available to you. Each time, the question essentially asked whether you had enough evidence to completely discard other possibilities\u2026 and each time the answer should have been no.", "Don\u2019t feel compelled to jump to the most elaborate conclusion available! You are allowed to keep an open mind.", "Even if you think you have a decent rule-of-thumb, don\u2019t shoot yourself in the foot by forgetting that exceptions are possible. If you can\u2019t resist jumping to the most elaborate conclusion, the rapidly-ballooning margin of error on your worldview should be enormous! Don\u2019t blunder through life without ever adjusting for it.", "Even if you think you have a decent rule-of-thumb, don\u2019t shoot yourself in the foot by forgetting that exceptions are possible.", "The best habit you can give yourself is to remember that in addition to the two conclusions you learned to make in kindergarten \u2014 (a) something is true and (b) something is false \u2014 there\u2019s often a better option: (c) let\u2019s keep an open mind until there\u2019s overwhelming evidence.", "Coming to conclusions is only a virtue when evidence forces you into them. Flatfooted overconfidence is not something to be proud of.", "Alas, some of you will read this article and walk away not understanding why you were wrong to choose (2). If so, tossing out perfectly good engineering resumes with evidence of \u201cartsy\u201d interests is probably going to be relatively minor on your list of crimes against cognition.", "If you\u2019re keen to read more of my writing, most of the links in this article take you to my other musings.

Since that last bit can\u2019t be negative, (Heather has a PhD) is the more probable thing over all.", "Interested readers can find my casual intro to probability fundamentals here.", "The most famous demonstration of the conjunction fallacy is also called The Linda Problem, named after a classic example that Kahneman and Tversky used:", "Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.", "By now, I hope you\u2019ve managed to restrain your urge to answer that (2) is more likely than (1). If not, you\u2019ve missed the entire moral of the story:", "Wherever there\u2019s uncertainty, keeping an open mind is a solid habit. That way, you\u2019ll be wrong about fewer things in life.", "Some folks defended option 2 on account of a language misunderstanding, arguing that people would read option (1) as \u201chas a PhD and does not own a dog.\u201d I\u2019d counter that seeing things that aren\u2019t there is part of the problem. Again, no one is forcing you to jump to the more elaborate conclusion.
