In order to be prepared, surveys that try to determine the prevalence of the disease had been carried out recently. As of 4/25/2020, three COVID-19 antibody surveillance tests had been carried out in the United States:", "These numbers are astonishing. They translate into most of us should already have tens of direct acquaintances that have been infected by the COVID-19. Can this be true?", "Let\u2019s take a deeper look. The first author of the Santa Clara County survey preprint\u00b9, Eran Bendavid, is an associate professor of medicine at Stanford University. And the LA County survey\u00b2 is carried out by the University of Southern California. Both are reasonably reputable. However, as of 4/25/2020, the Santa Clara County survey is not peer-reviewed, and the LA County survey doesn\u2019t have a preprint yet. The NY survey has even less information. We know science is about facts, not reputations. So how can we make a quick judgment on the trustworthiness of these numbers?", "Let\u2019s first walk through the main idea of the Santa Clara County survey.", "The survey tested 3,300 people, and 50 of them turned out to be positive (crude prevalence rate 50/3300 = 1.5%). After adjusting for zip code, race, and sex to be more representative to the county population, they estimated the prevalence to be 2.49%~4.16%. Then they multiply this number by the population of Santa Clara County (~1.9 million) and concluded:", "These prevalence estimates represent a range between 48,000 and 81,000 people infected in Santa Clara County by early April, 50-85-fold more than the number of confirmed cases.", "Now you can see the preprint basically treat the test positives as if they are infected (real positives). Even though this seems intuitive, is this actually correct? Let\u2019s put it formally,", "Given a person is tested positive, what\u2019s the probability of this person being a real positive?", "Once we frame the key question, using the Bayes\u2019 rule is simple (\u201cP\u201d means positive, and \u201cN\u201d means negative in the following):", "Since sensitivity, specificity, and prior are defined as:", "We can expand the denominator by the law of total probability, substituting the above three terms, and then have the posterior estimate:", "For the prior, we can use the population prevalence as a starting point. The cumulative confirmed cases in Santa Clara County on 4/3~4/4 is about 1100\u00b3. Divided by the county population 1.9 million, we can get the prior of about 0.05%.", "Substitute these numbers into equation (1), and we will have", "That means, even if a person is tested positive, this person is still most likely negative!", "This result may seem counter-intuitive at first, shouldn\u2019t we expect a positive result indicating an infected person?", "Here is the key. The confirmed counts that we usually encountered in news is determined by an RNA-based \u201cdiagnostic test\u201d, not an antibody-based \u201csurveillance test\u201d. Other than the difference in sensitivity, specificity, and many other aspects, one major difference is in the test participants \u2014 the diagnostic test usually requires some reasons to suspect a person is infected, while the surveillance test participants are general public. In mathematical terms, the test participants\u2019 priors are different.", "For example, here is the diagnostic test guidance on the Illinois Department of Public Health website (as of 4/26/2020):", "Just think about many of your direct friends satisfied these requirements, you can estimate that the prior probability of infected among these diagnostic test participants is probably 100 times higher than the general public. Therefore, a positive test result from a diagnostic test participant indeed most likely indicates a real positive (existence of the virus).", "One may argue that the 0.05% prior above is too low because many real infected people didn\u2019t go to tests. This is a valid concern, so we can estimate the prior from a different way. For example, the test positive rate (given symptomatic person) is usually from 10%~30%\u2074. If we think a person with symptoms is 50\u2013100 times more likely to be infected, then we can come up with a 0.2%-0.5% prior. But even with a 0.5% prior, the posterior probability given a positive result is only 45%, or about the same as flipping a coin.", "Below is a plot of the probability of being a is real positive given a positive test result, at different prior and specificity levels. The prior from the Santa Clara general public is the dotted line on the left, and a prior from the diagnostic test participants would be somewhere on the right. Thus positive results from different participants have very different implications.", "Now it\u2019s clear that even if the Santa Clara survey\u2019s sample is representative of the population, its prevalence estimate is likely to be overstated by about 10 times. No wonder this preprint drew lots of criticisms from experts. Just as Andrew Gelman, a statistics and political science professor at Columbia University, wrote on his blog:", "\u201cI think the authors of the above-linked paper owe us all an apology \u2026We wasted time and effort discussing this paper whose main selling point was some numbers that were essentially the product of a statistical error.\u201d", "For the other two surveys in LA County and in New York State, the lack of information prevents detailed discussions. But from the results, they look similar to the Santa Clara County study. So we should doubt those results until further information is revealed.", "One may wonder, given a positive surveillance test result, if that person\u2019s chance of being real positive is so low, then what does the result tell us?", "My answer can be split into two aspects:", "2. USC-LA County Study: Early Results of Antibody Testing Suggest Number of COVID-19 Infections Far Exceeds Number of Confirmed Cases inLos Angeles County: https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/CALACOUNTY/bulletins/2877402?reqfrom=share", "4. The test data for California is unreliable. I took the 2 weeks data (3/22 ~ 4/4) before the Santa Clara project. The total number of positive is 10.7k, from about 101k total tests performed. So the positive rate is ~10.6%. Illinois test data is a little more reliable, and its positive rate fluctuates around 20% in that period.", "Your home for data science.
