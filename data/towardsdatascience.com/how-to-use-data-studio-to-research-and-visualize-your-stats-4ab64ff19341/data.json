Everyone should practice it \u2014 the more, the better. Sometimes, though, practicing data science is hard for beginners as it involves a lot of learning and playing with data, which might not always be user-friendly. In the worst case, your project has nothing to do with your day-to-day, making the motivation to complete it harder to come by.", "Inspired to turn the tide around for all the beginner data scientists, I devised a friendly introduction to Google Data Studio, using Medium Stats Data.", "Google Data Studio is an easy-to-use, free, and powerful tool for data visualization, which allows you to build dynamic and interactive reporting dashboards. It is widely used in many industries, amongst which digital marketing, so is useful to add to any young entrepreneur's toolkit.", "It\u2019s also quite fun to play with.", "So, in the following sections, I present a step-by-step Data Studio Tutorial for Data Studio enthusiasts, absolute beginners, and writers, who want to look at something nicer than a bland old stats table every month, week, day, or every few hours, if you have no self-control like me.", "To provide a brief overview, we will first scrape our data in a Google Spreadsheet, then import it in a Data Studio report, create a few calculations here and there, and visualize it.", "Medium Enhanced Stats is a Chrome extension that gives your total reach and summary stats of your articles (and responses).", "The best thing about it is that it allows you to download your data as a .csv spreadsheet.", "So, how can you get your Medium Stats?", "Click on the \u2018save\u2019 button to download your data.", "The easiest way is to go to Gooogle Docs\u2019 Spreadsheets URL and create a new spreadsheet.", "Next, import the Medium Stats CSV we downloaded a second ago.", "Select the Medium Stats .csv file from your device and upload it.", "Tune in the file import recommendations.", "Check whether the import has been successful, and add an extra column \u2018type\u2019, which will be used to demonstrate the content-type \u2014 response or article.", "Medium Enhanced Stats naturally splits up the data in articles (on top of the spreadsheet) and responses (at the bottom), so what you need to do is:", "Now, your spreadsheet is ready for import in Google Data Studio.", "Create a profile or log into Google Data Studio.", "Create a Data Studio Report. You might be asked to agree to the Terms and Conditions of Data Studio and tune in your marketing preferences.", "Now, let\u2019s add data to the report.", "Connect Data Studio to Google Sheets by giving the relevant permissions and authorizations for data access.", "Then, add your Medium Stats SpreadSheet.", "You will likely receive an additional warning that you are about to add the data to your report, but go ahead and click \u2018add data\u2019 once again.", "Your Medium Stats data is now in a Data Studio Report, ready to be visualized. Let\u2019s take a quick tour of the user interface and do some cosmetic prep for our report.", "One of the things I want to visualize is the ratio between the articles I published and the responses I have given to other articles.", "An easy way to visualize this is through a pie chart.", "We can create this by adding a chart, selecting the chart type, and choosing to display the \u2018type\u2019 column through it. Previously, we created two types of entries in the type columns: Articles and Responses, so these can be beautifully visualized now.", "In order to measure the total number of any of the given metrics, we must create a calculated field.", "To do this we will select the \u2018scorecard\u2019 chart type from the chart field.", "Then we can enter a formula, as illustrated in the image below.", "Now that we have our scorecards, let\u2019s visualize our top-performing articles.", "For this purpose, we can utilize the dimensions we just created for reads and views, and plot them against the titles.", "Insert a bar chart and select titles as the dimension. Then select the metrics you want to plot. I chose reads and views.", "Finally, it\u2019s very important to adjust the styling settings, so the chart is readable. For example, some things to note to achieve the displayed chart are:", "Add another bar chart to visualize engagement and fans to rank articles.", "This time we want to add a line chart.", "If you are following step-by-step, your dimension should already be set as the title, select the metrics upvotes and claps, and sort by upvotes.", "Next, go to the Style section and adjust the following settings:", "As a bonus, to improve the completeness of the report, add a footer, explaining how the data was extracted and from where.", "Use the Text function at the top to add titles to each chart and style them appropriately.", "Finally, go to the top-righthand corner to view your report.", "Here is how the final version of my report looks like.", "The best thing about Google Data Studio is that it is dynamic, based on the data provided. A simple refresh of the report page, if the connected spreadsheet has been updated with new data, will be enough to update the entire report view.", "In my opinion, this approach offers a much better user experience in visualizing Medium Stats and tracking our progress as writers on the platform.", "Another fantastic thing is reports can also be saved as templates and shared with others. If you are feeling like this year has been hard enough already, and you don\u2019t feel like learning Data Studio to better visualize your stats, here is a link to the report, introduced in this article, which can be downloaded and used as a report template. To do so, simply log into your account, open the link, copy the report, and use it as a template, which you can sync up with your Medium Stats data.", "While this is a very fundamental introduction to the capabilities of Data Studio, I trust there can be other insightful, as well as more advanced ways to visualize this dataset. Experiment and customize the template as you see fit.", "In future articles, I will show how to create multi-page reports, with data from other sources to demonstrate the relationship between earnings, engagement, reads, and views.", "(editor\u2019s note: The article promised has just been published.
