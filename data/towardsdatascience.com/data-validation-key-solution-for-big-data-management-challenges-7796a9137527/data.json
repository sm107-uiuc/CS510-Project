In this article, we will go over key statistics highlighting the main data validation issues that currently impact big data companies. The article\u2019s final aim is to propose a quality improvement solution for tech teams.", "Retail e-commerce companies continue to see a rapid growth of sales on a global scale. In 2019, the worldwide sales reached 3,535 billion U.S. dollars, and according to Statista, these numbers will nearly double in 2023 and reach as much as 6,542 billion U.S. dollars.", "As e-commerce continues to grow, so does the data stored. Data volumes in e-commerce alone will grow exponentially. Data Age 2025 report for Seagate forecasts the global datasphere to reach 175 zettabytes by 2025.", "However, only a fraction of data volumes gathered from competitors, and publicly available sources will be used for analysis. This is because e-shops receive non-standard data, whether it is from third party suppliers or even through their own-built scraping infrastructures. The data they usually collect is unformatted and in raw format, e.g., HTML, making it difficult to read.", "Our customers at Oxylabs face these challenges as well, as most of our e-commerce clients work with big data. This article aims to point out the main pain points of data management and offer a solution and a shortcut for any tech team that handles big data.", "Data management will be one of the biggest challenges of big data in 2020. Not only the amount of information that comes into an organization will be difficult to store and organize, but the influx of unstructured data streams will slow down any analysis processes, disrupting workflow.", "Data volume growth is not the only issue. Different data formats and their variations are growing as well. To give you an example, some websites provide dates in CSV format as YYYY-MM-DD, whereas others have a standard of JSON with MM/DD/YYYY format. This seemingly small difference can cause big mistakes when reading non-standardized data.", "When the scope is increasing faster than human resources can be added, automation must be considered to deal with such tasks. Nearly 90% of companies say they have automated some part of their data management process. This includes back-end in the form of analysis and reporting as well as front-end and data filtering. This is where our solution for data management, data validation, comes into play.", "Data validation is a method or a function that checks and adjusts your data (usually before importing and processing) for accuracy and quality. Depending on the validation option you use (we will go over different Cerberus validation options later in the text), it can be made into a custom validation that ensures your data is complete, contains distinct values and makes sure they do not get duplicated, and makes sure the range of values is consistent.", "Simply put, data validation allows you to perform analysis, knowing your results will be accurate. So what method or library can be used for a smooth data validation process?", "Cerberus provides powerful yet simple and lightweight data validation functionality. It is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for custom validation. Simply put, it is a validation library for Python.", "Please note that we chose Cerberus as an example because the validation schema is language agnostics (JSON) and can work perfectly fine with other languages, making it more flexible to various workflows.", "To validate your data using Cerberus, all you need to do is define the rules. This is done through a python dictionary object, called schema.", "Let\u2019s say you have JSON people dataset:", "And you wish to ensure its validity. The most basic schema you can define would look like this:", "Here we defined strict types for person data fields: name has to be a string, age has to be an integer and fictional a boolean. Additionally, we always want the name to be present as name-less people data is rarely useful. Once we got a dataset and schema, we can perform our validation in python:", "Here we created a Cerberus validator object. Now you can simply provide it with a dataset and schema, and run validate. If validation fails, the validator will show you error messages. Simple enough. Now let\u2019s see what sort of validation options Cerberus has in store for us!", "The first and most important sort of validation is __type validation__.", "It is a good practice to ensure that the dataset fields are the right type as invalid types can break the whole data workflow or worse, perform invalid actions silently. E.g., field `age` ends up being a float, instead of an integer. This could throw off all of your calculations without you even knowing.", "Next, we will validate value coverage and values themselves. For example, the `required` rule can be set to ensure the field is always present. A mixture of `forbidden`, `allowed` and `contains` rules can ensure strict value options.", "For the sake of an example, let\u2019s validate a recipe dataset:", "With that in mind, we can also add relationships to some relationship expectations. For example, if our recipe has a vegan version, we want to ensure it contains vegan ingredients:", "Finally, the most flexible and common value validation rule is regular expression patterns, which Cerberus supports as well. Going with our recipe example, we can further ensure that the title of the recipe starts with a capital letter:", "Cerberus offers a wide range of built-in value, coverage, and type validations and is easily extendable with custom rules. Let\u2019s add our own python function as a rule:", "Here, we ensured that preparation time is always an odd number (marketing told us odd numbers often sell better).", "There is only one thing left to validate \u2014 keys themselves. This is an important step, especially if you are not doing data interpretation yourselves, and provide the data to other services. For example, if the graph visualizer does not support uppercase letters, you should ensure the data has none:", "Here, schema validation ensures that all keys should consist only of lowercase characters.", "As we can see, Cerberus supports a wide range of validation rules, and by using a whole combination of them, we ensure that our data follows strict predictable formats for error-free data processing. Moreover, Cerberus can lend a hand with processing too.", "Sometimes we know that the dataset already has invalid values. For this exact reason, Cerberus provides an ability to process the data before validation.", "For starters, we can normalize the key format:", "Here, we ensured that all keys are lowercase strings.", "Going forward, we can also slim our dataset down by purging unknown keys, as datasets often come with meta keys and unimportant data:", "In this example, we got rid of unwanted animal types.", "We can also do the opposite \u2014 expand our dataset by setting default values for when values are not present:", "So, if the `dogs_or_cats` field has no value, we can directly assume that the value is a \u201ccat\u201d.", "Finally, we can mutate data any way we want by coercion by converting string numbers into integers:", "By combining these two Cerberus\u2019 features, validation and processing, we can always be sure to have a reliable data stream in a very pragmatic fashion. You will have one schema file for the data source that will be easily accessed, edited, maintained, and understood by anyone in the team.", "With the rising volumes of unreliably structured data, the need to manage and process data to make it readable is becoming increasingly essential to big data companies. Analyzing unstructured data can become a massive headache and slow down your workflow. By applying data validation solutions, such as Cerberus, you create a significant company life hack that saves resources, money, and time.", "Your home for data science.
