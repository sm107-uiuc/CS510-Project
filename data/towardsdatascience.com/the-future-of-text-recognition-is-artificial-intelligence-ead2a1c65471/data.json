These reasons made us need to find a way to digitalize physical papers in a way to be electronically edited, manipulated, searched, managed, stored, and especially interpreted by machines.", "Optical Character Recognition made it possible to convert text captured in images of typed, handwritten, or printed text into digitized and usable machine-encoded text.", "Optical Character Recognition is a field of research in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision that consists in extracting text from images.", "Today OCR is knowing an unprecedented revolution thanks to using Artificial Intelligence tools.OCR became not only an image-to-text traditional conversion process but also a human mistakes checker.", "An OCR tool can convert text captured in images into text usable by computers.", "The tool we will be talking about in this article is Tesseract.", "Tesseract is an open-source OCR engine written in C and C++ that was originally developed at HP between 1984 and 1994. Tesseract began as a Ph.D. research project in HP Labs, Bristol, and was a possible software/hardware add-on for HP\u2019s scanners. Commercial OCR engines of the day were weak and failed on achieving a satisfying accuracy. In 1995 Tesseract was in the top three OCR engines in terms of character accuracy. The engine was then sent to UNLV for the 1995 Annual Test of OCR Accuracy, where it proved its worth against the commercial engines of the time. In late 2005, HP released Tesseract for open source. It is now available at http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr.", "In 2006, Google began sponsoring and maintaining the tool and has since released updated versions of Tesseract with different architectures and support for over 100 languages.", "Version 4.0 of Tesseract uses a neural network system based on LSTMs and then improved astonishingly its accuracy. It is trained on 123 languages which made from Tesseract a great tool and a wonderful example of how Artificial Intelligence can engage in text recognition research.", "To access Tesseract via Python programming language we use the Python-tesseract package. Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google\u2019s Tesseract-OCR engine and provides an interface to the tesseract system binary.", "Let\u2019s begin by importing the Python-tesseract package.", "We import the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to process the image we want to apply OCR on.", "Image module is required so that we can load our image in PIL format. Pytesseract requires this format.", "We load our image using PIL.Image.open function", "Now we can apply OCR on our image using pytesseract.image_to_string function. This function returns the result of the Tesseract OCR run on the image to string.", "Let\u2019s print the text variable to see the result of the OCR", "We can see that we obtained perfect results. The pytesseract.image_to_string function extracted exactly the text captured in the image.", "The image we applied OCR on was clear but unfortunately, real-life situations are far from being perfect and images are usually noisy which makes getting a very clear separation of the foreground text from the background a real challenge.", "Let\u2019s try running Tesseract on a noisy image.", "We will extract text captured in this image as an example :", "We process in the same previous way. We load our image as a PIL. Image object and pass it to pytesseract.image_to_string function to extract text from it.", "You can see that the function returned an empty string because it didn\u2019t succeed in extracting the text from the image.", "We need then to preprocess our image!", "Here, I will suggest 3 methods you can use to improve the performance of Tesseract on noisy images. These tricks aren\u2019t trivial, and they highly dependent on the content within your image.", "A grayscale image is one in which the value of each pixel is a single sample representing only an amount of light. Grayscale images can then be the result of measuring the intensity of light at each pixel.", "A pixel in a grayscale image can be any value between 0 and 255. The image is then composed of 256 shades of gray.", "To convert a PIL image to grayscale we use :", "PIL.Image.convert method returns a converted copy of our image.", "Let\u2019s now load it and display it to see what a grayscale image looks like :", "Grayscale images look like black-and-white images, but they are different. One-bit bi-tonal black-and-white images, are images with only two colors: black and white. Grayscale images have many shades of gray in between.", "Now let\u2019s run Tesseract on the grayscale version of our image.", "We can see then that grayscaling the image improves the performance of Tesseract on it.", "In this method, we will extract text from our image by binarizing it.", "Image binarization is the process of taking an image and converting it to black-and-white, it then reduces the information contained within the grayscale version of the image from 256 shades of gray to 2: black and white, a binary image.", "We can binarize our image using :", "This makes a binary copy of the image and stores it in binary PIL.Image object.", "We save the copy, load it and display it :", "Now, let\u2019s run Tesseract on it :", "Hum, The results don\u2019t look like we expected. Why and how can we improve our binarization?", "The process of binarization works by choosing a threshold value. In the grayscale version of the image, pixels less than the chosen threshold value are set to 0 (black), and pixels greater than the threshold value are set to 255 (white).", "The results we obtained may be due to a bad value of threshold since we used the default function for binarization. Let\u2019s build our own function, a function to which we pass an image and a threshold value and it returns the result of binarization using the chosen threshold.", "1. Converts the image to grayscale", "2. Loops through the image\u2019s pixels,", "3. Compares the value of the pixel to the threshold: If the pixel is less than the threshold, it changes its value to 0(black), and to 255(white) if not.", "Now, let\u2019s run our function with different values of threshold and see how it affects the performance of Tesseract :", "Threshold= 0: We obtained a white image because all pixels in a grayscale image are included between 0 and 255. Tesseract then couldn\u2019t detect any text.", "Threshold= 64: We obtained a clear image where only the text is visible. Our function removed the noisy background from the image which made it easier for Tesseract to extract the text from the image.", "Threshold= 192: Our function covered a part of the text and the OCR run on the image returned an empty string.", "Threshold= 256: We obtained a black image because all pixels in a grayscale image are included between 0 and 255. Tesseract then couldn\u2019t detect any text.", "Sometimes, a bad Tesseract\u2019s performance can be due to the size of the image. Detecting text in a large or tiny image can be sometimes difficult. PIL has a special function to help you resize your images with a multitude of options and filters :", "This function returns a resized copy of this image.", "In this article, you learned about Google\u2019s Tesseract-OCR engine, how it began and how it contributed to making text recognition more accurate than ever. You learned also how to access Tesseract via Python using the Python-tesseract package. You also learned how to apply OCR on images and improve Tesseract\u2019s performance on noisy images. Now that you have all the basic skills, why not build a Scanner Mobile App that takes an image as input, runs OCR on it and write results to a text file.
