That\u2019s an absurd position for a professor of business ethics and moral psychology to occupy. And yet, at New York University where Haidt teaches in the business school, the students and administrators have banded together to create a helpline for students who are reeling from the politically challenging, morally complex, or otherwise offensive material encountered in class. Anonymity guaranteed. While the helpline intends to be a force for good \u2014 an always available pressure valve for students who are having their moral and political opinions challenged in the rubber-meets-the-road environment of high academia \u2014 this is not the Samaritans. The telephone operators are not encouraging listeners or volunteer befrienders, they are powerful administrators who dangle Damocles\u2019 over the collective heads of NYU\u2019s academic staff.", "The helpline is the most recent in a long line of social justice-type phenomena that Haidt has been studying for the past few years. Using his social science toolkit and his ethical kaleidoscope, Haidt has tried to understand: why pre-teen girls are committing suicide in record numbers, why student groups object so forcefully to the ideas of some visiting speakers that they refuse to allow other students to hear them, why his colleagues are getting fired for unintentional offences, and so on, ad naus.", "As any social scientist worth their salt would, Haidt has a theory about these phenomena. He believes that since the early 90s Western parents have been in the grip of a mass hysteria. Haidt thinks that oversensitivity to new ideas, the need for officially sanctioned protectorates, and the scary, northbound trajectory of self-harm are the result of anti-anti-fragile parenting. According to Haidt, the 90s saw the slow climb of child abduction rates cross the declining slope of the parent-to-child ratio, these metrics meeting at a critical point which was the perfect fulcrum for flipping parenting on its head. Kids were suddenly supervised at every moment for fear that something awful would happen to the basket containing all of one\u2019s literal eggs.", "This perennial bubble-wrapping certainly explains the emotive force of some of these phenomena. But is the eradication of unsupervised play the only prerequisite to a partisan and idea-allergic academy? Aren\u2019t there supposed to be other, non-parental forces that shape a child\u2019s principles and opinions?", "It used to be that parents had to concoct ruses of square-eyedness to dissuade children from watching the television (conditions that materialised at the beginning of the evening news and left children squinting with ocular concern at same). Now it seems impossible for a nuclear family to jointly watch a movie without interstitial screens arising at moments of boredom, tension building silence, non-comical montage, dialogue etc. What accounts for this change?", "There\u2019s no denying that early television was an attention ingesting monster, but it had to juggle. The broadcast networks operated on a meticulous rota of viewership/advertisement optimisation \u2014 switching from cartoons, to soap operas, to news and business programming with all the glissando of a well-oiled middle-American family.", "Starting in the mid-90s, a smorgasbord of devices were either invented or reduced in price enough to promulgate access to the internet. Desktop PCs, laptops, netbooks, smart phones, tablets. Familial attention was fractured with each successive generation of device. New media companies challenging the incumbents no longer had to worry about balancing the spinning plates of inter-generational entertainment, they could instead optimise for the user \u2014 the singular, irreducible owner of a particular screen. And, with the right combination of technologies, they could erect a TV network\u2019s worth of content for the enjoyment of one individual and they could do so at scale.", "But how does a nascent internet startup find out enough about you to construct a television network on your behalf? Extrapolation.", "It comes as no surprise to frequent users of the modern web that nearly every action you take on a site is recorded. Views, clicks, likes, and reviews are tabulated and stored in vast data centres. What may shock you, however, is the leveraging of these surface events to derive further details. Your income bracket, social status, marital status, age, race, and gender all a short statistical leap away. From here, it is mathematically straightforward to find those users most like you. With each of these data acting as a co-ordinate in a high-dimensional space, everyone is a point. And your viewing preferences and purchasing predilections are artefacts of the distance between them.", "The question of what you\u2019d like to see, what would keep you engaged, reducible to a set operation on the union of your and your neighbour\u2019s content history.", "The students Haidt encounters may well be molly-coddled, but this is not the fault of parents alone. Society has yielded its responsibility for socialisation to the internet without realising that every person\u2019s web is their own, far from exhaustive and insulatingly, narcotizingly familiar.", "What could be the expected outcome of pervasive personalisation but continuous reinforcement of pre-existing principles, especially when this personalisation begins in our formative years?", "Proponents of the internet claim as one of its major benefits the ability for anyone to construct a vehicle for individual expression and creativity, but what of the inverse ability? The ability to construct for oneself a bottomless channel of consumption within which none of our values are scrutinised?", "Does this framework of experience not necessitate that those with a depressive disposition will encounter ever-increasing levels of negative emotion as the walls close in on their personal internet? Does that internet not sound like the perfect antithesis to the cognitive treatments that are indicated by depressive episodes?", "Is tribalism not a natural outcome of the mathematical operations that govern what we watch and read for the majority of our waking hours? Will future generations remain stilled in uncompromising adolescent ideology or will we find another way to communicate? One that unifies and harmonises, one that transcends virality, one that exposes us to the difficult questions Homo Sapiens has pondered since time immemorial?", "Your home for data science.
