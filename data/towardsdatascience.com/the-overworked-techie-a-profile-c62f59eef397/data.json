The sun is making its way down below the horizon, and outside my living room window here in London the rush-hour traffic is easing into evening\u2019s slower pace. It\u2019s Friday night and I\u2019m sitting on the sofa, sipping a coke straight from the can. So, what am I up to? Reading a book? Watching Netflix? Of course not. I\u2019m writing this; a blog post to promote my business.", "But, I am not alone. The city is full of people who are either still working, or plan to work over the weekend, eight hours both Saturday and Sunday. According to a recent worldwide survey of almost 90k techies, more than one in twenty of them work more than 55 hours a week. At that level, you\u2019re working eight hours a day, seven days a week. And at that level, you\u2019re also at increased risk of having a stroke or a heart attack.", "Is it a generational thing? Are the millennials, with their #ThankGodItsMonday hashtags and hustle culture being worked to an early grave? When it comes to to techies, that isn\u2019t the case. Millennial techies are less likely to work more than 55 hours per week than any other generation. Even Generation Z is more likely to work more than 55 hours a week.", "Someone once told me that \u201centrepreneurs work their own hours \u2014 all of them.\u201d Indeed, freelancers and people who work for small businesses are more likely to be putting in long hours than others. A whopping 12% of techies who work for companies with less than ten people work more than 55 hours a week. But at the same time, that quote isn\u2019t true at all. At smaller organisations people are also less likely to work long hours with 40% of solo operators and 24% of those at smaller companies working less that 40 hours. When a company reaches 100 employees, the percentage of the overworked evens out at 4%. So it\u2019s not at the big corporates where people burn the midnight oil, it\u2019s at the startups.", "Whether you are expected to hammer on until your fingers are bleeding into your laptop\u2019s backlit keyboard or not depends on what country you live in. We took every country that had more than 200 responses in the survey and visualised every one that has a higher than average percentage of 55+ hours/week workers.", "Iran, China, Pakistan and India have techies that are most likely to be working long hours. If the 50\u201354 hours per week bracket is included, techies in Israel are also high on the list of hard workers. Eastern Europe also makes an entry with Poland, Bulgaria and Czech Republic working more than average.", "But what are these people doing all this time? They\u2019re either managers or in sales. Senior executives/VPs are by far the most likely to be working around the clock, with 26% of them working 55 or more hours per week, with full-stack and backend developers the least likely to be working so much.", "The fact that managers are the ones most likely to be working all these hours is reflected in the salary groups. Below is a chart that shows the distribution of respondents across salary brackets, on one hand for every respondent and on the other for those who work more than 55 hours per week. The hard working have a higher percentage in the top brackets, but slightly alarmingly they also have a higher presence in the lowest bracket (although this may reflect the location they are in).", "Even though I use the term \u201coverworked\u201d in this post\u2019s title, that word never appears in the actual survey. Respondents therefore did not get the opportunity to say whether they feel they are working too much or not. Those working long hours were more likely to be dissatisfied with their job and career, but only just. And unlike the average techie who says their biggest obstacle is a \u201cdistracting work environment\u201d, the hard workers say that the \u201clack of manpower to get the job done\u201d is their biggest obstacle.", "Another caveat is how the data is gathered. It\u2019s a self-selected survey and there are certain parts of the population that have a higher representation than others (like men vs. women). When respondents were asked how much they work, they could enter any number they wanted to and this resulted in some very high numbers, possibly because of a respondent misunderstanding the input form (no, person from Norway, you\u2019re not working 324 hours a week.) So, be careful when comparing how much techies work according to this survey to data gathered with other methodologies. But comparing numbers within this survey across different groups is perfectly valid. Even if there could be a lack of accuracy, there\u2019s no lack of consistency, so the comparisons should be valid.", "Composing this entire report from 90k lines of raw data took somewhere around four hours. Most of that time went into writing the analysis. How did we do the number crunching so quickly? We used an open source Python library we co-created with the market research company YouGov, called Quantipy. It makes it incredibly easy to deal with survey data, meta-data, and extract results quickly. We\u2019ll tell you more about that in future posts.", "Your home for data science.
