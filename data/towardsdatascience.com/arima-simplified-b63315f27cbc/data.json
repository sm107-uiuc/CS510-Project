It\u2019s obvious and easy to think of, that Sunday\u2019s price will be dependent on Saturday\u2019s price.", "Now let\u2019s consider the effect of Friday\u2019s price on Sunday\u2019s price", "As Sunday\u2019s price is dependent on Saturday\u2019s (2), which in-turn is dependent on Friday\u2019s (1), there could be an indirect transitive relation between price on Friday and price on Sunday.", "Aforementioned relations are visualised in the diagram below.", "Apart from these, there exists one more relation which might be difficult to imagine at first i.e. the direct effect of Friday\u2019s price on Sunday\u2019s price (3).", "This mutual relationship between day prices here, is called correlation. If values of two variables increase (or decrease) together then they are said to have a positive correlation. If the value of one variable increases and the other decreases (or vice versa) then they have a negative correlation.", "Correlation is an important concept of time series and it has 2 flavours,", "As we have considered the effect on Sunday\u2019s price based on the price 2 days prior(i.e. Friday)\u2026 the lag factor here is 2.", "Auto-correlation and Partial Auto-correlation are important to understand before moving on to ARIMA as they are crucial for selecting the right parameters for your model. You can find a good explanation here.", "Auto Regressive (AR) model is a specific type of regression model where, the dependent variable depends on past values of itself.", "This necessarily means that the current values are correlated with values in the previous time-steps. And more specifically, the type of correlation here is partial auto-correlation.", "The equation for the AR model is shown below", "The respective weights(\u04241,\u04242 \u2026\u0424p) of the corresponding lagged observations are decided by the correlation between\u2026 that lagged observation and the current observation. If the correlation is more, the weight corresponding to that lagged observation is high (and vice-versa).", "Notice the (p) in the equation\u2026", "This (p) is called the lag order. It represents the number of prior lag observations we include in the model i.e. the number of lags which have a significant correlation with the current observation.", "Moving Average (MA) model works by analysing how wrong you were in predicting values for the previous time-periods to make a better estimate for the current time-period.", "Basically, this model factors in errors from the lagged observations. The effects of these previous(lagged) observation errors, on the current observation, depends on the auto-correlation between them. This is similar in sense as the AR model which considers the partial auto-correlations.", "The \u03b5 terms represent the errors observed at respective lags and the weights (\u03c91,\u03c92 \u2026\u03c9q) are calculated statistically depending on the correlations.", "Notice the (q) in the equation\u2026", "(q) represents the size of the moving window i.e. the number of lag observation errors which have a significant impact on the current observation. Its similar to the lag order(p), but it considers errors instead of the observations themselves.", "MA model supplements the AR model by taking into considerations, the errors from the previous time-periods thereby helping to get a better estimate.", "When we combine the AR and MA equation we get", "The models we\u2019ve discussed so far (AR and MA) assume that the series is stationary. This is also means that \u201cstationarity\u201d is a necessary condition to take advantage of these models for any time series.", "Basically, for a time series to be stationary, it should satisfy the following 3 conditions\u2026", "In most cases, these conditions can be visually analysed by studying the plot against time.", "You will came across a lot of series which are clearly not stationary.", "Does this mean that forecasting cannot be applied in these cases ?", "Well\u2026this is where the sub-acronym I comes in\u2026", "Lets say, for example, you come across a series with a \u201cnon-constant\u201d mean. Its clearly observable that the mean increases over time i.e. the series is not stationary.", "If we could somehow eliminate this upward trend we\u2019ll be good to go.", "One way to do this is to consider the differences between consecutive timesteps. This is equivalent to performing a transformation of the form\u2026", "Applying this transformation we get the following trend with an observable constant mean. The standard deviation is constant as well and seasonality doesn\u2019t exist i.e. the series is now stationary.", "I stands for Integrated (though it has nothing to do with integration). It just means that, instead of predicting the time series itself we will predict the differences of the series from one time step to the next time step.", "Notice that here we have taken the first order difference i.e. a single phase of differencing of consecutive terms. This is could done multiple times to make the series stationary.", "This order of differencing (d) is an important parameter of ARIMA and determines the success of the model", "So to revise, the final ARIMA model will take the following form.", "ARIMA is a widely used forecasting models due to its simplicity and its ability to generalise for non-stationary series.", "Though, it\u2019s important to understand when to use ARIMA and when not to use it. ARIMA doesn\u2019t work well for seasonal type of data.
