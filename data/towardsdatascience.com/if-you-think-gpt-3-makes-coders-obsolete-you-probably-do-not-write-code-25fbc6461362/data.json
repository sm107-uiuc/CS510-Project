This makes it hard for anyone except larger companies to benefit from the underlying technology.- OpenAI", "OpenAI gave this as one of 3 reasons why the model is only available via API and was not open-sourced.", "It\u2019s huge. At 175 billion parameters, GPT-3 dwarfs GPT-2 which had \u201conly\u201d 1.5 billion parameters.", "Given the death of Moores Law, we won\u2019t see such models running on personal computers in the near future.", "That said, I see this as a temporary problem.
