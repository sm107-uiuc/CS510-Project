For every unit of demand which is not met, you have lost an order. For every unit of supply\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Here\u2019s a good question to write on a Post-it Note and put on your desk: \u201cWhat assets do we have right now that are not making money for us?\u201d \u2014 Bill Walsh", "For a micro-mobility company (aka \u201cUber for X\u201d), matching demand and supply is at the core of the business. For every unit of demand which is not met, you have lost an order. For every unit of supply which is idle, you are losing money on your vehicles.", "Normally, every micro-mobility company has a matching algorithm. But, how does that algorithm perform at different times of the day, days of the week, locations? Do they have a pattern? How do you analyze that?", "In this piece, we would delve deeper into supply-demand gaps for micro-mobility companies that have vehicles on the ground. Let\u2019s explore both these gaps in a lot of detail and understand how it relates to both monitoring and historical analysis.", "Monitoring helps to know what\u2019s happening on the ground right now and be proactive about it. The real world is very fickle and chaotic and your model always cannot accommodate these sudden changes.", "For example, when demand peaks or troughs beyond the average value (it could be rain, traffic, protests, local events, etc.) monitoring helps to understand where is the demand abnormally high and what can you do about it.", "While monitoring is good for these immediate, abrupt events, analyzing the patterns historically helps you understand these minute nuances of how areas behave (or rather, users or riders behave in certain areas).", "For example, you learn from your data that when the trip of the user ends in an area that is on the outskirts in the evening, it is likely not going to be picked up by another user \u2014 which means the ops team would have to pick it up!", "Let\u2019s take a scenario: At 8 pm on a Saturday, your users are dropping off at one of the localities with a bunch of pubs as there is a music concert.", "For the scope of this article, we can assume a dropped off user to be someone who didn\u2019t book a ride. A canceled user would mean someone who didn\u2019t opt for a ride after booking for the ride.", "Note: Dropoffs per unique user and per unique session are both important to look at. So, even if the user searches five times and drop-offs, he would be counted as only one.", "Some important metrics that you would want to monitor in real-time to be able to match your demand and supply together and for other tactical decisions:", "The aim of analyzing historically would be to find patterns in the mismatch and improve your model over time and take more strategic decisions. For example,", "Understanding flow for micro-mobility companies is super important. Which area is the most likely to get demand next? How far is that from where the drivers are currently?", "Profitability: Would the ride have been profitable? Maybe it was not a bad idea for the user to drop off the ride was not profitable.", "Your riders are in a residential area where they receive plenty of ride requests usually. However, you are not getting requests and hence, riders are idle whereas users might be dropping off in a commercial area.", "Note: Idle Riders and Rider Sessions are both important parameters to look at. This will help us understand whether the problem is with a particular set of riders (high number of riders sessions) or other parameters such as location or time (high number of idle riders)", "As discussed above, monitoring works well to know what\u2019s going on right now, especially in cases of anomalies.", "Historical analysis is primarily to understand the patterns in the inefficiencies.", "If you are a company that as a web app, you use web (or app) analytics products (like Google Analytics, Heap, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Clevertap) to get granular details of how users are performing. You create \u201cuser personas\u201d based on their tastes, preferences, and actions to personalize your strategies, which increases your engagement and retention.", "If you are a company with moving drivers or vehicles on the ground, getting visibility and analyzing how your different dimensions interact with each other on the ground becomes very crucial.", "If you could similarly create location personas or micro-markets based on how different areas perform, you could personalize your strategies, and make these micro-markets profitable.", "You get the full picture of what\u2019s happenning on the ground once you understand how your supply and demand behave together in conjuction to how certain areas perform as well.", "Once you know the characteristics of these gaps \u2014 when do they happen, where do they happen, how often do they happen and so on, here are all the things you can do to bridge them!", "In areas of high supply (which is not very mobile), you can focus on offline promotions and awareness activities. For example, setting up a hoarding in a residential area.", "You can create user personas depending on how they move and send contextual marketing promotions. For example, in office areas at 5 pm whenever it\u2019s time for snacks!", "If you discover the patterns in your demand and flow for different days, time and area, you can make your supply available and increase its utilization. For example, the operations team would redistribute vehicles at different times on different days.", "From the revenue side, you can make your pricing more location-based. From the cost side, you can identify the bottlenecks in the delivery journey and learn which steps in the lifecycle you spend the time and costs on.", "You can stay on your toes in case of an anomaly, for example, a sudden dip in revenues or orders placed. For instance, sometimes a local event happening somewhere can drastically affect your KPIs and you might need to react to that!", "The micro-mobility phenomenon definitely has the potential to disrupt the industry ( as per stats it is already disrupting ). The level efficiency of micro-mobility companies depends on how an organization manage and utilize their on-ground assets.", "Your home for data science.
