Organizations are trying to stay lean as it allows them to quickly change, adapt to newer technologies and drive innovation quickly. This brings in DevOps which is not new but has seen a lot of implementations in the last few years. DevOps is a philosophical approach for software development and operations. Its core lies in promoting collaborative culture, drive speed of innovation, and enable automated software management & delivery. One of the important pillars of DevOps is Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) that we will be discussing in this article.", "So the question comes in: why CI/CD? Organizations are becoming more customer-focused and data-driven. This has led to release more features independently and concurrently. Cloud service providers have added a lot of sweetness into it by providing serverless frameworks and many other lucrative cost-saving features. Point to note, only carefully designed frameworks results in actual cost benefits. Clearly traditional tools meant for software delivery are not able to catch up with a fast-moving \u201cagile development approach\u201d. This leads to the need for and evolution of CI/CD tools.", "Continuous integration refers to the build or integration phase of software release. It involves developers regularly merging their code into a central code repository which triggers build and tests. The goal of continuous integration is to find &fix bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software features. There are two important components:", "Automation \u2014 Automation of build & test process including recovering from failures. the intention is to make the CI process boring, simple, and fast. This means developers have more time to build new features, test and merge.", "Cultural and mindset shift \u2014 This is an important aspect of DevOps. Traditionally developers in a team used to develop code for a long period of time and merge changes to code repository in one shot. This makes merging changes difficult and time-consuming. There are more chances for integration failures and bugs remain for a longer time without a fix. This makes it harder to deliver software faster. On the other hand, frequent integrations mean fewer integration issues, and bugs are fixed immediately.", "Improve productivity: Free up developer bandwidth by automating manual steps in build and test. More frequent commit ensures code issues are fixed promptly.", "Fix bugs quicker: Frequent commit and testing ensures issues are found and fixed sooner before becoming a large issue.", "Faster and frequent release: Continuous integration helps the team to release more features frequently to production.", "Standardization: Testing code for standardized test cases including regression and integration tests ensures that code adheres to mandatory checks.", "Continuous delivery is an extension to continuous integration where code changes are automatically prepared in the form of build artifact ready for deployment. Ready-made artifacts can be deployed to test environments for further testing or deployed to a production environment. This whole integration ensures standardized code is tested thoroughly and is always deployment ready. It also ensures code integrity since the same code is deployed across different stages. Another benefit is the ability to deploy the same code across multiple machines with a single click.", "These two terms are often considered as same or confused. An ideal scenario is the developer committing code to the central repository which can trigger build & test pipeline and deploy changes automatically to production if no failures or issues. However, most of us know this is not exactly the way deployments work. Mostly manual approvals or sign-off are required before deploying to production.", "In continuous deployment \u2014 press one button to merge code to central repository and code will be deployed to production automatically if all stages in the pipeline are successful. On the other hand, continuous delivery requires manual approval. This does not mean continuous delivery lacks anything, but practically manual approvals are required pending sign-offs.", "Before proceeding further, I want to bring an important topic that comes under configuration management but modern CI/CD tools on cloud platforms are including this feature \u2014 Immutable infrastructure. Let\u2019s discuss it in brief. Upgrading applications or software on the same infrastructure is known as a mutable approach. An Immutable approach refers to building a new VM or separate infrastructure, upgrading to desired tech stack, and if everything is good then migrate to new VM and dump/recycle old infrastructure. Both approach has some pro and cons however if your use case needs immutable infrastructure then modern CI/CD cloud platforms services are supporting this approach as well.", "Automate software release process: Continuous delivery helps in deploying ready-made build artifacts from the continuous integration pipeline and deliver updates & features faster.", "Improve productivity: Helps teams to be more productive by freeing developers from manual tasks and encouraging behaviors that help reduce the number of errors and bugs deployed to production.", "Fix bugs quicker: Continuous delivery lets your team easily perform additional types of tests on your code because the entire process has been automated.", "Deliver features faster: Continuous delivery helps your team deliver updates to customers faster and more frequently. When implemented properly, you will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process", "Now we have discussed CI and CD individually so let\u2019s take a look into CI/CD pipeline. CI/CD pipeline is the process to automate the entire software delivery process. Right from committing code to central repositories, running test cases, building packages, and deploying code to test or production environment. There is no single order of setting up CI/CD pipeline however based on the deployment model your organization is choosing there will be best practices.", "CI/CD is more like plug and play. It has different components that can be used in any manner. There are many open-source and paid services that can be used individually for each stage listed above. As an example, below is one form of pipeline", "Commit change -> Trigger Build -> Build -> Notify of build Outcome -> Run tests -> Notify of test outcomes -> Deliver build to environment -> Deploy where necessary", "Don\u2019t get carried away: There are so many tools and features available in the market, the majority of which may not be required for a particular use case. So brainstorm what best suited for your software delivery and implement associated components only. If there is a particular section like unit testing which is not stable and has more issues, then automate that process once it is matured else you will end up spending more time then benefit to automate it.", "Don\u2019t build huge scripts: Don\u2019t build huge testing scripts; rather build small scripts with defined functionality and reuse it across your pipeline as in when required.", "Run Local unit test cases: Run test cases locally on the developer machine for business-specific scenarios before pushing to the central repository. It provides extra verification layer and ensures less integration issues.", "Build pipeline centered around process and not tools: This is an age of disruptions. Software delivery services are improving very rapidly. Tools that are good today may not be sufficient tomorrow (like in a few years). So build architecture in such a way that you remain independent on tools. Try to build code repository on cloud platforms which give unlimited secured storage. The major benefit is this keeps the data at a central repository away from compute devices and makes it very easy if you want to transition to new services and software.", "Position the right component at the right place: Based on the use case place the right stage at the right place. The goal must be to save time by placing high failure pipeline components closure to start. For example, you may want to package first and then run multiple test cases in parallel.", "Avoid building in house CI/CD: There are plenty of open source and paid services at reasonable costs. The main goal of CI/CD is to free up the bandwidth of developers and use it for things that matter most. In house solutions will need upfront investment and extensive maintenance. The pipeline goal should be to make CI/CD seamless.", "Use cloud-native services: Major Cloud providers like AWS and Azure provide flexibility to choose native or popular services to build a complete CI/CD pipeline. Additionally, go serverless as far as possible to avoid maintenance costs and focus on outcomes.", "In this article, we discussed CI/CD, benefits, myths and pitfalls to avoid.
