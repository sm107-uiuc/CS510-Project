Someone overheard two people talking about Deep Learning and let me know every little detail. One of them was totally against deep\u2026."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["For privacy I\u2019m calling the first person Mr. A (the \u201chater\u201d) and Ms. B (\u201cthe expert\u201d).", "Mr. A: Hello B! How are you?", "Ms. B: Just great A! Great to see you. I wasn\u2019t expecting to see you in a Deep Learning conference.", "Mr. A: Yes, I came to see what these crazy people were talking about, and I was right. Deep Learning sucks. It\u2019s just the same old thing I studied in the University about Neural Nets, now you add more layers and that\u2019s it! Nothing interesting to see.", "Ms. B: Wow, that\u2019s a big statement, I\u2019m sorry you see things like that. Actually Deep Learning is just a brand for what\u2019s it\u2019s going on in the AI world. You could call it a \u201chype\u201d but there are very important developments there. Do you want to come to my computer? I\u2019ll show you.", "Mr. A: I don\u2019t the point but well, I have no other place to be right now let\u2019s go.", "Ms. B: So, let\u2019s start from the basics, what do you know about deep learning?", "Mr. A: I\u2019ve read that they are some algorithms that mimic the way our brain works, that\u2019s where the name \u201cneural nets\u201d come from, our brain. And they found a way of abstracting that into math, calculus and code. Then with it, the systems can learn like we do, or so they say, using these old school neural nets to solve some problems the system is presented to. Oh and by the way, they have no clue on how to interpret their models, is just another black box.", "Ms. B: Ok. I think you maybe reading some weird stuff about Deep Learning. I\u2019ll start with the basics. In the context of Machine Learning, the word \u201clearning\u201d describes an automatic search process for better representations of the data you are analyzing and studying. Looks at this example I found on the web:", "Let\u2019s say I tell you I want you to drive a line that separates the blue circles from the green triangles for this plot:", "Mr. A: What\u2019s the definition of line again?", "Ms B: Let\u2019s say is straight one-dimensional figure that has no thickness and extends infinitely in both directions.", "Mr. A: Ok in that case this is an impossible task. I can\u2019t put a line there.", "Ms. B: And, what would you say if I present this picture now, and ask you to do the same:", "Mr. A: Oh that\u2019s very easy, just a line in the middle. But that is cheating, this is a different dataset. The line would go like this:", "Ms. B: Great, but this is actually the same dataset I presented before.", "Mr. A: What? Nope, the other one was like in a circular form, this is different.", "Ms. B: I\u2019ll explain it to you. In this case what I did a coordinate transformation, so we can plot or represent this data in a way we can draw this line. The data is the same, but the representation was different. And it happens that in the new representation it was a straightforward task to draw that line.", "Mr. A: Ok I see what you mean. But what does this have to do with Deep Learning? Or Machine Learning?", "Ms. B: Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. But a very specific subset, inside of Representation Learning. Deep Learning enables us to create a system, a program, that can search for different representations (in this case a coordinate change), and then find a way of calculating the percentage of categories being classified correctly, when we do that, we are doing Deep Learning and of course Machine Learning.", "Mr. A: That sounds fancy. But what about the old fashioned neural nets we saw decades ago? Why are there so important now? And what is their role in Deep Learning?", "Ms. B: That\u2019s a very good question. We can define Deep Learning as representation learning using different kinds of neural networks and optimize the hyperparameters of the net to get (learn) the best representation for our data. But why neural nets? They are very flexible, and let us find useful representation of highly non-linear data, like the one I showed you before. The concept is not new, but the tools we use now to build them are very different from the past. They have all the great advances in the AI and Machine Learning world.", "Mr. A: They are the same neural networks, but the only difference are the tools? Like programming languages?", "Ms. B: In part that\u2019s true. But there\u2019s much more. Until the late 2000s, we were still missing a reliable way to train very deep neural networks. We had been working on the theory for years, but now, with the development of several important theoretical and algorithmic improvements, the advances in hardware, and the exponential generation and accumulation of data, Deep Learning came naturally to fit this missing spot to transform the way we do machine learning. The modern languages allowed us to program these theoretical part, and with distributed computing and the power of big data, we managed to create this revolution.", "Mr. A: That sounds very interesting. What are these theoretical advances and improvements you mention?", "Ms. B: They come from years of investigation all around the world. Some from big Universities, or companies, but there are great contributions that came from the open source world too. Without all these fancy grants and stuff. I actually found a timeline that can help me explain this to you. Take a look:", "You are right, this is an old theory. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not relevant anymore. From there I can say the ideas of Back Propagation, better initialization of the parameters of the nets, better activation functions, the concept of Dropout, and some types of networks like Convolutional Neural Nets, Residual Nets, Region Bases CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks and Generative Adversarial networks, are one of the most important advances we made in the Deep Learning world. I wish I could have time to explain all of them to you, but sadly I have to run to the next conference!", "Mr. A: Ok now I think I understand better what this \u201cDeep Learning\u201d thing is all about. You never told me the meaning of the words Deep Learning.", "Ms. B: You are right! The Deep in Deep Learning isn\u2019t a reference to any kind of deeper understanding achieved by the approach; rather, it stands for this idea of successive layers of representations. Like this:", "And the learning is what I told you before, it\u2019s an automatic search process for better representation for the data we have, with the goal to understand patterns, make prediction and model the world around us.", "Mr. A: Thanks B! Before leaving me, can you please suggest some good reading about the subject?", "Ms. B: Sure! I\u2019ll have a document with that, let me find it \u2026 here it is! Please write them down and lock the door after you exit. Great seeing you! Talk to you soon!", "Thanks for reading this. I hope you found something interesting here :)", "If you want to contact me make sure to follow me on twitter:", "Your home for data science.
