So many people are jumping with the fake idea that it\u2019s just about running 10 lines of python code, and expecting things to work by magic in any situation. This blog post is about all the things I learned the hard way. Hope it saves you some good time falling for the same mistakes.", "Machine learning is like any scientific field: it has its own rules, logic and limitation. Believing that it\u2019s some sort of black magic doesn\u2019t help to improve your ML skills. This belief will stand against your scientific curiosity needed to understand how each model/layer type works. Believing it\u2019s magic is a lazy way to convince yourself why you don\u2019t need to understand the mechanics running behind.", "The only magical thing about ML is that there is no magic behind. It\u2019s based on pure logic, math, and of course on some randomness and luck\u2026", "Starting with a real world data set, full of problems and noise won\u2019t help you in the quest of understanding. Instead of that, generate some ideal fake datasets. For example, start by creating a list of random x, and a list of y=3x+2 and test how a dense layer will learn the weight 3 and the bias +2.", "This allows you to reverse engineer the mechanics behind back-propagation, the different optimizers, the different initialization methods, and see if the model is converging fast enough. Reverse-engineering is a fun way to understand how things are working without going into the complex mathematical details. (But if you can, why not!)", "Whenever trying to solve a new type of problems, try to think first if there is a way to generate first an ideal, noiseless, fake dataset in order to check which type of layers or ML models will solve easier this challenge. If a model couldn\u2019t solve this fake/easy challenge there is even no point in trying it on a harder noisy dataset.", "Throwing immediately the full dataset into a model and waiting hours before getting a first result, is counterproductive. Instead better start with a small subset of the data and experiment with the different models first. Once you get an initial first result, then you can go big-data.", "Understanding your dataset is a key point and main ingredient of success, cleaning data is one of the most important step in ML. Finding out problems in data collection, storage, frequency rate, are important. Visualizing the dataset can help identifying many problems. Does the data contain lots of missing values? How to replace them? Is the data sampled at the same rate? Does the features need normalization? Are the features independent? Do we need to run PCA first? Perhaps the most important principle in data science is the following:", "A dataset with 100 features where all the features are linearly correlated can be reduce efficiently to only 1 feature with no data loss. Understanding the difference between features and dimensions help a lot to reduce the complexity of dataset.", "Neural network are famous in their ability to cheat and lazily learn things we don\u2019t want them to learn it. For instance, If there is a large difference between classes, let\u2019s say 99.99% of mails are not spam and 0.01% are spam, then there is high chance that the neural network will lazily learn to classify non-spam all the time. Another problem is the data-leakage:", "Any feature whose value would not actually be available in practice at the time you\u2019d want to use the model to make a prediction, is a feature that can introduce leakage to your model.", "When the input data you are using to train a machine learning algorithm happens to have the information you are trying to predict \u2014 Daniel Gutierrez, Ask a Data Scientist: Data Leakage", "So be sure that there is no easy way to cheat and find an easy but meaningless correlation between inputs and outputs.", "I got inspired for this point after watching this video about the Marshmallow challenge:", "The lesson is not to assume that your initial idea of model will work, and you might be mistaken with your assumption, the faster you discover that, the faster you might try something else without losing much time, reaching deadlines or paying hefty cloud compute bills before discovering the truth.", "Having a ground model that works good enough quickly is a key-point, the remaining time can be spent to improve the result and updating the record for the best model \u201cso-far\u201d. But the key is not to wait till the last moment before validating the result.", "It\u2019s very tempting to be proud of a model with a 0 loss in the training phase. However it might not be the optimal model for a real world. This is a well known problem of over-fitting", "Don\u2019t use directly a bi-directional LSTM variational auto-encoder with attention mechanism model, if your problem can already be solved using simply one linear dense layer.", "Tensorflow is powerful, but you might not be", "It\u2019s always better to start with simple models that you can understand and control first, then increase in complexity gradually to check if the complexity brings any added value or not. Remember that at the end, the more complex the model gets, the more data will be needed in order to truly validate that the model didn\u2019t overfit.", "A good rule of thumb is to keep a track of the number of parameters in a model vs the data set size. If your model parameter number get bigger than your dataset size, this should trigger an automatic warning!", "The objective of machine learning is to reduce the loss function. In many cases the default ones (RMSE, LOGLOSS) are enough. But many people are scared to define their own loss functions for some specific problems.", "Loss functions can be seen as the punishment or reward you want the ML model to achieve. So if you want the ML model to converge to a specific behavior, you can do so by creating a loss function that rewards this behavior while punishing the misbehavior for your specific problem and specific dataset.", "The best investment for machine learning is in knowledge, the more you understand what is the abstract role of each layer, the mechanics behind each function, the limitations, the easiest it will be to create a model faster.", "The second best investment, is in a dedicated hardware for machine learning. A 300$ GPU can accelerate up to 20x the training workload, meaning a one day job can be reduced to one hour, and the same data scientist engineer can try 20x more models within the same duration.", "Never, ever underestimate the importance of having fun.", "If you enjoyed reading, follow us on: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn", "Your home for data science.
