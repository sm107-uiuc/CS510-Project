This has been causing less traffic in cities, and some industries temporarily have not been polluting the air. From this, we can guess that air pollution in cities has decreased.", "To check this hypothesis, I analyzed the pollution data for my home city Ljubljana, Slovenia. To additionally support the assumptions, I took the pollution data for Bergamo, Italy, which is one of the most affected European cities by the coronavirus.", "I this article, I compare measurements for two pollutants that have a major impact on health according to the World Health Organization. Nitrogen dioxide (NO\u2082) in cities is mainly produced by traffic. PM10 are fine particles with a diameter between 2.5 and 10 micrometers. WHO also mention PM2.5 (particles with a diameter fewer than 2.5 micrometers), but I could not get data about PM2.5 for Ljubljana. I retrieved all data from the European Environment Agency\u2019s database.", "In the figures below, I plot the averaged daily concentrations of NO\u2082 and PM10 for Ljubljana for the last four years. Each year is presented with a different color.", "For NO\u2082, we can see that values for last month (in 2020) are lower than in previous years, but those graphs are challenging to read since concentrations vary between days. I used the moving average to get a smoother graph.", "We can see that concentrations of NO\u2082 after the middle of March \u2014 when our government placed restrictions \u2014 are lower than in previous years. For PM10 concentrations remain similar to the previous year \u2014 for some time at the end of March, it was even higher because of Sahara sand that wind brought up to Europe.", "The explanation of why the concentrations of NO\u2082 are lower than previous years can be the fact that the main source of NO\u2082 is internal combustion engines burning fossil fuels \u2014 traffic. On the other side, PM10 comes from more different sources, including power plants, industries, and also traffic, which can be the reason that PM10 did not change \u2014 the burning season is still on, and many industries did not stop with production.", "To make sure that our results correlate with the COVID-19 lockdown, we checked the data for another city, which has been affected by the pandemic \u2014 Bergamo in northern Italy. It is one of the most affected cities by the COVID-19.", "For Bergamo, I again plot daily averages for the last four years at the graph, since they are not completely clear I performed smoothing like for Ljubljana\u2019s data.", "We can observe a similar trend in the NO\u2082 graph for Italy than before for Ljubljana. Italy placed its restrictions in the northern part of the country at the end of February. At the same time, NO\u2082 concentrations started to decrease compared to other years. The difference comparing to other years is even more significant than in Ljubljana \u2014 the concentration halved comparing to other years. There is no difference in PM10 concentrations. I also analyzed PM2.5 concentrations for Bergamo, and they \u2014 similarly than PM10 \u2014 do not differ compared to other years.", "From the data presented in this story, we can conclude that air quality in observed cities has improved. There is a huge change in NO\u2082 concentrations, which shows that pollution produced by traffic decreased significantly, while particles (measured as PM10 and PM2.5) still stay at the same level. Based on references, I can conclude that this is because many sources of particles persist \u2014 including burning fossil fuels for heating.", "The consequences of the COVID-19 are devastating and will bring a big change in our future living. However, we must admit there are also some positive sides. One of them is also seeing how the Earth is getting healed. The cleaner air we\u2019ve been breathing in the last few weeks is one of the positive things that can change very quickly again if we go back to the same tracks as before.", "Your home for data science.
