A straightforward definition is that time series data includes data points attached to sequential time stamps. The sources of time series data are periodic measurements or observations. We observe time series data in many industries. Just to give a few examples:", "Advancements in machine learning have increased the value of time series data. Companies apply machine learning to time series data to make informed business decisions, do forecasting, compare seasonal or cyclic trends. Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN produces a great amount of time series data with measurements on sub-atomic particles. So, it is everywhere. Handling time series data well is crucial for data analysis process in such fields. Pandas was created by Wes Mckinney to provide an efficient and flexible tool to work with financial data. Therefore, it is a very good choice to work on time series data.", "Time series data can be in the form of a specific date, time duration, or fixed defined interval.", "Timestamp can be the date of a day or a nanosecond in a given day depending on the precision. For example, \u20182020\u201301\u201301 14:59:30\u2019 is a second-based timestamp.", "Pandas provides flexible and efficient data structures to work with all kinds of time series data. Following is a table to show basic time series data structures and their corresponding index representations:", "For any topic, it is fundamental to learn the basics. Rest can be built-up with practice. Let\u2019s explore time series data functionalities of Pandas. As usual, we import the libraries first:", "The most basic time series data structure is timestamp which can be created using to_datetime or Timestamp functions:", "In real life cases, we almost always work sequential time series data rather than individual dates. Pandas makes it very simple to work with sequential time series data as well. For example, if we pass multiple dates to to_datetime function, it creates a DatetimeIndex which is basically an array of dates.", "We don\u2019t have to follow a specific format to input a date. to_datetime converts dates in different formats to a standard format. It may not seem convenient to create a time index by passing a list of individual dates. There are, of course, other ways to create an index of time.", "We can create an index of dates using a date and to_timedelta function:", "\u20182020\u201302\u201301\u2019 serves as starting point and to_timedelta creates a sequence with specified time delta. In the above example, \u2018D\u2019 is used for \u2018day\u2019 but there are many other options available. You can check the whole list here.", "We can also use date_range function to create time index from scratch:", "Default frequency is \u2018day\u2019 but there are many options available.", "Note: \u2018M\u2019 indicates the last day of month while \u2018MS\u2019 stands for \u2018month start\u2019.", "We can even derive frequencies from default ones:", "Pandas also provides period_range and timedelta_range functions to create PeriodIndex and TimedeltaIndex, respectively:", "We\u2019ve learned how to create time series data but there are many other operations that Pandas can do with time series data. I will also cover shifting, resampling and rolling time series data.", "Time series data analysis may require to shift data points to make a comparison. The shift and tshift functions shift data in time.", "The difference between shift and tshift is better explained with visualizations. Let\u2019s first create a sample DataFrame with time series data:", "Then we can plot original data and shifted data on the same figure to see the difference:", "Another common operation with time series data is resampling. Depending on the task, we may need to resample data at a higher or lower frequency. Pandas handles both operations very well. Resampling can be done by resample or asfreq methods.", "It will be more clear with examples. Let\u2019s first create time series data for year.", "asfreq(\u2018M\u2019) returns the value on the last day of each month. We can confirm by checking the value at the end of January:", "resample(\u2018M\u2019) creates bins of months but we need to apply an aggregate function to get values. Let\u2019s calculate the average monthly values. We can also confirm the result by comparing the average value of January:", "Rolling is a very useful operation for time series data. Rolling means creating a rolling window with a specified size and perform calculations on the data in this window which, of course, rolls through the data. The figure below explains the concept of rolling.", "It is worth noting that the calculation starts when the whole window is in the data. In other words, if the size of the window is three, the first aggregation is done at the third row. Let\u2019s apply rolling with size 3 to the DataFrame we created:", "If you\u2019d like to learn more about time series analysis, here is a list my related posts:", "Predictive analytics is highly valuable in the data science field and time series data is at the core of many problems that predictive analytics aims to solve. Hence, if you plan to work in the field of predictive analytics, you should definitely learn how to handle time series data.", "Thank you for reading.
