The last large-scale FIFA survey in 2006 counted 265 million male and female players, a number that had been growing at an average rate of 1.5% per year since 2000 (here). For many, playground football was/is a staple. From the playground to the pitch, choice of playing position is usually a mix of trying to emulate your favourite professional player, figuring out which spot you enjoy or simply going along with what your coach says.", "Why isn\u2019t there a quantitative, smarter way to make this decision? What can we learn by investigating the attributes of professional players? Can we utilise physical attributes to make suitable playing positions obvious?", "Goal: Create a model to recommend a playing position based on physical attributes.", "This task fits the framework for classification via the linear techniques introduced in part 1. Namely, Linear Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and *new* Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR).", "I\u2019m a fan of learning by example so while this is technically part 2, I encourage you to use part 1 as a reference for the mentioned techniques rather than a strict precursor. This article is food for the curious. It was fun to write and fun to code so enjoy!", "#0 \u2014 Multinomial Logistic Regression Classification", "Before getting stuck in, we introduce the final technique used. The Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) classifier.", "MLR is the multi-class extension of Logistic Regression which models the relationship between input variables and a binary output variable by estimating probabilities using its underlying logistic function. Let\u2019s break this down.", "\u201c\u2026models the relationship between input variables and a binary output variable\u2026\u201d \u2014 This is a common task. One example could be relating pass/fail outcomes to hours studied/sleep/exercise. This type of problem is no different from what we have seen in part 1.", "\u201c\u2026by estimating probabilities\u2026\u201d \u2014 This is semi-new. Statistical theory tells us that the best estimation of our output variable is an expectation given all information (regression function). For a binary (0/1) output this expectation simplifies to a probability (the posterior probability). Linear regression, LDA and QDA use this property loosely to discriminate between classes but none of these methods place emphasis on probability estimation. Contrastingly, probability estimation is the heart of logistic regression.", "\u201c\u2026using its underlying logistic function.\u201d \u2014 This is definitely new. The logistic function makes estimating probabilities easier! How? In a typical binary classification problem, we expect our output to be 0 or 1. We get here by estimating a probability (between 0 and 1) and then picking a threshold any estimate over which is declared as 1 and else 0. Predicting this probability is a difficult problem partly due to the confined range of values taken (0 to 1). The logistic function is, therefore, drafted in to transform our probability to log odds. Crucially, this means we go from trying to predict a number between 0 and 1 to predicting a number with an unrestricted range (negative infinity to positive infinity)! Why does this help? We can now model our augmented output variable as a linear combination of inputs, i.e. using linear regression form, and reverse the transformation to return probabilities when predicting. Neat!", "Formalising our question into a statistically friendly objective, we look to solve a multi-classification supervised learning problem. To do so we need data and specifically require that our dataset provides:", "We look to perform our analysis on a dataset of professional players. Of course, physical qualities have been developed due to the position played but we still should be able to identify an \u201cideal\u201d stencil. The assumption here is that us amateur players are relatable to the professionals.", "I\u2019m going to make a leap right now and choose to use the FIFA19 video game dataset (found here). The assumption here is that the FIFA19 dataset is a fair proxy to real-life. I think if this was not true, the game would not be near as popular as it is. Other than leveraging EA\u2019s data collection, aggregation and analysis (discussed here and are based on real-world performance), the immediate benefit is that the dataset provides a single value per attribute. This simplifies analysis massively but does require that any new observation be calculated in the same way.", "#2 \u2014 Slide Tackling the Dataset", "Before we get to model prediction, let\u2019s clarify a few things:", "Eyeballing the full dataset in Figure 1, there does not appear to be any clearcut boundaries for each class. However, we do observe that the spread of data for centre backs is the smallest and largest for central midfielders.", "A potential issue in training a model on a partition of the dataset is introducing unexpected bias. We, therefore, expect the test set to look similar to the training set \u2014 which it does. The number of players in each position is also relatively well balanced as shown in the bar chart in Figure 2 below.", "Jumping straight in, Figure 3 shows the decision boundaries for Linear Regression, LDA, QDA and MLR. While the test dataset was cloudy in the sense that no classes were immediately obvious, all four methods predict disjoint (non-overlapping) classes. Question: Can we develop a classifier that predicts overlapping classes?", "The flexibility of the QDA model is immediately obvious. The freedom from a constant variance assumption significantly changes the class prediction boundaries moving from LDA to QDA. Question: The QDA boundary is different but is it better?", "All four models are consistent in terms of classification region for central midfielders with a clear difference in striker category. Question: Is it really true that strikers posses the middle ground in strength and stamina attributes?", "Let\u2019s put some numbers to our visual inspection. Table 1 shows some descriptive statistics about the predicted classes. Next to each method are the centroids for each class. In this case, the centroids represent the average strength and stamina pair for a player in each position category as predicted by that method. We aren\u2019t expecting to match the dataset average exactly but are looking for model averages that diverge from the true dataset averages. This is not an all-encompassing evaluation metric but it does provide a ballpark measure of how well a method recognised distinguishing attribute values for each class and more interestingly which classes were difficult to capture.", "From the table, we make the following observations in comparison to the dataset averages (with their spatial interpretation in relation to Figure 2 in brackets):", "But this is inconsistent with our visual observations! Firstly, the orange central midfielder position class does not appear to be representing the true dataset correctly despite the orange area being visually consistent in each model plot. Secondly, the table suggests that the green striker position class does represent the average characteristics of the true dataset despite covering very different regions in each model plot.", "Time to delve into formal model diagnostics.", "Evaluation of model predictions can be done by assessing the different classification rates. We do this via a confusion matrix. Table 2 displays the confusion matrix for each classifier. Each observation in the test dataset is counted just once in one of 9 possible positions in the table. If we know a particular player really is a centre back and was classified as a centre back via our classifier, we mark a single count in the \u2018True CB\u2019 row and \u2018CB\u2019 column.", "Reading off the first line for the Linear Regression classifier, out of 880 centre backs in the test data set, 519 were identified as centre backs, 73 were wrongly classified as centre midfield players and a further 288 were misclassified as strikers.", "The first metric we extract from our confusion matrices is how often each classifier was correct i.e. how many true centre backs, central midfield players and strikers from the test dataset were identified correctly. This is known as the accuracy of the model.", "While all models perform better than random guessing (33% chance of being correct), at around 50% no model particularly impresses us. QDA is the most accurate model by a whisker but we still know very little about how each model predicts on a class by class basis.", "Therefore, the next metric to be examined is the precision of each model. When a model predicts a particular player is a centre-back or central midfield player or striker, how often is it correct?", "Again, QDA is again fractionally the most precise model on average with the difference over the remaining models due to higher precision for strikers. Note also, that all models suffer poor precision for the striker class.", "The final metric we look at is recall. Recall is the proportion of true centre-backs/central midfield players/strikers identified correctly. Accuracy represents the overall proportion of truth captured correctly by the model but recall identifies weaknesses in capturing the truth correctly on a class by class level.", "An impressive 69.1% of true centre-backs are identified correctly by the QDA classifier. However, this comes at a cost to striker identification which lags at 32%. We see a similar pattern in linear regression while LDA and MLR show consistent recall across all positions.", "QDA performance is the most extreme in this test. We questioned earlier whether QDA\u2019s flexible boundary provided better predictions and if we had a preference to capture true centre-backs over the other classes, QDA would be the stand out winner on every metric we have examined. In this case, we do not have a class preference and while the average QDA recall is the highest we can see that the model actually struggles to identify true strikers (32%). With this in mind and in addition to the very marginal difference in precision and accuracy between MLR, LDA and QDA, it would be equally justifiable to pick MLR or LDA as the best model here.", "Accuracy, precision and recall used together are powerful indicators \u2014 they uncover how well a model captures the truth and with how much variability.", "In any case, scoring roughly 50% across metrics is not good enough. Can we improve these lacklustre results by including some more input variables? Consider the following model,", "Our original output remains the same but we are now armed with a larger set of characteristics for our models to learn from. The confusion matrices in Table 3 show improvement (greater numbers in the lead diagonal). Our three metrics accuracy, precision and recall have all improved to around 66%-67%.", "QDA remains the top performing model but the marginal difference between accuracy, precision and recall for each of the four models is even finer (Table 4).", "We saw that with just two input variables, QDA\u2019s recall breakdown was poor for the striker class. With the increase in input variables, recall is significantly more consistent across classes \u2014 CB: 68.1%, CM: 71.5%, ST: 64.4%.", "Given the FIFA19 dataset, we developed 4 models to classify football player positions based on physical characteristics. We found the most precise and accurate model using QDA. In the test dataset, 67.5% of players were identified in their correct positions and a model prediction is correct 67.7% of the time.", "Recall that both QDA and LDA hold strict distributional assumptions on the underlying dataset (Gaussian generating distribution) and we have not verified whether these assumptions hold. Without doing so, we must be cautious in declaring either of the resulting models as the best. We know our models require Gaussian data but in reality, the distribution of our data is rarely known. This motivated the development of Normality testing (here) which aims to verify whether a given dataset can be well modelled by a Gaussian distribution. Only then can we give the green light to statistical models that demand such assumptions.", "With this in mind and our lack of normality testing so far, we declare MLR as the match winner for our analysis. Given just 7 physical attributes our model can make a correct prediction of the player\u2019s position roughly 2 out of 3 times! That\u2019s without manually defining any rules or restrictions on the dataset at all.", "Extensions: Are there any methods to better handle overlapping classes?
