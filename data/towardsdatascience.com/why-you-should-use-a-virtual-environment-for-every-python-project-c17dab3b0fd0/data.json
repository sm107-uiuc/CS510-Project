However, to your shock, there is absolutely no organization within the entire building \u2014 no way to distinguish fiction from nonfiction; no way to tell what author wrote what; simply no way to find your book. You go to the librarian and ask her where the specific book is, but all she tells you is \u201csearch for it.\u201d The only option you have to find the book you so desperately want is to search every. single. book. in. the. building.", "This library is your computer \u2014 more specifically your python package bin. All those unorganized books are the endless cascade of packages you have installed over the years for each of your random projects. Now, the next time you install something or start a project you will have absolutely no idea if the package is up to date, if it collides with another package or python version, or if it exists at all. Such disorganization can cause painful and boring setbacks that not only take away from your project, but also from the time you could have been working on something more productive.", "What is the solution you ask? Virtual Environments.", "I like to think of virtual environments as package bookshelves for each of my projects. If I\u2019m working on a cooking project, there is no need for me to have a book on surfing. Similarly, if I\u2019m working on a machine learning project, there is no need for me to have a library for front-end. Having only the packages I need on my \u201cbookshelf\u201d eliminates all chances for me to possibly experience gross global installation and package collision errors and allows me to focus on what really matters \u2014 my code.  Just like packages, I can also specify what specific version of python I want for my project. If you want a python3 project, just start a python3 environment \u2014 If you want a python 2.7 project, just start a python2.7 environment \u2014 If you want a python 3.5.3 environment, well guess what, today is your lucky day!", "Virtual environments aid these problems by creating special isolated environments where all the packages and versions you install only apply to that specific environment. It\u2019s like a private island! \u2014 but for code. Anything that happens on the island doesn\u2019t affect your mainland, and anything that happens on your mainland doesn\u2019t affect your island.", "Once you\u2019re done working on the project, just jump off the island and back to the mainland.", "If you\u2019re still not convinced, let\u2019s take a second and look at the pros and cons:", "Overall, virtual environments become super handy when working on different projects. Of course, if your project is not package dependent, there is no need for a private island of versions and packages; but, if your project does require even a few packages, there is absolutely nothing a virtual environment can do but help. To get started, take a look at venv, virtualenv or pipenv \u2014 I will soon have an article describing the advantages each brings and how to get started using them!", "EDIT: The follow-up article is out now, check it out here!", "Your home for data science.
