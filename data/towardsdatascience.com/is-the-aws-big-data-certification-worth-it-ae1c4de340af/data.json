The material I learned has helped me communicate better with my co-workers and made me a more flexible data professional.", "Use the flowchart below to see if it might be for you:", "I\u2019ve been a data scientist at Outcome Health for about 2 years now. We\u2019ve done some interesting work, but throughout my tenure, I always had the nagging feeling that I didn\u2019t understand enough about data infrastructure.", "So, several months ago, I spent an hour a day for nearly 100 days straight studying for my AWS Big Data Certification. My AWS Big Data muscles got pretty ripped, and I was able to pass my certification exam on the first try!", "For data scientists considering whether or not this certification is worthwhile, this article is for you!", "Understanding the data science hierarchy of needs is critical to any data scientist\u2019s job because it (1) helps you work better with your teammates and (2) enables you to pick up other job functions more quickly.", "The AWS Big Data Certification can help bolster your knowledge of the lower levels of this hierarchy \u2014 typically where data engineers and DBAs step in.", "The primary difference I\u2019ve seen between the before and after of working toward the certification is in my conversations with data engineers and DBAs on infrastructure choices. I work with them on a regular basis, and having conversations with them about what services to leverage used to be heavily one-sided. They would go something like this:", "\u201cHey, I need to do XYZ. Do you know what I\u2019d use to do that?\u201d", "Now, they go something like this:", "\u201cHey, I need to do XYZ. I\u2019m trying to choose between ABC and DEF. Which would you go with?\u201d", "\u201cHmm. I\u2019d probably pick ABC because of these reasons\u2026\u201d", "\u201cGreat! That makes sense. I\u2019ll add the decision to the system documentation.\u201d", "That added bit of context and understanding has gone a long way to improve my ability to defend any architecture choices and know the limits of what I\u2019m building.", "My studies also gave me basic hands-on experience with setting up the various AWS services covered in the exam, which improved my confidence in setting up systems myself. This isn\u2019t necessarily something a data scientist ought to be doing on the regular, but it can occur, especially in smaller companies.", "Furthermore, understanding what tools data engineers and DBAs use on a regular basis (and why) can rapidly speed up your learning time should you ever need to step into those roles.", "Whether or not the certification truly matters in a hiring process is up for debate. What isn\u2019t up for debate is that it is a clear marker for knowledge proficiency. Passing the certification is not easy, and signals that you could actually have an intelligent conversation on the topic of AWS Big Data tools.", "Also, it just feels nice to have that piece of paper that says you\u2019re passably good at something.", "As I mentioned earlier, it took me 100 hours of study to prepare for and pass the exam. There are in-person courses, but they are both expensive and too short to be deeply effective. As a result, I chose the path of self-study.", "I paid $250 for an annual subscription to ACloudGuru (I took other courses on the platform, so this was well worth it), and probably spent ~$10 total on AWS charges.", "And the test itself costs $300 to take.", "Any kind of self-study is an exercise in discipline. I committed one hour of my mornings for 100 days to working through an ACloudGuru course on the subject matter. That meant going to bed early most nights so I would have time to work on my studies in the morning.", "If you want to know what studying felt like in the moment, you can check out my daily journal of progress in this Medium series!", "As an aside, getting up early has been the single most important habit I\u2019ve developed to improve my productivity. It\u2019s the habit on which all my other habits are based.", "When you get up early, you have time to breathe, relax, think, plan, and do what\u2019s most important to you.", "When you get up late, you go straight to work/school, which usually means your best hours are eaten up by someone else\u2019s priorities.", "Yes, it sucks at first, but eventually, you feel great about getting important work done while everyone else is still sleeping. The high of getting ahead can be addicting.", "If you need a good book on habit formation, Atomic Habits is probably the best book I\u2019ve read on the subject.", "If you need a good book that provides raw motivation, Discipline Equals Freedom is unparalleled.", "The ACloudGuru course material was helpful, but it definitely wasn\u2019t enough. I spent many hours reading through AWS documentation, exploring the AWS console, and trying out the various Big Data services that were mentioned.", "This is not a test you can pass simply by studying the material. You need to get into the weeds. You need to understand the basics of implementation, and you need to have at least a bit of practice actually implementing systems.", "There are 2 parts to retention through practice that were instrumental in solidifying the material in my head.", "First, chatting with DBAs and data engineers as I was learning the material helped to clarify confusing material. I cannot stress enough how helpful this was.", "These are people who work with what you\u2019re learning on a daily basis. They understand nuances and can explain concepts that are complicated. Talk to them, understand what they\u2019re working on, and ask questions as they\u2019re relevant.", "I\u2019ve also found that data infrastructure tends to be one of the few topics DBAs and data engineers are willing to talk about for a while. They\u2019re not the most chatty group, on average.", "Second, working on your own little project is equally helpful. It\u2019s also how you prove your technical chops to both yourself and others.", "I built a \u201cMangaTracker\u201d system (I\u2019m a nerdy nerd), which performed the job of scraping manga reading websites and sending me a notification when a new chapter had been released. The project let me test out several services: Lambda, SNS, DynamoDB, and Serverless, to name a few.", "Simply getting the prototype to work made me more confident in my ability to build from the ground up. Also, deploying the app using Serverless felt like magic. It was amazing to see Infrastructure-as-Code in action, in a very tangible way.", "I\u2019ve done my best to explain the benefits, costs, and potential study pathway to the AWS Big Data Certification here. If you need a highly concrete method for deciding whether it\u2019s for you, I\u2019ve written out the flowchart at the beginning of the article here:", "Is your understanding of the base layers of the data science hierarchy of needs weak? (AKA, could you do the basics of a DBA and data engineer\u2019s job?)", "Do you have the discipline to self-study consistently for an hour a day, for 100 days?", "Do you work with data engineers and DBAs regularly, so you can cement your knowledge?", "I honestly enjoyed learning about this subject material (although the early mornings weren\u2019t always fun). I\u2019m hoping that you enjoy your journey as much as I did!", "Your home for data science.
