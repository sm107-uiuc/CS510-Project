We will show step by step code and explain our processes along the way. Before we started diving into the code, we posed a few questions for ourselves that we were hoping to answer about the wine dataset:", "These questions and other findings will be addressed in the remainder of the blog post using Natural Language Processing (NLP), word clouds, map visualizations, and other calculations in Python.", "We found our dataset, \u201cWine Reviews,\u201d on Kaggle. The dataset consists of over 130,000 wine review entries. Each entry contains the country the wine came from, a description of the wine, the designation (vineyard within the winery where the grapes are from), the number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1\u2013100, the price for a bottle of wine, the province or state the wine is from, the region or wine growing area, the title of the wine review, the variety or type of grape used to make the wine, and lastly, the winery. Part of the raw data can be seen below.", "The top 10 countries make up 143,344 reviews which accounts for 95% of all reviews. There are 46 total countries in the dataset.", "The map below is interactive, please visit this link to see it in action.", "Surprisingly, the UK leads the list when it comes to wine review points with an average of 92.89 points. It\u2019s interesting to see that the US did not make the top 10. Looking back at the frequency data, the UK only has 9 reviews which is far too little compared to 62397 of the US. Our data is skewed, and this isn\u2019t quite the fairest comparison.", "The map below is interactive, please visit this link to see it in action.", "The UK hits number one for priciest wine with an average price of $47.50. France is in a close second with an average price of $45.61, and Hungary follows with $44.20. The United States ranks 8th with an average price of $33.", "The map below is interactive, please visit this link to see it in action.", "First, we can look at some summary statistics for price and points.", "Let\u2019s visualize the distribution of wine price and points.", "We can now look at the relationship between the variables price and points. Using the seaborn package we can visualize the variables\u2019 relationship.", "There is a positive relationship between points and price\u2013as the price of the wine increases, the points given to the wine increase as well. The average price is around $20 and average points is around 88. We can also look at the distribution for wines that received 100 points. We see that even cheaper wines can receive full marks!", "Using word clouds, we analyzed the descriptions for the top 10 wine types. We took out words like wine, bottle, glass, flavors, grapes, pour, sip, and taste so that we were left with solely descriptors. The code below shows how we created the two of the individual word clouds. The rest of the word clouds were created in the same way.", "As you can see from the word clouds above, the top words for the top 10 wines include fruit, spicy, dry, sweet, aroma, palate, herb, and tannin. Some of the wines have more specific descriptors:", "In order to approach this question, we explored the data looking for features that could be used for prediction. We found that the variables province and variety have a largely skewed distribution, but points had a normal distribution. We decided to use the description to predict the points a wine would receive.", "Creating and training the model: First, we preprocessed the description text using word embeddings from a pre-trained global vectors text file that rates words on the relationship they have between each other. We then used 3 different models to evaluate how to predict points based on the description. These models included a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), 1D CNN with a long-short term memory (LSTM) layer, and a 1D CNN with gated recurrent units (GRU). CNN is a basic model for reading word embeddings. LSTM is good at finding patterns in sequences of words. GRU is another recurrent neural network architecture, and similar to LSTM, GRU is good at understanding word context. We did not use purely an LSTM model because they do not perform well for sentiment predictions. The code below is for the 1D CNN.", "Evaluating the models: The best performing model was the 1D CNN that got an accuracy of 30% on the validation set and an average error of 3 points (error based on mean squared error). We also tried breaking the points into classes in a 5 point range. Using this method, the model had an accuracy of 62% with an average error of 0.3 points. Our results tell us that it is hard to predict an exact point value for a given description because there is so much variation. However, it seems that we can predict descriptions within a range of points pretty well.", "Problems: The descriptions given were some what problematic for predictions. There are only 20 unique reviewers that contributed to this dataset. Each reviewer has their own style of writing making the prediction problem a bit more challenging.", "This project was a great opportunity for us to use most of the skills that we learned throughout the semester in our Computational Analysis of Big Data class. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t have access to a dataset that didn\u2019t focus on American wines. If time permitted, we would\u2019ve liked to do a US-specific analysis as well. We would\u2019ve liked to use a better dataset to perform other predictions such as looking at how the origin of a wine affects its rating.", "Project done by Derek Albosta, Woo Jung, Emma Sheridan, and Erik Tacam for Computational Analysis of Big Data course. This projects source code can be found on GitHub. The interactive map visualizations can be found here.", "Your home for data science.
