You have picked a profession that is in the midst of setting historical precedents and establishing a new era based on artificial intelligence and trust in machines. We want the benefits of analyzing millions of data points across languages, industries, and professions. But we as humans do not have the capacity to do it ourselves. Its literally physically impossible for one person to look over or comprehend this many data points. That means that we will have no choice but to rely on decisions that machines will make even though we may not have the capacity to understand why those decisions were made. That requires trust in machine learning and its architects\u2026data scientists.", "To say that the implications of the body of work you are building will have far-reaching impacts on society as a whole, is putting it mildly. This means that if you do not learn how to speak up and challenge irresponsible behaviors in development of machine learning capabilities, we are all in trouble.", "If you are currently in a bad situation at work, I\u2019m sorry and I understand. The stats above should at least show you that you are not alone. Let\u2019s acknowledge that there will be moments when you will be, or already have been, asked to do things as data scientists that you will not agree with. Sometimes you may even start a project that seems relatively benign only to find out there are major issues once you are knee-deep into it. You may feel obligated to continue for many reasons. You may have signed a contract or feel the train is so far out of the station that there is no going back. You don\u2019t want to be the one to cause waves. But I\u2019m here to tell you, where you have a will there is always a way to stop something bad from happening. These are the exact moments where it\u2019s your character, not your code that will define your career and quite possibly your life.", "These moments of character \u2014 not code, are what will define your career.", "Machine learning innovations have ways of mimicking the people and teams that worked on them. If a lead data scientist is lazy, unethical, and does not care enough to ensure the data is a perfect fit for the purpose, then the code and training-data sets have ways of becoming an exact product of that. The ML innovation does not garner trust as a result and even worse, could actually be biased or unsafe. My point is, if you compromise who you are during an ML project that you are on, if you do not insist on the highest standards \u2014 ethically and otherwise, your work and the team\u2019s work will reflect that. This is not okay considering that your work may be going into weapons, cars, health diagnostic tools, robot-assisted surgeries or technologies that can literally affect a person\u2019s ability to land a job, get a loan, or have a quality life.", "There will be pivotal moments when you have a decision to make. You will have to decide whether to let momentum carry the project forward or whether to stop the project and insist on extra time to investigate the data and results because it\u2019s not quite right. Either way, it\u2019s your character that\u2019s defining the moment. You are building a little ball of knowledge, a little bit of your own personal ethics, into each narrow AI system that you dabble in. Though you are thinking \u201cit\u2019s just code, I got it from GitHub, everyone\u2019s using it\u201d\u2026LOOK DEEPER! It\u2019s not just code. Code is cheap. That\u2019s just the shell stuff. The real stuff is happening in the data you are selecting and the way you choose to use it. It is not good enough for you to simply massage the data to get it into whatever format you need it in. You must look deeply at the data BEFORE you mess with it. You must truly understand the lives or things represented in it; the context that it has and will be used in. Data is evidence of our lives. For example, you may think you are tracking the signals of a cell phone around town, but there are people behind those signals. Every one of those \u201csignals\u201d is a person\u2019s life that you are eavesdropping on and forming opinions about\u2026.and labeling with scores in enterprise systems.", "While you can tell tons of stories about these \u201csignals\u201d, just know that when you do, that information will then get used to build something else on top of that. So, if you screw it up, you have just marked a set of \u201cpeople\u201d vs. \u201csignals\u201d for life by perpetuating that data into the cloud and selling it or swapping it to the next highest bidder. The point is\u2026make sure this is your absolute best effort. In your mind, if you are analyzing a person\u2019s data, make sure you are helping them by what you do and not doing them in. If at any time that balance is upset, then you owe it to yourself to stop and re-evaluate the project.", "If you feel like you\u2019ve done something that you are not proud of, SPEAK UP! You are not just some cog in a bigger machine with no responsibility for what you have done. I hear what you are about to say next. I promise; I really do. I have heard this repeatedly from up and coming data scientists. \u201cBut if I speak up, my career will be sidelined. I won\u2019t get the fun or challenging projects anymore. The people who are funding or initiating the projects don\u2019t understand the nature of what they are asking me to do.\u201d", "\u201cBut if I speak up, my career will be sidelined. I won\u2019t get the fun or challenging projects anymore. The people who are funding or initiating the projects don\u2019t understand the nature of what they are asking me to do.\u201d", "Then make them understand. In the same way that you present data in meaningful ways for your projects, use that skill to make them understand what happens when you produce ML assets that are biased or unsafe. Is there anyone else that can tell them about pitfalls inherent in your ML project, other than you? Is there anyone else willing to stand up? What if the \u201cpowers that be\u201d actually care? Did you give them a chance to know the pitfalls? Did you assume they had bad intentions before you talked to them? Many business executives who fund AI projects want to know about issues that could cause public relations nightmares, security risks, and of course most importantly safety issues for the public and their clients. Any one of these hazards could cause a business to go under.", "Here\u2019s my suggestions for what you can do.", "These will all depend on your situation so be savvy about what you choose to do that will work best for your specific work environment. I\u2019m not going to lie; what you need to do may mean that you move on to a different project, department or even company. But I promise, good, ethical data scientists will always be in demand. Plus, you will be able to sleep at night and know you are contributing to the betterment of society.", "Start with being specific and prepared.", "\u00b7 Write down all the bullet points of the issues you have seen; and what you think would be reasonable proper resolutions for those issues. Coming with problems and no solutions will only get people frustrated. You want change; so be prepared to tell people what that change needs to be. If they disagree with your recommendations, then ask them to contribute their thoughts and make them part of the solution.", "\u00b7 Spell out what you think would be the impact of continuing with the irresponsible behaviors. You could write something like, \u201cif we continue to not allow at least 5 weeks for researching data from tier 3 data brokers, we could end up with a hiring application that will reinforce bias in the nursing profession. This would cause a prejudice against men in the profession and exacerbate the current gender gap that the profession is trying to close\u201d. The statement ties the issues (poor quality training data) and the resolution (5 weeks of extra investigation time) with the outcome (exacerbated gender gap in nursing). Who could say no when it\u2019s spelled out like this?", "\u00b7 Document agreements and resolutions from each meeting you have and arrive at an agreed plan for action. It\u2019s amazing how many times people agree with a concept (e.g. bias is bad), then when you take steps to resolve the problem (e.g. adding 5 weeks to app launch), they claim they did not agree with \u201chow\u201d the resolution would come to life. Then you are right back to a stalemate with no change happening. Immediately after each meeting send out a communication to make sure everyone agrees with what was said and how it would get done. Then you have written record of agreement to the plan.", "\u00b7 Prepare yourself for sweaty palms and a racing heart as you present the ramifications of doing an innovation project irresponsibly. Some of these steps will be conversations not presentations. What you present or discuss and how you present it is everything. Think of your audience for each step below. Would they balk at a formal presentation or would they expect one? Will they want an emotional appeal, or will they need to be convinced with numbers and other facts. Prepare the talk or presentation for your specific audience and then rehearse it. Also prepare a list of questions you think they may ask you and rehearse what you will say to those. Try to be as succinct as possible. Try not to be blame-y in tone or words. Remember that you want change. You will have to work *with* the very people that you may disagree with, to get real change to happen. If you set up a confrontational or combative environment with your requests, it will be very hard to change people\u2019s hearts and minds. Pray, meditate or exercise your heart out, or do whatever you need to do to get the hate out of your heart before you walk into that meeting place. If you don\u2019t come with love and enthusiasm, you will not get the change you seek. Have courage. You can do this!", "Here are the steps that are usually acceptable within corporate settings:", "1. Vet with your colleagues; if appropriate. If they are the ones suggesting the irresponsible ways of doing things, find out what is driving the behavior and then appeal to them to change. Try appealing individually first so that group dynamics do not come into play. If there are others in the group that feel the same way you do, see if you can get them to speak up as well. Present your issues and the resolutions you would like to see and ask for their help in bringing about change. A good book to read if you are about to undertake this step, is \u201cCrucial Conversations: Tools for Talking when Stakes are High\u201d.", "If that does not work, then it\u2019s time to take the next step. But know first that its typically seen as a great leadership move if you are able to convince the group to reconcile before you have to have someone higher up intervene.", "Most reasonable managers welcome a chance to understand a situation and your viewpoints before you go to anyone else in the company. They will typically see themselves as your advocate in the company and try to partner with you to intervene on your behalf. Directors or VPs will usually ask if you have tried working things out with the person whom you have an issue and if a resolution was reached with your direct manager. Skipping this step is generally seen as bad form. If you have taken this step and come to no agreements, or if the manager is a big part of the problem, then move on to the next step. Keep pushing and keep documenting conversations. Send a summary communication after each conversation and copy yourself and the person involved. You want positive change; so remember to use logic to drive conversations not highly charged emotions.", "3. Appeal to your manager\u2019s boss or a different department.If you still have not had a satisfactory resolution to the issues, then you have to make a decision about whether to stay within your management line or appeal to a different confidential source. If you decide to go to a confidential source that can investigate, then you have choices such as Human Resources, Legal, Privacy, Data Officer (if they are not your reporting line), Compliance and Ethics. There is also most likely some sort of internal anonymous tips hotline if you are working in a large company. If you are working in a small company such as an AI startup, then you probably do not have as many options. You will have to do a direct appeal. Keep pushing for an action plan, communicating and documenting. If this is not working and you are finally at your wits end. It\u2019s time to move to the next step.", "4. Decision point: Cut ties and move onIf you feel like the company is not doing anything illegal, but you cannot stomach their intentions to continue with their irresponsible behaviors, you can simply cut ties with them and not be a part of developing the thing you disagree with.", "5. Decision point: Scorch the Earth These are the most extreme options and should be seen as a last resort because they could hurt you or your colleagues as much as the perpetrators of the behaviors. Ramifications could include things like: negative press about you, legal actions against you, the company going out of business, thousands losing their jobs, regulatory actions, and other serious consequences. After reading expos\u00e9s on the lack of ethical leadership in some firms and universities using AI, it seems on rare occasions you have no choice but to scorch the earth behind you if you believe a company or organization must be stopped at all costs.", "a. You could become a whistle blower to the press via anonymous or open tips if you feel like the company is doing something that the public needs to know about like Chris Wylie regarding Cambridge Analytica.", "b. You could stage a walk-out or file an open letter to executive management of the company like they did at Google.", "c. You could tip off a university machine learning researcher who could then do a thorough objective investigation of the issues you are observing. If this is done anonymously this does not have to be a scorched earth situation.", "d. You could also tip off (anonymously or openly) a regulator or congress person. A regulator could open an investigation and a congress person could hold a hearing. It was a tip-off to a regulatory agency that ultimately brought down Theranos. Congress brought Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg to a public hearing after the Cambridge Analytica situation came to their attention; and it called Facebook\u2019s practices into the public.", "Only you can decide what you need to do for the situation that you are experiencing or seeing. Maybe the best thing you can do is what I chose to do, work in AI Ethics to help people more broadly understand what can go wrong with AI systems. But please, for the love of all of us in the world, don\u2019t choose to simply be silent if you see something that could harm people or their way of life. SPEAK UP!", "Your home for data science.
