It\u2019s the sexiest job of the 21st century and everyone is talking about it. Companies are eager to hire the best talents and people are enthusiastic to jump in the data science boat. With data growing exponentially and our technology advancing at such a rapid pace, it\u2019s no surprise that Data Science would become a fundamental job in businesses worldwide.", "With data as the new oil; an immensely, untapped valuable asset, it will play an imperative role in our society. The workplace today is dominated by various specializations of Data Science positions and it has influenced business models in fundamental ways. Algorithms and formulas that run on data will replace human intuition, and data science will be the decision-maker of data-driven companies.", "This sparked a hype to learn Data Science, and many have turned to the internet, a place with a plethora of resources to learn about Data Science. That said, not all of them are reliable and useful. As Data Science is surging, there are countless articles and videos \u2014 \u201cLearn Data Science in one month\u201d \u2014 which are misleading and superficial, a marketing strategy or \u201cclickbait\u201d if you will. Thus, if you intend to dig deep into what Data Science is, then you have to find the right resources to make sure you\u2019re learning from the best.", "That\u2019s why I\u2019ve chosen this book. If you\u2019re someone deciding to learn Data Science, then you\u2019re in luck. But if you\u2019re someone already learning it or you are practicing it right now, this can be a great addition to your resource collection or refresher/test to ensure you already know Data Science from scratch.", "Now you might ask, why still read books when it\u2019s 2020? Well because reading books are still, in my opinion, the best way to learn, albeit the multifarious online courses and video tutorials flooding the internet. Here\u2019s why:", "Nevertheless, that\u2019s not to say reading this book will magically turn you into a data scientist overnight. What\u2019s important about learning is that you can translate your knowledge into something concrete by actually doing.", "Underneath all the fancy jargon and mathematics, Data Science is just all about solving problems. And you can\u2019t solve problems just by brainstorming solutions and reading about the quandary at hand, you need action.", "So, without further ado, the book for you to start your data science journey is \u2026", "\u201cData Science from Scratch, 2nd Edition\u201d is written by Joel Grus, a Data Scientist, and Analyst at startups and an engineer at Google.

He highlights the importance of building up knowledge from the basics up to the complex theories \u2014 from the basics of Python to building Neural Networks.", "To learn data science, it is key to have a profound understanding of the underlying principles and methodology of each algorithm. Anyone can build a neural network if they just followed a video tutorial, but that doesn\u2019t mean they know what they are doing.

And this book surely doesn\u2019t make it any easier. If you\u2019re really passionate about learning, then have a go at this book.", "Get your hands dirty with the code, experiment with it, digest the principles and concepts explained in the book.
