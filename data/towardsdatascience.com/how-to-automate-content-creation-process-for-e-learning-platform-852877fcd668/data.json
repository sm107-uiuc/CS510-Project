Unfortunately, creating course content is the most challenging part of the development process as it consumes a lot of time and energy. Fortunately, this process can be automated with the help of web scraping and natural language processing.", "In this post, I will show you step by step how such automation can be achieved using spaCy. I will process the text data by spaCy to convert any given raw text data to something directly usable in an English e-learning platform.", "The result of the above steps will be used in my demo web application, lingomoo.", "If you want to see how all can be put together in a real-life scenario, check out my lingomoo demo application here. In addition to the demo application, I provided the source code in my GITHUB repository.", "Let\u2019s start with the first step.", "The main purpose of this step is to generate large amounts of text data that we can process and filter according to the task at hand.", "To do this, you can scrape text content from websites under a public licence. As this is not the main subject of the article, I will not give further detail on this.", "Below you can find the JSON file containing raw text data required. The actual JSON file, \u201csports_article_body.json\u201d, is stored in my GITHUB repository.", "This step will be involved with filtering and processing the text data according to the task at hand. There will be several sub-steps which are listed below;", "In this step, we will simply read from the JSON file created in the previous step and split each article into sentences.", "After we run this python script, we will have a text file, \u201csports_article_all.txt\u201d, containing 40K sentences ready for processing and filtering.", "At this point, as we have all the 40K sentences in a text file, we can now process and filter them to generate the questions for our English e-learning application.", "I will have a basic filtering process that ignores the sentences having more than 9 words and sentences having less than 4 words. That is because, after 9 words, it is not practical to show the sentence as a question on mobile devices without using considerably small font sizes. Another disadvantage of long sentences is that they are difficult to grasp by beginner and elementary level users.", "If the sentence has less than 10 words, then I calculate the sentence difficulty considering the sentence length, average word length and the number of polysyllabic words. This is required to put the sentences in order, based on their complexity so that we can provide them to the user accordingly.", "Then, I will classify the sentences based on their grammatical structure with spaCy\u2019 rule-based matcher function. As an example, using a set of spaCy\u2019 Part-of-Speech tags, we can define a rule to classify the sentences having future tense or sentences having present tense. By doing this, we can further refine our content. You can find all the rules below that I created to classify the content based on their grammatical structure.", "I will split the sentences into the words with keeping the punctuation, as I want to display the words together with punctuation marks. This will help the user to better understand the structure of the sentence with the help of the punctuation marks.", "For the \u2018Find the missing word\u2019 question type, we have to define the missing word of the sentence with the options for the answer. To do this, I will first define a VERB or an ADJ in the sentence as a missing word. Then I will find the vector representation of this word with the help of the spaCy pre-trained NLP model. Next, using the nlp.vocab.vectors.most_similar() function, I will find the 15 most similar words to the missing word. I will choose 9th and 14th of them as options for the answers.", "The final step is to store all the information we generated in a JSON for later use in our demo web application.", "Full code, \u201cnlp_simple.py\u201d, is provided in my GITHUB repository.", "The output of the \u201cnlp_simple.py\u201d script is a JSON file containing 2000 questions. These questions should be reviewed before serving them to the user as there can be some errors occurred throughout the process.", "In this post, I tried to explain how I manage automating the e-learning content creation for my English e-learning demo application.", "I hope you enjoyed my article and I hope it helps you to build your e-learning application.", "Your home for data science.
