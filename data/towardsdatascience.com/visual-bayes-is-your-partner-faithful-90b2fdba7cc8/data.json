The first one was in Stats 101. The professor just wrote the formula on the whiteboard and made us memorize it. Given a problem statement, just input the variables to the formula, get the output, and receive an A. More like a B.", "The second explanation I came across uses a tree. It\u2019s available in a YouTube video here. The problem is that it is not intuitive enough. Too much information to handle and you can\u2019t explain that to your grandmother while she is watching TV.", "Next, I tried an online course called Data Analysis for Social Scientists. Sara Fisher, an MIT lecturer, discusses the theorem in a couple of lectures. Even she states that it is not very intuitive. I lost all hope of a simple and on-the-go explanation, until Nate Silver wrote The Signal and the Noise.", "It is by far the best explanation I have found, and I am going to try to give it a visual twist I can\u2019t find elsewhere. The way I see it, Bayes\u2019 theorem allows a decision-maker to ask 3 questions about a dilemma. It is a way to test your gut and decrease your biases.", "Imagine you see a text in your partner\u2019s phone with a heart emoji from an unknown number. What are the chances that he/she is cheating on you? The new evidence you have found is the text, and you are trying to estimate the hypothesis of wherever your partner is cheating. We can find the probability of your partner being a cheater if you are willing to explore 3 questions.", "In summary, you need to estimate three things. A clean probability without any evidence, the chances of the best-case scenario given the evidence and the chances of the worst-case scenario given the evidence. For any decision, these are 3 good things to think about. Every time you receive impactful news, just take a step back and think if looking at it in a Bayesian framework makes sense.", "Nate uses a different event as evidence: you find underwear that doesn\u2019t belong to you in your bedroom.", "Nate\u2019s numbers result in a higher posterior. But it makes sense. He assigned 5% to the best-case scenario. It is hard to think why underwear would appear in a bedroom if they are not cheating. In our case, a text can have many explanations. After all, heart emojis are useful in many situations.", "Of course, the worst and best case probabilities are subjective in this example. However, the good news is that you can assign your own weights to any given situation.", "Here is a link for you to change the inputs:https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gyb1jzchr8", "Let\u2019s focus on the positive quadrant. X is the \u201cclean probability\u201d. You can determine the other two quantities and find how the posterior reacts (Y).", "Increasing the chances of the \u201cBest-case(c)\u201d drags the line to the right down corner. So even with a high prior, if the best-case has a high probability, the posterior won\u2019t be significant. Sounds like our scenario. The probability of someone receiving a heart emoji is fairly high. \u201cJust relax\u201d says Bayes.", "Increasing the chances of the \u201cWorst-case(a)\u201d drags the line to the upper left corner. You should be more cautious if the worst-case scenario has a high probability.", "It\u2019s a very symmetric graph and shows how fundamental the theorem can be. Hopefully, this saves you time understanding it. If you want to dive deep into the math I recommend this post. Deriving the theorem is not crazy. If you are curious about the formula itself more information is available here or here. If you want to see real-world applications of the theorem click here or here. In the next post, I\u2019ll use Desmos to explain a very basic neural network. Any comments are more than welcome!", "Your home for data science.
