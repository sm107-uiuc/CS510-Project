Thanks to libraries like scikit-learn and Keras, you can make models with a few lines of code.", "But it\u2019s harder than ever to turn data science projects into meaningful applications, like a model that informs team decisions or becomes part of a product. The typical ML project involves so many distinct skill sets that it\u2019s challenging, if not outright impossible, for any one person to master them all \u2014 so hard, the rare data scientist who can also develop quality software and play engineer is called a unicorn!", "As the field matures, a lot of jobs are going to require a mix of software, engineering, and mathematical chops. Some say they already do.", "To quote the unparalleled data scientist/engineer/critical observer Vicki Boykis in her blog Data science is different now :", "What is becoming clear is that, in the late stage of the hype cycle, data science is asymptotically moving closer to engineering, and the skills that data scientists need moving forward are less visualization and statistics-based, and more in line with traditional computer science curricula.", "So which of the many, many engineering and software skills should data scientists learn? My money is on DevOps.", "DevOps, a portmanteau of development and operations, was officially born in 2009 at a Belgian conference. The meeting was convened as a response to tensions between two facets of tech organizations that historically experienced deep divisions. Software developers needed to move fast and experiment often, while Operations teams prioritized stability and availability of services (these are the people who keep servers running day in and day out). Their goals were not only opposing, they were competing.", "That sounds awfully reminiscent of today\u2019s data science. Data scientists create value by experiments: new ways of modeling, combining, and transforming data. Meanwhile, the organizations that employ data scientists are incentivized for stability.", "The consequences of this division are profound: in the latest Anaconda \u201cState of Data Science\u201d report, \u201cfewer than half (48%) of respondents feel they can demonstrate the impact of data science\u201d on their organization. By some estimates, the vast majority of models created by data scientists end up stuck on a shelf. We don\u2019t yet have strong practices for passing models between the teams that create them and the teams that deploy them. Data scientists and the developers and engineers who implement their work have entirely different tools, constraints, and skill sets.", "DevOps emerged to combat this sort of deadlock in software, back when it was developers vs. operations. And it was tremendously successful: many teams have gone from deploying new code every few months to several times a day. Now that we have machine learning vs. operations, it\u2019s time to think about MLOps \u2014 principles from DevOps that work for data science.", "DevOps is both a philosophy and a set of practices, including:", "In a typical data science project, we can see some applications:", "The standard DevOps approach for accomplishing these goals is a method called continuous integration (CI).", "The gist is that when you change a project\u2019s source code (usually, changes are registered via git commits), your software is automatically built and tested. Every action triggers feedback. CI is often used with Git-flow, a development architecture in which new features are built on Git branches (need a Git refresher? Try this). When a feature branch passes the automated tests, it becomes a candidate to be merged into the master branch.", "With this setup, we have automation \u2014 code changes trigger an automatic build followed by testing. We have fast feedback, because we get test results back quickly, so the developer can keep iterating on their code. And because all this happens automatically, you don\u2019t need to wait for anyone else to get feedback \u2014 one less handoff!", "So why don\u2019t we use continuous integration already in ML? Some reasons are cultural, like a low crossover between data science and software engineering communities. Others are technical- for example, to understand your model\u2019s performance, you need to look at metrics like accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. You might be assisted by data visualizations, like a confusion matrix or loss plot. So pass/fail tests won\u2019t cut it for feedback. Understanding if a model is improved requires some domain knowledge about the problem at hand, so test results need to be reported in an efficient and human-interpretable way.", "Now we\u2019ll get even more practical. Let\u2019s take a look at how a typical CI system works. Luckily for learners, the barrier has never been lower thanks to tools like GitHub Actions and GitLab CI- they have clear graphical interfaces and excellent docs geared for first-time users. Since GitHub Actions is completely free for public projects, we\u2019ll use it for this example.", "2. You change the files in your project repository somehow and Git commit the change. Then, push to your GitHub repository.", "3. As soon as GitHub detects the push, GitHub deploys one of their computers to run the functions in your .yaml.", "4. GitHub returns a notification if the functions ran successfully or not.", "That\u2019s it! What\u2019s really neat here is that you\u2019re using GitHub\u2019s computers to run your code. All you have to do is update your code and push the change to your repository, and the workflow happens automatically.", "Back to that special .yaml file I mentioned in Step 1- let\u2019s take a quick look at one. It can have any name you like, as long as the file extension is .yaml and it\u2019s stored in the directory .github/workflows. Here\u2019s one:", "There\u2019s a lot going on, but most of it is the same from Action to Action- you can pretty much copy and paste this standard GitHub Actions template, but fill in your workflow in the \u201crun\u201d field.", "If this file is in your project repo, whenever GitHub detects a change to your code (registered via a push), GitHub Actions will deploy an Ubuntu runner and attempt to execute your commands to install requirements and run a Python script. Be aware that you have to have the files required for your workflow \u2014 here, requirements.txt and train.py \u2014 in your project repo!", "As we alluded to earlier, automatic training is pretty cool and all, but it\u2019s important to have the results in a format that\u2019s easy to understand. Currently, GitHub Actions gives you access to the runner\u2019s logs, which are plain text.", "But understanding your model\u2019s performance is tricky. Models and data are high dimensional and often behave nonlinearly \u2014 two things that are especially hard to understand without pictures!", "I can show you one approach for putting data viz in the CI loop. For the last few months, my team at Iterative.ai (we make Data Version Control) has been working on a toolkit to help use GitHub Actions and GitLab CI for machine learning projects. It\u2019s called Continuous Machine Learning (CML for short), and it\u2019s open source and free.", "Working from the basic idea of, \u201cLet\u2019s use GitHub Actions to train ML models,\u201d, we\u2019ve built some functions to give more detailed reports than a pass/fail notification. CML helps you put images and tables in the reports, like this confusion matrix generated by SciKit-learn:", "To make this report, our GitHub Action executed a Python model training script, and then used CML functions to write our model accuracy and confusion matrix to a markdown document. Then CML passed the markdown document to GitHub.", "Our revised .yaml file contains the following workflow (newly added lines are bolded for emphasis):", "You can see the entire project repository here. Note that our .yaml now contains a few more configuration details, like a special Docker container and an environmental variable, plus some new code to run. The container and environmental variable details are standard in every CML project, not something the user needs to manipulate, so focus on the code!", "With the addition of these CML functions to the workflow, we\u2019ve created a more complete feedback loop in our CI system:", "Now, when you and your teammates are deciding if your changes have a positive effect on your modeling goals, you have a dashboard of sorts to review. Plus, this report is linked by Git to your exact project version (data and code) AND the runner used for training AND the logs from that run. Very thorough! No more graphs floating around your workspace that have long ago lost any connection to your code!", "So that\u2019s the basic idea of CI in a data science project. To be clear, this example is among the simplest way to work with CI. In real life, you\u2019ll likely encounter considerably more complex scenarios. CML also has features to help you use large datasets stored outside your GitHub repository (using DVC) and train on cloud instances, instead of the default GitHub Actions runners. That means you can use GPUs and other specialized setups.", "For example, I made a project using GitHub Actions to deploy an EC2 GPU and then train a neural style transfer model. Here\u2019s my CML report:", "You can also use your own Docker containers, so you can closely emulate the environment of a model in production. I\u2019ll be blogging more about these advanced use cases in the future.", "To summarize what we\u2019ve said so far:", "DevOps is not a specific technology, but a philosophy and a set of principles and practices for fundamentally restructuring the process of creating software. It\u2019s effective because it addresses systemic bottlenecks in how teams work and experiment with new code.", "As data science matures in the coming years, people who understand how to apply DevOps principles to their machine learning projects will be a valuable commodity \u2014 both in terms of salary and their organizational impact. Continuous integration is a staple of DevOps and one of the most effective known methods for building a culture with reliable automation, fast testing, and autonomy for teams.", "CI can be implemented with systems like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI, and you can use these services to build automatic model training systems. The benefits are numerous:", "And I promise, once you get into the groove, it is incredibly fun to have your model training, recording, and reporting automatically kicked off by a single git commit.", "Your home for data science.
