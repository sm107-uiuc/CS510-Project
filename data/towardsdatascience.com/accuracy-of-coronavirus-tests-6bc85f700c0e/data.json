So what does false negative mean? How do medical researchers\u2019 measure the accuracy of these tests?", "In the realm of science, there are several ways to evaluate the reliability of tests. Some of the most common metrics are called \u201cAccuracy\u201d, \u201cPrecision\u201d, \u201cSensitivity(Recall)\u201d, and \u201cSpecificity\u201d. These are some of the most commonly used metrics to optimize the reliability of tests. Before we dive deep into a made up example of how a scientist would measure the reliability of a medical test, let\u2019s cover the basics of confusion matrix.", "A confusion matrix is a table to classify if a single test was accurate or not. The table is split into four grids \u2014", "If you have a random sample of 1,000 people to test the reliability of your coronavirus test and 100 (10%) of the people have coronavirus, what metric would you want to optimize? What is the cost of a false prediction? This is some of the questions that all medical researchers would have to go through. As these tests become more widely available, I believe it\u2019s important to understand how these tests work. More and more people will take the tests, and we will start seeing misinformed statistics in news articles, so I hope that this article can help you be more knowledgeable about these tests.", "Accuracy divides all the people that the test correctly predicted by all the people in the random sample. This might sound like it\u2019s a good metric to use, but in an imbalanced sample, it might not be such a good metric. For example, if the test was broken and predicted everyone didn\u2019t have the coronavirus. It would still be 90%.", "This metric is better used when the random sample has a balanced group where the target you are trying to predict is closer to 50%.", "Simply, accuracy answers out of all the people in the sample, how many people\u2019s tests showed a correct result.", "Precision divides all the people that the test correctly predicted by all the people that had a positive test result. Precision is a better metric than accuracy when the sample is imbalanced.", "Precision helps you answer, out of the people that tested positive, how many of those people actually had the coronavirus?", "Sensitivity and recall are interchangeable, but both terms are frequently used, so it\u2019s good to know them both. Sensitivity often goes with specificity and recall goes with precision. The metric divides all the people that the test correctly predicted by all the people that have the coronavirus.", "Sensitivity/Recall helps you answer, out of people that had coronavirus, how many of those people tested positive?", "A question to ask yourself: Would you want people to think they don\u2019t have the coronavirus, when in fact, they do? What is the cost of telling someone with coronavirus that they don\u2019t have it?", "Often you will have to choose either to optimize on precision or recall because when you increase one, it often decreases the other. Vice versa. Take a look at this article by Google: Precision vs. Recall. There are other metrics that looks at the harmony of both metrics like the F1-score, but I won\u2019t go over that in this article.", "Specificity divides all the people that the test correctly predicted that are healthy by all the people that are healthy.", "Specificity helps you answer, how well do you want the test to correctly predict that a person DOES NOT have the coronavirus?", "Question to ask yourself: Would you want to quarantine yourself because of a wrong test?", "These are all important questions medical decision-makers have to ask themselves. I\u2019m not sure if all medical tests can be perfect, so if you start seeing news about how these tests are not working correctly. Look back at this article and try to guess what the medical researcher tried to optimize for. If I were a doctor, I would think recall is the most important one even if we have to optimize that metric at the expense of falsely positives \u2014 false test results that tell some healthy people they have the coronavirus. Also, news articles will start reporting accuracy numbers. Make sure to understand how reliable these tests are by doing some research yourself.", "Hope that you were able to takeaway some useful information.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
