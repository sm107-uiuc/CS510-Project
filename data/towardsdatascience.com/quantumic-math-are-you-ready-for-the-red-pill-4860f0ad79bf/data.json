You take the red pill \u2014 you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.\u201dMorpheus, The Matrix", "A qubit resembles the idea of the spin of an electron. It is in a state of superposition. While the electron\u2019s superposition consists of the states up and down, the qubit\u2019s superposition consists of the states |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9.", "A popular notion of superposition is that the system is in different states concurrently unless you measure it. But, when you look at the electron, you find it either up or down. When you look at the qubit, it is either 0 or 1. Another notion is that the system is truly random and that there is no sensitive dependence on initial conditions. But superposition does not mean and. And it does not mean or. It is a combination of states that does not map onto classical concepts.", "\u201cThis is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back.\u201d Morpheus, The Matrix", "The basic model of superposition is given by a vector space. A vector space is a collection of all valid qubit state vectors along with the operations you can perform on them. We got to know the qubit state vector by the following equation:", "In Python, the array [alpha, beta] denotes this vector.", "When we measure a qubit, it will collapse to either one of the possible measurements. The number of possible measurements determines the dimension of this underlying vector space. There are two possible measurements of a qubit, 0 or 1. Thus, the vector space is two-dimensional. All vectors in this vector space consist of two numbers. These are the probability amplitudes \u03b1 and \u03b2.", "When we measure a qubit, we observe it as either 0 or 1. We know the state |0\u27e9 says our qubit will result in the value 0 when observed. And |1\u27e9 says our qubit will result in the value 1 when observed. In general, |\u03c8\u27e9=\u03b1|0\u27e9+\u03b2|1\u27e9 says our qubit will result in the value 0 with the probability of \u03b1**2 and in 1 with the probability of \u03b2**2", "The probability is a single number, called a scalar. How can we obtain this scalar from a qubit state? There\u2019s one way of vector multiplication that produces a scalar. This is called the inner product. And it results from multiplying a column vector with a row vector.", "In a previous post, we introduced the Dirac notation and its \u201cket\u201d-construct that denotes a column vector. For instance,", "Now, we introduce the \u201cbra\u201d-construct (\u27e80|). The bra is a row vector, such as", "The inner product is defined as:", "We can use the inner product to obtain the probability amplitude of measuring a certain value from a qubit state. And its square denotes the probability.", "So, what\u2019s the probability of measuring 1 from the state |0\u27e9? Let's build the inner product to find out:", "And what\u2019s the probability of measuring 0?", "And what\u2019s the probability of measuring |\u03c8\u27e9 as 0?", "Great! Even though this is quite mathematical, it illustrates how we can obtain a value from our quantum state. By multiplying our state vector with a row vector. In layman\u2019s terms, the \u201cbra-ket\u201d \u27e8e|\u03c8\u27e9 denotes the probability amplitude of measuring |\u03c8\u27e9 as e. Its square denotes the probability.", "In the last post, we got to know the matrix multiplication. We learned that when we multiply a matrix with a vector, the result is another vector:", "We saw that the X-gate quantum operator switches the amplitudes of the quantum state.", "In the Dirac notation, a ket and a bra arranged like |a\u27e9\u27e8b| denotes the outer product. The outer product can be understood as a matrix multiplication:", "Therefore, the term |a\u27e9\u27e8b| denotes a matrix. And, we can write our matrices in terms of vectors:", "In layman\u2019s terms (and only for specific base cases), the \u201cket-bra\u201d |a\u27e9\u27e8b| turns your |b\u27e9 into |a\u27e9.", "We have talked a lot about the state of quantum superposition. But whenever we worked with a qubit in such a state, we initialized the qubit with the corresponding probability amplitudes \u03b1 and \u03b2. But what if we wanted to put a once measured qubit back into superposition?", "Now, we have some means to do it. What do you think about this?", "According to our notion, it means we turn the state |0\u27e9 into |+\u27e9 and we turn the state |1\u27e9 into |\u2212\u27e9.", "Do you remember the states |+\u27e9 and |\u2212\u27e9? We introduced them here. They are defined as:", "These states yield the same probability of measuring 0 or 1. They reside at the horizontal axis. But although these states share the same probabilities, they are different. Their probability amplitudes are different. As mentioned above, this amplitude can be negative.", "Let\u2019s have a look at this operator.", "This operator is known as the Hadamard gate, or H-gate. It allows us to move away from the basis state vectors |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9. It puts the qubit into a balanced state of superposition.", "In short, it has the matrix:", "Quantum computers must work with high precision because quantum algorithms build on precise manipulations of continuously varying parameters. Even the noise caused by heat can ruin the computation.", "This is problematic because the computers we are able to build thus far are, essentially, expensive electric heaters that happen to perform a small amount of computation as a side effect.", "Our computers operate in a way that depends on the intentional loss of some information. When we look at the and operator, we get an output of 1 if both input values are 1. In all other cases, we get a 0. Given the output of 0, we have no way of knowing what the input was.", "In the process of performing such an operator, the computer destructively overwrites its input. It physically destroys the old information by pushing it out into the computer\u2019s thermal environment. It becomes entropy that manifests as heat. Quantum computers operate at extremely low temperatures \u2014 below 1 kelvin or -273\u00b0C. Quantum computers must be very energy efficient. Not because energy is a valuable resource. But because any loss of energy inevitably overheats the computer.", "In fact, it is possible to carry out computations without losing information and thus, without producing heat. This is known as reversible computation.", "By enabling our H-operator to distinguish between the input states |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9, it becomes reversible and thus, suited for a quantum computer.", "Let\u2019s see the Hadamard gate in action.", "You should note, we initialize our qubit with the state |0\u27e9, in Python [1, 0]. The only new thing is the Hadamard gate we apply to our qubit at position 0 (line 13).", "We can see that even though we initialized the qubit with the state |0\u27e9, we measure it with a 50% probability for 0 and 1, each.", "We mentioned the reversibility of the Hadamard gate. In fact, the Hadamard gate reverses itself.", "In this code snippet, we initialize the qubit with state |1\u27e9 (line 9). We apply the Hadamard gate two times. It results in a 100% chance of measuring 1. Exactly what the state |1\u27e9 denotes.", "The Hadamard gate is a fundamental quantum gate. It shows up everywhere in quantum computing. It turns a qubit from the state |0\u27e9 into |+\u27e9 and a qubit from the state |1\u27e9 into the state |\u2212\u27e9. And it reverses these transformations.", "This post took you deep into the quantumic math rabbit hole. We explored two constructs. First, the \u201cbra-ket\u201d you can use to get the probability amplitude of a certain measurement. Second, the \u201cket-bra\u201d you can use to form a matrix and specify how to transform an existing qubit state.", "We have covered quite some math. Surprisingly, does not need to be confusing. In fact, the math we use in quantum computing consists mostly of linear algebra. And this is not too hard at all. Unfortunately, many resources on the topic assume you got a math degree. For instance, they don\u2019t explain what an inner product is and how you calculate it.", "My experience tells me that there is no shame in explaining the basic things when we use them. For those who are already familiar with them, it is a chance to consolidate their knowledge.
