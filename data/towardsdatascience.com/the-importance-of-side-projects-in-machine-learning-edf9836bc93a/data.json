That been said, there\u2019s one answer that applies to all the questions.", "Or more accurately, the undertaking and completion of side projects.", "There you have it, the solution to all your problems. So, why is there still a substantial content of the article left?", "Well, this article is written to hone in on the importance of side project within machine learning.", "I would like you, the reader to understand how much of an impact taking on the appropriate side projects can have on your personal life and career.", "You\u2019ll find some personal anecdotes that I\u2019ve included to illustrate the benefits of advice and tips mentioned in this article. And if my accounts do not convince you, don\u2019t worry, I still have some more tricks up my sleeves.", "Before we go any further, why should you even listen to me or read this article?", "Allow me to introduce myself briefly.", "One thing about my career that is relevant to this article is that most of the roles I\u2019ve taken were at least five years above my experience level.", "I\u2019ve been a lead web developer within a startup less than a year after graduating; I\u2019ve taken contractual jobs that were meant for individuals with at least 10-year experience. And now I\u2019m leading the computer vision initiative within a startup, in my first machine learning-based role outside of my MSc studies.", "How could I have done all this?", "A side project can assist you in securing your next role.", "This is not new advice, you probably already heard this advice before.", "What I actually mean to say is that: side projects can help you secure a job that requires a higher skill and level of experience than your current job.", "But, then the headline of this section would be too long.", "My first role after my Bsc was as a graduate front end developer. I built web pages with PHP(laravel), BackboneJS and JavaScript. After a typically long day battling with PHP, I arrive home and open up my laptop, to work on a side project that utilized NodeJS, Angular and MongoDB.", "My side project did not directly increase my knowledge at work, but I knew what the next role I wanted to undertake required.", "With the information on the skills required for my next role, I started to work on these skills from day one in my current role, at the time.", "In my interview for my second role after my undergraduate studies, I barely mentioned what I did in my actual day job. The main conversation and questions asked were all related to my side project.", "What was even more appealing to my employers at the time was the fact that I was able to find the motivation to pick up a new set of skills while keeping my sanity battling with PHP.", "I leveraged the pattern of using my side projects to prepare me for my next role up until my most recent role as a Computer Vision Engineer. Within all the three offers I received, and even the positions I was rejected from, I only spoke about the skills and learning from my side project.", "Now how can you take my personal experience and apply it to your self?", "Go online to any job site and search the requirements for a role you see yourself in the next 2\u20135 years. Do not be put off by the seniority of this role. Make a note of the skills and tools required.", "Next, start a side project using the skills your ideal role requires. It doesn\u2019t matter how big or small. Just start.", "Here\u2019s how I use this method currently.", "I have aspirations of becoming a Principal Machine Learning Engineer within the next 2\u20135 years.

I would like to show what each task contains, but perhaps in another article, I can go into detail.", "Do take into consideration that I am no expert(yet) and I\u2019m just learner like you.", "If you agree or disagree with the statement below leave a comment in the comment section of this article, I would like to know your thoughts on the matter.", "The one mistake I see a lot of people make in the tech industry is that they correlate experience to number of years within a role. Whereas in reality there are individuals with a small number of experience in years and have put more hours into developing a skill than the average person does in three years.", "You need to become one of these individuals. And side projects are a proven and tested path.", "Side projects can assist with knowledge retention", "Stating that there\u2019s an unprecedented amount of information to be absorbed in Machine learning is an understatement.", "Our job involves constant learning until the very day we retire.", "Like I said earlier, I\u2019m still in the early years of my career, despite that, I still struggle to retain the information I learnt just days ago.", "Those with a bit more experience will tell you that success within a machine learning role is not explicitly determined by how much you can remember, but rather your ability to find and implement solutions to meet a specified requirement.", "Nonetheless, you need a method of knowledge retention to keep your mind sharp and have the mindset to be able to approach any task, regardless of familiarity.", "And yet again, side projects can help with this.", "Within my role, I utilize the TensorFlow framework extensively. I use TensorFlow to build machine learning pipelines to train and evaluate models daily. Yet, I still find myself referring to StackOverflow or documentations to complete tasks I\u2019ve done many times over.", "The solution to this problem is obvious. You would probably tell me to keep understanding and practising until it becomes second nature. And you are correct.", "That\u2019s why I decided to extend the process of repeating and practising skills I learn within my roles in my side projects.", "My thinking here is simple. If I use TensorFlow at work and after work hours, I\u2019ll spend more time repeating processes over and over again till they become second nature.", "It\u2019s also vital that you have a foundational level of understanding of whichever method you are trying to learn.", "Find aspects within processes that you are failing to internalize and practice them after work hours within your side projects.", "This simple technique aids with knowledge retention through the principle of consistent practice.", "Side projects can be the start of something grand", "How many side projects have we heard of that turn into multi-billion dollar companies?", "Most of the apps and tools we all use today are a product of side projects.", "Facebook started as a side project.", "In this short interview that included Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, Priscilla refers to Facebook as just one of Mark\u2019s project. Her exact words were:", "\u201cNo one in their wildest dream would imagine that this is what would happen\u2026it was his next project\u201d", "Hey, I\u2019m not saying that your next side project is going to turn into a billion-dollar company.", "What I am saying is that people are willing to place a monetary value on good products that solve significant problems. And your side project could be a worthy investment.", "In my late teens and early twenties, I partied a lot. I attended so much event I needed a system to recommend the events that were worth my time. So I developed a web application that used multiple event website APIs and made a comparison algorithm that weighted event location, prices and attendees to provide a single event recommendation.", "This side project didn\u2019t turn into a multi-billion-dollar company. Still, it did turn into a company, that my brother and I worked on for a couple of years and won startup competitions with.", "And all I wanted to do was party\u2026more efficiently.", "Currently, my next side project is centred around limiting the chances of coronavirus infection. Can\u2019t wait to share this soon.", "Solve pain points in your life with side projects.", "You have a skill that enables you to create tools that can solve problems in people\u2019s lives in creative and imaginative ways.", "Look at aspects of your day and identify three things that could be made simpler with a machine learning solution.", "Then implement these solutions and enjoy the ride.", "No one can predict tomorrow, and your next side project could just be about as successful as Facebook.", "And if it isn\u2019t you still gain a ton of skills and experience.", "Honestly speaking, I simply try a lot of things in my life and if something yields a positive result, I put more effort into it.", "I would encourage you to act on a few actions that I\u2019ve included in this article. And if they don\u2019t work for you, simply move on and try something that could work.", "There are a couple of talking points that I purposefully did not include in this article that also showcases the benefit of side projects in machine learning, such as:", "I don\u2019t have extensive experience in the omitted talking points mentioned above.
