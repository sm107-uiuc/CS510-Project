Based on a large number of advertisements, it is possible to assume a typical price according to the characteristics of the property to be rented.", "This standard price is of interest firstly to landlords who will be able to set the ideal price for their rental in order to maximise the demand for their property, but also to those who are going to rent the apartments who will have an indication of the position of the apartment they wish to rent in relation to the market.", "In this article, we will see together how to create a model that predicts the price of a property by looking at its characteristics. To do this we will start by presenting the data we have, we will clean it and then we will train a regression model that we will evaluate.", "The dataset comes from Kaggle a very famous dataset bookstore. It gathers advertisements for several years in the city of Berlin.", "The information that we\u2019ll use for this analysis will be price related (Price, Cleaning Fee, Extra people fee, Security Deposit), Amenities (Is there wifi, washing machine \u2026), and about the position (longitude, Latitude).", "Data cleaning is one of the most important things in data science. We\u2019ll see some basic example here what it\u2019s all about.", "First, for the prices, our training algorithm need prices with the format \u201c51\u201d not \u201c51,00 $\u201d so we transform all the prices to have the requested format.", "The function replace just replaces the first argument by the second one.", "Some prices were not present in the dataset. If we have no value for a price, it\u2019s going to result in an error. We, therefore, consider that if a price was not entered it is that the owner wanted to make benefit free of charge from this service.", "The function fillna replace the null values by the argument", "The amenities feature was a long list unstructured of all the amenities available in the apartment. So we have some arrangements to make.", "So we get an orderly array that we can visualize easily.", "The function strip removes leading and trailing characters.", "We can see here that Wifi, Kitchen, heating and essentials are present in most of the airbnbs such as more than 20,000 have them. So it seems obvious that if your airbnb doesn\u2019t have these amenities, the price will be lower.", "Creating new data from what we already have can significantly increase the performance of our model.", "When we visualize Airbnb prices compared to their position, we can easily see that the prices are more expensive in the center of the city.", "It seems obvious that the distance from the centre of Berlin has a direct influence on the price of the property. Indeed, as in all large cities in the world, people seek to be close to the centre, so these properties are more popular.", "So we are going to create a feature that calculates the distance of the apartment from the center of Berlin.", "The great_circle function gives the distance \u201cas the crow flies\u201d between two points.", "To build a proper model we need to have two sets of data. One that will be used to train our model and another to score it.The first thing we need to do is to separate features and label.", "Then we can split our data using train_test_split function from scikit learn library.", "We\u2019ll now try to train two different models to compare their performance.", "We start by training our model very simply by using the scikit learn implementation.", "We then score our model with different indicators that will tell us the average error of our model.", "We get an MAE at $22.72, which means that, on average, our model is $22.72 wrong when trying to guess the price of an apartment, which is honourable.", "Let\u2019s now try another model to see if we can improve this score.", "In the same way, we will use the implementation of scikit learn", "After training our model, we can also try to score our model.", "Here we have a decrease in the MAE of more than 1$ which is very encouraging.", "So we have seen here that in about 15 minutes and a few ideas, we can build a model that makes sense with only five features well used.", "So it\u2019s easy to imagine that Airbnb, which, like most companies that have been created in the last decade, invests a lot in Machine Learning. So the company builds models with much more means that does not try to reduce their error by a few dollars but by a few cents.", "It is therefore important to realize that even before you post your advertisement on the platform, it knows at what price it will be rented.", "Your home for data science.
