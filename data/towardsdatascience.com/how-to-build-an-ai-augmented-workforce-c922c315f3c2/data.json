Indeed, automation will profoundly impact the workforce mostly thanks to AI-powered solutions. As such, the question of how to achieve human-machine collaboration has become a priority.", "Unfortunately, many decision-makers continue to underestimate the need and complexity of adapting their workforce. On the other hand, many workers (including managers) still don\u2019t feel the need to become knowledgeable about AI despite the fact that automation will also impact them.", "In my latest mission, we implemented an \u201caugmented workforce\u201d strategy related to our numerous AI initiatives and long term vision.", "In this article, I\u2019ll explain why AI trainings are crucial to the success of a long term automation strategy and how it is possible to either transform yourself into an \u201cAugmented Worker\u201d or your team as an \u201cAugmented Workforce\u201d. I\u2019ll present some guidelines we have created as well as a use case.", "Thanks to prebuilt algorithms and open-source machine-learning libraries, it has become \u201ceasier\u201d to automate repetitive tasks and gain new insights. Automation is becoming a priority for many reasons such as demand for customization, short product cycles, cost reduction programs, etc. However, a significant number of tasks that can be automated still require humans to be in the loop.", "Indeed, is it quite easy to reach 80 percent accuracy but very complex to reach 99 percent? The best machine learning strategy is to let humans handle the remaining percent. This is why the relationship between computers and humans is essential for accurate results and scalable AI solutions.", "80 percent accuracy is not acceptable for most real-world business applications.", "Our main goal is to create symbiosis between humans and machines. To achieve this strategic level, you need to reimagine worker roles and business processes to enable people and AI to collaborate. This perfect fusion between humans and machines is an \u201cAugmented workforce\u201d.", "The word \u201cAugmented\u201d is not necessarily related to AI. It can be a reference to any assistive system that helps employees work more safely and efficiently.", "In reality, creating an \u201cAugmented Workforce\u201d requires new strategies as well as an internal culture ready to embrace change.", "Several \u201cnew\u201d elements have made AI trainings interesting for companies. The proliferation of AI vendors, AIaaS, the high percentage of failed AI PoCs (proof of concepts), etc. However, I do believe that the development of low/no-code AI platforms has highlighted the need to quickly better understand how AI works.", "The idea that a Marketing Manager could easily build a PoC to test a new idea could be a game-changer.", "I believe that workers could simply use AI to improve it, becoming somehow AI Trainers, a role that teaches AI how to perform and iterate. This shift will require HR leaders to look into defining the difference between \u201cfundamental human skills, and non-essential tasks that can be managed by machines\u201d (2).", "Rather than being replaced, many employees will have to develop a different skill set to remain relevant. We will transition from hiring people based solely on their formal degrees to focusing more on building skills and competencies through continuous training.", "Prediction: In the near future, managers unable to work in symbiosis with AI will be replaced by a new generation of managers. \u201cAugmented\u201d Managers will be more knowledgeable about AI and have an experience using low/no-code AI tools.", "The other reason why human-machine symbiosis is needed can be related to the lack of explainability from Machine Learning models. Like humans, neural networks make mistakes and it can be difficult to understand why they have failed, due to the inability of the AI to communicate the decision-making processes itself. Humans (Experts) must be involved to regularly check the accuracy and logic behind AI solutions but also help data scientists improve their models.", "In the best-case scenario, data scientists and designers will need to work together closely to create human-centric, symbiotic AI systems that enable human experts/workers, to train, interact and continuously improve the systems without extensive training themselves.", "Ideally, data scientists will use their time to work on more complex projects or identify additional business opportunities (with managers) in an organization\u2019s processes rather than operating and maintaining existing AI systems.", "Implementing AI solutions is useless if no one understands them or knows how to use them. Consequently, employees/users must be properly trained in these new AI-based tools.", "It implies rethinking the role of workers, redefining the workplace so that it becomes more digital and collaborative, and \u201cin fact redesigning job functions themselves so that they are more appropriate for uniquely human skills (3)\u201d The key idea is to transition from automation to collaboration between humans and machines.", "This transition is extremely important for all companies since automation will also impact smaller and mid-level companies. They may find the task of preparing their workforces for automation way more difficult than large companies as the ways in which automation will be used may not be fully envisioned by their management.", "An automation strategy can represent a costly investment. As such, if wrong decisions are made about which AI solution a company uses, this could not only mean a waste of any resources, but it could result in avoidable job losses.", "Prediction: I expect to see a growing number of consulting firms trying to develop a unique expertise in AI training/workforce adaptation as well as online trainings for decision-makers. The ability to create a perfect symbiosis between AI tools and \u201caugmented workers\u201d will become one of the main sources of competitive advantage.", "Moreover, I believe that businesses not providing their employees with the opportunities to retrain or move to a different position may see their image suffer (employer brand).", "An AI training for a manager (for a company who recently deployed an AI solution) should include:", "As mentioned before, I believe that an AI strategy can only be successful if companies managed to find the right balance between human intelligence and AI. Companies unwilling to augment or unable to find the right balance will be at risk. Based on my experience, the next AI-related main competitive advantages are:", "I also expect that companies workforce will become a mix of robots, AI, and freelancers who drop in on projects on an as-needed basis from all over the world. As a result, we might move towards an online workforce as-a-service.", "Based on my experience in implementing an augmented workforce strategy, I have listed below some key steps.", "An automation strategy that does not take into consideration human input will fail in the short-term. For AI applications, leaving people out of the loop prevents you from having access to a rich source of added value and expert knowledge. To build an augmented workforce, decision-makers need to be investing in roles and responsibilities that are three to five years away.", "Even though this article is mostly related to AI, I recommend companies to start their automation strategy with other technologies. Indeed, AI requires a certain level of data maturity that most companies still haven\u2019t reached. As such, technologies like Robotic Process Automation (RPA) are easier to implement at the beginning of an automation strategy.", "RPA: A software robot that mimics human actions, whereas AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. (X) Based on my experience, RPA solutions can\u2019t automatically adapt to process changes (RPA cannot learn from new data/detect patterns by itself). Moreover, RPA solutions only work for are repetitive, rules-based tasks that do not require human judgment", "Furthermore, automation through AI-powered solutions is often only possible thanks to other technologies. For instance, companies involved with manufacturing need an IoT infrastructure (wifi, cloud, etc.) to build flexibility and collect data that will be used by the augmented workforce. The data collected by sensors is communicated over IoT, resulting in a factory where humans and machines can increase efficiency.", "You will find below a use case that illustrates the strategic importance of automation and augmented workforce.", "Use case \u2014 Amazon & Machine Learning Training Recently, Amazon announced that is is planning on retraining one-third of its workforce to help ease the effects of automation. This audacious plan includes six programs, which will be available to employees at any Amazon location.", "Amazon Technical Academy will teach non-technical employees the skills needed to transition into software engineering roles. An entity called Machine Learning University will give employees with some technical background the ability to add machine learning skills (4).", "In general, I think that there\u2019s a bright future for employees who are willing to gain new skills and who are willing to work to either add to the work of an AI-powered solution, work alongside it, manage it, or to do something that they can\u2019t do.", "Your home for data science.
