I was na\u00efve and still doing my masters.", "I was excited for this job because my current specialization was Digitalization. I wanted to get a hang of how it really works. I had studied programming too, but not python. My colleagues were all really smart \u2014 PhDs, Mathematicians and Physicists. Their understanding level of analytics was way beyond what I could gain by merely reading books!", "For the first few days, the variety of projects and tasks, analysis and projects bewildered me. But, you know what was more bewildering? Questions like what is analytics? Why do it? What are all these files with so much data? What do all those numbers in the results say? How does an analytics project look like? What do they mean when they say they are analyzing data?", "I spent days understanding analytics and the job itself. I gorged on various books and online courses that taught python, statistics, data science, etc. Gradually, I developed an understanding for the subjects and successfully completed my thesis in the same department too.", "I have explained the data analytics recipe for you below. Hope you can use this as a guide even if your ingredients change with the application.", "The most important step to make any project successful is having a clear start. No matter how big or small your project is, if you do not have the ingredients in the required form and the right tools, even a masterchef\u2019s recipe will not guarantee a delicious meal in the end.", "Let\u2019s start with the ingredients before starting with the preparation.", "Did you ever get irrelevant results after you searched for your query in google? What do you do then? Rephrase and refine the keywords and search again. Similarly, having the \u2018why\u2019 of your analysis clear in the beginning helps you interpret your results better.", "After you get all the data that you need, the next step is to understand and define the problem statement. The pain points of the business case need to be addressed here. It is imperative for your aim to align with the business strategy of your company so that the analysis proves fruitful to the stakeholders.", "Consider the above store location example. As the result of your analysis, you will get a score assigned to each prospective location. If the strategy of your management is to finance the project only when the new location results in more than $ 100,000 profit in a new city with a minimum population of 5000. Thus, you have clear criteria to narrow down the analysis results in line with the vision of your company.", "For any kind of data analysis, getting the data is unquestionable. Data can be acquired from various relevant sources. Thus, it may come in diverse types and formats. Your job is to cut and crush it according to its type so that it is usable for your recipe.", "In a tabular representation of data, each column is a data field and each row is a record. Each record may be labelled uniquely with an ID.", "For example, for predicting the next location for opening a new store, you may have to use  Yearly Sales Data, Sales Data for existing store locations, Population Density of the locations, Total number of Households, Census Data, Land Area. If your company sells pet products then you need number of households with pets. If your company sells children\u2019s products then number of households with children under 15.", "Most common types of input files are .csv (comma-separated-values file), .xlsx (excel sheet file) and .txt (text file). Excel file consumes more memory while importing data. On the contrary, CSV files are faster and consumes less memory.", "Regardless of the file type, you have to clean each of the files and then blend all of it into one file to do the analysis. You can check out more about this here:", "The software used for the analysis can be selected depending on the kind of results you want; your knowledge of programming languages like Python or R. For those who do not prefer programming may simply use any modular analytics software. In such a tool, you just drag and drop the required functions and you are good to go with the beautifully structured results and presentations.", "Popular \u2018No Code\u2019 analytics software include:", "For these, you simply need to go to their site, create an account and download (some may only allow trial versions for a limited period)", "After that just upload your data file for analysis and run. You will have your results already when you finish reading this article.", "You can also directly start your data analytics projects online, without downloading or installing anything!", "Different types of data come in different formats. Data from usually disparate sources requires cleansing, enriching and proper consolidation into one usable form in a downstream process. The technical terms generally used are data cleaning, feature selection, data transforms, feature engineering and dimensionality reduction.", "Data cleaning and preparation is the most time consuming task in the entire analysis process.", "The first thing to do with any file is to check whether the given path is correct and it opens without errors. Load the data in the software of your choice. Now, look inside.", "An example of looking at the data is the field summary tool in Alteryx that provides a summary of data for all fields. The summary is shown below:", "Analyze and interpret the data using statistical tools (i.e. finding correlations, trends, outliers, etc.). However, the data might have missing values, typing errors or heterogeneous date formats; this must first be identified and fixed for better results.", "Categorical Variables are variables that can take values or labels belonging to a fixed number of categories. Gender is a nominal categorical variable having two categories -male and female. The categories have no intrinsic ordering. An ordinal variable has a clear ordering. Temperature is an ordinal categorical variable with three orderly categories (low, medium and high). Such variables are encoded using different techniques for easier analysis.", "Quantitative Variables represent measurement and count. They are of two types continuous (may take any value between an interval) and discrete (countable).", "The link below gives an overview of the methods to encode the variables.", "You may have to deal with the following challenges while preparing the data:", "Null Values are shown in the data as NaN or \u201cNot-a-Number\u201d value. The NaN property is the same as the Number but not a legal number. In python, use the isNaN() global function to check if a value is NaN. In Alteryx Software, the values are shown as [Null] after running the code. They can be filtered using isNull in the formula Tool. Additionally, summarize tool also helps you to count null.", "When no data value is stored for an observation in the dataset, it is termed as missing data or missing values in statistics. Rubin stated three mechanisms for occurance of missing data: missing at random (MAR), missing completely at random (MCAR), and missing not at random (MNAR).", "The process of assigning substituted values to missing values is called imputation. If a small portion (upto 5%) of the data is missing then the values can be imputed using method like mean, median or mode. It uses the other values in the same column for imputation. Principled methods such as the multiple-imputation (MI) method, the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) method, and the expectation-maximization (EM) method.", "It is advisable to delete the field if more than 10% of the data is missing, as it may add statistical bias to the results.", "In Alteryx, field Summary Tool shows the percentage of missing records for each data field.", "Follow this link for steps and formulae to deal with missing data in excel.", "Numerical fields like age, currency, date have a huge potential for errors due to non-uniform format. For example, age can be written as 30 years or 30.2 Years or simply 30. The thousands separator and decimal separator for currency varies according to countries and regions. Make sure that these columns have an even format.", "Once the dataset is cleaned, it is time to run another pre-process regime over it. Outliers are unusual values in the dataset that may cause statistical errors in your calculations. They are abnormally away from other values in a dataset and can severely distort your output values.", "Scatterplots help immensely when you need to instantly identify outliers in your data. Simply visualize the relationship between each predictor variable and the target variable using plots.", "Here are some links to help you with the terms and methods to deal with outliers:", "That was all for part 1. Check out part 2 for the analysis and presentation phases of a data science project. Stay tuned!", "The best way to be on track is by being prepared and keeping your addictions at bay.
