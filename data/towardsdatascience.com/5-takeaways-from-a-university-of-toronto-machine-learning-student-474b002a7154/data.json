The Scarborough campus, that I will refer to as UTSC, is a newer campus located at the East end of the GTA and offers a wide variety of Co-Op programs a freshman can select from. About 4 years ago, when I was applying to universities, I decided to attend the University of Toronto Scarborough Campus as a Co-Op Computer and Mathematical Science student, with the goal of entering the Computer Science (CS) program (that you must apply for after your first year of undergraduate studies).", "Here are five things that I learned throughout my journey and how I started my Data Science career:", "Everyone always claims that the reputation of the University of Toronto is solely based on the St. George (downtown) campus. That statement is not completely false seeing that most university rankings are based on Post-Graduate programs and not Undergraduate programs, and St. George (UTSG) offers the most highly sought-out Master\u2019s programs. However, no one should underestimate the education level in the \u201coffspring\u201d campuses, including the Scarborough (UTSC) and Mississauga (UTM) campuses. Common saying is that the two newer UofT campuses are easier to get admitted into than the St. George one. This is very true, not necessarily because the downtown campus is just that much better, but because UTSC and UTM are newer and do not have over a hundred years of academic reputation to back them up.", "Without a doubt, the St. George campus offers the most programs to choose from and has the most students, and of course amazing, highly ranked professors. However, if the specialized program that suits your calling is offered at one of the smaller campuses and you do not mind a less crowded and more compact campus, UTSC or UTM might be a good fit for you. If you are worried about the quality of education you will receive, don\u2019t! Most of the professors at UofT teach at more than one campus. That is, if you heard of this amazing Statistics professor that teaches this incredible course at UTSG, you just might find them teaching an equivalent course at UTSC. As a prospective Computer Science student, there was no doubt in mind that I wanted to experience being an intern and gaining hands on experience during my studies. That in mind, the deciding factor for me to choose UTSC over UTSG was the fact that the former offered Co-Op programs.", "What is Co-Op? Co-Op is a program that allows students to work in an industry-related field while still being a full-time student. This gives students the chance to alternate between a semester of schooling and a work term semester.", "The tech industry is extremely competitive as we are all living in this all powerful digital era, and more and more people are joining the tech industry seeing that it does not require any mandatory post-secondary education and offers quite a competitive salary.", "When you graduate, you will be competing against hundreds and hundreds of newly graduated students for the same entry-level tech job. Think about how any candidate would stand out in such a large pool of applicants. Say there is one opening left and it comes down to two applicants, you and someone with the same academic results and skills set as you. Who will the hiring manager pick? Now consider if you previously had hands-on industry-related experience during your undergraduate time. Without a doubt, the hiring manager will hire someone with experience over someone without any. Then, instead of competing with the huge pool of all undergraduate tech students, you will be competing with a much smaller pool of applicants consisting of all undergraduate tech students with relevant experience.", "If you are looking for a career in Computer Science or Data Science, I cannot stress enough how important real-world industry-related experience is during your undergraduate years. Of course you can seek out internships on your own during the summer semesters and gain just as much valuable experience. However, if you would like some more guidance finding your work term experiences and general job application consulting (including cover letter and resume building, and general tips on personal branding), Co-Op would be a good option for you. In addition, some intern postings are listed exclusively to Co-Op students, which further narrows down the applicant pool and thus increasing your chances of getting interviewed for the position.", "As mentioned previously, I initially started my undergraduate degree with the goal of entering UTSC\u2019s Co-Op Computer Science program, specializing in Software Engineering. I remembered wanting this not because I was good at coding, I actually went in with no prior programming experience, but because CS was super trendy and would guarantee a good future. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the subject is incredibly useful and opens so many doors for you, but I just noticed that I didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as I would have liked to. After my first year, I realized that I preferred and performed better in my Statistics courses over my Computer Science courses. Luckily for me, UofT gives first year students a set of mandatory courses based on the entire Computer and Mathematical Sciences department, and not any courses specific to the exact program you wish to apply into in that department. I was then able to switch into the Statistics program without any hassle.", "Not only did I find the theory learned in my statistics courses to be extremely applicable in the real world, I also noticed that I quite enjoyed working with large and messy datasets. I knew, however, that I wanted to keep developing my programming skills\u2026 and so I discovered that UTSC offered a program in Statistics focusing on Machine Learning and Data Mining. And thus began my journey in Data Science. For those who are new to the topic of Data Science, this field combines both skills from traditional data analytics and methods (Statistics), and programming skills (Computer Science) to then uncover some underlying information from the data and estimate the unknown .", "Before my first Data Scientist Co-Op position, I was a Data Analyst Co-Op for many work terms. My education so far (when applying to jobs for my first few work terms) and experience consisted mainly of statistical theory related to data testing and cleaning methods that could easily be applied to actionable data. This correlated quite strongly with the role of a Data Analysts, which is more focused on drawing meaningful insights for direct problem solving purposes. On the other hand, Data Science is a broader field that includes a focus on constructing new processes for data modelling, creating algorithms and such for more complex problems. And, machine learning is one of the most popular techniques used by Data Scientists. So in addition to not having much knowledge in the data science domain at the time, I sought out analytics internships.", "Following three work terms as a Data Analyst, I finally had a comfortable amount of experience in the industry to start considering Data Science Co-Op opportunities. After having learned Machine Learning algorithms and the underlying theory behind them (along with past Co-Op experiences), I managed to land my first Data Science internship.", "Although I took a very long detour to reach a Data Science position, this allowed me to broaden my knowledge in data applications. There are plenty of ways you can approach this career, this was just my personal undergraduate journey. I encourage you to take the route that is most comfortable for you and fits your work style the best.", "The more internships I applied to, the more I noticed that full time Data Scientist positions require applicants to have a Master\u2019s or PhD degree in a related field. As I continued learning more about the field, the more such a requirement made sense to me. Data Science requires a large variety of data techniques and thus more advanced theory is needed to perform on the job. However, I know that this knowledge isn\u2019t knowledge you can only acquire through higher level education! In fact, many companies stipulate that working a few years full-time in the field can be just as valuable. I know that many do suggest a post-graduate degree if you wish to contribute in formal research, machine learning algorithm development, deep learning, and such. Though, I need to mention that I have not personally been through this experience yet. As I am finishing up my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto in Statistics, in the Machine Learning and Data Mining stream, I am still considering a Master\u2019s degree myself.", "Your home for data science.
