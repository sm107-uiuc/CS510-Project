An AI-based language system can create around 80,000 pounds\u2019, which is twice of what a human being breathes in a lifetime [1]. The amount of power for searching and training a neural network architecture can be anywhere around 6,16,000 pounds [2]\u2019 \u2014 roughly five times what an average U.S. car emits!", "You heard it right; the massive carbon footprint that comes with artificial intelligence is posing risks for the technology landscape.", "Right, A.I. continues to rise exponentially and is here to stay \u2014 but with environmental concerns at stake. A.I. has not only become a focal point of ethical concerns; it is also contributing to around 3% of total carbon dioxide globally[3].", "Question yourself \u2014 Machine-driven society for who?", "Technology and society \u2014 these two are at crossroads. Think of roads with bots, human beings with machines and everything else driven by numbers \u2014 What do you see? Do you see smart cities or engineered ideologies with biased views splashed over them, or do you imagine a world where social good has converted into social justice?", "Engineered education is what we like to call it, and surprisingly, it doesn\u2019t come from the foundational knowledge. It\u2019s only confined to the education that is imparted from the school and community. Teaching something over the education system is only helping people with clouded thoughts about how everything will switch to a data-driven ecosystem with absolutely no implications on the environment. Dr. Erin A Cech [4], in 2013 spoke about how the U.S. is trying to emphasize the importance of training ethical, socially conscious engineers but in contrary engineering education itself is failing to encourage the neophytes to look upon public welfare as their professional responsibility \u2014 and thus giving a pseudo-reality with A.I. and uninformed opinions, in equal parts.", "Depoliticization \u2014 It states that cultural and social concerns of the society don\u2019t hold good in the \u2018real\u2019 engineering work and hence should be cast out. So to say, somewhere we do bring a notion of only technological advancement, but how it will impact the human or environment around us, we are least concerned about that. Engineering work done without any thought around the people in major is just the technology of no good. As technology and society are seen as two different pillars, that makes public welfare difficult for engineers to understand what they are doing, how it will impact society. We do need metrics, which can be brought into the picture crafted by \u2018socio- techno\u2019 guys.", "There are a lot of things the engineered minds talk about including data-privacy, IoT, ease of accessibility, 5G, so on and so forth \u2014 At the same time, it opens a world that is close to being easily exploited. One of the best instances for this could be cybersecurity in the education system. Due to increased surveillance, policing, etc. in today\u2019s society for better justice, it also opened a backdoor for unethical means. In modern society, even though we talk about smart cities, most of the funding does come in from the government and business people.", "The foundation for everything? Trust. And that\u2019s where machines lack.", "Well, the solution? A consortium, which can be trusted by people who are nurtured in different circumstances so that everyone can put faith in them. At least, we can look upon somebody who can make decisions regarding the price that human beings will be paying now so to correct the old deeds and for the brighter future of humankind. There is a need for social justice-based society. Emergence in research around decolonizing research methodologies, do show we have started, and we are moving towards the better world. The new generation does know what we lost and the current situation we are facing.", "The big question \u2014 is the technology just smarter, not greener?", "Businesses are scurrying to assimilate data and derive insights, which is giving A.I. an impetus to become stronger and, therefore, deliver better results. But the pylon holding up the burden is the environment. More extensive models, more consumption, and a negative impact on the environment.", "When the \u2018data-hungry\u2019 machines speak, the world listens.", "Carbon emissions. Energy consumption. Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. \u2013They all veil themselves under the influence of shiny insights that machines offer.", "From 2012\u20132018, the energy required for the computation of deep learning has increased around 3,00,000 times [5]. Machine learning models usually require more data and are prone to consume more power. To make those models even more skilled and accurate, one needs more training and execution it becomes a never-ending consumption process.", "Case in point \u2014 OpenAI recently launched its biggest AI-based language model \u2014 GPT3, trained on around 500bn words dataset against the previous GPT2 model that was trained on a dataset of 40bn words [6]. Before this, in 2018, the BERT, the best NLP model, was trained on a dataset of 3bn words and BERT outperformed by XLNet, which was trained on 32bn words [7]. \u2014 These numbers sound very optimistic at the outset, but the risk they come with includes lengthy training sessions translating into more energy consumption, and eventually a significant carbon emission.", "Is there some light at the end of this data tunnel?", "Definitely, there is. A.I. is unarguably saving the environment and boosting the country\u2019s economy to provide transparency in governance. A.I. for environmental applications has the potential to ramp the GDP of a nation by 3.1\u20134.4% if a recent report by PwC has to be believed [8].", "It can reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by around 1.5\u20134.0% by 2030 if the business is done as usual, while raising the GDP by a significant margin [8]. The early GDP gains are visible in a few parts of the world like Europe, North America, and East-Asia, accounting for around 1trillion USD [8] For the energy and transport sector, there could be a cut of about 2% and 1.7% respectively in total greenhouse emissions [8]. Having said that, more focus is still needed towards the water and agriculture in particular as they play a significant role in the environment in a broader sense.", "While A.I. can help make the right decisions, improve climate predictions, and work on allocating renewable resources \u2014 there have to be a few solutions to mitigate the risks.", "\u25cf A.I. model training sessions can be moved to the cloud and hosted near the location where there is a more significant consumption of renewable resources. Since a cloud can store more datasets, it\u2019s also easier to leverage data from different locations.", "\u25cf Making efficient A.I. algorithms can help \u2014 A recent study carried out by the Stanford group evaluated different algorithms for the same task. Results revealed that the difference in the electricity consumption of tuned and un-tuned algorithms was nearly about 880 kilowatt-hours, which is a typical consumption of American households for a month [1]. If we write better code or better models, we can make a daunting impact to reduce the carbon footprint of the application.", "\u25cf Evaluating programs based on the default configuration, and fine-tune the model once it\u2019s fixed. As we know, not only training of the machine learning model demands high energy, but consuming such an A.I. system consumes far more power than training. Evolution not only from algorithmic side needed but also infrastructure built on sustainable energy will also be required to facilitate such a vast A.I. dependent application.", "Well, let\u2019s hope for the A.I. pipeline to become environmentally sustainable \u2014 wouldn\u2019t that be the literal best of both worlds?", "Your home for data science.
