One of their strengths lies in the fact that they explicitly model relations (i.e. edges) between individual units (i.e. nodes), which adds an extra dimension to the data. We can illustrate this enrichment of data using the Cora citation network. This is a dataset contains a bag-of-words representation for a few hundred papers and the citation relations between each of these papers. If we apply dimensionality reduction (t-SNE) to create a 2D plot of the bag-of-words representations, we can see clusters (of similar research topics) arise but they overlap. If we produce an embedding with a graph network, that takes into account the citation information, we can see the clusters being better separated.", "Knowledge Graphs are a specific type of graph. They are multi-relational (i.e. there are different edges for different types of relations) and directed (i.e. the relations have a subject and object). Fortunately, we can convert the knowledge graphs to regular directed graphs, which facilitates further analysis.", "Graphs are increasingly being leveraged for various machine learning tasks. For example, one might recommend new friends to a user in a social network, predict the role of a person in a collaboration network, or classify the role of a protein in a biological interaction graph. In this post, we will focus on the task of node classification: we are provided with a set of labeled nodes in a graph and need to create a model that can predict the class of unlabeled nodes.", "In this post, we shall use a running example where the goal is to classify researchers in their correct institution. Below I depicted 5 researchers. Their color corresponds to their institution. We can retrieve the neighbors of these nodes to expand our graph. As can be seen, the graph quickly grows in size. After 2 iterations of expanding, we can no longer intuitively visualize our graph.", "Our goal is to mine walks (or paths in the graph) that are very discriminative for a certain class. We can notate a walk as follows:", "This walk can be found in the neighborhood of \u201croot\u201d if it has a directed going to \u201cv0\u201d. From there, a directed edge between \u201cv0\u201d and \u201cv1\u201d has to exist and so on until we reach \u201cvn\u201d. If suddenly we can no longer traverse an edge to end up in the next hop of our walk, we say that the walk cannot be found.", "Further, we introduce wildcards (\u201c*\u201d) in our walk. The semantics of this wildcards is that any vertex can be matched on that location:", "Now this walk can be found in the neighborhood of root if it has a directed edge to a node that has a directed edge to v1. The label on the intermediary node does not matter.", "MINDWALC (Mining Interpretable, Discriminative Walks for Classification of Nodes in a Knowledge Graph) is a technique that allows to efficiently mine for walks of a specific format. A walk of l hops must consists of l-1 wildcards, followed by a vertex in the end:", "This walk can be found in the neighborhood of root if x can be reached in l hops. Due to the format of this walk, we can introduce a datastructure that will allow to test whether such a walk can be found in a neighborhood in constant time. The datastructure is a list of sets. Each set, on index i in the list, contains the nodes that can be reached in exactly i hops. A code snippet on how this datastructure can be constructed is displayed below:", "The goal of MINDWALC is to find the walk that can maximize information gain. Information gain can be defined as the reduction in entropy resulting from partitioning the data. Entropy is a measure for uncertainty, as depicted below:", "Due to the fact that we can test for the presence of these specific walks in constant time, we can perform a brute-force search over all possible (depth, vertex) candidates. The depth defines the number of hops in our walk (so we will have depth -1 wildcards) and the vertex is the label of our final hop.", "Our mining algorithm can be combined with several classification techniques. First, we can apply the algorithm recursively in order to induce a decision tree. The resulting model is fully interpretable, since we can easily visualize the entire tree or highlight the taken path in our decision tree to form a prediction. We demonstrate this further in this post by inspecting and discussing an induced decision tree. Second, we can induce multiple decision trees, each with a subsample of both training entities and possible substructures, in order to form a forest. This ensemble technique often results in better predictive performances, but comes at a cost of lower interpretability and longer training time. Finally, we can decouple the modeling and mining by performing a single pass over the data to mine a collection of informative walks. These walks can then be used to create high-dimensional binary feature vectors (feature transform) that can be passed to any classification algorithm.", "We compared our technique to two black-box alternatives using four benchmark datasets. The black-box alternatives are RDF2Vec and R-GCN. The properties of the four benchmark datasets are listed in the following table:", "For each data set, we performed 10 runs. The average accuracy scores achieved on the test set and their corresponding standard deviations are summarized below:", "These results clearly show that all three of the proposed techniques are at least competitive to the current state-of-the-art for node classification in KGs. To conclude, we inspect a decision tree that is induced on the AIFB dataset, our running example of classifying different researchers:", "In the root node, we find the walk root -> * -> * -> * -> * -> * -> viewProjektOWL/id68instance. When this walk can be found in the neighborhood of an instance, it can no longer be of the research affiliation id4instance, as this leaf does not occur in the subtree on the right. Moreover, this type of walk already demonstrates the added value of having a fixed depth, by the use of wildcards, in our walk. As a matter of fact, we could end up in an entity which is of a type Project in only two hops (e.g. root -> * -> viewProjektOWL/id68instance) from an instance, but this results in a lot less information gain than when six hops need to be taken. When inspecting the original KG, it appears that only two people, who are both from affiliation id3instance, are directly involved in the Project id68instance, or in other words where this path with only two hops could be matched. On the other hand, it appears that these two people have written quite a large amount of papers with the other researchers in their affiliation. As such, a walk that first hops from a certain person (the root) to one of his or her papers, and going from there to one of the two people mentioned earlier through an author predicate can be found for 45 people from affiliation id3instance, 3 people from id2instance and 2 people from id1instance. The remaining nodes in the right subtree from the root are less informative, since these will try to split the 5 people from both affiliation id2instance and id1instance from the 45 others.", "This concludes this blog post on MINDWALC. MINDWALC is an algorithm that allows mining for a specific type of walks that are informative for certain (groups of) classes, in the context of node classification for Knowledge Graphs. Moreover, we show that this algorithm is a good basis for a predictive model, when used in combination with one of three different techniques proposed in this work. Experiments on four KG benchmark data sets show that our proposed approaches outperform the current state-of-the-art while, in contrast to these techniques, being completely interpretable. This is of great importance for applications situated in critical domains.", "Your home for data science.
