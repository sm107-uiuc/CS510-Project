Thinking about how the trolley problem applied to self driving cars led me to change my mind, and now I believe their benefits outweigh their risks so much that it is morally imperative that we try to build and deploy them as soon as possible. Some of the ethical dilemmas they pose still hold though, and therefore their widespread adoption needs to be carefully planned for and include certain guardrails.", "I used to really hate the idea of self-driving cars. It was petty jealousy: In the public mind, self-driving cars were emblematic of the possibilities that the current A.I. and M.L. paradigm shift promised. On the other hand, very few people outside of the domains of retail and data science understood that my own day job of demand forecasting and inventory optimization were just as deserving of the A.I. moniker as any computer vision or NLP problem.", "Ok, that was very childish of me. Actually, there were two deeper, much more serious reasons for my thinking that self-driving cars were going to cause more evil than good:", "To recap, I seriously feared the arrival of L5 autonomous vehicles because: (1) They presented ethical dilemmas that were likely going to be resolved in favor of big corporations and to the detriment of rider safety and finances, and (2) they were likely going to lead to massive and sudden displacement of workers, which we as a society are not equipped to deal with.", "The trolley problem is a thought experiment that was proposed in its modern form by Philippa Foot in 1967. Its basic formulation is the following:", "You are watching a trolley that is running out of control down a hill on its tracks, and there are 5 people stuck to the tracks whom it will run over in a matter of seconds, so that there is no chance to free them from the tracks before that happens. Next to you is a lever, which if pulled, will redirect the trolley to a side track, on which there is a 5 year old girl playing. If you pull the lever, the 5 people are saved, but the little girl dies. If you don\u2019t pull the lever, the 5 people die, but nothing happens the girl. Should you pull the lever, or should you let the trolley continue on its track?", "This is an outlandish scenario that would almost never occur in real life. Its original purpose was to demonstrate the possible conflicts between consequentialist ethics (where outcomes determine which action is most ethical) and deontological ethics (where universal rules determine which action is most ethical): A consequentialist would choose pull the lever to save the 5 people and sacrifice the girl, since 5 lives are worth more than one, whereas a deontologist would choose not to pull the lever, since he would otherwise be murdering an innocent girl, while by doing nothing, he hasn\u2019t committed any wrongs, even if it is tough luck for the 5 people stuck on the original path (note that we don\u2019t consider the case of guilt by inaction here).", "For most of its existence, the trolley problem was mostly of academic interest, or something to be brought up at a dinner party to make oneself appear interesting and profound. Nobody was likely to actually face a real world situation where they had a few short seconds to engage in moral calculs and decide whether they were a disciple of Emmanuel Kant or a disciple of John Stuart Mill. Well almost. It did happen once, with a train, not a trolley.", "But with autonomous vehicles becoming a very real possibility, the trolley problem suddenly was a very practical problem indeed:", "What happens when a self-driving vehicle, equipped with the latest image recognition and entity detection algorithms, finds itself in a situation where it has to decide between hitting 5 people on the left, and a young girl on the right? An algorithm would need to be provided to make such a decision: Do we make it an optimization problem with a numerical objective function that calculates how many lives will be saved with each course of action? Or do we encode some categorical \u201cif-then\u201d type rules that reflect the principle \u201cThou shalt not harm an innocent person, not matter what the cost\u201d?", "The problem started generating a whole bunch of buzz: Philosophy grads could now contemplate product manager roles at Google, instead of being condemned to a life of community college instruction. Developers would love to try to solve this type of problem, instead of spending their days and nights slaving to come up with another micro-service REST API that maybe 5 people will use over the next 2 years. The intersection of deep philosophical question and algorithmic/modelling challenge made everybody feel like they were in a real life version of an Asimov story. The people who brought up the trolley problem at dinner parties could now name drop Tesla and Waymo in the midst of philosophy banter, and come off as both profound intellectuals and connected to the cutting edge tech scene\u2026", "I was recently reminded of this new incarnation of the Trolley problem when I came across this excellent post: \u201cThe Trolley Problem is No Longer Theoretical\u201d. It gives a clear and lucid overview of the Trolley Problem, as well a good primer on the various ethical frameworks (deontological, consequentialist, etc\u2026) that can be used to approach an A.I. ethics dilemma.", "I started working through the logic of the trolley problem to try to figure out why it was a real world dilemma for A.I. driven vehicles, but rarely so for human drivers? After all, Foot\u2019s original formulation involved a human decision maker, and based on that, it isn\u2019t that farfetched to imagine that dealing with \u201cTrolley Problem-like\u201d situations would in fact be part of the standard road rules training materials when preparing for a driver\u2019s license test.", "The answer is: humans drivers would rarely be able to resort to logic in such situations. They wouldn\u2019t be able to make such lightening fast purely rational calculations in their heads, while they are also trying to maintain control of a collision bound vehicle, AND also seriously contemplating their own mortality. They won\u2019t be able to process information at the required speed, let alone do so while also managing the emotions, adrenaline, and whatever other physiological effects, that are arising from the fact of an impeding unavoidable collision.", "This is when it struck me: Self-driving cars will be much better drivers than humans! First of all, even though autonomous vehicles will have to deal with the occasional technical defect or software bug, overall they will be much less error prone than human drivers. A self-driving car is never going to text and drive, or drive under the influence, or intentionally drive above the speed limit, etc\u2026", "More importantly (w/r to the Trolly Problem), they will be much more rational when making split second decisions during a collision or some other high risk situation. Hence, they will need to be able to perform the type of ethical calculus required to solve dilemmas such as the Trolley Problem. Humans, on the other hand, are too slow, too dependent on physiological factors, and too emotionally biased to ever be able to resolve them within the necessary time frames, and such ethical dilemmas have no practical relevancy to their driving skills. Now we understand why knowledge of the Trolley Problem isn\u2019t required when taking a driver\u2019s license test.", "Ok, but then if self-driving cars will be better drivers than human drivers, then there is a lot more at stake here than just edge cases like the Trolley Problem, or questions of liability and agency w/r to autonomous vehicles.", "The vast majority of car accidents are caused by various human errors: Distracted driving, reckless driving, driving while fatigued, driving under the influence, failure to signal, etc\u2026see the below table for example for the statistics on contributing causes to collisions from my home state of Washington for 2015 (I think it is safe to assume that similar patterns are occurring at the national level, and in most other developed countries as well).", "This means that wide spread adoption of self-driving vehicles will significantly reduce the number of fatalities, injuries, and the amount of material and financial damage that occurs due to traffic accidents. In fact, it is conceivable that self-driving car technology will progress (by combining M.L. and A.I. with various control engineering and rule based guard rails) to a point where car collisions are brought to a number near zero. Although some of the ethical dilemmas discussed above (Trolley Problem, liability and moral agency of self-driving cars, etc\u2026) will still remain relevant, their importance diminishes significantly compared to the overarching benefit of autonomous vehicles in terms of lives saved (notice here that I am using a consequentialist mind set in order to make that last statement).", "Today\u2019s cars are on average 95% idle. Let\u2019s start by looking at my own household\u2019s usage patterns: Every morning I drive 2.8 miles/7 minutes to the bus station closest to our house, and leave my car at the bus station for the day and take the bus to downtown Seattle. My wife works from home most of the time but has to go teach classes at the University of Washington 2 days a week. She drives her car about 6 miles/14 minutes to the local campus. Her commute times are always different than mine. For other tasks such as shopping and on weekends, we only ever use my car. Because of this single time conflict, 2 mornings a week between my commute schedule and my wife\u2019s commute schedule means that we have to keep two cars in our household instead of one.", "With a self driving car, this will no longer be the case. The self-driving car takes me to the bus station. On days when my wife needs to go to UW, the car returns home on its own, and then takes my wife to the campus. I might text her or email her during the day, telling her that I will be back at the bus station at 18:00, at which point she can send the car to come pick me up. We get the same logistic flexibility of our previous two cars, with roughly equivalent emissions rates, but now with the environmental footprint of manufacturing and maintaining only a single car instead of two.", "Using suitable optimization and vehicle routing techniques, the above mentioned advantages can be applied to much larger groups of people and organizations. In theory, we can effectively get to a point where each population center has a single group transportation system that still provides the logistic flexibility of individually owned vehicles but with a significantly smaller number of vehicles (Although the social obstacles to getting to such a u\u0335n\u0335i\u0335v\u0335e\u0335r\u0335s\u0335a\u0335l\u0335 \u0335p\u0335u\u0335b\u0335l\u0335i\u0335c\u0335 \u0335t\u0335r\u0335a\u0335n\u0335s\u0335p\u0335o\u0335r\u0335t\u0335a\u0335t\u0335i\u0335o\u0335n\u0335 system, at least here in the U.S., will be daunting). This is, of course, translates into a significant reduction in the environmental impact of car manufacturing and maintenance, along with the social (and mental health) benefits that will come with a significant reduction in traffic jams and commute times.", "So now we\u2019ve established that self-driving cars have the potential to do the following:", "Because of this, I now believe that the potential benefits of self-driving cars are so compelling and crucial to improving the human condition, that it becomes a moral imperative for the authorities and organizations that have the power to do so, to put all their efforts in building L5 autonomous vehicles and ensuring their wide spread adoption as soon as possible.", "Let me put it in another, more dramatic way:", "An estimated 1.25 million people around the world die annualy from car crashes. Hence, the moral obligation of developed nation governments and major tech corporations have to try to develop L5 self-driving cars as soon as possible, is the same type of moral obligation as the one that world governments and medical institutes have to develop a vaccine when a dangerous infectious disease such as SARS or the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus.", "I realize that that is a very strong, even radical statement. But as I argued above, I believe that the positive human and environmental impacts of self-driving cars are indeed such that they justify such an imperative.", "Great, if you buy that argument, then we\u2019re all set!!! Self-driving cars are more or less an absolute good, and any responsible good citizen who cares about his future grand-kids and hates traffic jams should start calling his congressperson and/or try to get a job at Waymo. In this new grandiose view of autonomous-vehicles, those pesky ethical dilemmas are no longer existential questions. Instead, they are mere design details that whichever software team is slated to work on them can worry about, while we quiver in anticipation of a cleaner, traffic-jamless planet, where a 17 year old on Snapchat no longer has the ability to destroy a family.", "Not so fast!!!! We\u2019ve actually made the dilemma worse\u2026", "We forgot about my second serious issue with autonomous vehicles: The sudden and large scale technological unemployment of just about anybody who drives a land vehicle for a living. In fact, we now find ourselves dealing with a \u201cmacro\u201d level version of the Trolley problem:", "When weighing the potential benefits of self-driving cars, versus staying hung up on various philosophical riddles like the original autonomous vehicle Trolley problem or the question of the moral agency of a self-driving car, the choice was obvious.", "But when we factor in the question of technological unemployment, then doing a simple cost-benefit analysis is no longer possible. In fact, we start to see the limitations of the consequentialist approach: calculating the utility in such scenarios is intractable \u2014 only a few 10s of millions of professional drivers are impacted, compared to all of humanity, but have we factored in their families and communities? What about the ripple effect of such massive unemployment on the economy and society as a whole? It is conceivable that such large scale unemployment will lead to social strife so bad that it cancels out the benefits of self-driving vehicles in the first place.", "At this point, we have to move into Kantian territory: Kant, whose approach to ethics epitomizes the deontological approach, speaks of the \u201cKingdom of Ends\u201d, an ideal society where every person is treated as an \u201cEnd\u201d in and of themselves, and no human being is ever treated as a mere means of achieving another person\u2019s or group\u2019s goals, no matter how noble or lofty those other goals are.", "Here is a very dark, gruesome thought experiment to illustrate the Kantian concept of Kingdom of Ends:", "Imagine that I told you could achieve a last durable world peace: A sustainable end to all wars and all conflicts and ideological fights, but only if you performed the following ritual: You need to take a 4 year old child and imprison them in a dark basement for the rest of their life, and everyday, you have to go into the basement and torture them with a blow torch for 30 minutes. Is this an acceptable price to pay for world peace?", "Most people would answer with a resounding \u201cNO!\u201d.", "From this point of view, it does not matter how car collisions can be potentially averted or what the environmental impact of such a radical reduction in the number of circulating vehicles is: As long as the dignity of even one single person, an \u201cEnd\u201d, is trampled on, then self-driving vehicles are not the absolute positive that I argued they were earlier.", "There is hope, I think. Although I do argue further back that the wide scale adoption of self-driving cars will be a lot faster than it was for other technologies, extreme convenience and efficiency of free markets obligent, it still won\u2019t be instantaneous. Between the first successful production model of an L5 self-driving car, and its wide spread adoption, there will still be a period of a few months (or at least I hope so. If our tech and our business models evolve at a quicker pace than that, then we have bigger A.I. related problems on our hands, and we should all brace for the digital apocalypse). During this time period, the various world governments and organizations might be able explore various solutions. These solutions would have to be well planned (in order to be executed with minimal disruption) and they need to be courageous.", "As an example of the type of policy that could be implemented: I was at a marine biology conference in 2003 (in a past life, I spent my days applying neural networks and forecasting algorithms to sardine and mackerel populations). The representatives from Mauritius explained how their government, as part of an effort to save their coral reefs, actually paid coastal fisherman full salaries to not fish in any of the impacted reef areas. This is what I meant by courageous: Will the U.S. government ever have the courage to pay the 3000000+ American truck drivers to NOT DRIVE trucks for a period of 4 or 5 years, or provide some other form of safety net, while they transition into new forms of employment?", "You will have noticed by this point that I use the word \u2018potential\u2019 a lot when referring to the benefits of self-driving cars. This is not because I think the future of L5 autonomous vehicles is in some ways uncertain. Not at all. It is because of a deeper risk:", "Just because a new technology has the potential to significantly improve the human condition, doesn\u2019t mean the technology\u2019s actual deployment will lead to that outcome. Just look at the Internet, which was supposed to be a tool of knowledge sharing and unification, but has instead become the opposite: A tool for misinformation, propaganda, and division. Or closer to the topic at hand: Look at ride hailing services, which promised to reduce the number of circulating vehicles, since many people would find using them as their default transportation method to be less hassle and more cost effective than owning a car. Instead, they lead to an increase in the number of vehicles in many major cities, as driving for a ride sharing service was seen as an easy to access and flexible job that required little or no qualifications.", "The same risks apply to self-driving cars: Their deployment into society will have to be done carefully and guided so that we as a society work towards achieving their potential benefits. Otherwise, they risk turning into something different, leading to more car accidents, not less, or turning our already congested roads into autonomous Deep Convolutional Network-driven anarchy. Most online advertising services today are fully automated and run by customer targeting ML algorithms without any human intervention whatsoever \u2014 look at the resulting junk sites, spam windows, and malware webpages that have come to define the modern browsing experience. Now take those same design principles, business models, and technological excesses that characterize the online add industry, and apply them to autonomous vehicles that range from the size of a Roomba to that of an 18 Wheeler, and imagine the effect on our infrastructure and environment\u2026.you see? The very thought of it is too scary to contemplate.", "This is all to say that in order to prevent the deployment of self-driving cars from devolving into algorithmic-mechanical chaos, governments and big tech will have to work in concert to ensure that their adoption and use follow strict plans and rules, keeping Kant\u2019s concept of the \u201cKingdom of Ends\u201d as a guiding principle at all stages.", "How can world governments pull off the required level of coordinated planning, given how little they have agreed on just about any other important global issue? I don\u2019t know, but I do have hope because in this case, Bigtech has the influence, the means, and the self-interest to guide the proper deployment of self-driving vehicles in the right direction.", "In this post, I explained how I went from feeling that self-driving cars were going to be a source of problems more than anything else, to believing that the advantages of using self-driving cars will solve so many problems that it is a moral imperative for governments and tech companies to deliver them as soon as possible. I argue that, despite all of their positive impacts, autonomous vehicles will still lead to unseen levels of technological employment, with dire social and economic consequences. I argue that, based on Kant\u2019s notion of the Kingdom of Ends, we should not dismiss the plight of those whose were made redundant by autonomous vehicles, since that would be treating them as means, not ends. Finally, I call out that once the necessary technical innovations are achieved, the deployment of L5 self-driving cars for public use should be done with care and according to predetermined plans, in order to ensure that they do indeed full fill their promise, as well as to mitigate the effect of the worker displacement that they will cause.", "Your home for data science.
