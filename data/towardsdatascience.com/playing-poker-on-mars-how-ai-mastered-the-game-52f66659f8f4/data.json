At a superficial level poker is a more casual, social, and approachable strategy game than chess or Go. Gambling is inextricably wound into poker, bringing professional gamblers on one extreme and recreational dreamers on the other into the game in significant numbers. It is also a popular home game, where friends and foes alike get together at someone\u2019s house \u2014 or online poker lobby \u2014 for regular play. Poker can make a good case for being America\u2019s game, with similar popularity in many other parts of the world.", "Poker calls on our raw intelligence, it also requires softer skills like reading other players, bluffing against the odds, and imposing your will in psychological ways. Whereas games like chess and Go are perfect information games \u2014 where it make sense for machine intelligence to brute force its way past \u2014 poker combines simple math and percentages with a variety of perceptive skills that seem uniquely human. Or at least we thought. As it turns out, those soft, human skills may not matter.", "In January 2017, Libratus, an AI-enhanced software program, defeated four professional poker players over 120,000 hands of poker play. This was the latest conquest of top humans by software in apex strategy games, following on the heels of Deep Blue\u2019s 1997 victory over Garry Kasparov and AlphaGo\u2019s 2016 win against Lee Sedol. However, contrary to what many humans expected \u2014 that Libratus would need to vary its play based on each opponent \u2014 the AI instead crushed the poker pros by completely ignoring them as individuals. The computer didn\u2019t consider the psychology that is so core to some human professionals\u2019 theory of the game \u2014 tried-and-true tactics such as looking for \u201ctells\u201d and getting to know the player. It just played the best moves, from a huge range of possible choices, following a strategy that it ruthlessly applied over, and over, and over.", "We spoke with Noam Brown, a co-creator of Libratus who gave us a deep dive into how the AI learned the game of poker and beat the human professionals. \u201cAIs have traditionally been very successful in dealing with perfect information games, like chess or Go, where both players know exactly what\u2019s going on at all times,\u201d says Brown. \u201cIn a game of Go, or a game of chess, all the information that you need is available to you to make a decision. But in a game like poker, there\u2019s hidden information. You don\u2019t know what cards your opponent is holding. So, you always have to act with this uncertainty about what their strategy is, or what situation you\u2019re in. This is particularly challenging for AI. It makes things way more difficult. It makes it way harder to compute a strategy.\u201d", "\u201cSo for a long time researchers in AI just sort of ignored the issue,\u201d says Brown. \u201cAnd they focused on these perfect information games like chess and Go. Just sort of pretended that problems like poker didn\u2019t exist really. Which is really unsatisfying. So, there were some of us, myself included, that thought this was a problem that we should address. Because the truth is, most real world situations involve hidden information. You can make an AI that plays chess, but it\u2019s not going to be that useful in the real world if there\u2019s hidden information involved.\u201d", "So how does Libratus work? \u201cThese algorithms are trying to find what\u2019s called the Nash equilibrium,\u201d says Brown. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to find a perfect strategy. Now, a Nash equilibrium is proven to exist in any game. In particular, in two player, zero-sum games, if you\u2019re playing according to the Nash equilibrium strategy, then you are guaranteed to not lose in expectation no matter what your opponent does. This is what the AI is trying to find. It\u2019s not trying to adapt to its opponent. It\u2019s trying to find this Nash equilibrium strategy, and play according to it. Because it knows that if it\u2019s playing this Nash equilibrium, then no matter what its opponent does, it\u2019s not going to lose.\u201d", "\u201cI think the idea the Nash equilibrium exists, the idea that this perfect strategy exists in poker is surprising to a lot of people. But if you think about it for a minute, you can see this in smaller games. So, for example, in rock, paper, scissors. We all know what the Nash equilibrium strategy is: It\u2019s to throw rock, paper and scissors one-third probability each. If you were to do that, if you were to just play that strategy, then no matter what your opponent does, you\u2019re going to not lose in expectation. In the case of rock, paper, scissors, you\u2019re not going to win in expectation. No, you\u2019re just going to tie in expectation.\u201d", "\u201cBut in a complicated game like poker, if you\u2019re able to play the Nash equilibrium strategy, then it\u2019s likely your opponent will make mistakes. But playing the Nash equilibrium strategy, you will, in practice, win, because you\u2019re playing the perfect strategy. So, we\u2019re not trying to adapt to the opponent. In fact, during the competition, we never looked at the cards the opponent had, for example. We never cared which player we were playing against. We were always playing the same exact strategy no matter who the opponent was.\u201d", "For the Nash equilibrium strategy to work, though, you need a human. There is a saying in poker that if you look around the table and can\u2019t pick out the sucker then it is probably you. In a world of AI poker players, the humans are the suckers, because no matter how hard we try, we will never achieve perfect Nash equilibrium. Machines, however, can.", "Despite AI\u2019s success against top professionals in chess and Go, the poker world was surprised by Libratus\u2019 superiority. \u201cI think it was probably a little bit humbling for the players,\u201d says Ben Saxton, a New Orleans-based writer, teacher, and serious poker player who works as a poker journalist. \u201cThey were taken a little bit by surprise.\u201d Just two years previous, poker pros beat, but notably did not dominate, a competition with Claudico, another poker playing AI engine. \u201cLibratus apparently was much improved from its predecessor.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for a computer to take down a strong player, to take down an elite player,\u201d says Saxton. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing for Libratus to beat convincingly four of the best, heads-up, no-limit Texas Hold \u2019Em players in the world, and that\u2019s what happened. I don\u2019t think it was necessarily even a disappointing thing. I think it might have been initially a bit surprising and humbling, but in the end I think it reaffirms those who believe strongly in a so-called GTO approach.\u201d", "GTO is an acronym for \u201cgame theory optimal\u201d, a more recent and increasingly dominant approach to poker. So you want to be a poker pro? In a world of big data-powered GTO, the dream of becoming a poker pro might be as good as dead. Libratus essentially validated the GTO approach as optimal for defeating top pros. That is not absolutely the case, however: \u201cI think a big part of it depends on who you\u2019re playing against and at what level,\u201d says Saxton. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s too much controversy about whether or not you want to be playing a GTO balanced strategy at the very highest limits. I think that if you\u2019re deviating from an optimal strategy, you\u2019re gonna be playing against really savvy opponents who will exploit you. You really want to avoid that.\u201d", "This is an important bit of nuance: Libratus may in fact be better at optimizing its results against the very best players as opposed to worse players. As a player\u2019s skill goes down, an exploitative strategy that is reacting in the moment \u2014 something that Libratus is incapable of \u2014 is best. This gives us guidance for how machines will behave in other contexts, what their strengths and limitations will be.", "Libratus is driven by machine learning, where the software is composing its own notion of strategy and play, as opposed to being directed by a human. \u201cThe way that [Libratus] does this is through self-play,\u201d says Brown. \u201cIt\u2019s actually very similar to how humans learn to play a game. You learn from experience. So the AI starts by knowing nothing about the game. It plays totally randomly and it plays a copy of itself, in that game, for trillions of iterations \u2014 trillions of hands of poker, for example.\u201d Trillions of hands is a quantifiable reminder of the advantage AI today has in understanding something compared to humans. We may have our own advantages such as broader context and more varied toolsets, but at some point the ability to practice trillions of times is an incredible edge to the machine.", "There are three components to the Libratus AI. Brown describes how each component contributes to Libratus\u2019 ability to defeat highly skilled human players in competition: \u201cNow the first component is \u2026 trying to estimate this Nash equilibrium. Now we\u2019re not finding a perfect Nash equilibrium through this self-play component, but we\u2019re getting a rough approximation of what the Nash equilibrium would be. We\u2019re doing that offline before the competition ever begins, and so we come into the competition with a strategy that the AI thinks is pretty strong. But it\u2019s not perfect.\u201d", "The second component of Libratus is real-time equilibrium computation during the competition. Libratus was able to sharpen its edge as it moved forward in real-time. \u201cWhen [Libratus] is actually playing against a human in a particular hand of poker, and it\u2019s on the third betting round, for example, it will compute in real time the closer approximation to the Nash equilibrium for the situation that it\u2019s in at that moment,\u201d says Brown. With this real-time component, Libratus determines a better strategy for a particular situation, but one that fits within the blueprint it has computed for the game as a whole. \u201cI think that was actually the big breakthrough with Libratus,\u201d says Brown. \u201cNobody had really found an effective way of doing real-time equilibrium computation in imperfect information games before.\u201d", "The third component of the Libratus AI enabled it to learn from opponents \u2014 but in a perhaps, unusual way. \u201cNow, I want to make it clear, it was not adapting to the opponents,\u201d says Brown. \u201cIt was not trying to exploit the opponents in any way. \u2026 Because the AI is not perfect, it\u2019s not computing a perfect Nash equilibrium. There are some parts in the game tree \u2026 different situations where it\u2019s playing suboptimally. That\u2019s a problem, because if it\u2019s playing suboptimally, there are opportunities for the humans to exploit it in those situations.\u201d And that\u2019s, of course, what human opponents were constantly attempting throughout the competition: Searching for Libratus\u2019 weaknesses, so they could take advantage of the AI. So, at the end of each day of competition, Libratus would review those situations where the humans were trying to exploit it and develop a better strategy \u2014 a closer approximation of the Nash equilibrium \u2014 for those circumstances. \u201cThe next day, [Libratus] would have a much better strategy in those situations, so it would be far less exploitable for those points,\u201d says Brown. \u201cSo this led to a sort of cat-and-mouse kind of game. Because every day the humans would try to find a weakness and take advantage of it, and at the end of each day, the AI would fix those weaknesses in preparation for the next day. As the competition progressed, these holes that were in the AI shrunk and got smaller and smaller over time. The humans had even less opportunity to exploit the AI.\u201d", "Because Libratus learned poker in its own way, unlike any human could even possibly learn, the AI enjoyed some positive unintended consequences reimagining the game. \u201cBecause [Libratus] was trained from self-play \u2014 from playing against the copy of itself starting from scratch, without knowing anything about the game \u2014 it never looked at human data. And it came with a very different strategy compared to how humans play,\u201d says Brown. When Libratus started a match, human opponents felt like they were playing an alien. \u201cIt was like playing somebody who had learned to play poker on Mars,\u201d says Brown.", "For instance, Libratus placed bets in a fashion vastly different from human convention. \u201cIn the human poker world, you typically bet a fraction of the pot,\u201d says Brown. \u201cSo, if there is $300 in the pot, then you might bet $150. And you might bet $300. And, maybe in some really rare circumstances, you might bet $500, at most.\u201d But Libratus didn\u2019t constrain its bets to fractional amounts, choosing instead to bet 3x, 5x, and sometimes even 100x the pot. \u201c[Libratus] would have no problem putting $20,000 into a $200 pot,\u201d says Brown. \u201cThis was a big shock to the humans. It was very frustrating for them in particular, because they could be in a situation where they have a really, really strong hand, maybe the second best hand that\u2019s possible. Then suddenly, the bot bets $20,000 into a $500 pot. The bot is basically saying, \u2018I\u2019m either bluffing or I have the best hand.\u2019\u201d Libratus\u2019 betting tactics stymied the human players, forcing them to spend significant time considering their response. \u201cYou could see the humans sometimes taking five or ten minutes to make a decision,\u201d says Brown. \u201cIt was very frustrating for them. It was very satisfying for me.\u201d", "\u201c[Libratus] was bluffing,\u201d says Brown. \u201cIt learned to bluff, of course, because you have to bluff to play poker well. But the situations that it chose to bluff in were pretty different \u2026 from what humans would do. \u2026 In fact, the humans that [Libratus] played against, they told us that they were going to take some of these strategies and start using it in their own play. In particular, these big over bets, betting huge amounts to the pot in some situations. They said that that\u2019s something they\u2019re going to do in the future when they play against humans.\u201d", "AI, in general, is only able to do a narrow bit of things, and yet teams like the one that developed Libratus are trying to create engines that are more adaptable, that deal with certain types of factors that are relevant to multiple domains. Even if we are going to be in the world of narrow AI for a while yet, not surprisingly there is a push to create engines that are not just one-trick ponies.", "Brown shares a bit more about what the Libratus team has planned: \u201cThe things that we\u2019re developing are not specific to poker. They\u2019re applicable to any imperfect information game. \u2026 Financial markets are an imperfect information game, so are negotiations, so are auctions, so are military situations. So we see a lot of potential for applying these techniques to other domains in the future.\u201d", "There are challenges in expanding Libratus to other areas like negotiations and financial markets. Poker, of course, is a zero-sum game. Any money that you\u2019re winning, you\u2019re taking from your opponent. \u201cThose games [like poker] have nice properties that make it easier to compute an equilibrium solution. \u2026 But, if you\u2019re dealing with a negotiation for example, you have win-win outcomes. It\u2019s not zero-sum.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s important to understand. It\u2019s important to understand that you and your adversary can both win in this game. The techniques that are needed are a little bit different from the zero-sum setting. So, figuring out how to adapt the techniques that we have to this general sum setting that is one of the things that we\u2019re looking at in the short term. I think that\u2019s the smaller obstacle to overcome,\u201d says Brown. \u201cThe bigger obstacle is that when you\u2019re moving from a game to the real world, your strategies and your payoffs are not well-defined.\u201d", "The win-win scenarios Brown describes require context \u2014 and perhaps a lot of it \u2014 to solve successfully. So far, AI is awful at context. It uses data in ways we are incapable of, but is unable to apply broader context, much less more nuanced aspects of personality.", "However, as different contexts are optimized or automated we begin to understand that what we think of as creativity can indeed be replicated by machines. That the ways to win games like poker generally come back to math, not human discretion. And that even things as core to our concept of humanity seem more and more illusory. In the decades and centuries ahead our notion of being human will likely undergo a radical rethinking thanks to the discoveries of science and the achievements of thinking machines.", "Creative Next is a podcast exploring the impact of AI-driven automation on the lives of creative workers, people like writers, researchers, artists, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs.
