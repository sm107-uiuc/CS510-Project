That\u2019s where libraries like TPOT come into play.", "If you\u2019re more of a video person, or just want to reinforce your knowledge, feel free to watch our video on the topic. Source code is included:", "Let\u2019s face the facts \u2014 machine learning isn\u2019t as interesting as hyped by the media. You can do amazing things with it, don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m only talking about the actual machine learning process. You know, the process of finding an optimal algorithm and its hyperparameters.", "It\u2019s good this part is getting (or already got) automated \u2014 since we as engineers can focus on more interesting things.", "The ideal reader is someone familiar with the Python programming language and with the general flow of a machine learning project. You don\u2019t have to be an expert, or even work in the field, but it\u2019s expected that you\u2019re familiar with the most common algorithms and how to use them.", "The article is structured as follows:", "So without much ado, let\u2019s get started!", "TPOT, or Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool is a Python library for automated machine learning. Here\u2019s the official definition:", "Consider TPOT your Data Science Assistant. TPOT is a Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.[1]", "In a way, TPOT is your data science assistant. It automates the \u201cboring\u201d stuff and leaves you with the tasks of data gathering and preparation. I know this segment isn\u2019t fun to some of you \u2014 but it\u2019s 80% of the job. With libraries like TPOT, that percentage might only get higher.", "Plus, data gathering and preparation can\u2019t be fully automated, for obvious reasons. Another sentence over at the official documentation drives the point home:", "TPOT will automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring thousands of possible pipelines to find the best one for your data.[1]", "Let\u2019s take a quick look at your average machine learning pipeline to see where TPOT fits in:", "As you can see, the library automates every tedious portion of the process.", "But how? By using something known as \u201cgenetic programming\u201d. Let\u2019s explore this term in the next section.", "The official website summarizes the concept pretty well:", "Genetic Programming (GP) is a type of Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), a subset of machine learning. EAs are used to discover solutions to problems humans do not know how to solve, directly. Free of human preconceptions or biases, the adaptive nature of EAs can generate solutions that are comparable to, and often better than the best human efforts.", "Inspired by biological evolution and its fundamental mechanisms, GP software systems implement an algorithm that uses random mutation, crossover, a fitness function, and multiple generations of evolution to resolve a user-defined task. GP can be used to discover a functional relationship between features in data (symbolic regression), to group data into categories (classification), and to assist in the design of electrical circuits, antennae, and quantum algorithms. GP is applied to software engineering through code synthesis, genetic improvement, automatic bug-fixing, and in developing game-playing strategies, \u2026 and more.[2]", "With the right data and the right amounts of data, we can use machine learning to learn any function. Still, knowing which algorithm to use can be daunting \u2014 there\u2019s just too many of them. And we still haven't touched the idea of hyperparameter tweaking.", "That\u2019s where genetic programming really shines, because it is inspired by the Darwinian process of Natural Selection, and they are used to generate solutions to optimization in computer science.", "Sounds like a lot, definitely, but TPOT doesn\u2019t require us to be experts in genetic programming. Knowing the concepts is, as always, beneficial.", "Okay, we have the theory part covered thus far. We\u2019ll gather and prepare some data in the next section.", "I love using the Titanic dataset for most of my examples. The dataset isn\u2019t too basic, as it requires some preparation, but it isn\u2019t too complex in the means that the preparation process would take too long. You could definitely spend more time preparing this dataset then I did, but this will be enough for our needs.", "Imports-wise, we\u2019ll need 3 things for now: Pandas, StandardScaler and train test split:", "Next, we can load in the dataset and display the first couple of rows:", "And here\u2019s the code for the preparation process:", "Feel free to just copy it over, as this isn\u2019t the article on data preparation.", "Here's how our dataset looks now:", "Looks fine, but some attributes are on a much greater scale than the others \u2014 Age and Fare. We\u2019ll use the standard scaler to address this, but first, let\u2019s perform the train test split:", "And now let\u2019s fit the standard scaler to the train data, and transform both train and test data:", "That\u2019s it for this section. In the next one, we\u2019ll see the TPOT library in action.", "We\u2019ve covered a lot thus far, and now we\u2019ll shift our focus to the meat of the article. First, we need to import TPOT \u2014 either the regressor or the classifier. We\u2019re dealing with the classification problem here, so guess which one we\u2019ll use.", "The training process can\u2019t be easier:", "Here we\u2019ve specified the verbosity parameter as 2, as we want more information printed out, and also specified for how long we want training to last. Feel free to train it for longer, but 10 minutes is perfectly fine for a demonstration case.", "We\u2019ll get some info printed out during the training:", "It\u2019s only 4 generations, so the model won\u2019t be perfect, but we didn\u2019t want to spend an entire day training the model. You could.", "We can now check for the best pipeline:", "As you can see, the gradient boosting method was used with tweaked hyperparameter values. TPOT got to this point in only 10 minutes! Think about how much time would it take to get here manually.", "We can now check for the accuracy on the test set:", "And that\u2019s just enough for an introduction to the TPOT library. Feel free to explore further on your own. The official documentation is a great place to start.", "Loved the article? Become a Medium member to continue learning without limits.
