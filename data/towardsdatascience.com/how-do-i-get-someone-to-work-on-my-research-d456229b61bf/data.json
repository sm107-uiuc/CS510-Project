Yet collaborations are such fragile things, it\u2019s sometimes a wonder that they can be sustained at all in a scientific environment often so ripe for petty conflict and competition.", "Nothing is more suspicious than a single-author paper.", "This may seem surprising to those accustomed to the \u2018lone genius\u2019 narrative that the press loves to perpetuate in science, but to the experienced researcher, single-author papers tend to raise a number of red flags and make one\u2019s quack-o-meter go into overdrive. How does one go about not only attracting collaborators, but also setting up, fostering and nurturing collaborations?", "People often come to me asking: \u2018How do I get someone to work on my project?\u2019 I usually tell them to look around and find those who are asking themselves: \u2018Whose problem am I going to work on today?\u2019 Understanding and embracing that such people simply do not exist is the first step towards building great collaborations.", "Making your problem their problem is the next step.", "Much of getting people to work with you begins with getting them invested. Here is one (weird) trick that every successful politician and televangelist has mastered. It is popularly known as the Ben Franklin effect (I\u2019ve first seen it described eloquently in Chris Matthews\u2019 Hardball): if you want people to become invested in your goals, don\u2019t sell them on the things you\u2019re going to do for them. Instead ask them to do work for you. Ask for a tiny bit of work at first: seek their help, ask them for a small favor, get them to commit an itsy bitsy slice of their time and mindshare to your agenda. As their self-image updates to one that is aligned with your own success, and assuming you provide the right dose of reinforcement, they will be much more inclined to doubling down on their initial implicit commitment, and work with you on your own agenda. It is very counterintuitive to ask for someone to do work in order to get them to do even more work. You instinctively feel like you may be putting yourself into debt, or that you should be the one to have made the first step by helping them. But our psychology doesn\u2019t follow this tit-for-tat pattern, and commitment generally fuels itself.", "Much has been written about famed mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s\u2019 couch-surfing habits and how it shaped a lifetime of extraordinary collaborations. What is often missed in the narrative is the lesson in how, once you have a genius mathematician taking up space in your living room, there is little question as to whether you\u2019re going to work really hard to make that collaboration a success. You have made a commitment to being part of their story by the mere act of having them in your home, and the pressure is on you to deliver on that promise.", "It absolutely doesn\u2019t mean not reciprocating (that being the pattern by which pretty much every toxic relationship develops). In fact, the highest value currency you can spend as a researcher is your own time commitment. Your ideas and talent typically undergo a drastic devaluation in the eyes of your collaborators: no matter how smart you think you are, your collaborators are unlikely to value your ideas as much as you do. In contrast, the amount of time you commit to a project is valued by them at a very high multiplier: it\u2019s extra time spent on their work which they don\u2019t have to spend themselves. As a result, irrespective of how you value your own time, it is generally much more valuable to your collaborators than their own. Hence a value asymmetry, and an interesting arbitrage opportunity: you should probably oversell your time commitment, and undersell your ideas. Too many people try to sell how clever they are, and complain they are underappreciated as a result.", "Trade in elbow grease, not smarts.", "Another under-appreciated aspect is the importance of leaving gaping holes in your project agenda for others to fill. \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 is researcher catnip: people need creative headroom to thrive. Producing a well-argued, airtight research plan with all the questions answered also sends a signal that you may care less about exploring the problem space than having the actual answers be your own.", "It is easier to find someone to collaborate on a question than an answer.", "There is a gimmicky Netflix show called Lucifer with the unlikely premise that the protagonist solves murder cases by simply asking people \u2018what do you most desire in the world?\u2019 (Don\u2019t judge\u2026) Many a collaboration would tremendously benefit if one of the first things collaborators asked each other was that very question: \u2018what do you most desire in the world?\u2019 Motivations can be utterly diverse, and often have little to do with your own.", "Everyone desires personal validation, but everyone also has a different definition of what that means. A surprisingly large number of members of my extended research organization care not at all about publishing papers, and will actively walk away from projects whose net product is merely a publication. Some are positively terrified about the act of writing, or see it as a necessary evil, while others identify themselves predominantly as writers and communicators and will insist on having control of the narrative. Understanding those motivations is essential in fostering a healthy collaboration. If you\u2019re trying to collaborate with a seasoned Google engineer, resist the urge to produce the project\u2019s \u2018design document\u2019: what you may see as a thankless chore is the very currency by which said engineers get promoted. Some engineers will only work on projects where they get to write code from scratch, while others hate reinventing the wheel. Some have strong opinions about contributing to open-source code. Some researchers will see collaborating with a looming authority figure as a threat to their intellectual freedom, while others would give an arm and a leg to rub elbows with someone \u2018famous.\u2019 Some need to know a deadline is safely weeks away not to panic, others may feel blindsided if you put down any words on paper more than a day before the conference deadline.", "Understanding those sometimes subtle and contradictory motivations is essential to shaping a successful collaboration. It doesn\u2019t mean that there has to be perfect alignment of incentives at all times. But making explicit every concession made to the greater good by each individual helps the people involved feeling that their contributions are properly valued.", "Not everything is a matter of give and take, however, and the most powerful way to improve a collaboration is to shape the conversation not as \u2018you vs. me\u2019 (you do this, I do that), but as \u2018us against the world\u2019 instead. I now have all my one-on-one meetings walking around the block instead of in a meeting room. It\u2019s not just an improved health habit; the simple act of walking side-by-side, instead of sitting across one another face-to-face, has a magical effect on subtly changing the conversation\u2019s narrative in favor of shared outcomes, doing wonders to psychological safety", "Credit is one of the questions that can sour a collaboration late in the process. The only antidote, again going back to motivations, is a frank conversation about credit assignment early on. The first thing to recognize is that credit is not an additive quantity. Many people strangely treat collaborations as a large \u2018credit pie\u2019 to be distributed, with every collaborator joining in somehow diluting their own personal contribution. But face it, nobody will ever put a thought into the fact that you\u2019re co-author on a three-author paper versus a four-author paper, irrespective of your author position. Credit is not even a monotonic quantity: adding the right co-author can vastly improve the overall creditable value of your paper, for instance when the collaborator\u2019s reputation or expertise lends credibility to your work: they\u2019re effectively spending some of their hard-earned credit on you.", "Incentives around authorship are often surprisingly subtle: PhD theses are still largely built on first-author papers, and tenure cases on last-author papers. Threats to either status symbols can have outsized impact on a collaborator\u2019s degree of engagement. And don\u2019t act all surprised if your colleague whose last name is Zyzzyck proves not-so-keen on sharing alphabetical authorship.", "There is an interesting dilemma for one trying to write down this sort of advice: in general, positive pieces of advice (\u2018do this and you\u2019ll succeed\u2019), though they make for great and inspirational stories, should be treated with a very high degree of skepticism, because they are usually tainted by survivorship bias. Negative case studies (\u2018I did this and it failed\u2019), on the other hand, are infinitely more useful since as much as we hate to see it that way, success is often about repeatedly not failing more than anything else, and on occasion getting lucky in the process.", "So, like every advice dispenser out there, I cheat: what I couch here as positive advice should really be understood as a collection of things not to do, each and all discovered the hard way: don\u2019t start by giving unconditionally if you want to earn respect and build engagement; don\u2019t go around brandishing ideas, hoping to find someone intrigued enough to implement them for you while you get the credit; don\u2019t assume everyone wants the same thing out of a partnership; don\u2019t stiff anyone out of credit for fear of diluting your own.", "Admit it, that sounded a lot less inspiring, didn\u2019t it? I thought so too ;)", "Your home for data science.
