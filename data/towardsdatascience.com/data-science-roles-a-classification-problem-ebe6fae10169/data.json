It is essentially a catch-all term encompassing a wide body of knowledge and complex mix of skills and responsibilities. In his list of 30 Data Science Terms Explained, Alexander Eakins quotes DJ Patil, first Chief Data Scientist of the United States:", "\u201cA data scientist is that unique blend of skills that can both unlock the insights of data and tell a fantastic story via the data.\u201d", "This post will take a look at the ways some teams have attempted to classify various Data Science roles. It will focus on how job titles are organized at two large companies with mature Data Science programs, and will also introduce some essential non-technical skills from the perspective of one Data Scientist at a smaller organization. It will consider the trajectory of Data Science careers as perceived by industry practitioners and thought leaders. Finally, it will offer recommendations for some Data Science \u201cadjacent\u201d skills to obtain in order to add value and remain relevant in this rapidly evolving industry.", "In her 2018 LinkedIn post One Data Science Job Doesn\u2019t Fit All, Elena Grewal, Ph.D., Head of Data Science at Airbnb describes how rapid growth within the company (as well as lack of standard terminology within the industry) led to a tipping point:", "\u201cThe downside of this variety within a given company is it can result in organizational confusion and churn, since partner teams don\u2019t know what to expect from data scientists, and the data scientists themselves might be unclear on their role.\u201d", "To mitigate this issue the Airbnb team became strategic and intentional about creating roles which aligned business and talent needs, while also achieving clarity of expectations. The result was a restructuring of Data Science roles along three tracks:", "Every Data Scientist on the team is expected to have expertise in at least one of the three specialty areas under the general Data Science umbrella:", "While this level of Data Science specialization works well for a \u201chyper-growth\u201d company like Airbnb, Grewal advises smaller companies to start with a more generalized approach.", "Netflix relies on data to deliver personalized experiences for 130 million Netflix members worldwide. According to the Netflix Tech Blog:", "Every day more than 1 trillion events are written into a streaming ingestion pipeline, which is processed and written to a 100PB cloud-native data warehouse. And every day, our users run more than 150,000 jobs against this data, spanning everything from reporting and analysis to machine learning and recommendation algorithms.", "To support this gargantuan effort, Netflix employs data professionals in roles across three categories: Analyst, Engineer, and Scientist:", "While job titles fit neatly into each category, there can be some overlap in tools and responsibilities between roles.", "Data professionals in each category will likely leverage skills in at least two of the following Data Science areas:", "A larger company like Netflix may offer the \u201cluxury\u201d of many data professionals working in clearly delineated roles. At the same time, the sheer volume and complexity of the data will likely require each Data Scientist to have some generalized crossover knowledge in addition to specialized skills.", "In his article Data Science for The Rest of Us, Oriol Mirosa, Chief Data Scientist at Shubh Loans offers his perspective on why Data Scientists at smaller companies should pay special attention to non-technical work. While acknowledging that technical skills are essential, he posits that particular soft skills can be a key indicator of success.", "To Data Scientists at smaller companies where infrastructure and clearly defined data projects are not fully developed, Oriol offers the following advice:", "The combination of critical thinking, curiosity, creativity and enterprise required to do these five simple things can\u2019t be understated! This data-science-by-walking-around approach enables the Data Scientist to gain domain knowledge, understand business data and problems, and to conceive better business metrics and data products. The credibility gained from working closely with stakeholders will also make it easier to request the resources required to build out infrastructure, data and models down the road.", "In his post on AI trends of 2018, Emmanuel Ameisen expresses that:", "\u201cWhen it comes to recruiting, Hiring Managers of teams all over the valley most often complain that while there is no shortage of people able to train models on a dataset, they need engineers that can build data driven products.\u201d", "While Data Scientists will perform the data wrangling and statistical analysis required to build Machine Learning models, they may not always have the skills required to integrate their prototyped models into a production environment.
