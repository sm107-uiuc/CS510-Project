Search Engine Optimization is essentially just another way of saying:", "\u201cI want to figure out how to make my website the top result for a given search.\u201d", "Wordtracker helps clients to get more traffic to their website or better understand what consumers are searching for. Wordtracker is similar to Google Keywords Planner service but allows access to search data on platforms beyond Google. At the time the data was extracted, Wordtracker offered a 1-year representative sample of search data from June 2018-May 2019 on Google, Youtube, Amazon, and eBay. It offered over 2 billion unique keywords from 18 million global panelists, across 106 countries. Below is a synopsis of all data in the Wordtracker database related to search volume in the United States.", "But how do we decide on which terms related to \u201cathleisure\u201d to select for our search volume queries on Wordtracker? There are many methods, but what better way than to shop for athleisure buzzwords online? We can search the term \u201cathleisure\u201d on Amazon, and find all of the most frequently occurring terms in the results.", "So for our study, we can pull data from Wordtracker with the following constraints:", "According to Search Engine Journal \u2014 Google, YouTube, and Amazon are the three most popular search engines worldwide. According to Bluelist in 2019, there are about 2 trillion Google searches per year. Wordtracker provides nearly 2 billion Google searches within a 1-year timeframe. We assume that Wordtracker provides a representative sample of roughly 1/1000th of the entire Google search database worldwide.", "The cleaned dataset can be downloaded here as a .csv file. For the full code on how the data was called from Wordtracker\u2019s API \u2014 refer to this Jupyter Notebook here. For additional information on how the data was cleaned, refer to the data cleaning Jupyter Notebook here.", "Once the data has been extracted and cleaned, we can perform exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short. Creating a Tableau dashboard is a great way to get a comprehensive understanding of the various relationships between the dimensions and measures in our data, all in one place. A static preview of this dashboard is displayed below. The fully interactive Tableau dashboard can be explored here.", "A collection of word clouds provide a non-technical, graphic sense of scale to understand the most searched athleisure terms in each search engine. The larger the keyword appears in the word cloud, then the more that keyword was searched compared to the others.", "This line plot shows how often athleisure keywords are searched on average over each month of the year. There seems to be a higher number of searches in the colder months than in the warmer months, with the peak being in December.", "When we aggregated search volume for all of our athleisure-related keywords across all three search engines (Google + YouTube + Amazon) we noticed that the keyword \u201choodie\u201d was the most searched term, with 1,300,000 searches. This is followed by \u201csweatshirt\u201d, \u201crunning\u201d, \u201cworkout\u201d, and \u201cflex\u201d, all with several hundred thousand searches. Across all 77 keywords that were considered, the average number of searches is about 100,000.", "In observing metrics on each search engine, we found that Amazon and YouTube have a very low total search volume compared to Google. But even though Amazon has the lowest overall search volume, it has by far the highest ratio for athleisure-related terms. Over 25% of all searches on Amazon are related to athleisure keywords! In comparison, 5% of searches on YouTube are related to athleisure keywords. And less than 1% of searches on Google are related to athleisure keywords. These findings suggest that Amazon and Youtube may be better suited to run ads rather than Google since people are clearly searching athleisure keywords more often on those platforms.", "In the barplot on the left, we can see that Google has nearly 600,000,000 total searches, while Amazon and YouTube combined are less than 100,000,000. However, in the barplot on the right, we can see the search ratio for athleisure-related terms, compared to all searches on each search engine.", "The Probability Density Function plot below shows that a pretty good chunk of our keywords have a small search volume \u2014 close to zero compared to the rest of our keywords. Clearly, some keywords are searched much higher than others, and highly searched keywords are rare.", "The Cumulative Density Function plot below shows that 90% of our keywords have a search volume that is less than 200,000. Once again, this obviates that a large number of our keywords have a low search volume and that there are only a handful of highly searched keywords. This CDF plot seems to be logarithmic in nature.", "Before we get into the statistical testing of our variables, below is a brief overview of hypothesis testing and the concepts that we will use to determine statistical significance.", "Put very simply \u2014 the Null Hypothesis (H0) is a hypothesis that claims that there is no statistically significant relationship between variables, while the Alternative Hypothesis (HA) claims that there is a statistically significant relationship between variables.", "The alpha value is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true. This is also known as a false-positive, or Type I error. We choose the alpha value in every hypothesis test.", "A higher alpha value means we are okay with a higher probability of error, while a lower alpha value means that we are okay with a very low probability of error. Higher alpha values might be okay when there is no big consequence if there is an error, while low alpha values should be used when there are dire consequences if there is an error (like medical diagnoses, criminal sentencing, or any endangering of a life).", "Alpha values typically range between less than 0.01, and 0.1. For our case study, we can use an alpha value is not too lenient, nor too strict. So, We will use an alpha value of 0.05.", "The p-value is the \u201cevidence\u201d against a null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence that we can reject the null hypothesis. We compare the p-value to the alpha value that we set for our statistical test.", "One-Way Analysis Of Variance or ANOVA is our statistical test of choice since we are dealing with multiple groups. We will also use Two-Way ANOVA to determine combinations of factors that may be statistically significant.", "The problem with ANOVA is that it only compares the means between groups and determines if any of those means are statistically significantly different from each other. In short: ANOVA tells us if our results or significant or not, but does not tell us where the results are significant.", "But, the interpretability of statistical significance is crucial to figure out in order to guide our athleisure advertising strategy. We have to be able to explain which keywords perform best, which search engine is best, or which month is best to run ads!", "So a Tukey Test allows us to interpret the statistical significance of our ANOVA test and find out which specific groups\u2019 means (compared with each other) are different. So, after performing each round of ANOVA, we should use a Tukey Test to find out where the statistical significance is occurring in our data.", "Question: Are there any differences between athleisure-related keywords when considering search volume?", "Null Hypothesis (H0) \u2014 All athleisure-related keywords are equal in terms of average search volume.", "Alternative Hypothesis (HA) \u2014 Some athleisure-related keywords have greater average search volumes than others.", "We reject the null hypothesis that mean search volume is equal across all athleisure-related keywords.

In the output, we look to the PR(>F) column which provides our p-values (which is what we\u2019re after).", "For the Tukey Test after Two-Way ANOVA, we assign a variable to the pairwise_tukeyhsd() function, where we provide our response variable (search volume), the groups we are testing (combo of keyword + search engine, in this case), and our alpha value (0.05). Then, we coerce the output to a dataframe for easier analysis and filtering, and add a \u201ctotal_sum\u201d column to add up all of the (True) null rejections for each observation in each group.

If the search volume is most important, then we would recommend YouTube. If market share is most important, then we would recommend Amazon.", "The month by itself is not statistically significant enough of a factor to provide a confident recommendation.
