At this point, they seek to familiarize themselves with the data they are working with, so as to be able to know how efficient it will be in solving the problem at hand and how much more processing they would have to do. At this stage, the data analyst or scientist, AI or ML engineer uses so many tools and libraries to be able to efficiently explore their datasets. This makes the process of data exploration very difficult to fully accomplish, especially if you don\u2019t know many essential tools, libraries and methods for exploring your datasets well. There\u2019s good news, imagine being able to explore your datasets efficiently and very quickly in just one line of code!", "With so many concerns and problems related to effectively exploring your data, my teammates, Benjamin Acquaah, Adam Labaran and myself wrote some automation scripts that can drastically automate and simplify the data exploration process. We wrote this script using the Pandas open-source library, utilizing the many methods and functions that come with the library. After fixing a couple of bugs, optimizing the code and running a series of tests, we finally built and packaged xplore \ud83c\udf89.", "xplore is a python package built for data scientists or analysts, AI or ML engineers for exploring features of a dataset in a single line of code for quick analysis before data wrangling and feature extraction. xplore also utilizes the full power of pandas-profiling and can generate very advanced and detailed reports about the exploration of your data if the user wants that.", "xplore is fully open-sourced and interest contributors or code enthusiasts can find the complete source code and test files on Github. The project has also been published on PyPi so any interested person can easily install and import it in their local projects.", "In this section, I am going to guide you through a walkthrough tutorial on how you can install, import and use the xplore package in your local project.", "The minimum requirement to be able to successfully explore your data using the xplore package is to have Python installed on your computer. A bonus would be to have Anaconda also installed on your computer and added to PATH. With these things done, you can easily navigate to your command prompt (Windows), Terminal (Linux/macOS) or you anaconda prompt and run the command:", "By running this command, the latest version of xplore and its dependencies will be fully stored on your local computer so you can easily import and use it in your python files later.", "In any python file where you would like to explore your data using the xplore package, you would have to import the xplore module directly into your code file so you can easily access and use the built-in methods that come with the module. This can be done by adding the following line when making the necessary imports in your code:", "As at the moment this article was published, the xplore package has only been optimized to work with labelled data only. Preparing your data for exploration using the xplore package is as easy as just assigning the data you have read into your code to any variable name.", "The process of actually exploring your data is simplified to just one line of code. Everything else that has to be done will be automatically done by the automation script we wrote. You can explore your data using the command:", "By running this, you will see an output of the analysis made from the exploration of your data. Almost all the vital analysis you need will be printed out but for people who want to see a very detailed and advanced report from the analysis of their data, type in \u2018y\u2019 when the prompt asks you if you would like to see a detailed report on the exploration of your data. Otherwise, you can easily type in \u2019n\u2019 when you see that prompt if you are comfortable with the outputs that were printed out.", "After running code where you used the xplore method to explore your data, here\u2019s what your output should look like:", "Python is the most powerful language you can still read. \u2014 Paul Dubois", "Being an avid learner, I am very passionate about making things easier for the next generation of learners and automation is one of the easiest ways you can achieve this.
