However, I have to admit that seeing a difference home page and article presentation style is quite refreshing.", "What\u2019s even more refreshing are the thought-provoking articles that I came across this week, of course, all associated with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.", "Below is a brief description of the articles I\u2019ve included in this week\u2019s recommended list:", "If you write AI/ML content on Medium and you would like me to read and include your article in my weekly/monthly article coverage, feel free to tag me in the comment section of your article or connect and send a link to the article on LinkedIn.", "Recommended read for Data Science students and ML practitioners with interest CyberSecurity.", "Victor Basu documents a research experiment that explores the utilisation of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to classify DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks. A standard method of network infiltration used by hackers.", "Victor\u2019s article applies ML/Data Science techniques to a CyberSecurity use case, an area of computing that has risen in popularity in correlation to the adoption of A.I. based applications.", "There\u2019s a wealth of knowledge to be obtained from this article. There\u2019s an inclusion of typical data science project processes that one might encounter such as data gathering, exploratory data analysis or model implementation.", "Victor also includes essential topics such as data memory management and training visualisation.", "Machine Learning practitioners will appreciate the versatile approach to detecting DDoS attacks that Victor has implemented. The experiment covers both supervised and unsupervised ML approached to classification.", "Relevant code snippets and visualisation materials are provided in the article.", "Christopher\u2019s article is a synopsis to a talk he reveals to be having later this month. The talk itself is focused on the ability for language model to attain language understanding.", "Christopher states in his article his openness to engage in discussions that could sway his current thought process on the subject matter.", "Apart from the personal significance of the article to its author, this article provides introductory and contextual information on topics associated with language modelling as a machine learning task. For this reason, Christopher's article is an engaging piece of writing that goes beyond the common technicalities one would come across when writing about subjects related to natural language processing.", "I implore NLP practitioners and curious ML enthusiast to engage Chistoper in a discourse on the ideas and opinions he expresses within his article.", "The article does an outstanding job of exploring the possible talking points as to why the limitation of language models restrict their ability to generate a sense of \u2018understanding\u2019.", "Recommend read for Machine learning practitioners who are interested in exploring undeveloped areas of research", "Andre Ye article describes the approach researchers are taking in developing algorithms and machine learning models that can mimic the processes that human utilise to learn.", "More specifically, the technique Andre describes in this article aims to replicate, in some manner, the efficient derivation of understanding and learning abilities that human toddlers possess.", "This informative and descriptive article is an accessible introduction to a world of ongoing research that has yet to develop into full-fledged applicable techniques.", "That been said, the method presented and described by Andre might be a window into the origins of future developments that are yet to be discovered within machine learning.", "Zero-Shot Learning technique has always been a mystery to me. Still, Andre has presented key takeaways from associated research papers and summarised the intuition into the technique paradigm by leveraging easy to understand examples.", "Recommended read for anyone ready to have their current perspective and ideas on reality challenged.", "I have to admit I was surprised by the description of consciousness in relation to the downward movement of water flowing downhill. Duncan, in his first paragraph of this somewhat, triggering article (take a look at the comment section), conveys consciousness as nothing more than a subsequent effect of existence, as opposed to an unexplainable phenomenon that verifies humanity\u2019s uniqueness in this world.", "Medium is a platform that exposes the various forms of opinions and perspective individuals hold, and Duncan take, and written explanation as to why the concept of consciousness, does not exist is surprisingly very informative and can be recruited as a strong basis of an argument for the dismissal of the idea of consciousness.", "It would be best if you approached this article with an open mind as there are some feasible notions that Duncan presents quite eloquently. The marriage between a background in both psychology and artificial intelligence that Duncan possesses gives the breeding ground for ideas and perspectives that will have more relevance within the AI field in the decades to come.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
