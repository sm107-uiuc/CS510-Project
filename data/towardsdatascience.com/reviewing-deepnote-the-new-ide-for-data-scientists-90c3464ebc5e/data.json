I signed up for the beta and stood patiently for five (!) days till I got my invitation.", "I logged in, messed about with the platform for about an hour, tried some of the sample projects and that was about it.", "After a couple of months, Rodrigo Tadewald, a dear friend of mine that works in the finance business invited me to co-create an online course that would mainly use Python. I would pretty much be responsible for the environment setup/programming/performance-wise topics of the course.", "I accepted the invitation with great joy since I\u2019m deeply interested in financial topics and never had once produced an online course. I then had the idea to try Deepnote and proceeded to develop all the course Python notebooks with it.", "Disclaimer: I\u2019ve used mainly the Brave browser, only using other browsers to verify when it happened to show some strange behavior (Brave browser runs on the Chromium engine). I\u2019ve also used interchangeably OSX, Ubuntu and Windows machines during the development of the project.", "To start the project, I uploaded some of my old notebooks that I already had worked on for previous in-loco courses and proceeded to create the project. Deepnote also offers the option to import repositories from GitHub and GitLab, making it really easy to set up.", "As I was getting more comfortable with the platform, CTRL/\u2318 + P was my main way of getting things done.", "It works quite well to perform commands like the ones in the screenshot, while its querying capabilities didn\u2019t make me 100% happy with the way that performed. I had some problems finding files inside folders, which was really a pain since my project was organized mainly with folders and subfolders.", "In the Project tab you can see your project files, add new files, add data connections, and access the terminal.", "The notebook itself is quite interesting and has some cool features. I was really happy to see a markdown cheat sheet easily accessible.", "Modules can be automatically detected by the IDE, and you can easily install pip packages on the fly. If you use the!pip command, Deepnote saves it in a hidden file and installs it every time the environment is fired up. You also have the option of creating a requirements.txt file and interact with it via the Terminal", "The variable explorer is a nice feature that has some already integrated metrics to it, really giving it a nice touch.", "The Code intelligence features, like autocomplete and go-to definitions, didn\u2019t work as well with the current beta version.", "IMPROVEMENT: A important thing that I noticed during the development of my project is that the performance of the file explorer improved drastically. As I had uploaded a lot of files, I needed to organize them in folders, and some weeks ago, moving the files around in folders and subfolders was a really laggy/buggy experience. That improved drastically since the beginning of the course\u2019s development, around April/2020 . Nice!", "On some of the course modules I needed to work with data. Not huge datasets, but large enough that I wouldn\u2019t be happy if I had to re-upload all into the platform. Deepnote has some integrated datasets, like Landsat 8 and Goodreads books, but for my project I needed to use custom datasets that I already had prepared.", "Also, there\u2019s a way to integrate with (at least on my beta account) AWS S3, MongoDB and Postgres, besides uploading files from your local system. There\u2019s a lot of \u201cgrayed out\u201d options, but I miss Azure storage and Google Drive integration, mainly because it would certainly be a lot of less hassle for Google Colab users to try Deepnote casually.", "After setting up the data connection, I messed around a little with the Terminal, which gives you full root access to the machine, but I didn\u2019t quite saw the need for it on this project. I think the only time I ran to the terminal was when the Deepnote kernel entered in a restart loop and I tried to fix it by using some bash commands.", "Moving over to the Environment tab, you can select the machine configuration, restart it, see the CPU and RAM usage and check the packages your project is depending on.", "The free available machine configurations are the following:", "There is also a Performance configuration, that is available on request:", "And last but not least there\u2019s the Comments tab. The communication features on Deepnote are really advanced, and while this course was mainly a solo project, sometimes I would kindly request a friend to review some of its notebooks and I wasn\u2019t disappointed.", "We could do live sessions of code review and interact asynchronously with comments. That gives a large advantage to data scientists working together, remotely, on async or sync schedules. Far superior than any other collaborative experience I had with other notebook platforms.", "Deepnote has tackled the challenge of being the IDE of choice for data science teams, competing with some very good and already established alternatives.", "Its core strength is the collaboration-focused approach, that stands out from the crowd and provides a real Google Docs experience for data scientists.", "I\u2019m sure the \u201cfunny looking\u201d features are currently being fixed by the team, and the implementation of several features, like versioning, teams, dashboards, and API sharing of notebooks, are on progress as well.", "If you are curious about the platform, I suggest giving it a try using a project where collaboration is key, maybe with some of your friends or work colleagues. That way you can extract the real value that the platform offers.", "If you are a Python or Notebook environment beginner, Deepnote is a really easy way to get started.", "For data science teams, I would encourage them to use it with a new project and keep in touch with the Deepnote folks. You can use the integrated chat to talk with the team, which is helpful (since it\u2019s in beta, it has beta features :)", "I will be updating this post periodically reviewing new features, so actually a lot of things I wrote here can be changed in the future.", "I hope you enjoyed reading this post.", "If you did, consider following me on Twitter.", "Thank you for your time. Take care and keep coding!", "Your home for data science.
