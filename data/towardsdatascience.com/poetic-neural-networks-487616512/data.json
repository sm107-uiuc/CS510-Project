A link to the GitHub repository is included in the bottom.", "Nizar Qabbani was a Syrian poet who is most remembered for his poems that explored love, nationalism, eroticism, and religion. In addition, he was a prolific writer, which means that his work provides a potentially large amount of data for our neural net to learn from.", "Below is sample of his work:", "Who are youwoman entering my life like a daggermild as the eyes of a rabbitsoft as the skin of a plumpure as strings of jasmineinnocent as children\u2019s bibsand devouring like words?", "As a first step we need to create a corpus of text that contains most, if not all, of his known work. Luckily we can find websites that are solely dedicated to preserving Qabbani\u2019s work.", "Using packages such as BeautifulSoup, one can scrape the data and create a corpus that contains all available works we could find. With all of the poems gathered, the amount of data is just below 1MB, which is about 1 million characters, and has about 32,000 unique words. For more information how much data is needed, refer to Andrej Karpathy post in the references below.", "Despite appearing as a massive amount of text, in reality, it is considered to be a very small dataset, which will probably be a limitation for our purposes.", "Unlike Latin characters, Arabic is read from right to left. In addition there is no such thing as uppercase or lowercase characters. Furthermore, the concept of vowels and consonants is different than say English.", "There are more aspects on how this language and others differs from English. There have been successful examples of generating poems in languages other than English, such as Chinese (see references at bottom).", "This step involves creating a lookup table that returns two dictionaries:", "Next, we split the script into a word array using spaces as delimiters. However, punctuation marks like periods and exclamation marks can create multiple ids for the same word. For example, \u201cbye\u201d and \u201cbye!\u201d would generate two different word ids.", "We implement a function to return a dictionary that will be used to tokenize symbols like \u201c!\u201d into \u201c||Exclamation_Mark||\u201d, our list looks like:", "This dictionary will be used to tokenize the symbols and add the delimiter (space) around it. This separates each symbols as its own word, making it easier for the neural network to predict the next word.", "In general, we may get better results with larger hidden and n_layer dimensions, but larger models take a longer time to train. Below is a list of parameters to tune:", "With the parameters set and the model trained we can move on to the fun part: Generating poems!", "To do so we must define the prime_word which is the word to begin with.

At some points the writing was comical and broke all rules of grammar and logic.", "One possible reason for our shortcomings might be insufficient training data, as ideally we want at least 3MB worth of text. In addition there might be distinctive facets of the language itself that need to be accounted for. However bear in mind that the RNN had to learn one of the hardest languages from scratch.", "I hope you enjoyed reading this article and got a sense of what is possible in terms of text generation.
