An accessible Web can help people with disabilities participate more actively in society.", "The World Wide Web Consortium(W3C) is an international community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term development of the web.", "The principles of web accessibility are:", "The guidelines and success criteria are organized around the following four principles, which lay the foundation necessary for anyone to access and use web content. Anyone who wants to use the web must have content that is:", "These principles are also known as POUR Principles.", "If any of these are not true, users with disabilities will not be able to use the web. In one of the upcoming sections, we will see how to meet all the principles.", "There are a lot of sites and browser extensions that can be used to check to what extent your site is accessible. Out of all these tools, I personally recommend Achecker.", "Achecker is very simple to use, with a very simple user interface. We just need to place the URL of the website to be tested or the HTML files or we can even paste the HTML markup.", "The three categories of problems that Achecker points out are:", "There are three accessibility levels defined and each level is better than the previous level:", "There are 25 criteria that we have to check to reach Level A. To reach Level AA, we have to meet 13 more criteria in addition to the 25 for Level A. Level AAA is the icing on the cake with 23 more criteria.", "The success criteria at Level A are designed to be the easiest to meet without much impact on the website design or structure. For example, at Level A, we aren\u2019t allowed to identify something by color alone. Level AA requires a bit more commitment. Continuing with the theme of color, we have to ensure that all the text meets color contrast requirements. The requirement differs somewhat based on the size of the text, but it is actually pretty strict. At Level AAA, the requirement is taken further with an even more strict color contrast requirement for text.", "Since we now know what Web Accessibility and how to check for accessibility and also we know a bit about the various levels of accessibility, we will now continue our discussion on how to build a developer portfolio and then make it well accessible.", "The link to Achecker is given below:", "A programming portfolio is more than just a resume. It is proof of the skills that you possess and that you have put in your resume. Also, a good portfolio can be used to create a personal brand that goes much beyond just displaying the skills. Things that are a must in a Developer Portfolio are:", "2. Skills: In this section, you have to mention all the things that are your forte. All the languages and technologies that you are familiar with. It can be in the form of a progress bar, showing how confident you are with that skill or how much experience you have in that skill. For example,", "3. Contact Information: All the necessary social links must be provided, most importantly LinkedIn and GitHub. Also, there should be a separate contact page, where the users can directly contact you to ask some queries by sending messages.", "All the above-mentioned sections are a must while developing a portfolio. Furthermore, some other sections can also be added based on your choice. Here is a link to my portfolio where you can see all the things that I have added:", "We will follow Shneiderman\u2019s Golden Rules to make the website accessible:", "4. Offer simple error handling: The error messages should not sound too rude or should not be displayed in such a way that the users are not able to understand them. For example, Page not found error, form not submitted, error in filling out the details, etc.", "5. Permit easy reversal of actions: The users should be able to undo their mistakes easily. The system should ask for permissions before submitting a form and also before asking for details from the user.", "6. Support internal locus of control: The users should get a feel of what they are doing. Every action should make the user feel that they are actually doing something. For example, giving hover effects, giving click effects, etc.", "7. Reduce short-term memory load: The information provided on the website should be short and informative. There should not be a bulk of information provided on just a single page. Information should be distributed all over the website.", "8. Enable frequent users to use shortcuts: The users who have visited your site a number of times should not feel alien to the actions of the website. Thus, not many changes are to be made unless absolutely necessary, and even if the changes are made, the users should be informed about it beforehand.", "Apart from all these, we also need to make sure that we handle all the popular accessibility needs that are discussed in the previous sections:", "2. Mobility: We should build the site in such a way that the users can work even without mouse action. For example, enabling tab indexes as well as a tap to scroll button will do a world of good.", "3. Auditory: If the site contains any audio or video information, its equivalent captions should be displayed.", "4. Seizures: The animations displayed should not be too fast, the colors should not be too bright, and should not contain flashy things. We can also add mode switching themes if possible.", "5. Cognitive and Intellectual: As said previously, there should not be too much information at one particular place. Information should be distributed and structured evenly throughout the website.", "So, now that you have a brief idea about what accessibility is and why it is so important, and also how to implement it in your systems. I hope you all will implement it and make this world a better place for everyone.", "Your home for data science.
