As a result, our behaviour \u2014 consumer behaviour \u2014 has changed, and accordingly the marketing data surrounding it. When life returns to normal, hopefully, sooner rather than later \ud83e\udd1e, will we see re-adjustments in our consumer behaviour or an introduction of a new type of behaviour?", "A common \u2014 important assumption of many predictive models \u2014 is that the data used to train the model is similar to the data being input in production. Concept drift is the term used when the data for the thing we\u2019re trying to predict has changed. This can happen for many reasons. For example:", "Raising the question, has CV-19 polluted your data? or \u2014 given the length of the pandemic \u2014 has it brought about a new set of data to analyse? Either way it\u2019s important to recognise that there will be Concept drift, introducing new data challenges and degrading the accuracy in predictive ML models.", "So, let\u2019s take a few steps now to resolve any issues with, and future proof, our data.", "First, a quick hello from the authors of this post.", "Hi, I\u2019m Vic. Based out of Singapore, I\u2019m a Data Scientist at Google, where I work to advance the data maturity and capability of our key clients and partners. Previously, I was an engineer in the US.", "Hi, I\u2019m Drew. I\u2019m a Customer Solutions Engineer at Google, helping our Advertisers get the best out of their websites, apps, and data.", "On the 3rd April Google released the CV-19 Community Mobility Reports, a set of aggregated and anonymized insights that show movement trends by geography. Looking at this data for Australia there was a -63% drop in mobility trends for public transport, when compared to the standard baseline.", "Obviously (for most of us affected by this pandemic)! but this illustrates the shift in behavior well. Note the importance of comparing against a standard baseline, we\u2019ll explain why shortly.", "For this writeup let\u2019s consider Drew\u2019s daily commute \u2014 arguably the best form of transport in the world \u2014 the Sydney ferry service (photo). That is compared to Victor\u2019s 4 stops on the metro \ud83e\udd37.", "The opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au service provides Australia NSW ferry tap-on/tap-off data (representing an individual entering & exiting a ferry wharf). Let\u2019s imagine we are building a model to forecast activity.", "The data runs from July 2016 to March 2020 and shows a clear seasonal trend with activity peaking every January corresponding with the peak of Sydney summer and the New Years Eve activity. Then in early March, the World Health Organization announces a pandemic, which is reflected by a -57% drop in the service between Feb and March (wow that matches up with the Google Community Mobility Reports nicely!).", "Let\u2019s work with this to establish an achievable 3 step methodology we can follow to correct how our ML models interpret the data \u2014 1. Identify, 2. Resolve, 3. Automate.", "Step 1. (Be prepared to) Identify drift is happening", "How might we know there is a problem in the first place? Typically, it\u2019s when the data is no longer consistent with past trends. This can happen slowly over time, or \u2014 in the case of these transport services \u2014 suddenly.", "To prepare a control baseline we can plot all historical (or training) data, and forecast what the future activity could be based on past trends. We\u2019ve done this here using an ARIMA (Autoregressive integrated moving average) method (for more information check out this useful post on Analyzing COVID-19 with BigQuery by Lak Lakshmanan).", "The dotted green line represents our baseline. That is the actual historical data before January 2020, and the forecasted data for after January 2020. The ARIMA method we used returns a forecast\u2019s confidence upper and lower bounds, when the actual results (the blue line) fall out of these bounds it\u2019s clear there may be a problem. Particularly from February to March.", "There are a few ways the data can drift over time. Is it sudden or gradual? Is it permanent or temporary?", "In our ferry example (and I\u2019m sure most CV-19 affected data) we see a sudden change, and will hopefully decay. However, given the length of time the pandemic has lasted, plus possible new gradual changes in consumer behaviour post pandemic, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll continue to see results differing from their baselines that need to be addressed.", "Keen to spend more time and learn more?", "A method for detecting structural changes in time series data is Change Point Detection, the change point being the period in time the data trends started changing. This could be automated weekly, to be prepared for detecting future issues.", "It\u2019s also likely there will be a reduction in an ML model\u2019s accuracy over time (which hopefully you\u2019re monitoring). Tools like Explainable AI provide a nice insight to understand what\u2019s happening i.e are the explanations behind specific (incorrect) predictions still plausible, or is there an underlying problem that wasn\u2019t there before? These reference the Shapley Values to understand feature importance.", "Step 2. Resolve drift in the data", "There are a number of approaches we can take to resolve concept drift, some more advanced than others. Plus, different approaches will be more relevant depending on the type of drift.", "The goal of this article is to leave you with an achievable short term win for the sudden change we\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve CV-19. Given that, we are going to look at resolving drift by weighing the data and/or windowing the data.", "The win of weighing data is that we can continue to use the historical training set we did before, just now allowing the model to recognise older items that are less relevant to more recent events. Also, it may be possible CV-19 will reoccur (we hope not!) in which case keeping and using historical data can ensure we are set up for success long term.", "To see how this applies in the ferry data, we can look at correcting the sudden increase in total count activity when a new route (the F8 Cockatoo Island route) has been introduced.", "Weighing points based on how much they have drifted away from the current truth, by giving a stronger weight to more recent data and reducing this as the data gets older. Allowing the model to understand more relevant events. The simplest way to achieve this is to give more recent post drift events a weight of 1, and older pre drift events a weight of 0.", "That is, windowing data into instances by aggregating over a set of fixed windows, which helps to remove sudden drift. Also, weights can still be applied to the instances if you\u2019re keen to keep historical data. You can read more in this Project Flux Capacitor blog post.", "In the diagram there is a fixed window moving at set intervals, to reduce the drift across old and new behaviour.", "To see how this applies in the ferry data, let\u2019s use a 6 month fixed window averaging total activity in each window. If we had attempted to predict the future activity using all historical data, our predictions would be biased by low activity before Jan 2018. Using a 6 month window allows our estimate to react faster to the jump in total activity/traffic, and be more accurate overall.", "Keen to spend more time and learn more?", "When calculating weights also consider using an exponential decay method, where the smaller weights will contribute less to the model.", "To advance things even further, it\u2019s possible to use an ensemble of a number of models, trained using older and newer datasets. A weighted majority algorithm can then be applied to arrive at a result from a collection of predictions. This could be useful if we expect the data to \u201creturn to normal\u201d.", "There is no avoiding it, we need to retain our model as users are behaving differently. Of course, we can choose to retrain our model manually, but this is a good opportunity set up for success and have it happen automatically?", "There are several different options depending on the strategy we\u2019d like to apply.", "In other words, each new data point updates the model through a fixed sliding window or weighting scheme, as discussed in Step 2. With a fixed sliding window, the oldest data points are ignored.", "In the Sydney Ferry data we could be looking at only the most recent seasonal set of data. This is a simpler approach, although we still need to experiment to find the right window size or weighting scheme.", "The model can be triggered to retrain when it detects concept drift. For example, this could be rebuilding a forecast using data all the way back to the last change point, or incrementally adjusting the size of the data window (shrinking if drift is more drastic, or expanding if no drift is detected).", "In the diagram notice that the window grows while relevant data is still being accumulated. However, after T = 2, sufficient different data has been accumulated and a new window is created starting from when concept drift has been detected.", "Keen to spend more time and learn more?", "When detecting concept drift, have a think about what the trigger threshold should be for the change you are detecting, and how the model should adapt.", "When it comes to automating processes, the Cloud Composer tool in Google Cloud (which deploys Apache Airflow) is a powerful way to set up a Continuous Integration workflow based on a set of triggers to process data and retrain a model. There are also some useful quickstarts and codelabs under the CI/CD on Google Cloud solution page.", "As you\u2019ve seen, there are a lot of ways to tackle concept drift. In the article, we\u2019ve focused mainly on solutions surrounding the sudden drift caused by the CV-19 pandemic. Hopefully, there are a few quick wins for you to take away, along with some more advanced ideas to read up on in the future.", "Thanks for reading.
