You code for a few hours or a weekend, and viola! You have a new tool or application that you want to share out with others. The problem is: code built-in isolation by a developer or data scientist is not production-ready code.", "I have worked on several projects where I started as the lone developer for the code. When developing in such a manner, I take time to gather requirements, draft the code base\u2019s architecture, begin a minimal viable product (MVP) and get feedback. Once I start getting feedback flowing in, I can continue development, update where needed, and keep going. After finishing my MVP, I begin to introduce new developers to the codebase. As others become involved, new developments come from the work, such as use-cases that were overlooked, new ideas formed, and updated code based on stakeholder input. Code created in isolation has never stayed in isolation and only expanded in a reasonable and valuable way.", "As I mentioned, I have started many data science projects in isolation, but they never stay that way. The main two reasons these projects get expanded beyond one developer is (1) stakeholder buy-in in which they believe the MVP should expand, and (2) other developers and data scientists gained interest who are now providing feedback.", "As you begin to add more people to the project, you can now focus on a specific project area. When I add new individuals, I tend to add them to three main parts of the project. Breaking teammates into these groups allows for focused work on the current codebase, updating the codebase processes, and research.", "When adding developers to a project, the first group focuses on the current code implementations related to how the code was originally written. This team looks for areas of improvement and works on stabilizing the codebase. When the codebase is started and then reviewed for feedback, you will begin to develop a large backlog of work, which includes optimizations, new features, and bugs.", "The second group of developers focuses heavily on implementing updated processes to the new repository. I have found it helpful when migrating from a lone developer project to a project that will be production-ready to have one group focus on processes. This group will ensure the standards and processes set by our other repositories are also implemented in the new repository.", "The last group are the researchers. As you begin to invite stakeholders, developers, and data scientists into the project work, you will become aware of use-cases that were over-looked and areas that lacked a decent investment in research. This group of individuals defines what areas need to be researched based on feedback, determine the expected outcome of the work, and develop an MVP feature as required. They are working to push the edge of what has been done and fill the gaps.", "You can\u2019t write an entire production-ready data science application in isolation. It would be best to have stakeholder buy-in and feedback, understand all possible use-cases, implement CI/CD pipelines, and maintain your code. After getting stakeholder buy-in for the MVP work and receiving feedback, migrate the project from a lone developer to a team. At this point, you can break the team up into three groups: maintainability, processes, and research.", "You can\u2019t write an entire production-ready application in isolation, but you can start it and invite the team to continue the work.", "Have you started a project in isolation and then brought the team into it? What did you learn from this process?", "If you would like to read more, check out some of my other articles below!", "Your home for data science.
