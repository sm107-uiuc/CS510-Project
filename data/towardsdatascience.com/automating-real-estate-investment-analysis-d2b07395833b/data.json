Multiple examples include stock trading bots tasked with buying or selling assets based on different models or indicators. Renaissance technology received the worlds attention due to their return rates through algorithmic investing that averaged 60%+ annualized returns over a 30-year time span.", "The benefits of automation have the potential to transform businesses of varying size. Individual repetitive tasks can be automated by software that can be developed in house, or by third party SaaS platforms.", "For the individual retail investor, python bots pose a promising solution to various elements of real estate investing. In this article, we examine automating the process of analyzing properties. Other processes that could be automated include: listing properties, sending notices to tenants, screening tenants (machine learning or AI), and even automatically dispatching maintenance workers.", "The program takes three inputs: the listing URL, the monthly rent price, and the property tax rate. It returns monthly cash flow, cap rate, and cash on cash return rate.", "The following packages were used. Note for those working in the Anacondas environment, it appears that streamlit is not currently available through this package manager. Streamlit was installed with pip, which might cause issues when PIP and Anacondas are used together", "The functions that do the majority of the heavy lifting are price_mine, mortgage_monthly, and net_operating.", "These are the main functions that perform the following duties respectively:", "Other functions used such as cap_rate calculated the ratio of net income to asset price as a percent. The full list of function is available on the project\u2019s GitHub repository but will be excluded from this documentation.", "The idea was to have the inputs on the left-hand side of the page, and the output on the right-hand side of the page. The inputs were positioned inside a sidebar, this way the inputs and outputs are visually different.", "A common way we could build this dashboard is to create a static website with HTML, deploy the back end using flask, store values in some sort of database, and link everything using react. A new alternative deployment path that has advantages over this approach is called streamlit.", "Streamlit allows the fast transition from a python script to a modern user experience. It also offers a straightforward and fast deployment path. The first step in the conversion was to replace the built in python input functions and replace them with the streamlit input boxes. The same replacement was made for the output.", "Once is this is done, the streamlit app can be deployed from the console, and accessed through the external IP address.", "Once the user interface was built in streamlit, the code was modified to add a sidebar for the inputs as originally depicted in the above sketches.", "The final code is available on GitHub.", "Although groups such as renaissance technology have been able to profit from mathematical models applied to investing, there are benefits for individual retail investors that can be implemented much easier.", "Real estate investors can benefit from automation by handling many tasks that would previously require an assistant, or tie up a lot of time. This was an example of using automation to reduce time spent on filtering deals. More deals could be reviewed by the investor if automated summary reports were generated and only the best assets were presented to a human. Mom and pop shops, real estate investors, and entrepreneurs can benefit from automation and not just fortune 500 companies.", "Note from Towards Data Science\u2019s editors: While we allow independent authors to publish articles in accordance with our rules and guidelines, we do not endorse each author\u2019s contribution.
