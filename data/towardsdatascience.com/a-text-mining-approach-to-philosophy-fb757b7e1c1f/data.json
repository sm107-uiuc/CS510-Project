One of the key learning objectives of the course was performing text mining over sample sets of text data. As hopeful as I was about deeply learning about this topic, the concepts were taught at a very abstract level and as disconcerting it was, the tutor only spent two classes out of total fourteen on this module. The situation spoke for itself. We were to carry out the burdensome task of research on what text to analyze for our project. However; to me personally, this freedom worked in my favor as I was able to achieve a better learning experience than expected by the end of the course.", "Talking about the process, I initially went on a Google search binge for the first week, racking up useful resources on text mining, existing pieces of work and \u2018open\u2019 problems that are out there. Once I was comfortable with the material to get started on the project, I had to look for a text data set that not only piqued my interest but also one which hasn\u2019t been already used before. So, as part of my project, I wanted to evaluate pieces of literature that I read at some point in time, either as part of courses I opted for in the past or through my random explorations into philosophy while browsing the internet. These books are descriptive but touch upon different aspects of life. Others involve esoteric theories, ideologies and set of premises that I simply do not have enough time to go over all of them. Instead, to make life easier for me, my main concern was to understand the gist of what each philosopher tried to convey in their writings. So, by writing a few lines of code, I will be able to make sense of verbosely written text through the help of a few eye-catching visualizations.", "For the sake of keeping this piece as concise and readable as possible, I have analyzed only 6 different sets of texts written by renowned philosophers whose theories and ideas have historical significance, namely:", "[Notice the last two books are written by the same author. This is intentionally done to further my evaluation]", "Finding the mentioned books was not an arduous task, a major thanks to open source repositories especially the Gutenberg Project. The website has a collection of 56,000 uploaded ebooks which are ready to download. In order to extract useful terminologies and key insights, different statistical or natural language processing (NLP) procedures are needed to be carried out, only then we will be able to produce the visualizations that we talked about. I have ordered different sections based on the method employed, which are the following:", "To start off with my R program, I usually clean up all my global and local variables using the following command:", "Once executed, you\u2019ll have a fresh start with your code. Since we are using the Gutenberg project and have to read .txt files into our variables we will import the following libraries to utilize certain important functions:", "The Quanteda library is my go-to library for quantitative analysis of text files. In more technical terms, it allows me to create corpora or a \u2018collection\u2019 of texts that includes document-level variables and meta-data for each included text in that collection. Quanteda also allows me to map out a document-feature matrix (DFM for short) which will be used to create all the cool looking diagrams as you will see below.", "Lastly, in order to import data, we execute this line:", "Seems simple enough, right? Let\u2019s move onto the fun part.", "Before delving into keyword analysis of the texts, I wanted to share a piece of my Github code in Fig 1a. This code block simply allows me to parse text data and eventually create a word cloud from it. Since we are playing with text that may possibly include Latin characters (such as \u00e1, \u014d, \u012b ), we need to convert them to ASCII format which will allow us to extract \u201creadable\u201d results.", "Next, we MUST remove redundant words or marks such as stopwords, symbols, numbers and punctuation marks. Stopwords by definition are commonly occurring words in any given text such as \u201ca\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d, \u201cin\u201d etc. We filter these group of words out from the corpus so they do not reduce the quality of our keyword analysis. The lines 4\u20136 are performing the filtering process.", "After pre-processing the corpus, next we convert it into a document feature matrix (DFM) which determines the frequency of each word in a given document. We shall not go into the details of how the DFM is calculated but what we should essentially know is that this matrix will be passed into the magical word-cloud function that plots the colorful results in Fig 1(b), (c) and (d).", "As far as word rank is concerned, the words in the direct middle (colored ash grey) are the top featured words while the ones in orange and cyan are among least frequent words but that does not necessarily mean they are not important.", "First off, we will compare Descartes\u2019 \u201cPrinciple of Philosophy\u201d and Kant\u2019s \u201cCritique of Pure Reason\u201d. Being quintessentially 17th and 18th-century works, they were written during an era when modern western philosophy was in full bloom. In the left cloud, we observe Descartes gives importance to the words \u2018mind\u2019, \u2018body\u2019, \u2018nature\u2019 and \u2018things\u2019 through which he describes that all living things with a mind have the core attribute and ability to think, curate ideas and compare things critically; hence, the famous quotation exists:", "Cogito ergo sum. (I think; therefore I am.)", "Kant; however, emphasizes on the word \u2018reason\u2019 visible in the right cloud. Since the name of his book pertains to arguing about \u2018reason\u2019 it makes absolute sense for it being the most repeated term. Apart from that, Kant mentions jargon such as \u2018conception\u2019, \u2018empirical\u2019, \u2018intuition\u2019 which are all key to understanding his beliefs. We see the word \u2018transcendental\u2019 in the cloud as well which relates to the philosophical movement or trend started by Kant; later adopted by Ralph Waldo, theorizing that in order to understand the \u2018nature\u2019 of reality (with words such as \u2018space\u2019, \u2018time\u2019, \u2018world\u2019 as derivatives for nature) one must first examine and analyze the reasoning process that governs the nature of \u2018experience\u2019.", "If we were to compare two works by a single author, we can identify the similarity of words between the two clouds. The word \u2018man\u2019 is predominant in most philosophical works, especially in Aristotelian and Platonian philosophy. Even in Nietzsche\u2019s work on the topic of morality, we can assume how the main crux of the book revolves around the idealistic notion of how a human being is supposed to lead an \u2018ascetic\u2019 life of \u2018good\u2019, \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018love\u2019. In both the books, Nietzsche also critiques about past philosophers who associate the \u2018evil\u2019 man as the opposite of \u2018good\u2019 in all senses which the author tries to rebut. This is the underlying context of the mentioned words in quotes.", "Following Kant\u2019s philosophy, Ralph Waldo; an American philosopher of the 19th century, was among the group of thinkers of the Transcendentalist movement that apposed spirituality and intellectualism. Waldo\u2019s belief about the universe is best represented by the words \u2018nature\u2019 and \u2018soul\u2019 which he thought were essential components to realistically know the truth.", "Considering Karl Marx\u2019s work and comparing it with any of the other 5 texts, there is clear polarization. The terminologies are different, the concepts are revolutionary in the sense there is very little sign of work being derived from any other philosophical texts. The most interesting distinction between Marx\u2019s work and other notable thinkers is that the former has a more collective approach rather than an individualistic one. As Waldo, Nietzsche and company are talking about the \u2018man\u2019, Marx is more aggressively focused on \u2018society\u2019 at large, the \u2018bourgeois\u2019 or the middle \u2018class\u2019 and the \u2018proletariat\u2019 or working class, words that form the basis of Communism.", "Word clouds are only limited when it comes to qualitative analysis. We need to make use of some mathematical model through which we can compare the texts on a deeper level. R has a very neat way of calculating text similarity using various statistical models. In this particular scenario, I employed the Extended Jaccard method to calculate the matrix below.", "The comparison is done by taking the finite set of attributes (words) in each set, which in our case is the philosophical text, then dividing the total size of the intersection ( \u2229 ) with the total size of the union ( \u222a ) of the sample set. This is the extent of mathematics you need to know for now but we\u2019ll touch upon different methods of computing text-similarity matrices in future posts.", "On direct observation, we see that the 1\u2019s occur in a diagonal fashion, almost like an identity matrix. This shows that similar named texts will have 100% similarity with each other. Additionally, we can extract interesting pieces of information from this diagram. Looking at the numbered labels in fig 2a:", "The frequency of keywords can provide some important information about a particular philosophical text. Using R, we can approximate the total word count in the given text. Considering there are multiple redundant symbols, punctuation marks and numbers in the whole text, its safer to approximate the total count; hence, the tilde(~) in the first column.", "The second column represents the total number of unique terms present in each text. From this column, we can presumably determine the command and fluency of the English language with Waldo\u2019s work coming out on top with the highest number of unique words. It makes sense because the other 5 books were originally written in either German or French then later translated; whilst, Waldo\u2019s work was already in English.", "Additionally, we can further make sense of the work through the use of bi-gram frequencies. A bigram is a group of two consecutive words or terminologies that appear together in a certain text. In fig 3b, \u2018n\u2019 shows the count of the bigrams, on the x-axis. The y-axis illustrates the list of top 10 bigrams in each text.", "In the given graphs, Descartes\u2019 employs the use of \u201ccorporeal substance\u201d as the most repeated bigram, being one of the main topics the philosopher tries to prove. The two words are also inter-related with the other visible sets of words such as \u201cextended substance\u201d, \u201cexternal objects\u201d in the sense how they try to portray how the \u201chuman mind\u201d tries to assert objects as real.", "Not surprisingly, Kant\u2019s thesis talks fervently about \u201cpure reason\u201d and the graph directly proves it with a whopping count of 400+ repetitions. Since Kant\u2019s text has a total word count of 21000. Not much can be determined from Waldo\u2019s Essays because the group of words such as \u201chuman nature\u201d, \u201ccommon sense\u201d appear commonly across most philosophical works. Among the texts, Marx\u2019s communist mindset outshines the most. Not only that the bigrams are unique from the other 5 lectures, all the word groups have a high frequency distribution across Marx\u2019s Manifesto.", "Interestingly, when we consider Nietzsche\u2019s works, we see \u201cascetic ideals\u201d and \u201cmodern ideas\u201d as the two predominant bigrams in \u201cGenealogy of Morals\u201d and \u201cBeyond Good and Evil\u201d, respectively. It is intriguing to say the least, how their is a connection across Nietzsche\u2019s works as he provides a fresh perspective about how other philosophers of the age-old followed asceticism as a means to maximize their feeling of power. Concurrently, we can observe the name \u201cRichard Wagner\u201d; a German musical composer, appearing in both the graphs.", "Moving on, I also created TF-IDF graphs of the existing bigrams which will provide us a \u2018ranked\u2019 view about the words under use. TF-IDF is short for term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency, another statistical tool that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a text document in a corpus.", "To understand this graph, one needs to look at one set of words that are commonly occurring and another set of words that are rarely occurring. Notice this set of graphs are comprising of several stopwords such as \u201cthe\u201d, \u201cof\u201d, \u201cto\u201d and \u201ca\u201d, which are important in calculating the term frequencies (TF). Now the words next to these stop words are the source of interest for calculating the inverse document frequency (IDF). I\u2019ll conclude this section by leaving the analysis of the resulting bigram graphs to the reader.", "Proceeding into our final section on sentiment analysis. R has a very abstract way of going about this type of analysis which is both good and bad. Good because analysts who want to quickly churn out information from the text data can write a few lines of code and achieve results. It is bad for the eager ones who want to learn the algorithm and apply it in more advanced ways.", "Looking at the table in fig 4a, we use the NRC lexicon of words that comprise of a list of words associated with 2 sentiments: Positive and Negative; along with 8 basic emotions: anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust. We certainly must assume that a word can be positive in nature but the sentiment being expressed might be negative. For example bigrams such as \u201cnot happy\u201d or \u201cnot excited\u201d should be deemed as negative sentiments but should realize that R simply cannot determine all these associations in one iteration. This is one of those instances where Machine Learning can be applied, we\u2019ll look into that more in the future.", "The table otherwise is very simple to understand as it illustrates the total number of words associated with the particular sentiment or emotion. The red boxes represent the most dominating sentiment across the rows.", "Sentiment analysis usually employs the use of different lexicons named after researchers. For the graphical results below, I have used the Bing lexicon which has words divided into positive and negative sentiments only. There are 4782 negative words in comparison to 2007 positive words. This means that as we compile the results, expect a higher probability of hitting a negative trajectory.", "Progressing towards the graphs in fig 4b, Descartes starts off with a relatively positive demeanor, followed by an occasional depression. Generally, the overall sentiment expressed is positive. Kant, on the other hand, does the exact opposite. He starts off with a negative tone, possibly negatively bashing the then current notion of \u201creason\u201d. Then by the end of his critique, Kant shifts his tone to a more eager sounding one.", "In \u201cBeyond Good & Evil\u201d, there is an equal distribution of positive and negative sentiments while \u201cGenealogy of Morals\u201d is biased more towards the opposite spectrum of the y-axis, the reason probably being that Nietzsche focuses greatly on countering the \u2018evils\u2019 existing in human beings.", "In Ralph Waldo\u2019s Essays (highlighted by the green colored graph), the middle section of his lecture is significantly oriented towards the positive side. Upon, closer inspection, the middle section of Waldo\u2019s essays talks about \u201clove\u201d and hence we can justify the surge. While in Marx\u2019s short write up, we see more negative bias. This may be because of the aggressive or perhaps fear-inducing tone in his speech.", "With this comprehensive write up, we can see the existing possibilities of analyzing textual data. With my fondness to pieces of literature and mixing it with technical knowledge, I was able to create interesting visualizations that can be perceived in various ways. I intend on learning advanced toolkits available on the net such as D3.js, Plotly and playing around with available \u2018open\u2019 data. In the next piece, I might touch upon Facebook data and how one can use their emoji reactions feature to carry out sentiment analysis.", "Note: All the above mentioned tools in the article require some level of experience with coding. Fortunately, all these libraries are written in a way that with some effort, analysts who know statistical analysis tools such as Microsoft Excel, SPSS or Stata can create interesting (and aesthetically pleasing) graphs. So, if you want to enhance your skills in data analytics, do give these tools are try.", "Python enthusiasts can look into NLTK, which has a plethora of models for analyzing textual content using scientific, mathematical and even formulas that may involve some bit of Machine Learning as well.", "Spread and share knowledge.
