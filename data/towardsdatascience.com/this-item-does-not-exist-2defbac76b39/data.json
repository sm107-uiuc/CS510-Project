Even our conception of reality. In the XXth century, philosophers questioned the originality of an artwork (\u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d by Walter Benjamin). In the XXIst century, we question if something is real at all (and if there is something like a reality). With Machine and Deep Learning\u2019s power, entirely new possibilities emerged: we can generate something that never existed before. And ontological discussions continue in new dimensions\u2026", "The technical progress is going on at a rapid pace. For example, Generative Adversarial Networks. Here you can see the quality of GAN progress on face generation, presented in a tweet by Ian Goodfellow (creator and developer of GANs):", "And it was a 2018 tweet. The following year, StyleGAN came. And then, StyleGAN2. Based on the co-play of Generator and Discriminator this framework was able to generate photorealistic imagery. Not only the AI community was fascinated by new visual freshness. A website named \u201cThisPersonDoesNotExist.com\u201d became viral and acted as a bridge between Data Science and a broad audience. It showcased AI\u2019s capability to create lifelike portraits of not existing persons\u2026 or Deepfakes (a favorite media topic if it\u2019s time to speak about visual AI).", "DeepFake as a term means already delusion, fraud. But for me, ML/DL creations are full of unusual beauty. Forget \u201cUncanny Valley\u201d.", "It became a cultural movement, a metaphor for AI\u2019s creative (and dangerous) potential, a meme. The \u201cThis XY Does Not Exist\u201d meme.", "In the following, I want to present the existing representations of non-existing things, crafted with Machine and Deep Learning\u2019s power. The list will be ongoing updated with new findings.", "Presented images are coming from the Latent Space (the \u201cmachine\u2019s subconsciousness\u201d, \u201crepresentation of compressed data\u201d). Every time you refresh the page, a new image appears. This was probably one of the first ways to demonstrate the power of StyleGAN2.", "I advise you to run this StyleGAN2 Colab Notebook, finetuned by Mikael Christensen. It even has the possibility of StyleGAN2 projection (e.g. for detecting DeepFakes).", "Meanwhile, there is an opposite page: ThisPersonExists, launched by Vincent Woo as a homage to thousands of real human faces being used for StyleGAN2 training. Beautiful and weird as well.", "This page presents StyleGAN2-generated images of cats. Unlike faces, its resolution is rather humble (256x256), and cats don\u2019t always look realistic.

I mean, IRL?", "Another interesting \u2014 and non-existing cat can be visited in this interactive Latent Space Explorer:", "NotRealCats is an online gallery of daily digital art \u2014 and the cat explorer is an amazing feature.

I have never known, that changing a cat\u2019s Gestalt is something such pleasant.", "The same story (see: cats). The low resolution doesn\u2019t reconstruct alternate horses. Sometimes you see weird glitches as if the Discriminator gave up on low quality and went fishing; however, the Generator still tried as well as possible.", "These pre-trained networks are enabled by NVidia with StyleGAN2.

Why not?", "Imagine yourself being a coleopterist, discovering rare beetles, one after another. In the Latent Space. That\u2019s what a project by Bernat Cuni \u201cConfusing Coleopterists\u201d is all about. You see beautiful illustrations from scientific books under Public Domain license (it does mean they have some longer lives than many of us already).", "Around 30.000 Butterflies, generated by StyleGAN2, flutter around on this website. Creator described pretty well the steps he did, so not only inspiring but also very instructive.", "Ironically, for people living in Europe, such satellite images should be so familiar that one almost could identify a small town \u2014 besides, there are no such on the European ground or at the Earth\u2019s surface.", "Ron Hagensieker and Tomas Langer created an exciting model that lets you sneak into Alternate Europe.", "Ceramicist Derek Philip Au is multi-talent \u2014 not only he crafts ceramics, he also created Glazy, a free platform for sharing and analyzing ceramics recipes.

Infinite Jest.", "This lyric generator is a pretty powerful one. It creates lyrics to practically every topic you can imagine. Here is a song about toaster (you may know my affinity towards Toasters and Data Science):", "Or a rock song about \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d:", "Even if they not only have a rhyme or coherent verse, nevertheless you cannot stop to generate \u2014 and to sing!", "As project authors write, \u201cWhile not exactly your ordinary GPT-2 modal, we do crawl the web to find unexpected combos and show them for you.\u201d Interestingly, the page provides ML-based probability factors for every snack. \u201cPad Thai Bubble Gum\u201d is 0.146, according to their Plausibility Index. This is the code of the project: looking for and scoring \u201cthe plausibility of different types of associations\u201d.", "This one is a beautiful approach to reimagine artist manifests and statements by AI. The creator of \u201cVESSEL\u201d (see above), Derek Philip Au is experimenting with GPT-3 as well, and the non-existing quotes are not only convincing. They represent existing opinions and views \u2014 even if the particular artists have never said it (or even if there aren\u2019t such particular artists at all).", "For example, even if I couldn\u2019t find any artist named \u201cGiles Newton\u201d \u2014 but art, criticizing art critics was almost the way of creating by Kurt Schwitters, German Dadaist, who mashed up all the criticism on his art into his new artworks.", "Combining various visual and textual ML approaches can generate more unusual realms.

Images are produced by StyleGAN2 (on Bedroom Dataset).", "This is for sure not GPT-3 and the texts are on the fringe between insanity and reality, but this combination of visual and contextual data creates an eerie vibe of reality here.", "This is more than just an experiment. It\u2019s a parody about the generic state of many StartUps, who try to disrupt but implode after several pitches. According to Forbes and Fortune, \u201cNine of ten startups fail\u201d. There are manifold reasons for their ends, but one of the most crucial is: they often bear too perfect ideas without considering reality.", "In ThisStartupDoesNotExist we observe the web presences of unexisting startups as Zeitgeist: fancy stock image from Unsplash, hipster-ish looking staff, detailed pricing data, but you mostly have no clue, what does this StartUp really do. In the case of the current page, it\u2019s obvious (generated contents). But in the case of many existing StartUps, it\u2019s why they even by themselves not really know what do they actually do.", "Trained on Question&Answer conversations from StackExchange, this model generates realistically looking dialogues with experts.", "Stylistically and topographically correctly simulated forum couldn\u2019t probably solve the real problems but is refreshingly inspiring and generous for thinking out of the box.", "Guerilla company MSCHF, which is (in)famous for various memes, virals, puns, and subversive fun, generated this page using StyleGAN. As training Data was used \u201cWikiFeet\u201d, a massive database of feet images (don\u2019t ask me, please).", "This Foot Does Not Exist is a parody of fetishism of old urges and new technologies, social media clashes, and messaging app crazes. Subversive as every other project by MSCHF.", "If there are persons who do exist, even if they don\u2019t, why shouldn\u2019t they have a personal CV?", "Currently, the site seems not to work properly, as only one CV keeps to be generated repeatable.

Anyway, the chic and simple design is pleasant.", "I hope to generate new CVs for a new person because this is an fantastic way of storytelling.", "In the case of Brexit, you probably need a new fresh perspective. Even a new Parliament.
