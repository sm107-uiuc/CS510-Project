Probably many of you don\u2019t know who she was, but surely you know the English poet Lord Byron.", "Ok, but what is the connection between them? Byron was the father of Ada!", "Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace, was a mathematician and today she is considered the first computer programmer.", "She was born in 1815, and she received an education based on mathematics and science. That was not a standard for women of the 19th century.", "One day, Ada, decided to translate an article about Charles Babbage, the father of the computer. The article described a device known as an analytical engine, designed to handle complex calculations.", "She not only translated the article, but she also added some considerations about the potentialities of the machine. As a matter of fact, Ada described how to create codes with the device in order to manage words and symbols together with numbers.", "She also theorized a method for the device to repeat a series of instructions, a process known as looping that computer programming use today.", "Part I: what is the situation of women in Italy in the programming world compared to men?", "Starting from the article about Ada Lovelace, I asked myself what is today the situation of women in computer programming in particular in Italy. To answer this question, I analyzed data gathered by Stack Overflow\u2019s developer survey.", "In the first step of my analysis, I tried to know the percentage of women who worked with programming languages from 2017 to 2019 in Italy and in the United States. So, I noticed that a minority of them worked in this field, in particular in Italy.", "As you can observe in the graph below, the percentage of women computed on the total number of people who used programming languages in their job was very low. For Italy the situation is not good, only an average of 3.5% of women over three years worked in the programming world.", "Part II: What are the backgrounds of women who work in computer programming in Italy? What are their qualifications?", "Then I tried to go deep into this situation in order to understand what were the qualifications that these women had.", "I discovered that most of them were super qualified (i.e. they had a bachelor\u2019s degree, a master\u2019s degree, or a Ph.D.).", "The following figure shows us that from 2017 to 2019 women in computer programming with a university background were more than men with the same background.", "Part III: instead in the USA, what is the situation of super qualified women in tech?", "In the USA the situation is similar to the situation in Italy. Most of the American women who worked with programming languages from 2017 to 2019 were super qualified and they were more than men super qualified.", "In the following bar chart, it is possible to observe this situation.", "Thanks to the data I analyzed with Python, I understood that even today the number of women in computer programming is very low and only women who are super qualified try to take part in this field. That means there are a huge number of women who don\u2019t know this world because of cultural stereotypes and exclusion.", "So, it is important to give the right space to women in this field because they are a potential that can change and improve many things in the computer programming world as Ada Lovelace showed us.", "For more detailed information about this analysis, you can see the link to my GitHub available here.", "We can get in touch in my telegram group Data Science for Beginners.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data Analyst, Data lover & Dreamer. My aim is to make Data Science accessible to everyone.
