The city is renowned as one of the most multicultural cities globally due to its large population of immigrants from all over the globe. This leads the city to become a world leader among other metropolitan and cosmopolitan cities from many sectors, including business.", "Now, imagine that you own a coffee shop called Kopiasli (fictitious) that has been doing business successfully in New York. This year, your team plans to expand the business and decide to look for a city that shares the same trait as New York, and one of which is Toronto.", "To ensure this project\u2019s success, the team requires insights into the demographics, neighboring businesses, and crime rates. For each neighborhood, we can ask:", "Thus, the project goal is to figure out the best locations for opening up a new coffee shop in Toronto City.", "Entrepreneurs who are passionate about opening a coffee shop in a metropolitan city would be very interested in this project. The project is also for business owners and stakeholders who want to expand their businesses and wonder how data science could be applied to the questions at hand.", "The followings are data sources that we can use for this project:", "To sum up, we will use the 1st and 2nd data to analyze the pedestrian/vehicle volume and crime rates. Then, we load the 3rd data to obtain the exact coordinates for each neighborhood based on the postal code, allowing us to explore and map the city. Finally, we will use the coordinates and Foursquare credentials to access the 4th data source through its API and retrieve the popular venues along with their details, especially for coffee shops. The venue frequency in each neighborhood will be the features of the clustering model.", "We approach the problem using the clustering technique, namely k-Means. This approach enables the audience to see how similar neighborhoods about their demographics. We can then examine each cluster and determine the discriminating venue categories that distinguish each cluster. We will also display any statistics needed to answer questions concerning crime incidents, and vehicle and foot traffic records.", "We begin by analyzing the data about the pedestrian and vehicle volumes. The column Main contains the main street name that appears several times indicating it contains intersections. We can group by the street name and aggregate this either by summing those value up or averaging it. We will choose to average it for simplicity. This returns 248 main roads.", "We want our candidate neighborhoods to be lively. Hence, we filter out the roads. In this example, we only show the roads with an average of pedestrian volume above 1200 or vehicle volume above 12000 during peak hour (above ~70%). This gives us 139 main roads.", "Finally, we can visualize the roads using the Folium Python module from the given coordinates. The map shows a glimpse of the city\u2019s busiest roads, where many are located around downtown, which is not surprising \ud83e\udd23.", "In the next section, this visualization helps us filter the candidate areas and neighborhoods we need to focus on.", "Next, we analyze the crime statistics from 2014 to 2019. It gives us 206,435 crime incidents segmented by police divisional boundaries, neighborhoods, and Major Crime Indicators (MCI). Toronto Police Service divides the major crimes into 5 categories scattered to 17 divisions and 140 neighborhood IDs.", "We will group the data based on division (Division), not neighborhood (Hood_ID). This will give us insight into the safest boroughs and their neighborhoods.", "Among the 5 MCIs, Assault incidents have the most occurred for 6 consecutive years. In the same period, several divisions are consistent about their crime rates. We can segment them into three groups:", "Since we expect our candidate neighborhoods to be:", "therefore, the divisions qualified are D55, D54, D53, and D13. Referring to Toronto Police Service Wikipedia [5], these divisions cover:", "In the next section, we will explore the neighborhoods inside Central Toronto, East York, and York as the selected boroughs.", "Lastly, we have built a neighborhood data frame that contains 103 postal codes, 10 boroughs, neighborhood names inside each borough, and their coordinates. Since we are interested in neighborhoods inside Central Toronto, East York, and York only, we filter the data frame. This results in having 3 boroughs and 19 neighborhoods.", "Given the coordinates information, we can use the Foursquare API to access the 2nd data source, explore the neighborhoods, and get the top 100 venues within a radius of 1 km for each. As a result, it returns 905 venues with 172 unique venue categories.", "Some neighborhoods return above 50 venues, such as Davisville and Davisville North (100 venues). However, many return below 50 venues, such as Thorncliffe Park (38 venues) and Parkview Hill (19 venues). For each neighborhood, we can create the top 10 venues based on occurrences as follows.", "The data frame above indicates that we have the same venue categories returned to different neighborhoods. We can use this idea to cluster the neighborhoods based on their venues representing services and amenities.", "We will run the k-Means algorithm to build a clustering model with a different number of clusters (k). The features will be the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each venue category. Using Silhouette Score Elbow, we can measure and plot the clustering performances.", "We can inspect that the best k value for this task is 4. Hence, we will have 4 cluster neighborhoods at the end.", "Finally, Let\u2019s visualize the resulting clusters!", "As a result, we can examine venues listed inside each cluster and define the discriminating venue categories that distinguish them.", "The project\u2019s main goal is to determine the best location for opening a coffee shop business in Toronto. Discussing what locations can be considered \u201cthe best\u201d may vary, but we can equate it as the most conducive ones by considering the following criteria:", "Finding the best location to start a business can be challenging and quite frustrating due to many uncertainties. However, we can quickly gain meaningful insights into the city and its neighborhoods with data available today. This helps everyone, including entrepreneurs, business owners, and stakeholders, to make solid decisions based on facts.", "Using the coffee shop and Toronto as an example, I hope this project gives you a basic idea of how to deal with a similar case in the future. What other things need to be considered? Let\u2019s discuss below!", "Note: Everything you have seen is documented in my GitHub repository.
