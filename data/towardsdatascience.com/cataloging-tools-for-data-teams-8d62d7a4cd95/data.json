This gave birth to ETL solutions that integrate highly heterogeneous data sources, flexible, highly scalable data warehouses, and data lakes. With so many sources, copying, transforming, and integrating data into several targets, a data system gets quite complex. That being said, there are tools like Airflow to manage the workflow orchestration, tools to monitor jobs, and so on.", "Data discovery is essential for data scientists, data analysts and business teams", "If you think that integrating all the data into a single source of truth or even multiple sources gets the job done, the truth couldn\u2019t be far away from it. According to a report, data scientists at least 50% of their time finding, cleaning, and preparing data. Data scientists, data analysts, and business teams often find it difficult to find out what the data means and where it is coming from \u2014 both of these problems are quite commonly seen in data teams. The former can be solved by implementing a data catalog or a data dictionary and the latter can be dealt with by implementing a data lineage solution.", "Both data lineage and data cataloging fall under the large umbrella of metadata management. In this article, we\u2019ll talk about the most popular and efficient data cataloging tools available in the market. We\u2019ll explore the open-source projects, proprietary software, and cloud-based solutions that solve the problem of data discovery, cataloging, lineage, and metadata management, in general.", "Data systems are highly heterogenous today \u2014 they\u2019re multi-cloud, multi-source and even multi-target.", "There are not many contenders but the ones who are active are doing a good job such as Magda which was initiated by a government organization and has been adopted by many. With the backend storage in Postgres and search empowerment with Elasticsearch, Magda provides a great search engine-like interface to search through your data. You can go see a live demo with real data sets here.", "Before Magda came into existence, CKAN was the major open-source data catalog. In fact, Magda also uses parts of CKAN under the hood. The government of Canada and the government of the US use CKAN as one of their metadata management systems.", "Open-source by Lyft about a year and a half ago, Amundsen is another good contender in this area. It has been adopted by a number of very big companies like Workday and Asana. Unlike Magda, Amundsen uses neo4j as the backend database to store the metadata but uses Elasticsearch for search capabilities. You can learn about Amundsen\u2019s architecture here and from this Medium post by Tao Feng.", "There are a number of other open-source tools like LinkedIn\u2019s DataHub, Airbnb\u2019s Dataportal, Netflix\u2019s Metacat, WeWork\u2019s Marquez. You can find good resources about these tools in this article.", "Honorary Mention \u2014 Spotify hasn\u2019t open-sourced Lexikon yet but here\u2019s an interesting read about how it solved data discovery issues for their data scientists.", "All major cloud platforms have a substantial number of services to offer now. With cloud-based orchestration services, data pipelining and ETL solutions, there was a need for implementing a basic data cataloging component. Most of these solutions like AWS Glue Catalog and Google Cloud Data Catalog use the Hive Metastore underneath. Microsoft has its own implementation of the catalog in the Azure Data Catalog.", "Needless to say that these tools work really well with their respective coupled web services on their own cloud platforms but all of them are have limited features. They\u2019re not meant for metadata management but for ensuring that they have enough data to support ETL operations, orchestration pipelines, and so on. Think of them more like your database or data warehouse system catalog views & tables with some additional information. That\u2019s about it.", "With commerciality in mind, many companies have built fantastic full-fledged products for metadata management. Atlan, Ataccama, and Alation are some of the major players in this market. There are many traditional players in the market too \u2014 Informatica being the most popular amongst them, so much so that it was named the leader in this industry in 2019 in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Metadata Management Solutions.", "Proprietary software has a one-up on open-source software on being ready for enterprise usage, great technical support, and also product enhancements according to the clients. They usually have a very engaging UI and a fairly bug-free codebase. All that obviously comes with the money \ud83d\ude04", "In the end, it is worth reiterating that metadata management is one of the less taken care of problems in the data engineering world \u2014 using proper tools for metadata management and data discovery can make life easier and work efficiently for data scientists, data analysts, and the business users in your company. Make sure that you choose the right ones that suit your needs!", "Your home for data science.
