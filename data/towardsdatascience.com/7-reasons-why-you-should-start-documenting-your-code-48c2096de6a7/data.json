Notion can be called an all-in-one workplace.", "I like to use Notion to document everything that is related to my data science projects because Notion supports every kind of file including code, pdf, and web bookmark. Notion also makes it easy to organize your contents and make them look nice with minimal effort.", "I remembered my manager kept reminding me to document my code using Notion, but I was reluctant to document my code at first because I imagined it must be time-consuming.", "However, I realized that it would be even more time consuming if I forgot what I have done and needed to reinvent the wheel. Thus, I decided to start documenting my code on Notion. Surprisingly, I was able to solve all of the problems mentioned above!", "In this article, I will share the benefits I gained from documenting and show you how you can start documenting your code in Notion.", "Some benefits of documenting with Notion are:", "It is good to keep track of what models you have worked on, especially if you are not the only data scientist in your team. The worst thing you don\u2019t want to happen is to accidentally work on the same thing that your teammates worked on.", "By creating a general description of what each member is working on, your teammates and manager will not only get updated on what you have done but also might be able to give you some helpful suggestions.", "To insert a table like above, select Table-Inline option. Now, you have a fully fledged table like above", "After inserting text to the table, you can expand the text to a page to describe the details of the method.", "In the team meeting, your team members offer some amazing ideas to tackle a problem. However, after the call, you might not be sure about what specific steps you should take next. To prevent this from happening, quickly write down the ideas of your team members in the meeting", "It can be just as simple as below. Several bullet points should do the trick.", "By writing a rough sketch of your general plan before jumping into the project, you will know what specific steps you should take next. This might sound time-consuming but this will actually save you time by taking the right steps.", "After revising your plan and your team members\u2019 ideas, you can put ideas into actionable items by writing a TO-DO list at the end of the outline.", "By having small and specific goals, you know the exact steps you need to get the work done and keep yourself from feeling lost.", "If you find it difficult to write down a specific task, it is time to have a short call with your team to recap the ideas of the last meeting.", "To create a to-do list in Notion, find a to-do list block.", "Now you have a to-do block.
