Java is one such programming language.", "Everything in a java program is contained within a class. A class can be considered as a factory that produces objects. An object contains data inside of it. It can have one data item or many. e.g. a lunchbox object might contain 3 data items", "These 3 different items inside our object are called fields. Every field must have a type. In the above example, we have 3 fields but 2 of them have the same type. At the same time we methods that act on data. For example, methods can be used to see what data is contained inside an object. These are called accessor methods. We can also have methods that modify the data inside the object. These are known as updater methods.", "Let\u2019s say that we have a food factory (class). It makes lunch boxes (objects). A lunchbox contains 3 different items of food(fields). Two of them are the same type (solid food) and one is different (liquid food). We have 3 people who interact to use this food. The chef (Method 1) heats the food, the waiter (Method 2) serves the food and the consumer (Method 3) eats the food.", "In Java programs, the primary \u201cactors\u201d are objects. Every object is an instance of a class, which serves as the type of the object and as a blueprint, defining the data which the object stores and the methods for accessing and modifying that data. \u2014 Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, Michael H. Goldwasser (Data Structures and Algorithms in Java)", "An object is an instance of the class i.e. A class can give rise to many objects. For example", "Let\u2019s try to see how to build a basic Factory Class. Let\u2019s first take a look at the complete code.", "The lines public class Factory{} enclose the complete code. The file has to be named as the class name. So the filename is also Factory.java.", "Now the top 3 lines give you the 3 items (instance variables) you want in your lunchbox. Right now you can see that all 3 have the same type = String. Java gives you the flexibility to create your own types which essentially means creating a class by that name. So if you were to create a SolidFood class, for example, you would have to write public class SolidFood{} and that\u2019s all.", "Right now we have 3 instance variables of the type String and names SolidFood1, SolidFood2 and LiquidFood1.", "The code that creates an object lies inside the constructor. A constructor can be an empty one or can take some input arguments that are used to define the object. In our case sf1, sf2 and lf1 are the arguments that define what items are contained in our lunchbox.", "In simple words, a constructor defines what the fields of the object look like.", "Methods are used to either fetch object fields or modify them. In our case, we have only written fields that fetch the item names.", "The main method is the only method that needs to be in every program. It is the only thing that java compiler runs. From inside the main, you can create objects, use methods on these objects and print stuff.", "Object is created by calling a constructor. Once an object is created you can use various methods at your disposal to understand or modify the object. Here we are just showing how to access field names.", "Just in case you do not have java visit this page.", "Assuming you have java installed in your system you should be able to run the program using the following commands.", "The output you see looks like this", "There is a lot more involved in OOP.
