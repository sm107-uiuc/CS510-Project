Lately I\u2019ve been devoting my career to making Shiny apps more beautiful, and this year I decided to take part in the contest. However, I wanted to do something a little bit different\u2026", "At that moment a question popped up in my mind: Would it be possible to build a game using R Shiny, even as a prototype? Could it actually be playable and enjoyable?", "Shiny has been historically used for data-driven applications and as a rapid development tool, but games have been done in all sorts of languages and frameworks before. Not only that, but the ingredients were all there: A way to build UI, something to keep game state, and the ability to read input from players and update the UI accordingly.", "There have been attempts to make simple Shiny games as early as 2016, but I wanted to try something more ambitious. The more I joked around with the idea the more it actually seemed doable. Let\u2019s find out if I was right.", "My initial idea was simple. I wanted it to be a slow-paced game that you could play on a desktop or mobile since I also wanted to explore building responsive UIs in Shiny. I went with a card swiping game where swiping in different directions would affect the game in different ways. These choices would then influence some metrics, and the player would juggle decisions to keep those metrics at optimal levels.", "I decided it could be fun to put the player in the shoes of a fictional world leader whose decisions would influence the state of the world. Your job would be to balance the economy, environment, and public opinion of your performance as an all-powerful decision maker. If any of those got to zero, game over!", "I also decided it would be interesting to have a separate value to track how evil you are. Something that wouldn\u2019t lose you the game but provide small benefits or hurdles depending on your behavior. Thus the Karma meter was born.", "I imagined it with a retro feeling, so I went with NES.css for some of that 8 bit nostalgia. I also really wanted to show a map based on the metrics, `leaflet` was an easy choice in this case given how popular and easy to use it is.", "With most of the research and a solid proof of concept behind me, it was time for implementation! I wanted to have a very clear and easy to follow project structure, while at the same time making it simple for anyone to pick up and expand upon.", "When it comes to technologies, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would be the bread and butter for the front-end. Libraries like `htmltools` and `SASS` were obvious choices since I was going to build a lot of these components by hand. This would also let me easily include JavaScript for more complex browser behavior.", "For the server components, I decided to structure them in their own individual `R6` objects, inside `modules`. If you aren\u2019t familiar with R6, it\u2019s an Object-oriented programming approach for encapsulating methods and values into classes that can then be instantiated as separate objects, meaning each object will have its own methods and state. It\u2019s a different approach from functional programming, but very commonly used in other languages. Be sure to check out Marcin Dubel\u2019s helpful post about R6 classes.", "With an idea of what I wanted to work with, it was time to actually build the thing. So I started going over a list of the required components:", "After a few weekends, I got to a point where I was happy with it and decided to enter my submission. The contest results aren\u2019t out yet, so keep your fingers crossed for me!", "I was shocked by how quickly the development went. Reactive values are AMAZING as an engine for managing the state of the game, and R6 made it super easy to create and destroy instances when needed. Using a spreadsheet for the database was also a really interesting concept that turned out better than I expected. The final result lets me fix typos and add new card types very easily.", "Even mobile worked as expected thanks to some custom css styling:", "Final thoughts: Games in shiny, yay or nay?", "At this point we know that it\u2019s possible to build a functioning video game in R Shiny. So\u2026should you use Shiny to build your own game? To be honest, probably not. There are dozens of other frameworks and languages that are definitely more suitable for this type of project.", "However\u2026to me this project shows how easy it is to implement complex UX and UI elements in R Shiny. Of course, this is not a commercial ready game, but as a proof of concept or a rapid prototype that can be set up in a couple of days/weeks and then iterated upon, Shiny once again managed to surprise me in a highly positive way. This bodes well for Shiny\u2019s continued future as a go-to solution for complex enterprise dashboards.", "If you want to play around with the code or find more information about the project, you can find everything on the Github repository: https://github.com/pedrocoutinhosilva/shiny.decisions", "Or maybe you just want to play with the final result! Make sure to let me know how many weeks you managed to get to!", "Your home for data science.
