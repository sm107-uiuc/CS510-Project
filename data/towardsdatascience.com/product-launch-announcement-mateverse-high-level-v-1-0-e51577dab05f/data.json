Statistics predict a huge increase in the use of artificial intelligence by 2021. Many have written repeatedly on the subject of how transformative the AI technology is going to be, and calling AI the third Industrial Revolution. We are not going to dive into that, but let\u2019s take a look at how Mateverse comes into the picture.", "TL;DR to the story of the AI\u2019s tremendous influence in society is: Machine learning is seeping into every other business organization. As a result, it\u2019s making their processes (internal and external) tremendously easy.", "What started with large companies, culminating in manifold sales conversion with the ability to cater to unique customer demands, started making its way into smaller organizations. Areas such as analytics, sales desk, UI and much more, underwent large transformations within the smaller companies. Now, word is spreading faster than ever.", "Frankly, nothing ever prevented the smaller organizations from implementing what the bigger ones could, other than the cost.This expensive affair becomes quite an ordeal for smaller organizations. Soon enough AI, and its essential counterpart, Machine Learning was made accessible through Open Source algorithms, and the availability of pre-trained ML models.", "Another fact, that not many take notice of, is that while such rampant adaptation is happening around companies worldwide, guess who bears the brunt for the ML project gone awry? They are the Analysts and the Data Scientists, who have shouldered the solo role of pushing the analytics with little to no help from other departments. There are numerous cases of Data Scientists switching companies, or ending up at highly unsatisfactory jobs, either because they do not get to do what they can, or because they are made to do Himalayan tasks with insufficient infrastructure.", "We really can not blame anyone, considering that AI and ML are very new technologies trying to shake off the hype and fear around them.", "We at Mate Labs started building our product- Mateverse, upon identifying, and knowing all too well, the struggles of the industry having tried our hands at various projects before. As we attempted to come up with a solid solution for some time, to the tremendous, and mundane processes that is involved in Machine Learning, Mateverse V1.0, is finally out there. Lit..era..lly, fighting the tech corporates of the world, and finding the will in a community dedicated to helping us bring AI to the masses.", "After testing the idea with Mateverse beta Version, we got an overwhelming response from the smaller businesses and analysts behind huge walls of MNCs that previously had no good idea about how ML could help their businesses, or didn\u2019t have a lot of room to play. Having to not write a single line of code for the Modelling, Mateverse has made it several times easier for companies to deploy predictive models, and bring accelerating impact to their businesses.", "Coming back to the factors that deter ML implementations for businesses , we\u2019ll connect the dots and talk to you as to how and where Mateverse is a cost-cutter, as well as an \u201ceffort-cutter\u201d.", "Perhaps, the best way to take you through how Mateverse does the cost and effort cutting, would be to go through the steps of Machine Learning. Let\u2019s take one of the best examples of building a Predictive Analysis Model", "While present solutions in Automated Machine Learning seems like the following:", "Get Data \u2014 -> Perfect Predictions", "It definitely does not work that way.", "The best way to piss off a Data Scientist would be to assume that it is all too easy with some data at hand. Worse, incomplete and inconsistent data can never accomplish a project.", "Still, there are ways that we can make it easier for Data Scientists to Deploy a Model faster, by which I mean, way faster.", "To Deploy a Predictive Model (to take the best example), the steps involved could be summarized as follows:", "In the Data Collection phase, Mateverse supports all common types of databases HDFS/RDBMS/NoSQL, or you can just upload a CSV file and a database is created. As simple as that.", "Data preparation starts from joining multiple tables in the database. This requires skills with SQL scripts, which is a bit of a tedious task. Now, Mateverse provides a graphical interface for users to do that. The table join feature allows End-Users to create hybrid datasets in 7 different ways.", "Moreover, most of the time, a team of Data Analysts/Scientists work on a dataset, by dividing it into subsets due to the sheer volume of and size of the dataset. However, working on the same dataset by multiple people synchronously has never before been supported. This is now possible through Mateverse\u2019s pro-collaboration platform, where the team admin distributes/delegates the responsibilities, and each member can simultaneously work on the same dataset while they stay updated on the edits done by other members of the team.", "Classic methods of data cleaning includes Analysts and Data Scientists juggling between multiple steps, and concentrating on several points simultaneously. The data that is collected is not always in the perfect form. In fact, it never is. Suppose, data from a retail store is collected, there may be some missing values that failed to register in the systems, or were stored in formats that make it difficult to be retrieved. If not missing data, there can be data that is a misfit, irrelevant, or unusable. Data can also be mixed, misrepresented and categorized in wrong sections. If listening to this is hard, dealing with these mistakes is something data folks struggle with all the time. So, when Data Scientists are expected to transform data overnight, it\u2019s no wonder that it\u2019s frustrating to the lot.", "In technical terms, some of the data cleaning methods are \u2014 Missing value treatment, data tokenization, and outlier detection.", "Mateverse has made this a one-click process. How do you ask? We have built an intelligent system that has been trained on tens and thousands of datasets to do exactly that.", "This section of data handling is yet another tedious set of methods that Data Scientists carefully go through. This is where Data Scientists make sure that there are no mistakes in the data that has been cleaned, and then applying transformations on it. Making sense of the data that is collected is the primary manual effort that is put into Machine Learning. Unless this part of data preparation is able to derive accurate predictions, the machine\u2019s learning can commit serious errors.", "A set of rules guide this phase of data preparation. Some of those rules/methods are: Classification, Clustering, Regression and Ranking. To take the example of retail again, these set of rules can help a machine learn relationships between the given data. Obvious Classification, like gender or age, or not so obvious Clustering, like spending habits, financial capability and so on. It is only after this stage that a Data Scientist can heave a sigh of relief because most of her/his work is done.", "Mateverse will remove the excess manual effort that is involved in the process, and will let the experts spend quality time to experiment with different types of models.", "Now that we have built our near perfect dataset, the next step is training a predictive model. That involves two steps:", "The core of Machine Learning is in the selection of appropriate algorithms. Algorithms function in a way that makes interpretations out of the prepared data. Selection of a certain algorithm depends on what function is expected out of the model in the end. These algorithms range from statistical algorithms, to tree based algorithms, and then to Bayesian algorithms. In fact, there are countless possible algorithms out there.", "Data Scientists experiment with the hundreds of algorithms, to finally select the algorithm that can get the best results.", "Hyperparameter tuning is used on models according to the specific problem that the model is trying to solve. Hyperparameter tuning results in creation of the best predictive models. This is a complex process and optimizing this part of machine learning is a tough task.", "Mateverse makes the fore-mentioned steps a one-click process, by mimicking how a data scientist would approach the problem, in-turn optimizing a Data-Scientist\u2019s work acting like an assistant to her.", "It\u2019s not rare that you find a data analyst picky about their visualizations since correct and appropriate visualization bring value and clarity to the data. We support over four dozen visualization charts in Mateverse.", "Mateverse allows model deployments on Data Stream and the predictions are live, and on the spot. You can deploy on Mateverse\u2019s dashboard for real-time updates, or you can integrate it in your own product using APIs.", "If you think that the platform is something that can be helpful to you, do tell us about it here.", "At Mate Labs we have built Mateverse, a Machine Learning Platform, where you can build customized ML models in minutes without writing a single line of code. Our platform enables everyone to easily build and train Machine Learning models, without writing a single line of code.
