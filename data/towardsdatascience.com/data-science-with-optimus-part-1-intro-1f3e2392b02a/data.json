The API was designed to be super easy for newcomers and very familiar for people that come from working with pandas. Optimus expands the Spark DataFrame functionality, adding .rows and .cols attributes.", "With Optimus you can clean your data, prepare it, analyze it, create profilers and plots, and perform machine learning and deep learning, all in a distributed fashion, because on the back-end we have Spark, TensorFlow, Sparkling Water and Keras.", "It\u2019s super easy to use. It\u2019s like the evolution of pandas, with a piece of dplyr, joined by Keras and Spark. The code you create with Optimus will work on your local machine, and with a simple change of masters, it can run on your local cluster or in the cloud.", "You will see a lot of interesting functions created to help with every step of the data science cycle.", "Optimus is perfect as a companion for an agile methodology for data science because it can help you in almost all the steps of the process, and it can easily connect to other libraries and tools.", "If you want to read more about an Agile DS Methodology check this out:", "The install process it\u2019s very simple. Just run the command:", "And you are ready to rock and roll.", "Creating a data science environment should be easy. Both for trying stuff and for production. When I was starting thinking on these series of articles I was shocked to find out how hard is to prepare a reproducible environment for data science with free tools.", "But without a doubt the winner for me was MatrixDS:", "With this tool you have a free environment for Python (with JupyterLab) and for R (with R Studio), also tools for presenting like Shiny and Bokeh, and much more. And for free. You will be able to run everything in the repo:", "Inside of MatrixDS with a simple fork of the project:", "Just create an account and you\u2019re good to go.", "The path above is how I\u2019m going to structure the different blogs, tutorials and articles in the series. I have to tell you right now that I\u2019m preparing a full course that will cover some of this tools with a business perspective with Business Science, here you can see more:", "The first part is on MatrixDS and GitHub, so you can just Fork in on GitHub and Forklift it on MatrixDS.", "Here\u2019s the notebook, but please check it out in the platforms :)", "For updates follow me on Twitter and LinkedIn :).", "Your home for data science.
