When data privacy is a major concern and we don\u2019t trust anyone withholding our data we can turn to federated learning for building privacy-preserving AI by building intelligent systems privately.", "Federated learning is about moving computations to data. Where a globally shared model is bought to where the data is e.g. Smartphones. By moving the model to the device, we can collectively train a model as a whole.", "With this concept in mind, anyone can take part in Federated learning on their devices either directly or indirectly, E.g. Edge devices such as smartphones and IoT devices can benefit from on-device data without the data ever leaving the device especially for computationally constrained devices where communication is a bottleneck with smaller devices.", "The concept of moving computations to data is a powerful concept in terms of building any intelligent system while protecting the privacy of any individuals.", "Federated learning also comes in three categories such as \u201cHorizontal federated learning\u201d, \u201cVertical federated learning\u201d, and \u201cFederated transfer learning\u201d.", "Horizontal federated learning uses datasets with the same feature space across all devices, this means that Client A and Client B has the same set of features as shown in a) below. Vertical federated learning uses different datasets of different feature space to jointly train a global model as shown in b) below. One example would be Client A (Amazon) has information about the customer\u2019s movie purchases on Amazon, and Client B (IMDB) has information about the customer's movie reviews, using these two sets of datasets from different domains allows one to serve the customers better using movie reviews information (IMDB) to provide better movie recommendation to the customers browsing movies in Amazon. Lastly, Federated transfer learning is vertical federated learning utilized with a pre-trained model that is trained on a similar dataset for solving a different problem. One such example of Federated transfer learning is to train a personalised model e.g. Movie recommendation for the user\u2019s past browsing behavior.", "Federated learning revolves around the Federated averaging algorithm called \u201cFedAvg\u201d [3]. FedAvg is the very first vanilla Federated learning algorithm formulated by Google [3] for solving Federated learning problems. Since then, many variants of FedAvg algorithms such as \u201cFedProx\u201d, \u201cFedMa\u201d, \u201cFedOpt\u201d, \u201cScaffold\u201d etc.. has been developed to address many of the Federated learning problems in [2].", "The following describes how FedAvg algorithm work at a high level.", "At each round of FedAvg, the aim is to minimize the objective of the global model w which is just the sum of the weighted average of the local device loss.", "With such a useful technology comes with an abundance of challenges that need to be addressed [2, 4]. Some of the most important challenges which I think need to be addressed were the following four points curated from [4] (The list is by no means exhaustive).", "Federated learning is still a relatively new field with many research opportunities for making privacy-preserving AI better. This includes challenges such as system heterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, privacy concerns, and communication efficiency, etc.. This brings forth many open problems in Federated learning that needs to be addressed as a whole before Federated learning can be widely adopted by the industry.", "[1] Federated Learning: Collaborative Machine Learning without Centralized Training Data", "[2] Advances and Open Problems in Federated Learning", "[3] Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data", "[4] A survey on security and privacy of federated learning", "Your home for data science.
