Engineers worldwide developed open-source Elasticsearch integrations and extensions, and many of these projects were absorbed by Elastic (the company behind the Elasticsearch project) as part of their stack.", "Some of the projects were Logstash (data processing pipeline, commonly used for parsing text-based files) and Kibana (visualization layer built on top of Elasticsearch), leading towards the now widely adopted ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack.", "The ELK stack quickly gained notoriety due to its impressive set of possible applications across emerging and consolidated tech domains, such as DevOps, Site-Reliability Engineering, and, most recently, Data Analytics.", "Chances are that if you're a data scientist reading this article and have Elasticsearch as part of your employer's tech stack, you might have had some problems trying to use all the features Elasticsearch provides for data analysis and even for simple machine learning tasks.", "Data scientists are generally not used to NoSQL database engines for everyday tasks or even relying on complex REST APIs for analysis. Dealing with large amounts of data using Elasticsearch's low-level python clients, for example, is also not that intuitive and has somewhat of a steep learning curve for someone coming from a field different from SWE.", "Although Elastic made significant efforts in enhancing the ELK stack for Analytics and Data Science use cases, it still lacked an easy interface with the existing Data Science ecosystem (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and other popular libraries).", "In 2017, Elastic took its first step towards the data science field and, as an answer to the growing popularity of Machine Learning and predictive technologies in the software industry, released their first ML-capable X-pack (extension pack) for the ELK stack, adding Anomaly Detection and other unsupervised ML tasks to its features. Not long after that, Regression and Classification models (1) were also added to the set of ML tasks available in the ELK stack.", "Last week another step towards Elasticsearch achieving widespread adoption in the data science industry, with the release of Eland, a brand new Python Elasticsearch client and toolkit with a powerful (and familiar) pandas-like API for analysis, ETL, and Machine Learning.", "Eland enables data scientists to efficiently use the already robust Elasticsearch analysis and ML capabilities without requiring a deep knowledge of Elasticsearch and its many intricacies.", "Features and concepts from Elasticsearch were translated into a much more recognizable setting. For instance, an Elasticsearch index, with its documents, mappings, and fields, becomes a dataframe, with rows and columns, much like we are used to seeing when using pandas.", "Typical data science use cases such as reading an entire Elasticsearch index into a pandas dataframe for Exploratory Data Analysis or training an ML model would usually require some not-so-efficient shortcuts.", "The procedure described above would lead us to get all the documents in the index as a list of dictionaries, only to load them into a pandas dataframe. That means having both the documents themselves and the resulting dataframe in memory at some point in the process (2). This procedure would not always be feasible for Big Data applications, and exploring the dataset in the Jupyter Notebook environment could become very complicated and fast.", "Eland enables us to perform very similar operations to the ones described above, without any of the friction involved in adapting them to the Elasticsearh context, while still using Elasticsearch aggregation speed and search features.", "As an added feature that would require a bit more wrangling on the pandas' side, the field geoip (which is a nested JSON object in the index) was seamlessly parsed into columns in our dataframe. We can see that by calling the .info() method on the Eland dataframe.", "We can also notice that memory usage went from around 840 Kbs in the pandas dataframe to only 96 bytes in the Eland dataframe. We don't need to hold the entire dataset in memory to retrieve the information we require from the index. Most of the workload remains in the Elasticsearch cluster (3) as aggregations or specific queries.", "For such a small dataset, this is not that important. Still, as we scale to Gigabytes of data, the benefits of not holding everything in memory for simple computations and analysis are more noticeable.", "Eland abstracts many of the already existing APIs in Elasticsearch without data scientists needing to learn Elasticsearch's specific syntax. For example, it is possible to get the mapping of an index (equivalent to retrieving thedtypes attribute of a pandas DataFrame). Still, it is not immediately apparent or how to do it. With the Eland DataFrame object, we can retrieve thedtypesattribute as we would do on a regular pandas DataFrame.", "With these abstractions in place, Eland allows us to use core Elasticsearch features that are not part of pandas (or at least are not as efficient), such as full-text search, Elasticsearch's most prominent use case.", "This article only touches the surface of the possibilities Eland opens for data scientists and other data professionals using Elasticsearch on day-to-day operations.", "Especially in DevOps and AIOps contexts, where ML-based tools are not very mature yet, data professionals can benefit from Python's existing machine learning ecosystem to analyze large amounts of Observability and Metrics data, which will be a topic for another article.", "Eland is undoubtedly a big step towards Elasticsearch, and I look forward to what future versions of the ELK stack will bring to the table.", "Check out this webinar where Seth Michael Larson (one of Eland's main contributors) goes over Eland's main features.", "If you would like to see more content about Elasticsearch, Data Science, Information Retrieval, NLP in the context of Observability, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and read my other articles on these topics.", "Your home for data science.
