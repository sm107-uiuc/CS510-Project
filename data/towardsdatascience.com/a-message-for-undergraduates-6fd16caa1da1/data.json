Either you\u2019re graduating soon (like me) or you\u2019re in the process of getting your first college degree. The process is not easy and I can only assume how difficult the pressures on Masters and Ph.D. students are. However, I have no clue about this, so it will not be my topic of focus. You could easily make the argument that I\u2019m writing this for myself \u2014 that would be partially true. I still want to send this message out regardless. Applying to jobs in the Machine Learning field is not easy. Anyone who tells you otherwise did not work half as hard as you are working right now.", "Getting an undergraduate degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or any technical field related to Data Science and Machine Learning is an excellent way to get your foot in the door. Typically, you\u2019re expected to have some form of internship or research experience during your four years in college. Getting experience afterwards is just as great. But when I talk about being objective of yourself, it\u2019s not necessarily about your experience.", "I am a rising senior in my university. This means I have less than a year left to graduate with a BS in Statistics. I constantly look back to myself as a sophomore taking my first upper division Statistics class \u2014 Analysis of Variance. When my professor was discussing how to find the overall sample mean, I saw a double summation for the first time in my entire life. I almost had a panic attack. This was the equation:", "Now, you may be looking at this equation thinking that it is very intuitive. It really is. However, I will never shake the feeling I got when I first saw this equation. It was a feeling of not being mathematically savvy enough to understand a double summation. It was a feeling of being behind in the class despite starting it no more than two weeks before seeing the equation. It was a feeling of failure. Isn\u2019t that a lot of feelings for an equation like this? It really is.", "I was 19 when I saw my first double summation and here I am now, a little less than two years later at 21, developing a thesis that requires me to know about two fields I have no formal education in. In a little less than two years, I went from being scared of equations to not getting enough of them. Now, I look back at myself taking this class and I can understand my feelings objectively. As a new student, I was seeing many concepts for the first time, so it makes sense that I was intimidated by a formula like this. As an undergraduate, you will be expected to see many (and I mean many) new concepts you have never seen or thought of in your entire life. Many of these concepts will fascinate you endlessly and fit perfectly in how you interpret the world. Many more of these concepts will break the way you think and leave you stumped for days, weeks, and sometimes even semesters to understand them (side note: if you are ever this confused about a concept talk to your professor and TA. If that still does not help YouTube has always gotten my back.)", "If you cannot recognize the growth you have made in the past few years, you cannot recognize the growth you are bound to make in the future. What are your goals? How do you plan on achieving your goals? Looking at yourself objectively reminds you that you are not expected to know everything from the get-go. Being an undergraduate comes with a very significant implication: you are new in the field. This is far from a bad thing. In fact, it is only a bad thing if you think it is. Begin to recognize that you are beginning your journey down a path you chose for yourself. Begin to recognize that what you do not know now is not representative of your knowledge and potential in the future. Begin to recognize that the malleability in your knowledge can be used to make you a superstar \u2014 you just have to see it for yourself.", "Your home for data science.
