But it\u2019s also an area that\u2019s relatively difficult for newcomers to navigate, due to the high bar for technical knowledge and resource requirements.", "While there\u2019s no shortage of helpful notebooks and tutorials out there, pulling the various threads together can be time consuming. To help speed up the learning process for fellow newcomers, I\u2019ve put together a simple end-to-end project to create a simple AI conversational chatbot that you can run in an interactive app.", "I chose to frame the text generation project around a chatbot as we react more intuitively to conversations, and can easily tell whether the auto-generated text is any good. Chatbots are also ubiquitous enough that most of us would have a good sense of the expected baseline performance without having to consult a manual or an expert. If it\u2019s bad, you\u2019ll know right away without having to check a score or metric.", "The workflow in the project is structured with the practical questions of a beginner in mind: How to get started with data extraction and preparation, what\u2019s needed to fine tune a pre-trained transformer model, and finally how to test/use the bot in an app.", "The end product is not what one might call \u201cpolished\u201d, as the screen-grab below of one of the test-runs shows. But as a first experiment, the results are good enough (in my view) for highlighting both the possibilities and limits of AI text generation via transfer learning.", "If the sample conversation above looks bewildering to you, well, you\u2019ve likely not been to Singapore and/or heard of \u201cSinglish\u201d, or colloquial Singaporean English. It\u2019s a mish-mash of several languages and local slang, and can be confusing for non-Singaporeans. In other words, not a bad way to test the limits of the DialoGPT model.", "The data for fine tuning the model is taken from a collection of SMS messages by Singaporean students at a local university. While the written and spoken forms of \u201cSinglish\u201d can differ significantly, we\u2019ll set that aside for practical reasons.", "The dataset (raw and cleaned versions for training) and four related notebooks are available in my repo. The notebooks are split according to the following tasks:", "As far as resource requirements go, you can run this project on a free Google/Colab account if you fine tune a DialoGPT-small model instead of the larger versions. If you are using a more robust dataset, perhaps fine tuning a DialoGPT-small model would be sufficient.", "But I found that my results from fine tuning the smaller model weren\u2019t as good, and the constant housekeeping to avoid busting the 15Gb storage limit on a free Google account was a drain on productivity.", "If you foresee yourself experimenting with more/larger transformer models in future, I\u2019d recommend an upgrade to Colab Pro as well as increasing the amount of storage space on your Google account. This allowed me to iterate quickly, without having to wrestle with a physical eGPU set up at home.", "For brevity, I won\u2019t go into the technical details in this post. I\u2019m still learning as I go, and there are far better articles on this topic out there. Most of the code are lifted or adapted from the work of previous authors, and they are acknowledged as such in the notebooks.", "The first and biggest question for the project is whether you can find an appropriate dataset for your use case. The more specific the use case (say, a Trevor Noah chatbot), the harder it will be to find the appropriate training data. Ethical questions should be considered at the outset: Is it appropriate to model the chatbot after a real person, even if you have access to transcripts, and what is the likelihood of potential misuse?", "The anonymised SMS dataset used in this project is among the few \u201cSinglish\u201d corpuses in the public space, and is the only one I\u2019ve found that\u2019s large enough for this purpose. The first half of notebook3.0 involves the steps needed to extract the SMSes from a deeply nested json file. Skip this if you are using a different dataset.", "The second half deals with the very specific way that the training and validation data sets have to be prepared for use in the DialoGPT model. Essentially, for every SMS you have to create x-number of previous SMSes as \u201ccontext\u201d:", "I settled on seven previous responses, but you can change it up or down to see what impact this may or may not have on the chatbot\u2019s performance. If this is more than an experiment for you, I suspect this is where you\u2019ll be spending a lot of time tweaking the dataset to clean up the response/context. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve not come across a good tutorial on how best to structure or tweak custom datasets for fine tuning a DialoGPT model.", "After splitting the response-context dataset into training and validation sets, you are pretty much set for the fine tuning.", "There\u2019s a tonne of code involved in the fine tuning process, but thanks to the earlier work by folks like Nathan Cooper and Rostyslav Neskorozhenyi, the training loops can be used as is without new users having to make major changes. You can study the code in greater detail when you have more time. The key cell to note in notebook3.1 is the one below:", "This is where you\u2019d need to make changes depending on your dataset and the set-up at your disposal. For example, you can stick with the medium-sized DialoGPT model or dial down to the small one.", "If you encounter GPU-out-of-memory issues, you\u2019ll have to reduce the batch size (as I did in cell above by reducing to 1). If you don\u2019t have much storage space left in your Google Drive, you\u2019ll have to adjust the logging_steps and save_steps intervals accordingly (files saved at various checkpoints can chew up storage space in a hurry).", "The fine tuning process can take anything from 40 minutes to about 2 hours, depending on the parameters you set. Do note that there are usage limits even on Colab Pro. For instance, I wasn\u2019t able to fine tune a DialoGPT-large model due to GPU memory limits. Colab Pro notebooks can run up to 24 hours, but I have yet to test that out with more epochs.", "The one metric to take note of at the end of the fine tuning process is the perplexity score \u2014 a measure of how certain the model is in picking the next token. The lower the score, the better as it means the model is less uncertain.", "I got a perplexity score of 1.6134 from fine tuning the DialoGPT-medium model, a significant improvement from the scores in the ranges of 6.3 to 5.7 when using the DialoGPT-small model. It\u2019ll take several runs for you to figure out what\u2019s an acceptable score.", "You can start chatting with the bot at the end of the notebook (assuming everything ran correctly), but I much prefer to load the fine tuned model into an app. Thanks to Lu Xing Han @ Plotly, there\u2019s a notebook for that.", "The Plotly repo contains code for running the chatbot app on a local machine if you wish to do that, but I opted to run notebook3.2 on Colab for practical reasons (the fine tuned model is already there). The code is lifted straight from Lu Xing Han\u2019s demo, with minor changes towards the end for folks who might want to experiment further with the output from the bot:", "\u201cTemperature\u201d allows you to control the level of creativity (or craziness/brazenness) of the responses. You can reduce the length of the chatbot\u2019s \u201cutterances\u201d by lowering the max_length (max number of token: 1,024; default: 256 tokens). A full list of the arguments you can tweak for the chatbot conversation can be found here, under the section \u201cUsing the interaction script\u201d.", "Here\u2019s a screen-grab of slightly more successful conversation I managed to have with the chatbot. Highlighted cells are my entries:", "The fine tuned pytorch model is too big (1.44Gb) to be deployed on any free hosting account, so there\u2019s no way (for now) for you to try this particular Singlish chatbot on a web app.", "My take: The \u201cSinglish\u201d chatbot is not ready for prime-time. It can give surprisingly good responses at times, but can\u2019t sustain the effort beyond a few exchanges. As you can see in the screen-grab above, things go sideways towards the end. With a richer dataset and perhaps enough compute to train on a DialoGPT-large model, the responses might get better.", "But as an experiment, I\u2019d have to say the performance is not half bad at all.", "There are a number of alternatives out there if you\u2019d rather not use Colab and/or confine the data and the fine-tuning to a local machine. I\u2019ll just highlight one Python library that I\u2019ve been experimenting with \u2014 aitextgen \u2014 that provides an option for CPU-only training.", "Notebook3.3 outlines a simple example using the same SMS dataset in this project. I had previously tried aitextgen with other datasets involving YouTube transcripts of political speeches in Singapore. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve not been able to get very satisfactory results so far.", "I\u2019m probably not using it right. You might have better luck. Aitextgen can run on Colab too.", "Hopefully this post and the accompanying notebooks will help you get started quickly on experiments with your own AI chatbot. What\u2019s far harder to do is figuring out how to improve its performance, or ensure that it\u2019s safe for public use.", "There are also related technical issues to explore, such as slimming the model down for deployment or more advanced interactive app designs that can bring out additional functionalities in the chatbot.
