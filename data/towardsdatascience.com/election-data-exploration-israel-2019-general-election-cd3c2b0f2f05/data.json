(which is different depending on the issue at stake)", "Our story begins with a post on social media. The following \u201canomaly\u201d in a specific polling station was making the rounds. All the parties got votes that were \u201cVery Round Numbers\u201d\u2122", "These are indeed suspicious looking. OK, let\u2019s dive in.", "In this multipart series, in some cases I will be able to present simple, innocent mathematical explanations for ostensibly suspicious results. In other cases I won\u2019t. Note that there are more than 10,000 ballot boxes, so even a rare numerical anomaly is expected to crop up several times.", "I started looking for other anomalies. Maybe round numbers are too obvious, but what are the odds that a party will get exactly a third of the votes? Half?", "Before I answer, can you think of an explanation of why exactly 1/2 is so popular? [Take a minute]", "Well, small rational fractions have a lot more going for them. You can get EXACTLY 1/3 by having 100 out of 300, 101 of 303, etc. but to get 200/601, well, you must have a very specific vote tally, and a very specific vote count for that party. So those values aren\u2019t as common.Is this enough to explain the oddity? Here are the results of a simple model (we pick random numbers for the total number of votes in the polling station, and number of votes for a specific party, given that party\u2019s national total)", "So, now that we have a simple explanation for these rational numbers in the data, what would be a good way to look at our data? How about if we let the histogram do what it wanted to from the start, which was to bin the data?If we take 100 bins, we can see if bin 50 is a lot more likely than bin 51 or 49 and thus judge.", "Well, it looks like we don\u2019t have enough evidence to convict. In the world where the Null hypothesis is true (no fudging) the evidence presented is actually quite reasonable and not at all surprising. That is not to say that there weren\u2019t instances of a single tally that was fudged and set to exactly 1/2 of the votes for a specific party, it is just not the conspiracy that it appeared to have been (with dozens of polling stations agreeing on the same ratio.)", "This post will be first in a series. In the next weeks I will explore other anomalies. I\u2019ll revisit the anomaly that started it all, and I\u2019ll explore some weird rational relationships between parties. (i.e. one party getting 1/2 or twice that of another party)", "If you\u2019ve noticed some other weird lines you\u2019d like me to look at, comment and I\u2019ll have a look.", "The results of the tallies per polling station are in here https://media21.bechirot.gov.il/files/expb.csv", "Here is some boilerplate python for loading that file (11K rows), and renaming the columns to English, So you can see for yourself, and find some more suspicious results.Also includes the code that generates the histograms above.", "Fitting a normal distribution to the number of valid votes per polling station (centred at 400 with sigma=100, ignoring the peak at 800)", "and a poisson distribution for the number of votes per party given the national party fractions, picking lambda from a distribution that matches the national vote fraction per ballot for that party.", "This is a bit simplistic I know, e.g. a PCA accounting for vote trends for different parties in different municipalities would be better. But this is good enough for now, it produces a viable reason for all those small rational numbers.", "Your home for data science.
