This article is my first effort to dive a little deep into an advanced topic like Machine Learning. There are two reasons for me writing this article. Firstly, I found this subject super interesting and if you are curious about Machine Learning but don\u2019t know where to start, then this article is for you. Secondly, this article is a way for me to synthesize my learning and share my knowledge with Machine Learning passionates.", "I expect you have some basic knowledge of \u201cProbability Theory\u201d in order to follow along. Since Machine Learning is a very broad topic and I want you to enjoy reading, thus this article will mainly focus on:", "\u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u201d", "We know that humans learn from past experiences, and machines follow instructions given by humans.", "What if humans can train the machines from the past data and do what humans can do?", "Well, that\u2019s machine learning, let's dig deep into it.", "The world is filled with data, a lot of data \u2014 pictures, music, text, videos, spreadsheet. Machine Learning is the science and branch of Artificial Intelligence, in which computers are trained from data to perform a particular task, rather than by explicitly programming them.", "In the traditional software development approach, input and the algorithm is known, and you write a function to produce an output.", "However, in the Machine Learning approach, you know the input and desired output, but you don\u2019t know the algorithm that gives the output.", "Companies use Machine Learning algorithms to optimize the results for their products.", "In most applications of machine learning: the focus is not so much on building models (\u201cunderstanding the underlying process\u201d) but more on predicting.", "Same way as humans learn from experiences, the same is with machine learning, you give them lots of examples (data), and they start to figure out what\u2019s going on. We, humans, do inductive reasoning as opposed to deductive reasoning. Let\u2019s review these two concepts as they are very important in Machine Learning.", "Induction (Specific \u2192 General) is generalizing conclusion from specific examples based on our limited experiences, here the conclusion might not be 100% accurate all the time.", "Deduction (General \u2192 Specific) is the process of drawing a specific conclusion from general statements. Here the conclusion is a fact.", "It is important to remember that any system that learns has \u201cInductive Bias\u201d or prior knowledge, and Machine Learning aims to automate the process of \u201cInductive inference\u201d. A notable example of this diversity of Machine Learning is the separation of Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning, I won\u2019t talk about Reinforcement Learning here.", "In Supervised Learning, we are given a labeled data set and already know what our correct output should look like, taking into consideration that there is some relationship between the input and output. A self-driving car is an example of Supervised learning. Supervised problems are categorized into \u201cRegression\u201d and \u201cClassification\u201d problems.", "In a \u201cRegression\u201d problem we are trying to predict something that has a continuous result. Example, given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture.", "In the \u201cClassification\u201d problem we are trying to predict results which have a discrete output. Example, given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.", "In order to design Machine Learning algorithm, here are the main 5 steps to follow:", "Let\u2019s see two examples of supervised learning with both classification and regression to get a deeper understanding.", "Let\u2019s say we work at the admission office at the university and our job is to accept or reject a student. In order to make a decision, we need some inputs from the students, right? Let\u2019s take: their grades and final year exam mark.", "We are trying to predict based on the past data collected, whether Student C will be admitted or not? In order to visualize we can plot it on the graph.", "In the image above we have first separated with a line the data from good and bad. This line is going to be our model. The blue dots represent the data points students who got accepted and red dots students who got rejected based on their test mark and grades. Looking at the diagram we can observe that students above the line get accepted while the student under the line gets rejected. You might be thinking that there are a couple of red dots above the line and a couple of blue dots below the line, yes you are right, the model makes a couple of mistakes, that is why it is probability and not 100% certain. So it is safe to predict, if a point is above the line then the student is accepted. Student C with Grade(6) and Test Mark (7) is above the line, thus we can assume with some confidence that Student C is most likely to get accepted. This is a classification problem because the output is discrete (Accepted, Rejected).", "Let's take an example of House Price Prediction. Your friend owns a house and says it is 750 sq/feet and he is hoping to sell his house and want to know for how much he can sell it. You know Machine Learning, and hence you can help him to predict the price using your Machine Learning knowledge and skills. Let\u2019s see how to do it.", "Our goal is, given a training set, to learn a function h: X \u2192 Y so that h(x) is a \u201cgood\u201d predictor for the corresponding value of y. For historical reasons, this function h is called a hypothesis. The hypothesis takes the input and gives out an estimated value, so it maps from x \u2192 y.", "We can use a \u201clinear \u201c line (pink line in the image below) to fit into the data set, and based on that it looks like maybe he can sell it for $150,000. However, there might be a better learning algorithm than linear. Instead of fitting the straight line into the data, we can maybe try \u201cquadratic\u201d to this function (blue line in the image below). Then, by making a prediction on it, it looks like maybe he can sell it for $200,000. Now it comes a question of choosing which one we should use? There is no fair in picking, whichever gives our friend the best price. This is a regression problem because the answer can be continuous.", "In Unsupervised Learning, we have little or no idea what our results should look like. Hence, the purpose is to find hidden structure in data. The core idea to understand Unsupervised learning is \u201cClustering\u201d.", "Clustering: Take a collection of 50 different people, and find a way to automatically group these people into groups. Maybe you want to group them into male and female, hence you can decide how would you do that. You can perhaps divide them by facial hair, skin tone, clothes, etc. In the end, you can say thee are 27 male and 23 females.", "This article is just a small taste about the Machine Learning field, there is much more in it and there are tons of online resources available to enhance your knowledge. Below I\u2019ve provided 5 resources that I personally found very helpful.", "This article was my first attempt to dive deep into a complex topic like Machine Learning. I will write more articles to cover the math behind Machine Learning. I hope I did a decent job in explaining and you found this article insightful.", "Stay Curious & Keep Learning :)", "Your home for data science.
