The problem is that most of the job positions in ML are not \u201centry level\u201d so many people are working hard to train themselves up in the field. Here\u2019s some helpful information for you about what the different stages of ML include.", "In every new field, there is someone who starts as newbie and adds to their knowledge. If you are the one who has to learn the basics and you feel stuck, check the list below to see what you need to do next to move on.", "Yes, you may need more input. The good news is that these sources are abundant on the web.", "Books are great for getting familiar with the field. Videos offer more instructional guidance and can often be a good source of inspiration. Make sure that you watch tutorials on ML techniques, and if you make a mistake you have the ability to fix it. Videos (especially courses on Udemy or Coursera) may cost money but they are often free in both formats.", "Here are some resources to find a good book on ML.", "If you can\u2019t afford the books but you know you want to take classes in ML, it is good to find a good mentor, preferably a former professional in the field. When you are faced with a problem you do not know how to solve and need a question answered, a good mentor will be helpful.", "In many cases, it is also advantageous to take online courses if you don\u2019t have the funds to do that. By taking the course you will often be able to access further training so you get the most out of the course.", "The next step into the field is learning how to master the tool (aka the computer) that you are using.", "This is the stage that many people at this point have completed all their training and can now do some real machine learning. It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t let this become a hurdle and that you continue to learn and practice as you become more comfortable with ML.", "It\u2019s probably obvious why this stage is important in your career so make sure you still are up to date in your latest developments.", "This is one of the most important stages in a career. In this stage, you\u2019ll transition from a student to an expert in your field. You\u2019ll have to convince your boss that you are qualified to move ahead.", "Are you one of the lucky ones who has all of these things?", "Great, there\u2019s your path to be a master of machine learning.", "Finally, if you want to have an overview of what it means to be a Data Scientist, then have a look at my book Data Science Job: How to become a Data Scientist which will guide you through the process.", "Your home for data science.
