It is arduous to store, understand and analyze increasingly larger volumes of data with traditional software\u2019s. However, as individuals or an organization, all of this data is only as good as what we can make out of it. This is where Big data comes into play. Big data is used for predictive analytics, analyzing user behavior or other data analytics processes to bring value to data. Yet, the raw details about this can remain uncertain due to lack of knowledge. Data Visualization helps tackle this issue.", "Data Visualization is the process of transforming data into charts, images, graphs and even videos that explain the numbers and allow us to gain insights from it.", "It makes information more coherent and helps us create value out of it, discover new patterns, and spot trends. Let\u2019s take an example: How do you explain the numerous rows and columns of data in an excel spreadsheet to your boss or a customer? Create a chart like a bar chart, line graph, scatter plot, etc of the same data. This gives meaning and purpose to the original raw data and now that you have a visual representation, you can start analyzing and integrating it into your business. This has empowered many businesses and users by providing clear and actionable insights to programs as it can keep you ahead of the game.", "Microsoft Power BI is a data visualization tool that allows you to quickly connect your data, prepare it, and model it as you like. It gives you the power to transform all your data into live interactive visuals, create customized real time business view dashboards, thus extracting business intelligence for enhanced decision making. You can visualize data and share insights. This tool allows you to embed your custom visualizations into your app or website, connect to hundreds of data sources like excel, google analytics, IoT devices for real time data etc. It amalgamates everything conveniently with your existing professional environment allowing you to acquire analytics and reporting capabilities. You can publish these reports, therefore allowing all the users to avail the latest information.", "You can read more about Power BI here.", "Now let\u2019s use Power BI and create a basic visualization of our data.", "Listed below are a few ways to install Power BI:", "After you install Power BI Desktop, you can now visit the Power BI service website and sign in to your account. If you have not signed up yet, you can scroll down and use your student or work email address to sign up for free.", "Alternatively, if you do not have a student or work email address you can sign up for a Microsoft trial account by clicking here.", "After installing Power BI Desktop, let\u2019s launch the application and explore the main components of the application.", "Fields: Here you can view the data you import and it\u2019s fields.", "Visualizations: This pane consists of the different visuals that you can utilize to display distinctive visualizations of your data.", "Publish: enables you to publish your data model to your Power BI workspace.", "Get Data: allows you to import your data in the form of excel files, text/csv, xml, etc. We can also obtain data from Microsoft Azure, or other online services like google analytics, GitHub, etc.", "As mentioned before, the \u201cGet data\u201d option allows you to import data of various sizes from different platforms. You can download all the necessary material for this tutorial from here.", "Open the excel file called \u201cSalesData.xlsx\u201d, select the In-Stock Data sheet from the left side of the window and then click on Transform Data. This should bring you to the Power Query Editor. The Power Query Editor allows you to navigate through and transform the data.", "Great! Now that we have loaded our data, let\u2019s get to cleaning it.", "When we view the In-Stock data file, the first thing that we notice is that the first row in the file as well as Column 9 and 10 have null values. Values like these slow down our model\u2019s overall performance so lets clean that up. You can delete the rows and columns by selecting the \u201cRemove Rows\u201d and \u201cRemove Columns\u201d options respectively.", "Once we do this, we may now notice that the first row of our data actually consists of our column name. So let\u2019s change that by selecting the \u201cUse first row as headers option\u201d.", "Click \u201cClose & Apply\u201d in the top left corner of the home section in the Power Query Editor to make sure our changes are applied.", "You can even change the data type of a column easily by clicking on the data view icon on the left of the window.", "Cleaning our data can be a long and tedious process. Mentioned above are a few basic ways of dealing with data that have a few obvious anomalies but there is a lot more to it. At the end of this tutorial you will find the references that I\u2019ve used to understand and learn Power BI and its functionalities.", "For the sake of this tutorial, I have uploaded a \u201cready to use\u201d file called \u201cPowerBI Tutorial.pbix\u201d. Please refer to the link attached above for the same. Once that has loaded, we can get to the fun part \u2014 Visualizing our data.", "In this tutorial, we will learn to create a few charts and understand how you can analyze data.", "Bar Charts: Now that our data has loaded we can view it in the Fields pane to the right of our screen. We can select our desired visualization from the visualization pane and go back to the fields pane to select the data that we want to analyze. Let\u2019s start by analyzing the products in our inventory and its sales. Select the Average Inventory On Hand ($), Sales ($), and the Category fields.", "Congratulations on creating your first chart in Power BI!", "This bar chart compares the sum of the Average Inventory and the sum of the Sales for every Category. However, a logical way of studying this would be to compare the Average value of our Inventory and the Average Sales for every category. We can do this by changing it\u2019s values from Sum to Average in the Visualization pane.", "Using the same logic and fields, you can drag and drop different types of bar charts from the visualization pane and display the data in the form of a Stacked bar chart, Stacked column chart, Clustered bar chart, etc as shown below.", "Line Charts: Let\u2019s visualize our data using a line chart. Select the line chart from the visualization pane and select the Sales field from Geo Data in the Fields pane. Drag and drop the Week ID into the Axis section of the visualization pane as shown in the video below. This shows us the sales made with respect to the week ID. Further we can gain insights on the availability of products by comparing our inventory with our sales. To do this, drag and drop the Average Inventory field onto the secondary axis section in the visualization field. You can also click on your chart, and then change it to a Area chart or a Stacked area chart from the visualization pane.", "Pie/Donut Charts: Pie charts are quite well known however when it comes to displaying a lot of data, it\u2019s recommended that one does not use a Pie chart simply because it can be difficult to identify tiny differences between categories. For instance: clearly determining which category takes up more area.", "To create a pie/donut chart, choose the pie/donut visualization and the appropriate categories to display data as shown below.", "Maps: You can also use a map to view your sales in different places. Choose the globe icon from the visualization pane. Now select the required categories i.e. State ID and Sales. Legends are very useful when it comes to analyzing a few number of categories. Using Legends we can also view the sales of every category in the state by dragging and dropping the Category field into the Legend section as shown below.", "KPIs: Key performance indicators (KPIs) are a measure of the company\u2019s performance and evaluates it\u2019s success. We can display this in Power BI using the card or gauge option from the visualization pane. While using the KPI option, we will need to drag the week ID onto the trend axis in the visualization pane in order to view the weekly trends behind the KPI value.", "Deleting a chart: To delete a chart, simply click on it and press delete.", "Adding a new page: To add a new page, click on the \u2018+\u2019 icon at the bottom of the window.", "Now that we have learnt how to visualize our data, we can consolidate everything and make a dashboard.", "To make the dashboard, copy paste all the visualizations that we have created so far onto the same page as shown below.", "This basically gives us our dashboard. In order to create a mobile view of this dashboard, click on the view button and select Mobile layout. Once you\u2019ve done that, you can drag and drop your visualizations onto the phone screen as you desire.", "Now that our dashboard is ready, we can configure our visualizations by exploring the various options available in the Format section of the visualizations pane.", "Including Python and R in Power BI is one of the greatest things that Microsoft has done. Power BI is now a one stop place for data visualization using different libraries and machine learning packages. It allows you to reshape data without having to modify the underlying tool.", "R is a language and environment that is used for statistical computing and graphics. We can analyze our data using R in Power BI to acquire the desired results.", "Requirements: You will need to have R and R studio and other necessary packages and libraries installed in your system.", "Set up: Click on File in the top left corner of your Power BI window, select \u201coptions and settings\u201d. Go to the R scripting option under Options and make sure that the correct path to the folder holding R is listed, and that the R studio IDE is detected as shown in the image below", "Using R scripts for visualizing data: R provides an amazing platform for data analysis and visualization. It allows you to visualize data even before you begin with it\u2019s analysis. Shown below is an example of data visualization by displaying the frequency of our Sales using R scripts.", "Python is often used for data visualization using libraries like matplotlib, Seaborn, Gleam, Plotly, etc. Power BI is a platform where we can integrate and enhance Python visualizations.", "Requirements: Install Python and other necessary libraries and packages that you will require in your system", "Set up: Click on File, in the top left corner of Power BI Desktop, go to Python scripting under Options in the Options and settings section. Make sure the Python home directory is set to the location where Python is installed in your system as shown below in the image.", "Using Python scripts for visualizing data: Python has been used for data visualization since years. Libraries like matplotlib are good for getting a sense of the data. Although, when it comes to creating aesthetically pleasing charts quickly and conveniently Python is not very useful. However, when we integrate Python and Power BI, we acquire publication-quality charts. The video below shows us an instance of displaying the sales with respect to the Week ID using Python.", "Let\u2019s get back to our dashboard. Now that we have a dashboard that is ready to publish.", "Kudos to you for getting to the end of this tutorial! You have now learnt the basics of data visualization in Power BI. In this tutorial, I have only covered a few types of visualizations but there are many more available in Power BI that you can explore.
