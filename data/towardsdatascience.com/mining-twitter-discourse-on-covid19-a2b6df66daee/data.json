This is an expected phenomenon, as social media platforms can help track natural disasters in real-time. In this regard, Twitter appears as a preferred place for finding out what happens in this kind of situations, to such an extent that it has updated its COVID-19 policies claiming that it will remove misleading tweets that could \u201cincite people to action and cause widespread panic, social unrest or large-scale disorder.\u201d", "In this post, we will study Twitter discourse around the novel virus using some data science techniques. For that reason, we used this dataset containing ~27M tweets using hashtags associated with Coronavirus. Namely:", "With that in mind, we try to answer the following questions:", "and we do it with some basic Social Networks Analysis (Part 1) and NLP (Part 2: upcoming). Different techniques and tasks have been implemented in this project, e.g. text processing, measuring graph metrics, using word2vec embeddings for a text classification model, iterative learning with maximum likelihood, applying SVD for dimensionality reduction, and so on. We provide all the results and codes in this repo on Github.", "Although results weren\u2019t as I would have expected or desired, the exercise and study overall worth it the time spent on it. I\u2019ve learned a lot, I\u2019ve enhanced my hacking skills and I\u2019ve applied techniques I never used before.", "First things first, we get the data. Kaggle provides an API to download datasets and I prepared this notebook providing a detailed guide with the necessary steps to access the dataset with the API. An excerpt of the data is shown below:", "Some basic data exploration confirms that WHO\u2019s announcement on March 11 of the outbreak as a pandemic, triggered a huge activity on Twitter. The following figure shows the daily amount of tweets by country, with the United States counting with most of the tweets posted worldwide. However, this activity started to decrease since then.", "There are two properties that a tweet can have. It can be either a reply to another tweet and/or a quote (like a retweet with a personal comment on it). Otherwise, it is just a simple tweet. One can use these properties to see whether debate (replies) or sharing (quotes/retweets) explains an activity on Twitter around a specific topic. We did this, but instead of comparing topics, we compared countries. The following plot shows the quoted, replies, and the total number of tweets by country.", "The same insights are displayed in the bubble plot below.", "You will find an interactive version of this plot here:", "Our first approach involves graph theory. You\u2019ll find all codes for the analysis done in this section in this notebook. Some cool resources for learning graph theory are:", "We proceed to preprocess the data. This particularly consists of extracting the hashtags associated with each tweet and dropping the duplicates. In Part 2 we\u2019ll filter out non-English tweets and do some text cleaning (i.e., remove symbols, mentions, URLs, punctuation, and stopwords) so that we can train a Word2Vec model (using the preprocessed corpus will allow us to transfer tweets to the vector space), whereas in Part 3 we\u2019ll train a language model using the original text.", "You can have a grasp of how data looks after preprocessing it in the following example:", "Now that we have parsed the hashtags associated with each tweet, we can create replies networks from tweets that share a common hashtag. Such networks will consist of a list of edges representing the structure of the graph, i.e., the source and destination users of replies. As an example, the DataFrame below shows that user 45993399 has replied to user 976542720 a tweet associated with the hashtag #socialdistancing.", "These links/relationships are displayed as a network in the following graph, with node size varying according to the node degree.", "Before creating more graphs, we should first look at the most popular hashtags in the corpus (see figure below).", "We select \u2018stayathome\u2019, \u2018lockdown\u2019, \u2018socialdistancing\u2019, \u2018flattenthecurve\u2019, \u2018masks4all\u2019, and \u2018trump\u2019 as our hashtags of interest for this analysis. However, we don\u2019t use all tweets at once for creating the graphs. Instead, we compute them iteratively adding to the graph the new edges that appear on a daily basis. This way, we can see how hashtag-graphs evolve through time.", "To track the structure evolution of each graph, and compare them with each other, we compute some metrics based on common properties in graph theory:", "Many other interesting metrics can be calculated, like Average Path Length, Centrality measures, Clustering Coefficient. But these are computationally costly, so we will just stay with the metrics mentioned before.", "Additionally, we design a specific metric for this analysis, which is formally defined as follows. We call it \u2018new edges added\u2019 to the graph:", "where G_t is the graph at time t and V(G), E(G) the vertices (nodes) and edges of the graph G.", "The following figure shows the results of our analysis. We have computed each metric daily from March 4 to April 29, for all networks.", "An interactive dash in Plotly has been done to visualize hashtag metrics separately (see link below)", "First, it is noteworthy that #trump\u2019s network average degree increases considerably compared to the other networks, whilst its number of unique nodes decreases. The same thing happens with the diameter of the networks. Recalling that the diameter is the longest path in the network, we can infer that #trump tweets had a lower reach than, say, #flattenthecurve. One possible reason for this is that nodes in #trump\u2019s network are prone to connect with nodes connected with their neighbors, and we can support this hypothesis by seeing a higher assortativity coefficient. Moreover, #trump\u2019s network degree has fewer nodes with a low degree (number of connections), and more nodes with high degree, than the other networks. This result would have been enriched with an analysis of the degeneracy of the networks, which probably would have given us some evidence on the possibility of Trolls explaining partially that activity.", "In the opposite direction, #flattenthecuved had a great spread, reaching the highest diameter, considering its low number of nodes and average degree. Likewise, #mask4all, which is the smallest network, spread so rapidly that in a few days reached the other networks\u2019 diameters on average.", "Julian Lopez Baasch is an Economist turned Data Scientist and passionate about AI.
