I\u2019ve done work for CCTV in the past, and most of my translation clients have some sort of government ties. Overall, I think that the daily news (\u65b0\u95fb\u8054\u64ad) that gets presented on CCTV is generally objective when it comes to international news. However, when it comes to domestic Chinese news, there can be more of an agenda. Having been a regular consumer of \u65b0\u95fb\u8054\u64ad before, I\u2019m well aware of how the program will often shape a story to be very pro-China, and will often do fluff pieces on important figures.", "But as a Data Scientist, I wanted to perform an exploration of this, and see if there were any recognizable trends in how many fluff pieces (for Xi Jinping in particular) are produced over time.", "The dataset I\u2019m using was found on Kaggle, and features every written news article published for use on the \u65b0\u95fb\u8054\u64ad program between January 1, 2016 to October 15, 2018. It has 4 columns: Date, Tag, Headline, and Content.", "The Tag column differentiates the rows in the dataset between \u201c\u201c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5168\u6587\u201d some relatively long news, \u201c\u56fd\u5185\u201c domestic short news, \u201c\u56fd\u9645\u201c international short news.\u201dProject Goals:", "To get started, here\u2019s a list of all the imports that were used in this project:", "Most of these are fairly standard for NLP, but one package that some might be unfamiliar with is jieba. Jieba is a popular tokenizer specifically for Chinese characters, and typically does a great job parsing which should be compound characters and which should not. It also allows you to add custom tokenization rules pretty easily, if something isn\u2019t parsing quite right.", "And this is typically what the data looked like:", "It had 20,738 rows with only 100 or so stories that repeated. Since these were all stories that did actually air, I decided to leave them in.", "Before getting to the NLP aspect of the project, I wanted to see if there was perhaps an increase in Xi Jinping-friendly stories surrounding times when there may typically be negative public sentiment about him (specifically in March, when he changed to constitution to remove presidential term limits). This required me to \u201cmanually\u201d determine if each news story was about Xi, an arduous task with over 20,000 rows of data.  So I counted the ratio of mentions of Xi Jinping (or Chairman Xi, Secretary Xi, etc.) to the character count of an article, getting the percentage he was mentioned, and cross-referenced articles with high \u201cXi counts\u201d with whether or not he is mentioned in the title.", "This was typically a good enough measure for whether an article was truly about Xi or not, which allowed me to tag it (for later use by NLP classifiers). I did do a manual count of about 2,000 rows, and found 33 false positives. Logically, I didn\u2019t see how an article could be about Xi Jinping without actually mentioning him, so wasn\u2019t worried about false negatives in articles with a Xi count of 0.0, and 33/2000 false positives is a good enough error that the rule seems alright.", "We can see that the number of articles about Xi Jinping varies throughout the year, but has generally been on the rise in 2018. However, the rise for the time period around March specifically could just be random variation. If we had another year of data, it would be interesting to see if this rise continued, or if it was simply a slightly larger increase than the normal variation we see throughout the seasons of the rest of the years. 2.5 years isn\u2019t really a long enough time to observe definite trends in something as abstract as whether the media is trying to promote more positive pieces about the President.", "The dictionary keeping track of all the values was rather long, so I cut it down to only record words/phrases that appeared 20 times or more. Some of the top words we see throughout the dataset are \u2018\u53d1\u5c55\u2019 (development), \u2018\u4e2d\u56fd\u2019 (China), \u2018\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u2019 (Xi Jinping), \u2018\u5408\u4f5c\u2019 (cooperation), etc. This isn\u2019t very surprising for a dataset of Chinese mainstream news articles.", "MethodologyI was able to train NLTK's basic Naive Bayes classifier using all 12,000+ characters as a feature set, but ran into memory issues when training other classifiers, so ended up using just the top 5,000 character combinations as features. All 20,738 of the articles were shuffled using random.shuffle, then the first 15,000 were used to train, resulting in roughly a 72/28 split for training and testing.", "The first pass with all 12,000 characters as a featureset is interesting to examine because of the changes that occurred when less characters were used. Most notably, some of the figures that strongly indicate an article is about Xi Jinping are different, and both \u68c0\u9605\u53f0 (review/inspection platform) and \u6325\u624b\u81f4\u610f (waving to express regards/respect) are absent in 5k-character featureset\u2019s list of most informative features. Both of these terms (highlighted in red) are almost exclusively used during a review of the troops (typically done by Xi Jinping).", "And the most informative people (in order) were:", "Ding Xuexiang \u4e01\u859b\u7965 (General Secretary of the CPC)", "Yang Jiechi \u6768\u6d01\u7bea (Director of the Office of Foreign Affairs)", "Fang Fenghui \u623f\u5cf0\u8f89 (Former Chief of Joint Staff)", "Ma Xiaotian \u9a6c\u6653\u5929 (Former Deputy Chief of Joint Staff)", "Zhao Keshi \u8d75\u514b\u77f3 (Former Nanjing Commander)", "In the second pass, with a 5,000-character featureset, we see that \u4e01\u859b\u7965 (Ding Xuexiang, Xi Jinping\u2019s aide) and \u6768\u6d01\u7bea (Yang Jiechi, a key leader of China\u2019s foreign policy) are found in both featuresets. Interestingly, it appears that Xi Jinping himself (highlighted in green) appears throughout the dataset so much that he is 45 times more likely to appear in articles that aren\u2019t actually about him. The \u4e2d\u592e\u529e\u516c\u5385 (the General Office of the CPC, highlighted in red) is also present in this featureset\u2019s 25 most important features, but was absent in the previous version\u2019s most important features.", "And the most informative people (in order) this time were:", "Ding Xuexiang \u4e01\u859b\u7965 (General Secretary of the CPC)", "Yang Jiechi \u6768\u6d01\u7bea (Director of the Office of Foreign Affairs)", "Liu He \u5218\u9e64 (Vice Premier of the People\u2019s Republic of China)", "Wang Huning \u738b\u6caa\u5b81 (Chinese political leader)", "Purely by looking at how likely these people/features were to indicate whether a story was about Xi Jinping, we can see the importance of certain politicians that might not often appear in the public eye.", "The baseline of this dataset was 89.787%, which is relatively high, but it turns out most of the articles in the dataset were not about Xi Jinping.", "Most of these classifiers actually did improve upon the baseline, except for the Bernoulli NB classifier, but I imagine with proper tweaking it might also be able to get better.", "Overall, this was a very fun project, and first foray into Natural Language Processing. I learned a lot more than mentioned in this post, and will write about unsupervised LDA models for parsing Chinese once I have performed some more exploration. As for this project, the next step could be to turn it into a filter of Xi Jinping-related news, or apply the techniques used here to filter out any topic one could want. It could also be used to draw a map of relationships in the CPC based on the proximity of certain political figures to Xi Jinping. It is also one step along the way of defining that vague concept of what it means for an article to be \u201cabout\u201d someone or something, and handling it in a way that computers can understand.", "All code and visualizations used in this article is available here: GitHub", "Please feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn if you have any questions about wrangling/analyzing data in Chinese!", "Your home for data science.
