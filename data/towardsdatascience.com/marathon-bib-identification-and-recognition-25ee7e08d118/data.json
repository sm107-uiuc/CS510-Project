A few days later I received an email with a link where I could check out and download my race day pictures. I needed to put my bib number on the webpage, and it would pull up all the photos with me in it. This got me thinking how was it made possible!", "For those who are not familiar with running events, a bib is a sheet of paper with an e-tag attached to it. This tag is used to record the runners accurate timing over the course of the marathon. The bib also has a unique bib number, printed in big fonts, along with the runner\u2019s name and some other text. (See the photo for reference)", "I started thinking of possible ways the tagging of photos could have been achieved. The one obvious way can be manual tagging \u2014 there\u2019s a team of humans who look at the photos, read the bib numbers and tag the photos with those bib numbers. This is a tedious task, assuming each marathon will have upward of five thousand photos. The other way is using Computer Vision.", "I have this philosophy that any task that requires a human to look at an image and follow it with an action, almost in a mechanical fashion, can be and should be automated using Computer Vision. We have state-of-the-art algorithms to solve the problem and high computation power to enable such solutions. Why not utilize it? So, that\u2019s how this project started.", "I started to explore different Computer Vision techniques that could be used to tag the photos with the bib numbers. I\u2019ll briefly describe each method that I could think of:", "First, I tried the first method to get an idea of how a generically trained model will perform on this problem. As expected, it wasn\u2019t performing very well. There was no guarantee of identifying the bib number correctly, and moreover, there were lots of false positive text detected in the image. I\u2019ll write more about it in a later post. Later, I proceeded to try out the (third) method that involves using instance segmentation. This forms the core of this project.", "When I first started out to work on this problem, it didn\u2019t seem like a big task. Only when I dived into the project and the nuances started to surface, I realized how challenging this problem is. Just to give you an idea, the only possible way I could get to read the numbers correctly on the photo at the top was using AWS Rekognition API. While it might be easy to read that bib for humans, it wasn\u2019t that simple to train a computer to read that number. The best I could get with my custom image processing pipeline was \u201c1044\u201d instead of \u201c21044\u201d. There are reasons for it like creating a general heuristic for different bib designs and color schemes, etc. that I\u2019ll discuss in later blogs.", "The solutions that I have come up with are probably not the best, yet. I realized there is no end to the improvements you can make to a solution. The end-to-end execution of this solution is what this series of write-ups is about. The major reason to pick this up was to get my hands dirty with each aspect of building a computer vision project \u2014 gathering dataset, annotating the images, implementing a deep learning model for segmentation, image processing, creating a CNN model for OCR, custom training it for a given dataset, stitching these different parts together, etc.", "I\u2019ll write about each of the above-mentioned parts and share the code. You are free to take the code and make improvements or use it for your own application. The learning from this project has been enormous and I want the community to benefit from it.", "Please feel free to leave any suggestions/comments/critique. I\u2019ll try to be as prompt as possible.", "Here\u2019s the next part in the series:", "Your home for data science.
