I took a risk and invested time into learning how to do statistics with Python, in an attempt to create an overlap between two of my preps. In the end, it definitely paid off for me: I found a new passion and am now pursuing a career in data science.", "This blog is the first in a series of standalone posts dedicated to solving basic AP-style statistics problems from scratch using Python. I will keep the use of specialized libraries to a minimum. It is important to keep in mind that only parts of the statistical pipeline can (or should) be automated, and that computing specific values is just one step in problem-solving \u2014 interpreting and applying your results is the ultimate goal. Many students tend to get so far into the weeds with number-crunching that they lose sight of the bigger picture. By automating the calculations with code, we can focus on what those calculations actually tell us.", "Please keep in mind that this post is not an introduction to Python, nor is it an introduction to statistics. Instead, it is an introduction to merging the two to enhance your understanding of both. It could be used by students, teachers, or self-studiers.", "Here is an example of an AP Statistics problem involving categorical variables:", "This is the global distribution of rollercoasters found in the Roller Coaster Database", "We\u2019ll tackle these individually. Our approach will be to create a set of functions we can use to solve problems of this type, rather than this problem alone. The goal is not to solve this individual problem \u2014 it is to understand how problems that look like this are solved in general.", "First, we need some sort of an object that will tie our data to our levels. We could accomplish this with two listobjects (and there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that), but I\u2019m going to take advantage of one of my favorite Python objects: a dict. Dictionaries are nice for a variety of reasons, and many libraries such as pandasallow you to pass in dictionaries as you construct more sophisticated object like a DataFrame.", "Here is the dictionary we will work with:", "In particular, I like how the value (the frequency) is tied directly to the key (the continent). Keep in mind that as we progress, our implementation will be using the methods and attributes of a dict, so if you are unfamiliar with this type of object, you may want to review the dict type before proceeding.", "At this point, it\u2019s worth checking and double checking that the values in my dictionary are correct \u2014if they are, this is the only time we\u2019ll need to do this. (Compare that to entering a long string of numbers into your calculator, only to discover you missed a digit on one of them.)", "Similar to how the table is divided into a left column (the name of the continent) and a right column (the number of roller coasters), our dictionary naturally separates continents into keys, frequencies into values, and each \u201crow\u201d in the table is its own key-value pair.", "To solve this problem by hand, we can look at our table and add up all of the numbers in the column on the right:", "Unfortunately, this approach doesn\u2019t generalize to other problems. If I\u2019m given another table of counts, I\u2019d have to pull out my TI-84 Plus (in true AP Statistics fashion) and enter all of the numbers all over again from the beginning, hoping that I don\u2019t make any typos or accidentally miss a number. With a dataset this small, that might not be an issue, but as the number of categories increases, so do the odds of me fat-fingering the number pad.", "Instead, we can write a function in Python that will accept our dictionary object (which represents the table above), and return the sum of the counts in the right column (represented by the values in the dictionary):", "Now we can handle any table whose categories are in the left column (our keys) and whose counts are in the right column (our values).", "Let\u2019s see what we get when we pass the coasters dictionary into the total_values function:", "Output: There are 5175 rollercoasters in the world.", "In order to solve this problem, we\u2019ll need to do the following things:", "We\u2019ve already written a function that will take care of #1, which returns the value we\u2019ll use in #2. For #3, I want to keep my function flexible, so I\u2019m going to give myself an option to toggle percents on and off. I also want to be able to specify the precision, since the problem explicitly tells me to round to a specific number of decimal places.", "First, we rely on the function we wrote to find the total of the values. Next, we create a new dictionary rel_freq to hold the relative frequencies. For each key-value pair, we\u2019ll add the same key to rel_freq, but with the original value divided by the total. If percent has been specified as True, we convert these proportions to percents with the given precision (or the default, 1). Compare this approach to having to repeatedly divide by hand on your calculator.", "Next, we have a function that will print our relative frequency table. Spending a lot of time writing this function is the equivalent to procrastinating from the intellectual heavy lifting demanded by your statistics homework by carefully drawing a table with a ruler and colored pens. Obviously, it was the best investment I could have made with my time today.", "For part (b) of question 2 (seeing whether or not the sum of the percents adds up to 100), we can reuse our total_values function once again.", "In order to accomplish this task, we\u2019ll create a function that sums up the values corresponding to categories in a list.", "Although this function doesn\u2019t do exactly what we want by default (it only sums up the values, and does not return a percent), we can answer our question by being deliberate about how we interact with it:", "Now, the real advantage of using Python over doing all of this by hand: pretty charts. Learning how to make charts with Python is actually what led me to discover matplotlib and opened the door to data science in general, so this next function holds a special place in my heart.", "We\u2019ll plot both of these on a Figure with a (1 row, 2 columns) arrangement of Axes. The left Axes will be the bar chart, and the right Axes will be the pie chart. Going in-depth on each line of code is a topic worthy of many blog posts of their own, so I\u2019ll just show the code without much commentary. In particular, I\u2019ve written this function to accept any dictionary (which is assumed to contain frequencies), a title for the chart, the name of the categorical variable, the label for the y-axis, and whether or not the frequencies should be converted to relative frequencies.", "And there we have it! Now we\u2019re ready to completely turn in this problem:", "Although writing this code might have taken more time than simply crunching the numbers by hand, we now have code that will solve problems of this type for us. A bonus problem is included in the notebook, which can be found on my github.", "Your home for data science.
