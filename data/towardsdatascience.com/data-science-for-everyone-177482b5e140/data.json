From my own experience with Big Data, Modeling, Analytics, etc., Data Science can sometimes feel overwhelming; or at the very least, reserved only for those who are advanced mathematicians and programming prodigies. While this field may appear that way from the outside, in reality, it is not ubiquitously the case.", "This is not to say that those who are mathematically inclined won\u2019t have a predisposition for Data/modeling, but this inclination is not required to get started. Perhaps at one point, having an extensive background in statistics or modeling was, in fact, a prerequisite for harnessing data- but today, things have changed.", "Today, what seems to discourage people the most from getting into Data Science, is the volume of information and complexity of concepts. As this field was understandably built by and for, those who have an established analytical mindset- many concepts or tutorials can be a bit high-level.", "You don\u2019t know, what you don\u2019t know- and there is a lot you don\u2019t know", "Often, the answer to a question you have will only result in you having three additional questions, and so on.", "Trying to learn how to effectively utilize data, quickly involves feeling like you know absolutely nothing about it. If your first lesson is that you effectively know nothing, and you feel like everyone else knows everything, you are much less likely to be effective at comprehending new information.", "The fact of the matter is that the beauty within open-source sharing, Stack Overflow, GitHub, and the general velocity of information exchange within Data Science- is also what can push new people away from the field. Imposter syndrome runs rampant.", "It is much easier to learn how to swim in a swimming pool, as opposed to treading water in a raging river", "This is not to suggest that the fundamental nature of the Data Sciences should change. On the contrary. It is instead to point out that the harder something is to learn, the more rewarding the knowledge it eventually yields will be.", "People are curious by instinct, we just make different choices in regards to how we explore that curiosity. Biologists explore the fundamental mechanics of nature and life, physicists explore the workings and boundaries of reality, artists explore the human mind and its relation to others. Almost every industry or field explores a particular facet of our existence and pushes boundaries, in a uniquely specific way. I propose that Data Science allows you to quantify and understand all of these explorations.", "If knowledge is power, then data is raw untapped and unshaped knowledge", "Data is the single most critical commodity of the modern world. Every business and industry wants to harness it to its fullest extent. Why? Because Data is knowledge materialized. It effectively empowers decision making. Is it always clean and organized? Of course not. Is it easy to organize and understand? Rarely. But is in fact everywhere, and the modern race is to see who can use it the most efficiently- to see who can make the best decisions, from the brightest insights, at the fastest pace.", "No living thing can handle, process, or manipulate information at the speed of even the slowest computers today. We have developed a way of digesting countless inputs to receive unfathomable outputs at unprecedented speeds. Effectively, we have ways of concretely answering almost any question you could think of. What do you want to know? What do most businesses want to know?", "Data Science and computation are how you get your answers. But computers are fascinating in that they can solve complex equations in a fraction of a second, but may not understand even the simplest of your intentions. They are simultaneously the most profound and idiotic creations on the planet. This is because, effectively, they are a tool, and a tool can only be as effective as the user. If it is true that computers are this powerful, why would we limit our insights to those of a casual user?", "Data Science has applications in every field and solutions to every problem. Nothing is more powerful or more important from an informational standpoint. It is vital to each and every industry, and necessary to definitively reach any solution. It is the closest we can come to objective truth.", "Data Science and Analytics are how this knowledge is collected, processed, utilized and interpreted. It is the industry behind modern decision making. It is therefore irrefutably, the future.", "So an average person reaches this understanding, tries to enter the field, and immediately gets overwhelmed. Some give up immediately. There is too much to learn, it is too complex, it is too difficult. Those that will inevitably be successful, however, remain resilient.", "Even the act of pursuing data science, especially when it does not come easily, is a crucial distinction. One has to be a problem solver, one must be able to deal with ambiguity by themselves, to be deeply confused and then find clarification independently. This is what experienced data scientists frequently face, and this is what people trying to learn their first modeling techniques encounter. But it is immeasurably valuable. You gain an intrinsic drive, to find the optimal answers to some truly extraordinary questions. You become a problem solver of the future.", "Data experts do not just wake up with a bevy of knowledge. They learn through practice and experience. Experts become experts through frequency. What distinguishes them from beginners, is that they have tried more often, and therein failed more times than the majority of people who have even thought of making their first attempt. Embrace and learn from your failures. This applies to almost every industry- but in Data Science, you can learn from your failures very quickly, because you can immediately tell whether you failed. Furthermore, you can discover exactly why you failed within a matter of hours. The answers are there.", "\u201cSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d \u201cSuccess is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.\u201d", "An intelligent decision is made, and people only see that decision. In reality, the decision was carefully engineered based on countless sets of information. Data Scientists are therein the engineers behind the decision making.", "Persistence is what makes you successful as a Data Scientist. Remain hungry for the answers you want. Maintain the drive towards optimality. Stay curious and passionate about that which you have yet to discover.", "The most successful, are the ones who make the smartest decisions at the fastest pace. The ones who utilize every morsel of information, to make the optimal choice.", "Your home for data science.
