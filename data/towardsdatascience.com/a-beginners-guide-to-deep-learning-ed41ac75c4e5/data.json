It is an extremely complex subject that some data scientists spend years of their life studying. For many people who make career switches into data science or do not have an extensive background in artificial intelligence, it may seem like an intimidating subject to delve into. As someone in that category who had an interest in learning about it, I wrote this blog to give a brief and simple overview for people who may want an introduction to this topic.", "By the end of this blog, you will be able to:", "Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms under the umbrella of \u2018Artificial Intelligence.\u2019 In the simplest of terms, it is teaching a machine to learn by example, much like a human baby! When reading the words \u2018Artificial Intelligence\u2019 you may think of popular science fiction films that depict robots who evolve past the point of needing humans and then eventually destroy the world. Fortunately, we have not gotten to that point yet, but machines can still do some pretty impressive things! For example, deep learning can be used to process X-ray images in order to identify irregularities like tumors. It can also be used in facial recognition, speech recognition, text classification or even to create a self-driving car!", "So how is deep learning different from machine learning?", "It is important to remember that deep learning IS machine learning. They both perform a function with given data and get progressively better over time. The main difference is how the data is presented to the model. Machine learning algorithms need guidance and structured data whereas deep learning networks use layers of artificial neural networks (ANN) to determine on its own if its prediction was accurate or not. This makes deep learning extremely powerful because it can deal with unstructured data (i.e. images, audio files, text data) exceptionally well.", "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and as humans, what better form of flattery is there than to model machine learning networks after the human brain?! Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computing systems which are designed after the complex biological neural system inside the human brain.", "Obviously, an ANN is not as complex as a human neural system, but we can visualize the similarities. In a human neuron, there are dendrites, cell bodies and axons. The dendrites receive signals from other neurons and send the signals down the cell body, do some processing and then send the signal to the axon and axon terminals were the signal is transferred to other neurons, over and over again (as shown below). In an artificial neural network, weighted inputs are fed into a feature node where some processing happens which forms an output that is then fed into the next layer, over and over again. It is important to note that the inputs and outputs are binary in nature (0 or 1). One thing that isn\u2019t shown in the image is the gap between nodes, where weights are assigned to each input.", "Weights are important because they determine which features are more important than others. Each node has a certain threshold that causes the node to \u2018fire.\u2019 If the combination of weighted inputs exceeds the threshold, it will trigger the node to signal. Since the nodes are binary, the network just acts as a typical linear regression model. By adding an activation function, it provides a non-linear transformation to the input, making it capable of learning using the difference with respect to error.", "So in simpler terms, an activation function acts as a mathematical \u2018gateway\u2019 which receives the input and calculates a weighted sum with added bias to determine if the node should fire or not. This allows some connections to become stronger, causing new connections to appear, or weaker, causing connections to be eliminated. In the image below, a sigmoid activation function is being used.", "There are many different types of activation functions that can be applied. I\u2019ve listed a few of the most common ones below, but you can read more about them here and here:", "Let\u2019s go over an example to visualize what a neural network is. Let\u2019s say we wanted to open up a new restaurant in a town with 20 different restaurants. We want to predict the amount of sales for a restaurant given certain inputs features such as: the location, the pricing of different food items, and the variety of food choices.", "Now let\u2019s look at each feature individually:", "So having a wider variety in food offerings may increase the perceived quality of the restaurant, but on the other hand, the if the pricing is high, customers may perceive the quality of the restaurant higher. This shows that several inputs might affect one \u2018hidden\u2019 feature. In traditional neural networks, the inputs and outputs are independent of one another, but in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the nodes can use the outputs from the previous node as an input to the current node. You can learn more about RNNs here.", "A hidden layer is a layer of nodes (# of people walking by, affordability, and perceived quality in this example) whose output is dependent on the inputs (location, pricing, and variety in this example) of other nodes, and therefore is not as visible as a network output.", "To be considered \u2018deep learning,\u2019 an artificial neural network needs to have at least two hidden layers. Each layer can have any amount of nodes and there can be as many layers as you are willing to add. If you are interested in learning more about the different types of neural networks, you can learn more about it here.", "Thank you for taking the time to read this blog post!
