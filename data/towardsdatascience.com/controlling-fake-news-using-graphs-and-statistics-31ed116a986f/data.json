And no, I am not talking about CoronaVirus.", "These things above are called Click farms. And they are an industry already.", "A single Click farm may contain thousands of iPhones and Android phones on shelves to influence and manipulate recommendation systems, propagate fake news, influencing public opinion, and sometimes even win elections \u2014 the need of the hour for some politicians in the USA.", "Fake news is everywhere. So are a lot of fake users.", "At any time, millions of transactions are happening in our increasingly connected world. These transactions are time-bound, and we need to catch them pretty early before any harm is done dynamically.", "So, can we catch these fraudulent transactions as they occur? Will Data Science come to rescue?", "In this post, I am going to be talking about MIDAS, a Microcluster-Based Detector of Anomalies in Edge Streams, which aims to solve this exact problem.", "To work with the problem, we will use the DARPA Intrusion Detection dataset that is used in the MIDAS paper. DARPA has 4.5M IP \u2192IP communications between 9.4K source IP and 2.3K destination IP over 87.7K minutes. Each communication is in the form of a directed edge (src_IP, dst_IP, timestamp, attack) where the ground truth attack label indicates whether the communication is an attack or not (anomalies are 60.1% of total). The data looks like below.", "But before usage in MIDAS, we have to change the src_node, dst_node, and timestamp to integers. Fortunately, the author of the library has done this preprocessing for us, and we can start with a preprocessed file from here. You can also download the original data here. The processed file looks like:", "So first, let\u2019s talk about CMS, which is the primary data structure used in this algorithm. From Wikipedia:", "In computing, the CMS is a probabilistic data structure that serves as a frequency table of events in a stream of data. It uses hash functions to map events to frequencies, but unlike a hash table uses only sub-linear space, at the expense of overcounting some events due to collisions.", "Put simply, CMS is an approximate dictionary. A data structure that can keep approximate counts for the keys.", "It is implemented as a grid with w columns and d rows with each of the d rows having a different hash function. Whenever we encounter a key, we add 1 to all the rows in the columns based on the hash function for the row. When we need to retrieve the value for the key, we go through all the rows and give the minimum value in all the rows for the given key.", "The advantage of such a data structure is that we can get the value for a key in constant time as the size of the grid remains constant.", "Let\u2019s start simple and talk about a single edge between two vertices u and v. We have the past trends of such edges, and we can see a considerable uptick at time period 10. We need to create an anomaly score that can capture such an uptick. In the real world, this uptick could be a DDOS attack. Or, it could be a scraping attempt from an IP address to another IP address.", "So how can we capture such an uptick?", "One approach would be to assume that the time series follows a particular generative model \u2014 for example, a Gaussian distribution. We could then find the mean and standard deviation of this Gaussian distribution and use these to declare the edges at a particular time tick as anomalous.", "But that is a pretty strict condition. And the distribution could be anything. So, the MIDAS algorithm uses a weaker assumption that the mean level (i.e., the average rate at which edges appear) in the current time tick (e.g., t = 10) is the same as the mean level before the current time tick (t < 10).", "So we set up a hypothesis test which avoids assuming any particular distribution for each time tick. We can divide the past edges into two classes:", "Now, let s\u1d64\u1d65 be the total number of edges from u to v up to the current time(t\u226410). And a\u1d64\u1d65 be the number of edges from u to v at the current time(t=10).", "We can keep these counts for all edges using two CMS data structures. One to hold the past hits and one to hold the current hits between two nodes.", "Now, we can do the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, which is used to determine whether sample data(t = 10) is consistent with a hypothesized distribution(t < 10). Our chi-squared statistic is:", "The higher this statistic/anomaly score, the higher would be a chance of an anomalous edge.", "The MIDAS Algorithm then simply looks like:", "The above idea is extended in the MIDAS-R algorithm, which adds:", "This results in a more performant MIDAS-R algorithm.", "We start by just getting the whole code:", "The output of the run command is as follows:", "When we look at the scores.txt file we see:", "We can then use the original DARPA file with the ground truth labels to check the AUC scores.", "And here is the PR curve:", "MIDAS-R achieves a much higher AUC (=0.95) compared to the baseline(=0.64) provided by SEDANSPOT(which uses personalized PageRank to detect anomalies in sublinear space and constant time per edge), while also running significantly faster (0.39s vs. 84s).", "This is a 48% AUC improvement at 215\u00d7 faster speed.", "MIDAS provides a simple framework to find anomalies in any data which can be represented as a time-evolving/dynamic graph.", "It can be used for a variety of use-cases in social networking as well as transactional sites to detect Microclusters and hence fraud.", "So down with COVID-19 and down with the Fake news.", "With the advent of so much social data, network analysis could help a lot in improving our models and generating value.
