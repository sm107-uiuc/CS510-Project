But I noticed there was a dearth of information on how they talked on the debate stage.", "As we raise our glasses to the final year of the 2010s and to its eighth and final Democratic presidential debate, which is scheduled for December 19th, I thought it would be nice to close that gap with a little exploration and data analysis.", "After December 12th (which is the final date by which candidates have to meet all donor and polling requirements to qualify for the next debate), I will have all the information I need to:", "As of today (December 7th, 2019), we\u2019ve completed a total of eight Democratic primary debates for the 2020 election:", "I scraped the debate transcripts from a single source, The Washington Post (from June 2019 through November 2019). Here\u2019s an example and it looks like this inside:", "Each block of text (for example, the part highlighted in gray above) corresponds to a <p> tag in the HTML source code, which you can get to by highlighting a section of the text and right-clicking \u201cInspect\u201d. Note that each speaker boundary is indicated by a speaker tag, which is the speaker\u2019s last name in all caps (\u201cBIDEN\u201d, \u201cCOOPER\u201d, etc.). I will refer to the part that follows the speaker tag in each block as a segment. Since only the first of consecutive same-speaker blocks contains a speaker tag, it was necessary to reshape each block of the original text as a tag-segment pair, like this:", "It wasn\u2019t trivial getting there. In fact, I think I spent more time working on this early preprocessing step than on any other part of this project, but it\u2019s always worthwhile to spend as much time as necessary to get your data into the precise format required for analysis and set up a streamlined preprocessing pipeline to easily ingest and transform any new data in the future. The following were some of the main components of this early but important step:", "We\u2019re now ready for some serious fun \u2014 extracting features to numerically represent the candidates\u2019 speech. For the analysis below, I removed all rows containing segments uttered by moderators (like Cooper). I did not exclude transcriptions like (APPLAUSE) and (CROSSTALK) if they were associated with one of the candidates in case they serve as an important feature later. After this, I had 4,069 rows.", "In order to compare the candidates\u2019 utterances, it was necessary to transform the segments into numerical representations. I used spaCy to write rules to extract most of the features below. I will highlight a few of them in code blocks below, but you can check out the full script here.", "Biden and Warren spoke the most both in terms of segment length (the total number of tokens across all debates) and number of sentences. It\u2019s notable that Sanders spoke the least among our top contenders, trailing slightly behind Harris, Booker, Buttigieg, and Klobuchar. These findings seem to correlate with candidate speaking time.", "By the way, most of the bar graphs presented in this post can be graphed with something like:", "Another length feature to consider is mean sentence length, which is calculated by diving the total number of tokens (words) by the number of sentences per segment and averaging across all segments. This graph shows that Gabbard, O\u2019Rourke, and Steyer managed to fit the most number of words in their sentences:", "The same three candidates also showed the most variation in sentence length, as determined by the standard deviation of sentence length (in tokens). In other words, they had a good mix of long and short sentences (which is something your high school English teacher might have wanted you to have in your essays).", "Candidates toward the right end of the graph, including Swalwell and Delaney, did not vary sentence length very much in their speech. In fact, in conjunction with the graph above, we can infer that the two candidates consistently uttered short sentences.", "Converting text to spaCy Doc provided an easy way to extract these length features:", "That is, whose speech exhibited the greatest level of syntactic complexity? I used two features to measure this: number of complex clauses and number of words before the main verb.", "I define complex clauses as any sentence-level constructions that are more complex than simple transitive or intransitive sentences in terms of argument structure (\u201csubject\u201d, \u201cobject\u201d, etc.), contain adverbial clausal modification, and/or contain an embedded clause. For example:", "Having one or more of these properties in a sentence can increase its overall syntactic complexity.", "Number of words before the main verb measures specifically pre-verbal structural complexity. The longer the text before the main verb, the more likely it contains a clausal modifier (and/or subject modifier). It\u2019s a pretty crude measure of syntactic complexity, but it gives us something useful quick.", "In the normalized graphs below, we see that Gabbard and Steyer\u2019s speech showed the greatest level of complexity in terms of both these measures. On the other end of the spectrum, Bennet and Inslee showed the least amount of syntactic complexity, likely suggesting they stuck to forms of sentences that were quite simple (i.e., subject-verb-(object)) and lacking in clausal modifiers like conditional \u201cif\u201d statements or coordinated phrases.", "Swalwell showed a somewhat deviant pattern: He scored the lowest on number of complex clauses, which measures both pre-verbal and post-verbal complexity (but mostly the latter), but he is just barely above the center for the other measure, number of words before the main verb. This asymmetry in the locus of complexity suggests that while the part after his main verbs tended to be simple and short, he\u2019s pretty average when it comes to how he opened up his sentences (i.e., before main verbs).", "It\u2019s notable that four out of six candidates that already qualified for the December 19th debate \u2014 Sanders, Warren, Biden, and Harris \u2014 showed relatively low levels of syntactic complexity, suggesting they spoke quite simply on the debate stage.", "Here are the spaCy-based functions used to extract these two syntactic features:", "A category closely related to syntactic complexity is readability. I used textstat, a Python library providing diverse statistics to measure how readable a piece of text is. The different measures are described on the website, but suspecting some of them are correlated, I created a quick correlation matrix adopting the implementation here:", "The features that intersect at lighter-colored cells are highly correlated, such as gunning_fog and linear_write_formula, and to a lesser extent, flesh_flesch_kincaid_grade and flesh_reading_ease, as well as text_standard and gunning_fog.", "From what the textstat website describes, text_standard is a kind of aggregate measure that returns the estimated grade level required to comprehend the text based on all the other tests, so I\u2019ve chosen to graph that one here:", "On average, most speakers speak at a level comprehensible to 6th graders. Steyer and Gabbard spoke at a level slightly higher, being comprehensible to 8th graders and above, and this lines up nicely with them exhibiting the highest level of syntactic complexity, as discussed above.", "Those two candidates also scored the highest on number of difficult words (per segment), another readability measure that was shown not to be correlated with any other measure. Note that Warren, one of our frontrunners, spoke with the least number of difficult words per segment. (She was also among those who scored the lowest on text_standard, as you can see above.)", "(*I use this term to describe a pattern of speech behavior that is characterized by rich verbal references to oneself. It shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as synonymous with other terms that possibly carry a more negative connotation, like \u201cnarcissistic\u201d or \u201cselfish\u201d.)", "For this feature, I explored the use of pronouns as a measure of the degree to which a candidate identifies themselves as an individual vs. as part of a group when addressing each other and the American public. In particular, I considered:", "It\u2019s going to get a bit crowded with all the double bars, so I\u2019ll split up the visual into two graphs: one for the cluster of candidates who qualified for the 12/19 debate and one for the cluster that didn\u2019t (or are on the cusp as of 12/7):", "A quick look at these graphs shows that Klobuchar was the most egocentric in her speech in absolute terms, using more \u201cI\u201d pronouns per segment than any other candidate. Among those candidates who did not qualify for the December debate, Castro was the most egocentric, followed closely by Gillibrand. But we also see that Klobuchar used more \u201cwe\u201d pronouns than the other two \u2014 meaning, in relative terms, Castro and Gillibrand might have been more egocentric, depending on how you look at it.", "By contrast, Yang was the least egocentric by this measure in both absolute and relative terms, using on average 1.64 \u201cwe\u201d pronouns vs. a measly 0.58 \u201cI\u201d pronouns per segment. The difference between the two sets of first person pronouns is a lot more stark for Yang than for any other candidate. This can be more easily visualized with the following graph, which shows the difference between \u201cI\u201d pronouns and \u201cwe\u201d pronouns (\u201cI\u201d pronouns minus \u201cwe\u201d pronouns).", "The more positive this difference, the more \u201cI\u201d pronouns the candidate used. Returning to an earlier point, we confirm with this graph that even though Klobuchar used the most \u201cI\u201d pronouns per segment, she used them in a more moderate proportion to \u201cwe\u201d pronouns compared to Gillibrand and Castro, who showed the greatest difference between the two sets of pronouns.", "To the extent that a candidate\u2019s ability to articulate their future plans and strategies can be taken as a measure of their \u201cfuture-orientedness\u201d, I think language can provide an interesting means to discover whether a candidate has the qualities of a visionary, forward-looking leader \u2014 something voters might want in their future president.", "Using spaCy tags, I took a count of the following words/phrases in the segments as a crude measure of future-orientedness:", "Here\u2019s the total number of future-oriented expressions used by each candidate:", "Warren and Harris had the highest number of future-oriented words in their speech. This is interesting, but we have to remember they were also among the candidates who spoke the most in general. So to control for this, I took the sum of the proportions (%) of future-oriented expressions across all segments.", "Even with this adjustment, we see that Harris and Warren remain the heaviest users of future-oriented expressions in their speech.", "Harris mentioned Trump the most across all eight debates, followed by Yang and Booker:", "But again, we have to remember Harris was among those who spoke the most in general, so again, I took the sum of the proportions (%) of Trump mentions to segment lengths across all segments.", "After this adjustment, we see that Harris still remains the one who mentioned Trump the most (i.e., even in relative terms). However, as for Yang, despite having mentioned Trump more than 30 times in these debates, the proportion of his Trump mentions to the rest of his speech is relatively low, not more than average when compared to all the other candidates.", "At this point, I\u2019m eager to find out whether there is a clear dividing line between the speech characteristics of candidates who are moving on to the next debate and those who are not. We may have seen some indication that there is in this post, but I probably need to verify that more thoroughly once we have all the information.", "So far, Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Warren, Sanders, Steyer, and Harris have qualified (though the last has dropped out). Yang and Gabbard have not yet met all the requirements, but we will find out if they do on or before December 12th.", "Please stay tuned for a follow-up post where I use the features described in this post to build a machine learning model to answer the ultimate question: Can speech characteristics (alone) predict the likelihood of a candidate qualifying for the next debate \u2014 and therefore, quite possibly, their electability as president?", "Your home for data science.
