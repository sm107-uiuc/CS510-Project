Was this really the first time we have seen a job like this? The answer is no, we have seen a very similar career present well before the emergence of Data Science. We have seen this career currently, too \u2014 that being the role of Statistician.", "What makes them different? What are the similarities? These are the questions I will answer in the sections below. Continue reading to find out which role is which.", "This role has become incredibly popular as of recently for good reason. When you acquire a Data Scientist into your business, you are hiring for several roles into one. The skills required to become a Data Scientist are intimidating and check many several boxes. The role can be thought of as cross-functional \u2014 needing to know both technical skills and soft-skills of the business. It is not enough to simply know only coding techniques, but how to solve important business problems with nontechnical stakeholders and leaders in your company as well. There are some straightforward skills that a Data Scientist will need to know, but there are some non-conformed skills that you will have to acquire from practice in those situations over time. Those skills are the less-technical ones, and usually include but are not limited to: forming a question, forming a problem statement, creating a process for answering that problem, presenting findings, and explanation of results to stakeholders.", "Some key skills required for Data Science are:", "A Statistician role has been around for many more years than that of the Data Scientist role. There are countless industries that require this position. If you want to work in healthcare, security, academia, marketing, economics, and many other fields, you can be sure to be a Statistician there. The main duties of a Statistician include, but are not limited to: experimental design, conducting studies, creating estimations, and developing surveys. You will need to have a strong background in mathematics and experimental design as well. There are also soft-skills required for this position. Some of those include reporting your findings to stakeholders and their respective changes needed as a result of those statistical findings.", "Here are some of the key skills for Statistics:", "As you may have seen, some of the skills required for both roles were similar, if not exactly the same. So, what are the main similarities between Data Scitnstis and Statisticians? Here are some of the similarities between these two roles:", "There are of course more similarities between these roles, but those are some that I have encountered from roles as well as their respective job descriptions. As time goes on, it would be interesting to know if Statistics becomes more like Data Science or the other way around \u2014 or if they diverge away from one another.", "Now, let us discuss the differences between these roles.", "For one, Statisticians have been around much longer than Data Scientists, which implies that the difference may be in new technologies.", "So, here are the main differences between them, mainly consisting of those new technologies.", "The differences described above are also seen in job descriptions as well as from personal experience. You may find some of these skills overlap depending on the company, but I believe those are some of the strongest differences between the two roles.", "So, to summarize, what is the difference between a Statistician and Data Scientist or study of Data Science and Statistics? It can be summed up in one phrase \u2014 automation from new technologies. Is one role more important than another? No. They are both important roles. If you want to focus on significance, testing, experimental design, normality distribution, and diagnostic plotting, then become a Statistician. If you want to practice more software-engineering like coding and automation of machine learning models, then become a Data Scientist. You will find that a lot of the job descriptions for both of these roles overlap, but it is rare to find machine learning libraries required for a Statistician role.", "I hope this overview of the similarities and differences between a Statistician and a Data Scientist was interesting and helpful to you if you are thinking of starting a new career or switching careers. Of course, there are more similarities and differences, so feel free to comment down below what experiences you have had in these roles.
