So let me portray a fantasy research society.", "Bob is interested in solving research problems. He is curious about a question, and recently has found a good answer which is worth to be shared. Nevertheless, there are still some shortcomings in his proposed method and he has no idea for them. But this is not a concern in our research society: He will write his idea, put it on arXiv, and raise those shortcomings as open problems on arXivOP. Alice, who is working in the same field, will be notified and found them interesting. She will write her solution to one of those issues on arXivOP. Bob will find it interesting, extend his article with Alice\u2019s solution, and add her as an author\u2026", "arXivOP is the new arXiv assistant that connects researchers through open problems.", "Open problems may be submitted by authors who seek collaboration, or by researchers who review others\u2019 works. Thinking of StackOverflow user experience (comments, upvotes, badges, \u2026), everyone can submit a solution for an open problem, and the community will judge its correctness. Later, following some protocols, the main article can be merged with the solution.", "Alice reviews Bob\u2019s article, finds and submits an open problem on arXivOP, and gets a reputation. Bob will be notified, and if he is too eager for the solution, he can make the problem \u201ccommitted\u201d to express his commitment to include the problem solvers\u2019 names in the list of authors, if he decided to extend the article with one of the proposed solutions. This way the community is encouraged to contribute more. Later, Carol finds the solution and gets a reputation. Bob can extend his article, and add Carol as an author if the problem is committed, or just acknowledge her if it is not.", "Now that we have a system to build connections among researchers, let\u2019s see the solution for the other important difficulty most of the researchers struggled with: quantifying contributions and ordering author names. The main challenge here is to compare the importance of different types of contributions. This challenge is solved in arXivOP by defining roles.", "arXivOP papers and solutions have contribution roles. For each role, the names of contributing authors are sorted alphabetically.", "This is like holacracy methodology: neither hierarchical nor flat. For example Hypothesis, Proof, Experiment, and Support can be different roles, and one may contribute to some of them.", "Thinking abstract, we have two different domains: problems and solutions. Papers and solutions to open problems lie in the solution domain, while open problems or maybe reviews lie in the problem domain. Each problem is derived from a paper or a solution and each solution is derived from an open problem. Hence we can think of the following bipartite graph:", "To get a sense of what I have talked about, I tried to roughly sketch problems and solutions pages in the following two figures.", "In the first one, you can see a problem raised by user D on the left, with its proposed solutions on the right. The problem is made committed by B who is the corresponding author of the source paper (or solution) which is accessible by pressing S on the left.", "The following also shows a solution written by users A, B, and C with determined roles (it is similar to a paper). Three open problems are raised on this solution which is depicted on the right. Also by clicking P on the left, you can find the parent problem.", "I know many more challenges should be considered on the way to reality. For example, we can think of handshake protocols to consider the long-term nature of research, and each problem can have a solving by list. Or university resources can be accessible via faculties admitting support role in the papers. However, this was my imagination and although it may be far from reality, I think it is not that far.", "Your home for data science.
