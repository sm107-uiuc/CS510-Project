I used NetEase Cloud for streaming music when I was in China, while after I start my Master\u2019s program in the United States, I switched to Spotify. Both NetEase and Spotify provide yearly wrap-up service to let users look back on their favorite songs of the year. Beyond that, I aspired to know other characteristics of the songs or artists that I loved. Therefore, I have collected track information and features from both streaming history and my self-created playlists to build my music streaming story.", "I will break down the article into two parts: The first part takes you through how I connect to Spotify APIs and retrieve the music data that I need. The second part displays the exploratory analysis of the streaming history and playlist tracks. Let\u2019s put the beats on!", "The full code is available at my GitHub.", "The first step of the work is to decide the coverage that I want to visualize so that we retrieve the correct data from Spotify. Spotify enables users to request their streaming history at https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/account/privacy/, and it usually takes 2\u20133 days to get the data even though the instruction show Spotify needs around 30 days to prepare the data. The streaming history will be download in the JSON file, and we can first convert the JSON data to a data frame.", "Now, we can have a better view of the information in streaming history: we got artist_name, end_time, ms_played, and track_name (which are all self-explanatory).", "The above step only provides limited information for streaming history, other tracks information, however, are excluded, for example, popularity, mode, key, and other features calculated by Echo Nest(owned by Spotify).", "Here comes Spotify Web APIs that allow users to search songs, artists, and playlists, set up the metadata features.", "First, register your app in the developer dashboard. After registration, you can see your ClientID and Client Secret(as shown in the screenshot in figure 1). Next, turn to \u2018EDIT SETTING\u2019 on the upper-right side of the webpage and Redirect URIs = http://localhost:7777/callback. Save the setting, and we\u2019re done with the prerequisite setting before we can retrieve data.", "We then use python package Spotipy to connect to the web APIs. The function from spotipy.util send our Client ID and Client Secret to Spotify and Spotify will return the token by prompt the authorization window. Follow it, log with your Spotify credentials, and paste whatever link(it will be an invalid page) that you are redirected to in the prompt console.", "Then your token will be stored in the variable token. Print it to review what you got!", "Get track_id, the unique identifier for a track in the Spotify. Spotify API also provides multiple dimensions of song features that describe the characteristics of a song. Let\u2019s understand some of the features a little bit!Acousticsness: A measure(0 to 1) of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence that the track is acoustic.Danceability: Danceability(0 to 1) describes whether the song is suitable for dancing, and it combines elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, etc. Value=1 is ideal for dancing.Energy: Energy(0 to 1) measures how fast, loud, and noisy the song is. Instrumentalness: A measure(0 to 1) indicates whether a track contains no vocals. For a purely instrumental song like a classical piano masterpiece without any vocal, the index will be close to 1.Loudness: Index of a track in decibels (dB).This value typically ranges between -60 and 0 dB.Mode: This feature indicates the scale (major or minor) of a track. Major is represented by 1, and the minor is 0. Typically, music pieces of Major scales are more bright while minor scales are more obscure/gloom.Valence: This is an interesting measure(0 to 1) describing the positiveness of a track. The value is higher when a track is more happy and cheerful.", "Bang! Now, we have all the features for our Spotify streaming history!", "In addition to the streaming history among where lots of songs may be played by chance, the songs in playlists are pinned by me, and I have categorized them for different moods or for various purposes. Spotify APIs also allow users to retrieve the playlists records and we will retrieve the features of all the tracks in my playlists as I did in the previous section. (Please see my code in Github!)", "Bang! Now we have both complete data for streaming history as well as my playlists.", "Up until this point, we should have a full table of data ready to cook. In this section, I will show how exploratory analysis help me understand further about what music I preferred.", "I often tell people that I can\u2019t live without music, I keep listening everyday\u2026 But do I? The heatmap calendar plot below tells me the truth: No, I don\u2019t! (The darker the blue square, the longer the time I play the music on that day. The large blank space in 2019 is because I was an Apple music user before I switched to Spotify.) According to the heatmap, I took around one day off from music each week.", "Mac Ayres, Twice and John Mayer are my Top 3 artists in my playlists. Twice is one of the top groups in K-pop music, and John Mayer is a famous American singer-songwriter, guitarist and record producer. But hold on, who is Mac Ayres? I don\u2019t even know who Mac Ayres is! After review, I learned that Mac is an American R&B singer-songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist. I have added nine tracks in total of Mac Ayres in both chillnight and Vlog list, and I love them because the songs are chilled and in vaporwave style. Well, he deserves to be valued.", "According to the streaming history, I listened to classical music a lot, mostly from Bach, Franz, and Debussy. I played more than 100 different pieces of Bach last year. It indicates that I randomly played his work most of the time instead of repeating in cycles. In contrast, for Peter Marsh, I played almost the same amount of time but only covered around 20 songs of him. The song that I repeated most is exactly from Peter March. I have played his Christmas Tree for over 400 minutes, much more than I played other songs.", "According to the top songs and top artists that I have listened to in the past year, almost half are classical music. I didn\u2019t realize that I was so into classical pieces until I look at the data.", "Let\u2019s explore the personality of my playlists first! I have 8 playlists where I collect music pieces that are suitable for different moods: Living room song is more gentle and steady, better to listen to when I am studying or working cause the music pieces make me calm and relaxed. Playlist K-pop, in contrast, includes most of the Korean-pop tracks that are brisk and rich, with catchy hooks and off-the-wall production.", "I inspected the following features in the radar chart: acousticsness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, loudness, valance. Except for loudness, all other features are on 0\u20131 scale, thus I first converted loudness to the scale of 0\u20131. I drew each playlist a radar chart to display and compare the listed features. And the charts showed the playlist Living room song and classical are most acoustic and instrumental since most of the songs in these two playlists are purely instrumental work, while K-pop and road trips are significantly loud and full of energy. The rest of the four playlists are quite balanced.", "Next, let\u2019s explore how popular are my playlist songs. Through the boxplot chart of popularity index, I can tell that most of my playlist songs are of 50\u201360 popularity. The list K-pop is the most popular one, and classical is the most unpopular one. It\u2019s quite reasonable since people nowadays pay less attention to classical music pieces unless the piece is exceptionally famous. The list chillnight and STAND ON TIPTOE \ud83d\udcab have sparse distribution in terms of popularity score. The highest popularity is slightly higher than 80, indicating that I seem not to be a fan of \u201chit\u201d songs.", "Key and mode are two essential features of tracks. Music with different keys has different styles, but minor differences can only be identified by professional musicians. However, it\u2019s easier to recognize major versus minor mode: major scales are usually more bright or cheerful, while minor keys sound more melancholy and sad. Check out this Youtube video to have a more straightforward connection with sample audio. According to the below figure, I can tell that I prefer major mode than the minor mode. I like songs that make me happy and light my life!", "The valence index calculated by Spotify indicates how happy or sad a song is, which helps me track my mood along time. I used error bar plot to indicate both mean valence and variance of the valence of each day. The graph below shows that I seem not to be in a good feeling in the first half of March and in May. Hmmm, it happened to be the final exam stage of two quarters in my Master\u2019s Program when I was really busy and stressed. Then that makes a lot of sense!", "Through visualizing my playlist tracks and streaming history, I understand the music I like more thoroughly and even surprised by facts that I will never know without looking at the data. If you are also interested in the music you are listening to, try to build your exploration. Welcome to connect with me in Spotify!", "[1] Santos, J. D. Is my Spotify music boring?
