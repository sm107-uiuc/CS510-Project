The idea (of getting our hands dirty by crafting with data) spontaneously arose in a conversation between myself and Natalie Vladis, a Quantitative Fellow at Harvard Medical School.", "Here\u2019s what happened: Natalie loves crafting and lives in data. I love data visualization, occasionally hodgepodge things, and believe that adults don\u2019t play enough. In the month of January, we wanted to facilitate a creative, hands-on play date with data \u2014 to make data approachable AND to build a space where experts can explore new facets of their data.", "The value of play is scientifically grounded. But play in the context of data? That\u2019s relatively new. Most literature in the space focuses on building data literacy in children, and while design has often integrated facets of play to inspire new work, it\u2019s failed to effectively trickle down into its interdisciplinary neighbor, data visualization.", "Play comes from curiosity, inquiry, and exploration. By latching on to curiosity and allowing ourselves to explore, we learn new techniques without the stress of expectation or competition, and uncover unknown facets of the world. This is particularly important when we are intimidated by something, or when we have become accustomed to it, associating it with the mundane.", "But we think data is austere \u2014 perfect \u2014 and that makes it hard to play with.", "Combine the perceived complexity of data that the general populace maintains (an internalized belief, if you will) with visualizations\u2019 rhetorical force \u2014 a major reason why we find it difficult to fact check, debug, and critique them \u2014 and we find a conundrum: data and its representations are unapproachable.", "By that, I mean data, as an intangible, big concept, is scary. People avoid it. And those that work regularly with data (as analysts, researchers, and scientists) often only understand one idea, one perspective, of what data is and are therefore limited in the ways they can represent and engage with said data. Because again, data feels hard to play with.", "That\u2019s how Data Crafting came into being. Data should be fun, should be approachable, should be played with. The best way Natalie and I could think to make that happen is by crafting.", "But first why crafting? What is crafting? And how does it differ from data physicalization?", "\u201cCraft is the dovetailing of discipline and imagination, dedication and inspiration. When those spiral around each other, and serious attention is given over to that alchemy, then one\u2019s craft can be realized\u201d \u2014 Rosanne Cash", "Historically, a craft was a skilled labor, maintaining traditional arts for future viewers. In response to harmful factory conditions of the 19th century, definitions of craft evolved to become counter-industrial, elevating the well-being of both consumer and producer. Then (in the 20th century) studio craft added new meaning: a rebellion against conformity.", "Our modern understanding of craft builds on traditional arts \u2014 from quilting and beyond. Craft acts as a form of individual agency via the creation of anything, regardless of material or technique, from custom-made chairs to craft beers to handmade pompoms. Most importantly, modern crafting is something anyone can do.", "Let\u2019s revisit our initial question: what is Data Crafting? It\u2019s representing data, where there is:", "An argument of accessibility. While engaging with multiple mediums may facilitate connections with a broader audience, there is much work to be done in the space of accessible data representations.", "But how does Data Crafting differ from data physicalization? To Nathalie and I, it\u2019s in the play of it. As the Data Physicalization Wiki puts it, \u201cPhysical representations of data have existed for thousands of years.\u201d Incan Quipus, Marshall Island Stick Charts, and Yakama Time Balls are a handful of examples to illustrate this point. From a historic perspective, these are products of data crafting.", "Data Physicalization has been redefined in the research community to describe computer-supported physical data representations. In the cases where a computer isn\u2019t involved, the representation is still carefully curated and appears \u201cperfect\u201d. As we\u2019ve discussed, perceived perfection makes it hard to play.", "While there is certainly overlap between data physicalization and data crafting, the emphasis on play is absent in physicalization. And that\u2019s what we were so excited about!", "We describe data crafting as either adjacent to or a subset of data physicalization, where the emphasis is not on a perfect, camera-ready object but rather on the process of doing \u2014 of playing with your hands, and experiencing with all five senses.", "Because, as Albert Einstein once said, \u201cPlay is the highest form of research.\u201d When data is the foundation of all research, how can we not want to play with it? With that in mind, I encourage you all to play with data \u2014 and maybe craft a bit ;)", "This is one of two articles that I\u2019ll be writing about Data Crafting. This first article lays the ground for why we wanted to craft with data. The next explores how we did it, and shares a few takeaways so that you too can play with data. Stay tuned!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Hi! I\u2019m a PhD student at MIT. I\u2019m interested in AI, HCI, data visualization, and how tech impacts human experiences.
