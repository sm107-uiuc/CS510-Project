Youtube, Facebook, Amazon, and many others provide some sort of recommendations to their users. This not only helps them show relevant products to users but also allows them to stand out in front of competitors.", "One such technique to recommend items to users is an item-based recommendation system also known as item-item collaborative filtering or IBCF. In this guide, we will go through all the ins and outs of the algorithm, the actual mathematics behind it then will implement it in R, first without using any libraries, this will help understand how the algorithm fits in with dataset, and then implement same using recommenderlab, an R package, to show how things work in a real environment.", "If you are also interested in evaluating the performance of recommender systems check out this article explaining how to evaluate the recommender system\u2019s performance.", "Item-item collaborative filtering is one kind of recommendation method which looks for similar items based on the items users have already liked or positively interacted with. It was developed by Amazon in 1998 and plays a great role in Amazon\u2019s success.", "How IBCF works is that it suggests an item based on items the user has previously consumed. It looks for the items the user has consumed then it finds other items similar to consumed items and recommends accordingly.", "Let\u2019s understand this with an example. Suppose our user Jhone wants to purchase a movie DVD. Our job is to recommend him a movie based on his past preferences. We will first search for movies that Jhone has watched or liked, let\u2019s call those movies \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019. Next, we will search for other movies similar to three movies. Suppose we found out that movie \u2018D\u2019 is highly similar to \u2018C\u2019, therefore, there is a highly likely chance that Jhone will also like movie \u2018D\u2019 because it is similar to one Jhone has already liked. Hence, we will suggest the movie \u2018D\u2019 to Jhone.", "So at its core IBCF is all about finding items similar to the ones user has already liked. But how to find similar items? and what if there are multiple similar items in that case which item to suggest first? To understand this lets\u2019 first understand the intuition behind the process, this will assist us to comprehend the mathematics behind the IBCF recommendation filtering.", "If you want to dig deeper into item-based filtering I suggest starting with this course here. Mentors not only explain all the ins and outs the algorithms but also explains its applications with real-world examples which is valuable for anyone who wants to advance in the recommender systems field.", "Suppose we have a table of users and their ratings for movies (link):", "Let\u2019s pick two movies (Id 1: Toy Story and Id 2: Star Wars) for which we have to calculate the similarity i.e. how much these two movies are comparable to one another in terms of there likeness by users. To compute this we will:", "First multiple ratings of both the movies with each other and the sum the result. Let\u2019s call this value \u2018A\u2019.", "Second, we\u2018ll sum the squared movie ratings and then take the square root of them. So square all movie 1 ratings, sum them and then take the square root to get final value (do same of movie 2). Doing so will get us two values i.e. square root value of movie 1 and movie 2. Multiply both the values. We call this final value \u2018B\u2019", "Third, divide A and B, this will gets us a score that indicates how close movie 1 and movie 2 are to one another (link).", "Repeating the above process for all the movies will result in a table with similarities between each movie(in general we call them items).", "Here is how the above process is depicted in mathematical form.", "Don\u2019t get overwhelmed by how crazy the formula looks. It\u2018s really simple and is exactly what we did above with our excel exercise. Let\u2019s break it down piece by piece to understand what all these weird symbols mean.", "Adding some labels to the letters will ease in understanding each part of the equation.", "Starting from label 1 (blue on left), above illustrates that in order to calculate the similarity between an item \u2018i\u2019 and an item \u2018j\u2019 (consider \u2018i\u2019 and \u2018j\u2019 as movie id 1 and 2) multiple all ratings of item \u2018i\u2019 and \u2018j\u2019 given by users \u2018u\u2019 and sum them. Divided the result with the product of square root of the sum of squared ratings of individual items given by user \u2018u\u2019.", "This is exactly what we did in our excel exercise above. Iterating above for all the items will result in a list of values that will indicate how close other items are to our main item \u2018i\u2019. This method is also known as cosine similarity. It helps to calculate how close two vectors are to one another.", "Cosine similarity works but it doesn\u2019t take into account the optimistic behavior of users. Different users can rate the same item differently depending upon how optimistic they are. On the scale of 5, one could rate an item 5 while another could rate 3 even though they both very much liked the item. To account for this we have to make a small change to our similarity formula. Here is what it looks like:", "Subtracting user rating of a given item with that user\u2019s average rating normalizes ratings to the same scale and helps overcome optimism issues. We call it adjusted cosine similarity.", "There is also a similar method where instead of subtracting with the user\u2019s average rating we subtract with items average rating. This helps to understand how much given user ratings deviate from average item rating. This technique is known as Pearson similarity. Both Cosine and Pearson are widely used methods to compute similarities.", "Applying adjusted cosine similarity equation on ratings for items will produce a table or matrix that\u2019ll show how similar one item is to another. It should look something like this:", "A table of similar items is a half job done. We know which items are comparable but we have yet to crack the nut on which items to recommend to users from the list of similar items. For this will have to combine our similarity matrix with users' past history of rated items to generate a recommendation. This is easily achieved by applying IBCF\u2019s equation.", "u = user for which we are generating recommendationi = item in consideration, i.e. if this item should be recommended or notscore(u,i) = generates a score that will indicate how strong a recommendation of item \u2018i\u2019 is to our user \u2018u\u2019.j = items similar to main item i.", "Above equation elicits that in order to calculate recommendation score of an item \u2018i\u2019 for a user \u2018u\u2019 sum the multiplication of an item \u2018i\u2019 and \u2018j\u2019 similarity with the difference of rating given by user \u2018u\u2019 to an item \u2018j\u2019 and the average rating of an item \u2018j\u2019. Divide the result with the sum of item \u2018i\u2019 and \u2018j\u2019s similarity, add the output with the user \u2018u\u2019s average rating.", "Doing so will generate a matrix of scores for users and available items. Top scored items can be recommended to the user.", "Let\u2019s see above in action using R (code link). This will allow us to further our understanding of IBCF.", "Note: We will be using loops and data frames to implement IBCF knowing that R is fairly slow with loops and row/column multiplication is faster with matrix than with data frames. The reason being that the main purpose of this exercise is to help understand how IBCF is implemented using programming and we are not interested in writing robust code. Will show a faster alternative in section three of this article.", "With that said let\u2019s start by loading required libraries and movie rating data set.", "To calculate IBCF based on movie ratings, first, we will calculate normalize ratings by subtracting item ratings with user\u2019s average rating. This will standardize ratings to the same scale.", "Next, we\u2019ll calculate the similarity of each item by passing the actual rating and normalized rating to our \u2018calCosine\u2019 function.", "Now it\u2019s time to calculate the recommendation score for each user by iterating over each user and item. In each iteration, first, we\u2019ll calculate the average rating of the user, this will be used in calculating the score, second, we check if the item was rated by user or not, if rated then we store -1 as we are only interested in recommending items that user have not rated or liked.", "If the item is not rated then we grab the top 10 items similar to our given item using the similarity matrix we calculated above. Then we fetch the user\u2019s rating for those similar items. We will also calculate the average rating of similar items in order to subtract it with items\u2019 rating.", "Finally, we will pass a similar item list, user rating history list for similar items, and an average rating of similar items to our \u2018calScore\u2019 score function. The result will be added to the average rating of the user. Doing so will result in scores that will indicate which item to recommend to which users. Higher the score more likely the user will buy that item.", "Predicting recommendation scores helps to understand and suggest items but we can further improve how results are shown by replacing scores with the item\u2019s name. Here is how to do it.", "Implementing above will enhance our understanding of how the recommendation system works. But the above code is not efficient and is rather slow. There are many R packages using which we can implement recommendation filtering without any hassle. One such package is recommenderlab.", "Now let\u2019s implement IBCF using recommenderLab.", "recommenderLab works on a \u2018real rating matrix\u2019 data set so we have to convert our data frame to it first.", "Next, we split our data set into training and test sets. We will be using a training set to build a model for IBCF and evaluate its result on the test set.", "It is time to implement the item-item recommendation system using recommenderLab", "And that is it. This one line computed everything that we had implemented above using our own R code.", "Here is what our model predicted when we provide it train data", "Item-item collaborative filtering is a type of recommendation system that is based on the similarity between items calculated using the rating users have given to items. It helps solve issues that user-based collaborative filters suffer from such as when the system has many items with fewer items rated. IBCF is also computationally less intensive than UBCF. Implementing IBCF helps build a strong recommendation system that can be used to recommend items to the users.", "Your home for data science.
