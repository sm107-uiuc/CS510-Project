There are amazing advances happening in the field and it is changing the world. We hear a lot about hot acronyms like ML, AI and NLP. These advanced techniques are truly awesome but the reality of our world is that a significant part of a data scientist\u2019s job is spent cleaning and manipulating data.", "Before you can build the cool deliverable, you need to collect data and wrangle it into shape and clean out the muck. As the meme goes: much like an iceberg, most of the work that goes into a deliverable isn\u2019t work that your clients or users see.", "According to some surveys, as much as 60% of a Data Scientist\u2019s time is spent cleaning and organizing data. To be clear, most of the work done by many data scientists is manipulating data and this is going to be especially true for junior roles.", "Data science isn\u2019t just ML and advanced analytics, data science is the science of working with data. The modeling techniques and the insights are important, so is the ability to interpret a histogram or scatter plot, to know that you should be wary of drawing conclusions from small samples\u2026 These things are all important and are where the value of our work is realized, but in order to analyze the data, it has to be in a usable state.", "There are a few mindsets you can take when faced with this truth. One is that the real job is doing machine learning and advanced analytics and we have to do the boring data manipulation to get the result. Another perspective (and the one that I recommend) is that data manipulation is the basis of our trade and we should aim to master it. I think that this is not only good from the perspective of attitude, but also from an economic perspective as well. Mastering data manipulation and cleaning is fundamentally valuable and is what will drive your career forward in the early days.", "This next section is going to dig into a little bit of basic economics and provide a market-driven perspective on employment. I think this is both interesting and a valuable perspective to have as a job seeker.", "A job is you selling your skills/time for money. An employer isn\u2019t paying you a salary because they want you to have a good life, they are doing it because they need you to do work for them.", "In a free market with perfect information, no rational self-interested market participant is going to pay more for a good or service than the value they receive for it. There are quite a few caveats required to account for real-world issues. Markets are regulated so they aren\u2019t completely free. Employers definitely do not have perfect information when hiring so they might misjudge and overpay. In my experience, the self-interested and rational parts usually hold true in the employer-employee dynamic, and this usually gets truer the bigger the company gets, the smaller the company the more the owners\u2019 empathy comes into play.", "The important result of this transactional view is that your productivity is the upper bound of your remuneration. That is, in the long run, you aren\u2019t going to get paid more than the amount of value you can create for your employer.", "The more productive you are, the more your time is worth. Therefore, the more productive you are the more you can get paid. If you are in a competitive market with scarce jobs, the most productive person will get the job (or the person who is perceived to be the most productive in a situation with imperfect information).", "Unfortunately, you probably aren\u2019t going to get paid the full value of your time. Your company is going to want to make a profit on your labor, that is the amount they are willing to pay you is going to be less than or equal to the amount of value you provide to them. Negotiation and supply and demand are going to bring down your paycheck down below that. Productivity just sets the upper bound, but it is extremely important. Fortunately for data scientists in 2020, there is a huge skills shortage and so we are able to capture a lot of the value of our labor.", "This productivity idea is one of the reasons why you should specialize. Getting good at something takes time. You have limited time so you should focus your efforts on getting good at a particular area so that the time you are selling to your employer is more valuable.", "One of the other primary reasons for specialization is to reduce the amount of competition. Less supply means you can potentially capture more of your value in the negotiation phase. This productivity idea is also why a company will invest in tools, but that is a discussion for another time.", "The key takeaway point from this handwavy economics is: Think about your productivity if you want to get paid more.", "For the less financially motivated of you out there, productivity is also important for achieving project success. If you have a limited amount of time to get a project done, the faster you can get your work done the more likely you are to achieve your objectives.", "So far I have outlined two points:", "If the majority of your time is spent manipulating data, and you want to improve your productivity, it makes sense to improve your ability to manipulate data.", "The most effective way to increase productivity that I know of is to improve your skills. In my experience, the main tools and skills for dealing with data processing are:", "I\u2019ve also included some other fundamental skills that are not directly related to data processing but are also important for productivity as a data scientist.", "SQL is the tool used for manipulating data in databases. This is the fundamental skill for a data scientist. Most structured data is kept in databases. If you want to analyze the data in a database, you need to be good at SQL.", "Imagine you work at a marketing company. You have a client come to you who wants a dashboard made showing the effectiveness of their recent campaigns. If you are lucky all of the data you need is in a single database, likely stored amongst multiple tables.", "You may need to create some charts for your dashboard showing: sales by day, sales by region, source of sales. You need to be able to work out what structure your data needs to be in for your visualization suite, and then get that data out of the database as quickly as possible.", "You might need to use some common table expressions (CTEs), some joins, and use some functions to transform the data. That is just for a simple query, these queries can be complicated and require hundreds of lines of SQL. This is one of the fundamental parts of the job. The faster you can get your data into shape, the sooner you can get to building your dashboard. These same skills are required for nearly all data science tasks, so mastering these is essential and valuable.", "In my experience a lot of data analyst roles consider SQL to be the core skill. Languages like Python and R are viewed as specialist tools for data scientists. If you are a student and reading this you may be thinking \u201cbut I want to be a data scientist!\u201d. The reality is that the quickest and most profitable path to becoming a data scientist and working on advanced topics like machine learning might be to start as a data analyst at a company that hasn\u2019t fully embraced modern data science.", "If you are good at SQL you can get the job, then once you are comfortable in your role you can start to introduce your Python skills and impress your boss, maybe then you will get an opportunity to work on any advanced analytics projects that come up. Otherwise, after a couple of years of working at your job and a bit of studying on the side, you will have awesome SQL skills and have learned the fundamental ML skills and will be able to get a solid data science job doing the advanced work you want to do.", "You really need to be GREAT at SQL.", "The operating system provides a powerful set of tools for getting work done. Tasks that are monotonous and time-consuming with a mouse can be scripted in the shell with a few commands. Tasks can be automated with scheduled tasks or cron jobs. Programs can be installed and updated using package managers like choco (on windows), homebrew on macOS and apt on Ubuntu. There is a lot of functionality in the OS and while you don\u2019t need to master these tools as a data scientist, you should be familiar.", "Shell scripting languages are worth a bit more explanation. Bash, windows cmd and PowerShell are some examples of shell scripting environments. They are extremely powerful and you should be familiar with these tools. Amongst other things, you can use them to rename move and edit large numbers of files with just a few lines of text.", "An example of how a simple shell script can help you get your work done is if you have 1000s of similar files across multiple directories that you would like to combine into a single file. You could write a script to read the contents of all the files, combine the output into a single document and then write it back to disk. Obviously this is far better than doing this by hand.", "You can achieve a lot of these tasks in a language like Python or R, but the shell will always be there because it is the operating system.", "These languages are great for in-memory data manipulation, for dealing with APIs and web scraping, for flat files such as .csv and can be used for manipulating files on the OS.", "These languages are where the magic happens and a lot of attention is given on the internet to fashionable topics such as training machine learning so I\u2019m not going to discuss these here. There are a lot of data manipulation tasks that you should be familiar with to get your work done.", "Dataframe manipulation \u2014 this is the same as in SQL, you need to be able to quickly reshape data and build new columns to expose features of the data \u2014 dig into this", "Data isn\u2019t just stored in flat files and databases, there are other data formats such as XML and JSON which you should be able to handle. Being able to deserialize and serialize JSON is important for dealing with APIs.", "A lot of data is available on the internet from services such as twitter in the form of APIs. These APIs allow you to query datasets via the internet. Often the data is returned to you in a structured format such as JSON, which you then need to transform into a dataframe for analysis. Libraries exist for dealing with popular APIs but you should be familiar with working with APIs that there aren\u2019t packages for.", "These languages are useful for scripting beyond the simple text manipulation that you can do in the shell, one example I have dealt with is: we were provided a folder of 1000s of spreadsheets each with an individual days report on a piece of machinery. We needed these in one file for analysis, using R I wrote a script to import the individual spreadsheets and then looped through the folder and read all of the files into a list, then combined the individual dataframes.", "Good for small data sets and data entry. Good for keeping track of work. Non-data scientists use it so you need to know it. Most business people can use spreadsheets and they are extremely portable. Excel can only hold a million rows of data so it is limited. Spreadsheet operations are not as reusable as well written code and it is hard to increase your productivity by writing tooling.", "You need to be good at spreadsheets because other people know how to use spreadsheets. For most people, data analysis means spreadsheets so if you are interacting with non-data scientists you are likely going to have to work with spreadsheets as a medium of communication. People will give you spreadsheets and you will need to understand what they have done. You need to be able to present your work clearly as clients and managers may want to see how the calculations are being made.", "Spreadsheets are also just a good tool to have in your arsenal for hacking your way through problems. For example, say you have a spreadsheet with a list of names and ages you have to add to your database. You should be able to quickly turn those names and ages into a column of the right format (e.g. (\u2018name\u2019,\u2019age\u2019), so that you can copy that into a values statement in a SQL insert query.", "You should be good with excel but you shouldn\u2019t live in excel, that is a spreadsheet is a powerful tool to have in your toolbox but a data scientist lives primarily in code.", "A text editor is a powerful thing. They are the tool you use to inspect raw data files, they are ways of manipulating those raw data files. A text editor is a crucial tool for hacking your way through data processing tasks.", "A good use of a text editor is my spreadsheet example from above. You can create a column in excel of the format (\u2018name\u2019,\u2019age\u2019), but if you copy this directly into a text file or SQL editor it will copy \u201c(\u2018name\u2019,\u2019age\u2019),\u201d because it is a string. With a text editor, you need to be able to remove the outer double quotes with something like a find and replace double-quote with blank, or vertically select the double quotes and delete them manually.", "There are many text editors out there and you really need to be familiar with one. The windows default notepad is not a good option as it is extremely limited but many ides such as VS Code and RStudio have good text editing capabilities. For next-level text manipulation look at vim and emacs, these are available in the terminal and many graphical text editors support some of the functionality these programs provide.", "Regex gets a special mention here. They aren\u2019t really a standalone set of tools in and of themselves, but they are extremely useful and you should know the basics and that they exist.", "Regular Expressions basically allow you to describe strings in a general way that allows you to instruct the computer to bring you variations of a string.", "A simple example of regex being useful is replacing dates in a .csv file. Say you have a flat file with the date formatted as yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss e.g. 2020\u201301\u201325 20:13:00 and you want to change the date to the 28th of January, you can perform a regex match on [0\u20139]{4}-[0\u20139]{2}-[0\u20139]{2} and replace it with your date. That is 4 digits, then a \u201c-\u201d, then 2 digits, then a \u201c-\u201d then 2 digits. This is a simple example but it should demonstrate the power of regex and why you should invest some time in learning the fundamentals.", "The tool is the automation. You might be thinking that this work will be automated, and it will, with better tooling. e.g we used to have to write for loops for data analysis in VBA, now with packages like pandas and dplyr we can write column expressions and calls to mutate().", "These tools will keep advancing and becoming more powerful, the trick is that you have to learn how to use them. Think of these tools like magical languages, you are telling a computer what you want to do, the better you are the more easily you can express your desires.", "Getting better takes practice and a commitment to learning. You will often face a choice in programming to either write something complicated and powerful, or to manually repeat tasks, over time you will get better at writing the complicated things and it will be elegant, but you will often find there is a trade-off between writing the elegant script and hacking together a data processing solution with a spreadsheet, text editor and a bit of programming.", "\u201cIf you give a hungry man a fish, you feed him for a day, if you teach him how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime, if you teach him how to Google, he can learn how to feed, clothe, and house his whole village.\u201d \u2014 Owen Flanagan, 2020 [questionable quote]", "You need to be great at using search engines. Most coding problems can be resolved by correctly expressing your problem in a way that will bring you the documentation, forum posts, and stack overflow responses. In order to do this, you need to know the terminology and practice reading technical documentation. In a broader sense, this also covers academic research and google scholar.", "As a data scientist, you need to write. You will need to write emails, you need to explain yourself and the work you have done. At a basic level, you need to be able to write sentences that people can read and be able to structure a paragraph. This is a fundamental skill of any profession and it takes practice. The better you are at writing the less work you will have to do, if you send long confusing emails with no context to your coworkers, managers or clients you will have to write more to explain the point. You should be good at distilling the key points you are trying to convey and then structure your writing around them.", "Beyond the fundamentals of good writing, there is a productivity argument to having good habits around documentation. Explaining things to people takes time; if you document the steps you take to get a result you can share it with people who need to know instead of explaining individually. This is especially important for people joining your team; if you have good documentation, when a new person joins you can show them the documentation and give them some training on the process, after that they should be able to go to the documentation for anything they can\u2019t remember from your training.", "An investment in good documentation can save you time. Building a habit and skill at documenting your processes will save time in the long run. This point also extends to comments in code.", "\u201cDocumentation is a love letter that you write to your future self\u201d -Damian Conway", "Data scientists are tasked with important jobs. We have to deliver insights to help decision-makers identify the best path forward, we build machine learning models to make predictions that can help determine whether people get hired or get released from prison. Even minor tasks like data entry and configuring things in the database are left to us to check. Testing and checking your work is a big part of the job.", "Getting things wrong can be serious, if you are making a dashboard for a sales team you might confuse or stress people out until the issue gets raised. If you are presenting numbers to a CEO making an urgent decision then millions could be lost. If you are working on building driverless cars, people can die.", "In the real world, there is no one but you and your team checking that things are done properly. Checking your work is possibly the most important part of the job, delivering bad work can cause serious harm and damage your reputation. While it is dull and tedious, it should be done with the utmost attention to detail and diligence.", "When we are talking about productivity, getting things right is going to be up at the top of the list.", "We hear a lot about the huge demand for data scientists and we see a lot of courses teaching people to be data scientists. A lot of these courses focus on advanced techniques and anyone new to data science would probably think that the job is mostly building and optimizing models. When they hear that there is a huge skill deficit and millions of data scientists are needed over the next few years they think that means that millions of people need to be training and deploying machine learning models and advancing the field.", "I would argue that the world doesn\u2019t need millions of ai researchers, the world needs millions of people who can make data useful. This is what these skills are about, making data useful. There is a huge amount of work that needs to be done to get data into good shape before any projects can be delivered. A lot of the job is dull and mundane, but without that work we can\u2019t achieve any results. This is not how things are portrayed to aspiring data scientists, I know it wasn\u2019t what I thought of when I was just starting in the field.", "By investing time into mastering the skills required to manipulate data you can get more work done and increase your value. This is where the opportunities are and this is what people get hired to do. The faster the data can be wrangled the more time there is for building the cool stuff. On another level though, a lot of these tools are language-based so more skill means using a more elegant thoughtful solution which means the work is more interesting.", "These skills will always be useful as a data scientist no matter what you are working on. My point is not just that getting good at using these tools will help you get your work done better, it is also that our attitude should be to shout about great ways of getting the data processed. We should shout about great ways of testing and checking your work. We should shout about Great ways of integrating documentation into our work processes. We should shout so that these skills are given the respect they deserve and so that we can all become more productive.", "Your home for data science.
