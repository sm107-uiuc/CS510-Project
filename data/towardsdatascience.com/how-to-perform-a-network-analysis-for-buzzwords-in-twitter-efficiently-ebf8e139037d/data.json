It has been a mature approach to analyze hot trends with data on twitter.", "However, previously, we are required to complete the following steps if we want to do this kind of analysis:", "It seems not a big challenge for those who have sufficient coding skills. However, it can be an impenetrable barrier for social scientists with a poor programming background.", "Luckily, a new tool will help as a crucial steppingstone to overcome this barrier.", "The following introduction will explain how this new tool can efficiently complete series of manipulation mentioned above by one-stop.", "As you can see here, the tool is called \u201cInfraNodus.\u201d After the registration, you can dive into several different kinds of functions.", "Now let us click the button \u201cTwitter sentiment analysis,\u201d which is circled in the above image.", "Here you are prompted to enter a query term. For example, if you are interested in the recent scandal of Luckin coffee, you can enter \u201cLuckin.\u201d", "Click \u201cgo\u201d and be aware that it may take several seconds loading.", "Then plotting is finished and presented.", "In this plot, every node represents a keyword, and the line between two nodes indicates that these two words are found in the same tweet.", "Not every word is shown in the plot due to a filtering mechanism.", "As we see, different colors represent different clusters of themes which are classified in the dialog on the right side.", "For example, the first class, which is the yellow cluster, involves keyword \u201cCoffee,\u201d \u201cShare,\u201d and \u201cLoan.\u201d", "One of the highlights of this plot is that it\u2019s dynamic.", "Let us say if you are interested in the keyword \u201cfraud,\u201d click on it.", "You will notice that \u201cfraud\u201d automatically appears in the search box on the top right corner, which means you just performed a relevance filtering.", "Now you can see some keywords showing up that have a high correlation with \u201cfraud.\u201d", "Indeed, \u201cCOO\u201d and \u201cinvestigation\u201d obviously are highly relevant.", "Now click the button marked red at the top left corner of the plot above.", "And all tweets containing \u201cinvestigation\u201d are here.", "You can keep diving for analysis, for example, keep checking tweets about the investigation.", "Now there is only one relevant tweet left among original tweets. In this way, when you try to understand hot issues, you could be comfortable with targeting specific words to figure out the topics and their associations.", "Click above part with the red circle, and you can easily export the InfraNodus analysis results to png format, or gexf format. Png file could be displayed directly, and for gexf format, we could get further analysis and a high-quality plot in Gephi.", "So far, InfraNodus helped us do a lot of work. As we mentioned at the beginning, there are four basic processes.", "We finished items 1, 3, and 4. Besides, dynamic interactions are added as well.", "We were clicking the red marked button in the figure below to figure out what we could do in settings.", "Here you could preprocess text. For example, what degrees of distances are regarded as \u201cco-occurrence words.\u201d In particular, there are stopwords settings below. You can filter out words that you do not want to appear in the results.", "So, I say it is a one-stop analysis tool, is it not an exaggeration?", "We only tried the Twitter analysis function in this tutorial.", "How about the other parts? After I applied to different areas, it also works, whether it is news, Google search vocabulary, or even Wikipedia analysis.", "We could explain further when we have more time.", "InfraNodus provides the public with a free open source version on Github. Here is the link.", "However, this free version has to be built and run on the local computer. Particular coding skill is required.", "If you want to use it immediately, you could pay for a subscription. The current subscription fee is 9 Euros per month.", "As we mentioned before, this software mainly empowers social science researchers, so the subscription method is relatively more practical.", "In the end, if you want to conduct a vocabulary co-occurrence analysis on a specific topic on social media Twitter, InfraNodus can help you complete it in one stop to empower your research.", "Is the analysis of Twitter limited to keyword co-occurrence? Can you analyze the author, hashtag, or even a comprehensive review of several different elements?", "You are welcome to try it by yourself, and then feedback the results to the community. Let\u2019s learn from each other.", "If you are interested in this blog article, you may also want to read the following ones:", "I would like to thank Shelly Yin, my former undergraduate student, for helping me to translate the original Chinese version into English.", "Your home for data science.
