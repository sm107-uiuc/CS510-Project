This blog will use the Sportsreference API to create a data set for your own analysis, specifically NCAA Men\u2019s Basketball. When I look over the sports analytics landscape, I predominantly see canned reports (PaaS companies) hiding their data and not allowing you to export the raw data. The raw data is important so that you can check to see if the formulas are correct, and it allows you the flexibility to create your own features. This is understandable because, typically, these companies or websites most likely pay for that data. However, after extensive research, it has come to light that there are very few unique data points between data providers in the NCAAB landscape. The data set we create in this blog will give you a great start in analyzing the college basketball world's nuances.", "I am a huge believer in passion projects. I originally attained an engineering degree from university because I wanted to build things. Today, I use my computer to build passion projects to satisfy my curiosity. Typically in industry, you are constrained to your job duties. You may likely have not done anything a data engineer would do until today. A data engineer typically creates the infrastructure to import and clean the data for the data scientist or analyst. In your passion projects or even start-up companies, you will constantly be out of your comfort zone, wearing all of these hats at once. Outside of your comfort zone is where the learning truly begins.", "I will assume you have basic knowledge of Python 3.X from here on out. I will be showing code snippets from a Jupyter Notebook. The documentation for this API can be found here. If you would like to see the full notebook, please contact me, and I will help.", "To test out the API, let\u2019s begin with something simple: checking how many teams the Sportsreference API tracks.", "As you can see, there is data on 356 teams. It is important to understand that this is a snapshot of the 2019\u20132020 season data. College teams sometimes are created, disbanded, jumped conferences, or may have changed divisions in the offseason. If you want to change the year, change the year parameter in the Teams() class.", "Now that we know we can make basic requests from this API, let's pull the entire season\u2019s boxscore data. The code block below will create a CSV file for every team with the respective team's box score statistics from every game. Warning: This API is extremely slow, and this may take a couple of hours.", "I have added a couple of columns such as \u201cteam_name\u201d and \u201cconf\u201d to add some columns to the data set I felt were needed. You will see the output count up to the entire 356 teams to gauge how much has already been completed.", "Pay close attention to the part after \u201c# send to CSV\u201d as that determines where each CSV file will be created on your local machine. There are many ways of bringing in the data. I chose to do it like this because if one team\u2019s data were screwy, it wouldn't ruin the entire loop. Now we will assimilate all of the files into one main CSV. Make sure there are no other CSV files in this directory!", "I will be using this data set in future blog posts showing my work on feature creation and data cleaning. That being said, I will not go into cleaning and analysis here.", "If you are looking to take this one step farther and get this same data over multiple years, all you have to do is add a loop for the desired years. Warning: This will take a very, very long time to run. Run this code as you are heading to bed and let it go overnight.", "Now you have a CSV file of every team's schedule and box score data from the respective game. To assimilate all the files once again into a single CSV, repeat the very similar code from above.", "Let\u2019s create another CSV database with every player in the Sports Reference database from 2010 until today. This may be fun to play with, trying to project player growth, recruit projections, and more.", "Now once again, let\u2019s assimilate all of these files into a single CSV.", "Boom goes the dynamite! We have a CSV database with a player\u2019s season totals and career stats dating back to 2010!", "Believe it or not, that was the easy and non-time consuming part. Now we must clean the data \u2014 particularly standardizing the strings. For example, my alma mater is commonly referred to as LSU, but as you can see in the data frame above, the database has the team abbreviation as \u201clouisiana-state.\u201d", "I will continue working with this data set to provide insight into the NCAAB world in the form of easily understandable visualizations. I will also find other data sources publicly available to share with you so that we may be able to do shot charts, lineup analysis, and more.", "Please feel free to reach out and interact with me on social media! I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on my blogs, sports, data analytics, or anything in general.", "Your home for data science.
