Overfitting and underfitting are the two most common reasons why your model maybe performing badly."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["A machine learning model\u2019s true effectiveness actually depends on how well it does on the test set data. No matter how well it does on the training data, if it performs poorly on test data, the model is probably not a good fit for the task in hand. So when building a model there are three things that could happen, performance-wise:", "In general, we want a model that achieves only the third point mentioned above. The other two points are bad for a machine learning model. But it\u2019s very common to face one of these two problems while developing a model if we are not careful enough. In this article, we\u2019ll discuss what exactly it means to be overfitting or underfitting.", "For a supervised machine learning task we want our model to do well on the test data whether it\u2019s a classification task or a regression task. This phenomenon of doing well on test data is known as generalize on test data in machine learning terms. So the better a model generalizes on test data, the better the model is. But that\u2019s not what happens always. Because sometimes the model might run into the problem of being overfitted on the training data.", "When a model does too well on the training data but performs poorly on test data, it means the model is overfitting the training data.", "There are several reasons why a model overfits. But the general idea is when we try to fit a complex model with significantly insufficient training data, then the model tends to overfit the training data. Because then the model tries to capture a more complex pattern among the training data samples. By doing that it ends up picking every little local variations of the training data rather than picking up a more global structure of the data samples which is absolutely essential for a model to be generalized well on the test data.", "Now let\u2019s look at an actual example below using Python\u2019s Scikit-learn.", "In this Python script, a K-NN classifier is trained with different values of K (1, 3, 11). This script will yield the following output:", "As we can see when K = 1, the classifier has a 100% accuracy on training data. But the test data accuracy is significantly less. Because the classifier generalized poorly on test data than on the training data, meaning the classifier is probably overfitting the training data. However, as the value of K increases (K = 3, 11) the classifier\u2019s accuracy decreases on training data but increases on test data. That means the classifier is generalizing better on test data when K increases. Although it does not mean that if we keep increasing K, the test data accuracy will also keep increasing. At some point it will again start to have less accuracy on the test data, we have to be careful about that.", "As we have discussed when a model overfits, it tends to do too well on the training data. Well, model underfitting is the complete opposite of that.", "When a model underfits, it is likely to do very bad on the training data. As a result the model also doesn\u2019t generalize well on the test data.", "An under fitted model is too simple to even pick up the usual patterns that are present in the training data. So it\u2019s obvious that the model will also perform poorly on the test data. The following Python Script trains a K-NN regression model for different values of K (7, 15, 55):", "This Python Script will yield the following output:", "Here we have used the R\u00b2(r-squared) regression score to measure the performances of the models. This R\u00b2 score falls between 0 to 1, inclusive. The higher the R\u00b2 score is, the better the model is. As we can see when K increases from 7 to 15, the train score decreases but the test score increases slightly. However, when K changes from 15 to 55, the train score drops significantly. It means the model is underfitting when K = 55. As a result, the test score is also significantly less than the other models (K = 7, 15).", "Now that we have discussed what is overfitting and underfitting, the next logical thing is to ask, what is a good fit then! To be exact, there are no fixed criteria to decide whether a particular fit is good or not. In an ideal situation we\u2019d want a model that makes 0% error on both the train and test data. But that\u2019s easier said than done. So what we can do is to find a sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting while training a machine learning model. A model that neither underfits nor overfits and has a considerably good accuracy on both the training and especially on the test data can be considered as a potential good fit for the task in hand.", "Hope you liked this article.
