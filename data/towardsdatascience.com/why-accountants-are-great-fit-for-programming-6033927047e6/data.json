We manipulate, transform, do computations, store and share data.", "For years, Excel has been the go-to tool of us accountants in doing our work. But with today\u2019s volume and speed of data, new tools have appeared in order to process these. And most of them require knowledge of programming.", "Learning to program allows us to use these new tools and provide new insights to the organization.", "I\u2019m gonna make a bold statement.", "All apps are just supercharged spreadsheets.", "They are basically workarounds to the limitation of the traditional spreadsheets that we know of.", "How do we use spreadsheets? \u2014 We usually put data in them, manipulate them, and store the results.", "But they have limitations \u2014 not so aesthetic, data can be corrupted, duplicate data, invalid data, not so secure, etc.", "So we solve these limitations by separating data, logic, and presentation.", "In other words, we accountants are one step away from creating or understanding any app as we have knowledge of the problems that are commonly solved by these apps.", "The accounting field is abundant with repetitive tasks like inputting invoices in the system, updating customer information in practice management software, calculating tax, etc.", "And with the technological advances, most of them can now be automated, freeing our time and allowing us to focus on more value-added tasks \u2014 and thus continue being relevant in today\u2019s world.", "Accounting is a disciplined profession. You have to get the numbers right otherwise you risk misleading your stakeholders with false information.", "Patience and attention to detail are practiced in each phase of accounting \u2014 from inputting the transactions to the accounting system, making adjustments, and creating financial reports.", "Any accountant can relate to the experience of auditing your spreadsheet because numbers are not making sense \u2014 only to find out that you use the wrong cell reference in your formula.", "The same is true with programming. Anyone with programming experience may relate to coding for hours but finding a bug when you run the program \u2014 only to find out that you use = instead of == somewhere in your code.", "If you think about it \u2014 debugging is just the equivalent of auditing your spreadsheet \u2014 only it applies now to your script.", "Nowadays, there\u2019s a lot of hype about data science and business intelligence.", "But we accountants already know these two even before the terms became popular. We call it management accounting.", "Management accounting is simply the branch of accounting that focuses on providing relevant information to the management for decision making.", "This goes beyond the conventional financial data and may involve data such as customer churn, inventory lead time, etc. \u2014 any data to use for business decision making.", "The difference is that today\u2019s technology allows these data to be collected and processed in larger amounts at a faster phase.", "We accountants are the original \u201cdata analyst\u201d of every organization and we\u2019ll continue to be such if we adapt and learn to program.", "Programming is a tool to solve problems. It\u2019s a means to an end. Hence, to program well, you have to define first the problem being solved.", "That\u2019s where domain knowledge comes in. Accountants know the areas needing improvement and where programming can help.", "We also have an idea on how to measure the benefits of any software solutions and its ultimate effect on the bottom line.", "There\u2019s no better time than now to learn to program.
