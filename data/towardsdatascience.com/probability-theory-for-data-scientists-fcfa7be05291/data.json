However, we can make guesses based on previous experience or logic. Depending on the characteristics of an event, we might be very successful at our guesses.", "In math, we do not make guesses. Instead, we calculate probabilities. Life is also full of surprises for math so having a calculated probability value does not guarantee the correct answer. However, we will know that our guesses are based on math, objective, and not biased.", "The probability theory is of great importance for data science. One needs to possess a comprehensive understanding of the probability theory to be a well-performing data scientist. For instance, probability distributions play a key role in predictive analytics.", "Probability simply means the likelihood of an event to occur and always takes a value between 0 and 1 (0 and 1 inclusive). The probability of event A is denoted as p(A) and calculated as the number of the desired outcome divided by the number of all outcomes. For example, when you roll a die, the probability of getting a number less than three is 2 / 6. The number of desired outcomes is 2 (1 and 2); the number of total outcomes is 6.", "I have box with 1 blue and 4 yellow balls in it. If I randomly pick a ball from this box, it will likely to be yellow.", "The probability of picking a yellow ball, p(yellow), is 4 / 5 which is equal to 0.8 (or 80%). The number of desired outcome is 4 and the number of total outcomes is 5.", "When someone asks you if you think it will rain, your first reaction is usually to look at the sky. If there are dark clouds, your are more likely to answer \u201cyes\u201d. You check the conditions before giving an answer.", "We observe a similar logic behind the idea of conditional probability. The probability of event A given that event B has occurred is denoted as p(A|B).", "Conditional probability is the likelihood of an event A to occur given that another event that has a relation with event A has already occurred.", "The formula of the conditional probability is given below:", "P(A \u2229 B) is the probability that both events A and B occur. P(B) is the probability that event B occurs.", "Let\u2019s go over an example to comprehend the idea of conditional probability. In the image below, we see a probability space (\u03a9) which indicates all the probabilities add up to 1.", "The unconditional probability of event A,", "The conditional probability of event A given that B2 occurred, P(A | B2),", "Given that B2 occurred, the probability of event A increases.", "Conditional probability is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. For instance, Bayesian statistics arises from an interpretation of the conditional probability. In machine learning, Naive Bayes Algorithm is based on the Bayes\u2019 theorem and thus the conditional probability.", "There are some important points to emphasize about the conditional probability.", "In other words, if two events are independent of each other, the conditional probability of A given B is equal to the probability of A. It comes from a property of the joint probability.", "Joint probability is the probability of two events occurring together. If two events are independent, the joint probability is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each event.", "If we put that in the equation of the conditional probability:", "For instance, we have calculated P(A | B2) as 0.75 earlier. Let\u2019s also calculate P(B2 | A) and compare the results.", "Let\u2019s do one more example to finish up. The following table shows the number of female and male students enrolled in the sociology and music classes.", "There are 103 students. We will first calculate the unconditional probabilities.", "P(Female) means the probability that a student is female.", "The joint probabilities can be calculated by dividing the number in a cell by the total number of students. For instance, the probability that a student is female and enrolled in the sociology class:", "We can calculate the other joint probabilities similarly. The following table contains all the probabilities for these events.", "We will calculate the conditional probabilities now.", "Uncertainty is ubiquitous in our lives. Thus, any field in science needs to handle uncertainty both practically and theoretically.", "The probability theory is crucially important in the field of data science as well. Since we cannot eliminate uncertainty, we need proactive ways to efficiently handle it. For instance, probability distributions of variables play a key role in predictive analytics. One needs to possess a comprehensive understanding of the probability theory to be a good data scientist.", "Thank you for reading.
