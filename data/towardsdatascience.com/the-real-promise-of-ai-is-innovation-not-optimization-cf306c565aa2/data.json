General purpose technologies\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Let me start right off the bat: many incumbent organizations risk missing out on the strategic opportunity of AI \u2014 instead focusing on tactical optimization initiatives.", "General purpose technologies like AI have the potential to change how companies operate and create value, disrupting entire industries along the way. History proves however that new technologies thrive under new paradigms. That means their immediate applications are often far off from the real potential that they will bring in the long run. The good news is for AI that these paradigms are already emerging\u2014 they are just unevenly distributed.", "Using AI for both short term gains and long term strategic value is not trivial and requires strong leadership skills: combining vision with experimentation and aiming for both optimization and strategic plays.", "This article explains how to instill a strategic compass in AI transformation.", "Algorithmic decision making, in the sense of narrow-AI to automate or support key processes, enables companies to break through 100-years old limits in productivity inherent to the established corporation as we know it.", "Specialization of labor created organizational silo\u2019s. These silo\u2019s create boundaries in expertise, information flow and data. Increasing scale and scope put a limit on what is \u201cmanageable\u201d by humans, and puts a cap on learning. The result is that traditional organizations suffer from diminishing returns. Beyond a point, bigger just ain\u2019t better.", "For AI, this is actually reverse: algorithms can be scaled virtually infinitely and improve with size (i.e. more data and feedback loops).", "This fundamental dynamic creates a new breed of firms, with a step-change in productivity due to enhanced scale, scope and learning power. Certainly, digitization is the precursor. But AI creates a fundamentally new dimension by making cognitive tasks scalable while also improving them in a learning loop \u2014 rather than one that diminishes in size. The implication is not only automation of cognitive tasks at scale, but using AI to create new levels of scale.", "The writing is on the wall. Ant Financial, the financial services arm of Alibaba, has a broader offering of services than incumbent Bank of America. Yet, Ant Financial\u2019s operational efficiency is a factor >200 higher, measured in number of employees per customer.", "So the million dollar question for incumbent organizations: how to harness the power of this disruptive force?", "Artificial Intelligence is a general purpose technology with a fluid future \u2014 it is not yet entirely clear how disruption will play out at large for specific companies and sectors. That makes it hard for managers to develop a sharp vision and strategy for how to shape their business with AI. It makes sense to just start, and learn as you go. A wait-and-see approach only postpones an inevitable transformation.", "The inconvenient truth for managers is however that a bias towards action is necessary but no guarantee for long term success. We have history to prove it.", "When the electric motor was invented in the 19th century, the dominant use was to replace steam engines as a central power source in factories. It took decades to reconfigure manufacturing plants and redesign machines to exploit the benefits of locally applied mechanical power.", "A more recent example is the emergence of e-commerce. When the internet arrived, many retailers that went bust were initially the first to move online. They viewed online as just another distribution channel. Successful e-commerce players realized that the internet provided more than unlimited (digital) shelf space: easy experimentation (A/B testing), removing friction from the user buying experience, building customer relationships and recurring revenues, etc. But most of all: instead of a having a captive market based on physical presence, the internet creates winner-takes-all dynamics in single categories.", "Concluding, it takes both vision and experimentation to adopt new technologies for business innovation. For AI, this means it is not enough to launch a transformation program and identify a few use cases. In a world where the new technology (AI) will become a commodity, it will be the most creative and agile firms that continue to look for new ways of value creation that thrive in the long run.", "A new era of business model innovation has arrived: using AI to break traditional industry boundaries and build new revenues on top of optimizing old ones.", "Let AI scale your business, rather than letting your business scale AI.", "AI-powered innovation happens along three horizons which are typically increasingly risky in nature, but also potentially more rewarding.", "The far majority of AI activity in incumbent organizations takes place in horizon 1 (source: my own experience). And make no mistake, a lot of value is to be captured still. And it takes many iterative learning loops to figure out the most valuable forms of human-machine collaborations. There is however a lurking issue. Four of them, actually.", "First, AI initiatives could end-up as tactical gains, being in a sense no different from any other business optimization initiative. The AI-wash can obscure this fact and make it seem strategic for a while. No technology has ever created a strategic advantage by itself, without the proper business model to create defensible moats (which includes patents, of course) .", "Second, once the ball is rolling on AI a flurry of initiatives may arise. Getting AI solutions in production and implemented is however a huge challenge. Fragmented efforts may result in a whole lot of nothing.", "Third, the tactical character combined with fragmentation reduces the vision and nourishment the most promising areas require to come to fruition. The MVP in most cases gets you 20% of the potential. The remaining 80% requires sustained commitment and focus to realize.", "Fourth, while horizons 2 and 3 may require more bold moves beyond the traditional business, they represent both exponential gains and threats. The latter because value chains may fundamentally reconfigure as scale boundaries diminish. And someone else may get there first.", "The resulting status quo is that the bottom-up initiatives do not live up to their top-down potential.", "The humble task for AI change leaders is to create a vision and transformation approach that delivers both short term value while creating stepping stones towards strategic initiatives. Periodically raise your vantage point and calibrate your AI priorities. My advise would be:", "No easy task, but luck favors the prepared.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something \u2014 your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. \u201c Steve Jobs", "Your home for data science.
