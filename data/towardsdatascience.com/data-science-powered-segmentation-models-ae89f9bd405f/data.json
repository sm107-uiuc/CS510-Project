It reflects the increasing popularity of customer centric marketing strategies over product differentiation strategies. The audience focused approach in marketing e.g. helps to deliver more relevant and targeted communications to commercially relevant segments. STP therefore goes hand in hand with marketing personas.", "The popularity of segmentation in the strategy derives on the one hand from past limitations of CRM and ad-tech systems as well as a dependency on human decision making in the STP process on the other hand. Before the rise of data driven personalisation most systems could only handle a smaller number of segments and consequently targeting was limited to your general audience segmentation.", "To create rich and meaningful audience segments or marketing personas there is a wide choice of geographic, demographic, psychographic and behavioural data available. In our desire to create human interpretable segmentations we tend to", "This thinking in more or less discrete personas resonates strongly with marketeers and decision makers but is ultimately flawed and limiting. To name just a few problems:", "There have been important developments which cause a significant rethinking in how we approach segmentation today:", "You probably heard that data is the new oil but what does that even mean? With the advances in data technology and machine learning, data scientists can process vast amounts of data to extract subtle otherwise hidden signals. This data enabled approach unlocks not only new and innovative use cases but also helps to scale and automate them. Which kind of data are we talking about? In particular behavioural data like click-streams, event and search data from your e-commerce website or apps.", "The different geographic, demographic and psychographic attributes of your customers have subtle but definite impact on their needs and behaviour. Machine learning allows us therefore to extract these factors indirectly from behavioural data.", "There are clear advantages to this data driven approach:", "This can be a big deal for the marketeers but does it really matter? Not necessarily! It just requires change in how we understand and work with customer characteristics.", "On Zoopla, around 1.5M people search and interact daily with our property listings generating around 10M daily page views. To better understand these volumes of people and their product needs Zoopla naturally looks at segmentation. In a traditional segmentation approach we would look at personas like Renters, Buyers, Sellers, Landlords etc. But the property ladder isn\u2019t that clean cut: If you are in the process to buy a property you probably sell your current property to finance it. Such property chains account for the majority of property transactions in the UK. Renters might rent out of necessity in London but are also landlords with buy-to-let properties. And how about nosy people who just like to browse the property details on their street? At the same time, it is not clear how such personas translate into different product needs for a property portal like Zoopla.", "The first step in your segmentation journey with behavioural data is to translate your click-stream into a selection of relevant dimensions and their values. A great way to find these dimensions is to leverage the math of a recommendation engine and apply a factorisation to a user-product interaction matrix. If you read my previous article about recommendation systems and collaborative filtering, this is called a user-item model:", "The aim is to factorise a history matrix into user and product characteristics which can predict our historic user-product interactions. This history matrix could be product purchases, user ratings or some other relevant event for your business.", "The matrix factorisation can be done to a varying degree of complexity, e.g. whether to take user and product biases into account or not. Fast.ai provides some useful high-level abstractions for collaborative filtering. We use SVD++ as our factorisation which includes a bias b for items i and users u and our user characteristics U and product characteristics P for our dimensions f:", "For this example we use a sampled data set of Zoopla users and their engagement with certain property listings. The score describes an intention metric from 0 to 1 capturing the depth of a user\u2019s interaction with a listing on Zoopla (e.g. page time, number of images browsed, viewed the floor-plan, sending a lead to an agent etc.) as follows:", "We use Fast.ai and PyTorch to train our SVD++ model:", "Our model learned 10 factors to describe users and property listings on Zoopla. To make sense of this high dimensional data we can use the t-SNE algorithm to cluster and visualise our data. t-SNE is a stochastic ML algorithm to reduce dimensionality for visualisation purposes in a way that similar users and listings cluster together. This is also called a neighbour embedding.", "From those plots we can learn some interesting qualitative insights:", "You can read about an alternative approach using Deep Learning and Tensorflow in my follow up article:", "But marketing wants to go deeper!", "T-SNE is a useful visualisation technique for high-dimensional data but there are limits to how much quantitative information we can get from a neighbour embedding like this. How to extract insights from the high dimensional factors depends on your use-cases and industry.", "Geographics: The property market is very much hyper local and it\u2019s not surprising that our user and property characteristics contain geographic information. The property listings have associated location data and users search in geographic areas on Zoopla. Let\u2019s just group property listings by out-code and users by the out-code of their most frequent Zoopla search. We can then look at the variance of our 10 factors in the factorisation by out-code (like SE1). The hypothesis is that factors encoding geographic information show less variance within an out-code than other type of factors.", "Factors 0, 2 and 5 seem to encode geographic information. Not surprisingly, the user factors show a greater standard deviation for these factors: users search in multiple locations but we have aggregated them only by their most frequent search. Contrary to users, property listings have a definite location and hence lower expected standard deviation on geographic factors. The map shows the average user factor u_0 by out-code which correlates with the population centres across the UK. But the factor also highlights an important insight: it encodes geographic information as well as demographic information like renters versus buyers.", "Many dimensions we treat independently in the traditional segmentation approach are in fact strongly correlated and our factorisation produces derived dimensions of blended geographic, demographic and psychographic information. E.g. the price of properties, their number of bedrooms in combination with some geographic information is encoded into some derived localised affordability metric in our user-property factorisation.", "There are interesting differences in the localised affordability of properties:", "Technical: SVD++ like all collaborative filtering models has a cold start problem. New properties and people on Zoopla have to receive/ produce a certain level of interactions to be included in the segmentation. This also means that to add a new property or user to the model we have to re-run the factorisation. For Zoopla\u2019s highly dynamic property catalogue this is more of a problem than for a traditional e-commerce business.", "You can read about an alternative implementation with a Deep Neural Network using Tensorflow in my follow up article which has no cold start issue:", "Ethics: This blog post showed how rich behavioural data is and how detailed the signals are which can be extracted via machine learning. But is it ethical to do so? We derived detailed signals without that people explicitly gave us any data. On the one hand, this means that it\u2019s not necessarily transparent to users. On the other hand, if we derive an attribute against a user or property which is incorrect than a correction might require the involuntary disclosure of further data.", "After reading the blog post you might not see immediately why this is important. After all, I presented only qualitative insights mostly at an aggregated area level to inform a general STP strategy. This is clearly ethical and serves a general benefit of improving our products and services.", "But one signal we looked at was some derived affordability. In the factorisation model this data exists against the property and user level. Taking it down from an aggregated area to the property level still seems ethical. We do talk about the affordability of properties all the time. But how about taking it down to the individual user level? We could theoretically tell an agent what we think about your affordability with the leads you send. If that makes you feel uncomfortable and reminds you of DSS (housing benefits) discrimination then you are right. This is a data point which feels immediately unethical to use in such a context.", "As data scientists we have a responsibility to think about data ethics not just in the context of the models we train but also the use-cases such models might enable. We should only use data and build models that are proportionate. One way to incorporate this into our factorisation model is the number of signals we derive. My geographic area embeddings I trained in another blog post contained 50 signals. But the factorisation of user-property interactions I limited purposely to 10 signals, restricting the level of detail I extract.", "This is a very shallow and high level data ethics discussion and is solely meant to highlight the responsibilities when working with data. Every data scientist should understand and apply the Data Ethics Framework: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-framework", "I\u2019m far from an expert, but you can also read my article on Bias and Algorithmic Fairness to learn more about the problem and mitigation strategies:", "Jan is a successful thought leader and consultant in the data transformation of companies and has a track record of bringing data science into commercial production usage at scale. He has recently been recognised by dataIQ as one of the 100 most influential data and analytics practitioners in the UK.", "Your home for data science.
