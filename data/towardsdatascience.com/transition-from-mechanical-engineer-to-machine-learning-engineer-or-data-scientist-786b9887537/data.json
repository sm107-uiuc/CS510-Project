After my Bachelor, I was doing my higher education in the field of Robotics when the Data revolution took shape. People were more familiar with the word \u201cBig Data\u201d at the time rather than Data Science. Then, I got hooked up with Machine Learning and started steering my career path towards Data Science since. I had a bit of good start with a Robotics background, especially in programming, so I didn\u2019t have to start from scratch. Despite that, I encountered numerous obstacles trying to make the cut into the field of Data Science.", "It was quite confusing to me at the time since I didn\u2019t know where to start, what skills I need to sharpen, how I should form my resume, etc. If you are reading this and have a similar ME background, I hope you find this helpful.", "Before we hop on the board of investing time and money for online courses or other irreversible actions, it might be good to take a moment and seriously question your motivations. If it is merely due to the sexiest job of the 21st century, it is very likely that when the enthusiasm passes out, you will be left with confusion and frustration after wasting your investments and being lost in the sail.", "In my opinion, comparison between any two jobs are all irrelevant as any field has its pros and cons. However, as a person who has spent some times in both of the fields, I would like to point out a bit of characteristics of both, reflecting my personal opinions only.", "Data Science has nearly exact opposite characteristics.", "I didn\u2019t categorize above characteristics into pros and cons, since I think it highly depends on individuals. For instance, if you want a stable life and a routine work space, then the boredom of ME is not a cons at all.", "Executing the transition takes a good amount of time and effort. As any kind of investment, you might want to consider how long the return of interest can be. For some person, the transition might be natural and take place over time, months, even years as in this article. For others, it might be fueled by a moment of epiphany and executed with a hustled plan. In my experience, it often take years if you are already in a full time job, and a bit shorter if you are in college. Mainly because you need free time to develop new skills. Again, it also greatly depends on what you already have, so this time frame is just for reference.", "I really like the word \u201ctransition\u201d. You transit from one state to another, not \u201chop to\u201d or \u201cstart a new\u201d. In other words, by realizing what you have with an ME background, and strategically developing the required new skills in Data Science, you will make the cut.", "Since skill sets in Data Science are commonly categorized into 3 main cohorts: Math/Stats, Domain Knowledge, and Programming, I will structure this section accordingly, each with a \u201cRe-usability Score\u201d, that I think how hard we can re-use the ME background in the transition.", "If there is one thing that I can be the most confident about my ME background, it would be a rigorous and solid Math and Stats understandings. You might be surprised looking back to your academic transcript and count the number of Math-related courses that you\u2019d taken. The challenge is that, whenever I have a conversation with my friends about learning Math in college, I get replied with \u201cyeah yeah, I\u2019m still waiting for the day I can use the Green\u2019s theorem in my real life\u201d. No, you won\u2019t. But that\u2019s not the purpose of studying Math. It gives you the \u201cfood for thoughts\u201d. It gives you the fuel to burn when it comes to problem solving.", "Let me give you an example. If I ask you to compute the first order derivative of this function y = x^2 + 1. Easy, it\u2019s y = 2x. But how can you make any money out of that skill (apart from being a tutor for a high school student)?", "Here is the trick, what matters is not with the numbers and Math formula, is with the intuition behind the Math. The first order derivative tells you the speed with which the function is increasing or decreasing. Hence, it\u2019s around 0 in the region that a function is a constant, and non-zero elsewhere. Let\u2019s see what we can do with that intuition.", "Now, let\u2019s say you are an engineer, and the manufacturing manager of an automobile manufacturing site complains with you that they are paying a good amount of money for a tester to count the number of screws on machines, before let them out of the factory. If you can automate that task, you get 20% of the margin, after decommissioning the tester role. Now we are talking real money.", "You take a photo of the view from the tester. You observe that the screws have different colors than the machine body, so if there is a way to make it \u201cpop out\u201d in the photo, you can have a program to \u201ccount\u201d them. Since you remember that we can use the first order derivative to find region where a function changes significantly, you realize that the edges of those screws should have a non-zero first order derivative.", "You run a first order derivative filter of the image, and voila! the screws are as bright as stars.", "Now you can develop a computer vision system to replace the (poor) tester and collect your share. All of that is based on the fundamental first order derivative intuition.", "Another example: if I ask you to write down the Probability Chain Rule, it would be a piece of cake: P(A,B)=P(A|B)*P(B). But what of use is it?", "Let\u2019s say one day your senior manager asks this question: \u201cHow likely we have to pay $2000 to restore server XYZ this year? You know, if it goes down.\u201d This is a valid and common business question that a Data Scientist is supposed to be able to answer. You would go back and define:", "Thus, P(A|B) is the probability that you have to pay $2000 to fix the server XYZ, given it indeed breaks, and P(B) is the probability that the server breaks down. A quick and dirty way to determine those probabilities might be:", "(Please note that abnormality detection is a huge topic and this is just an over-simplified solution. But I think it\u2019s enough to make the point.)", "Anyone who took Probability & Statistics 101 can write the Chain Rule, but only being able to \u201ctranslate\u201d it to answer the business questions will grant you the job.", "Unlike other kind of engineerings, where the skills or the outcomes of the work of engineers directly generate products or services that the end users buy, Data Science doesn\u2019t often directly create values. This is the reason why Domain Knowledge is essential. A Data Scientist needs to understand the business thoroughly before they can apply AI models to it.", "Normally, I see AI models create profits by the following setups:", "It might be obvious, but all those setups answer a single question:", "How do you use the proposed AI model to make profits?", "Either measurable by dollar counts, or other KPIs. When one first starts with Data Science, they might have a lot of concerns in their first project. It might be the novelty of the methods, model performance, computational complexity, degree of state-of-the-art, or model evaluation, etc. All of them do matter, for the whole solution to work. But they all should be guided by that single question. It might sound pragmatic, but it actually is. The question should have a satisfied answer at step 0, before anything happens.", "This transition is a bit harder, since for a mechanical engineer, you don\u2019t really have to care about how values are created. But what you possess, is the well-trained mindset of how to design and optimize processes: mechanism design, process control, thermodynamics, Otto cycle, Capstone design, etc. They are all processes! And to some extent, a business model is a process itself. There are lot more uncertainties, since humans get involved (humans are random), but you have been trained to model uncertainty in process too!", "However, what you bring along (your process-oriented mindset) is just the vehicle, you still need the fuel to run. Have you ever wondered how the local food court near where you live makes money? or how the shirt you are wearing was made in a country half of the earth away, and got transported to you to buy? Just graph your ideas down onto a paper, and you will be surprised. Instead of \u201cgas reservoir\u201d (just a fancy thermodynamic jargon for a container of gas), you have \u201cgood inventory\u201d; instead of \u201cfluid conducting pipe\u201d, you have \u201cdata extraction pipeline\u201d; instead of \u201cflow rate\u201d, you have \u201cdata transfer rate\u201d. The laws of physics are universal, and they are valid in the digital world as well.", "Re-usability Score: for Data Scientist: Medium, for ML Engineer: Hard.", "I differentiate between the two since in my opinion, ML Engineers are hardcore software engineers who can do modeling. Hence, the level of competency in programming needs to be extreme. This differentiation of course is relative, since certainly there are data scientists who write production code.", "This is the part that takes most of the time to master. \u201cProgramming\u201d is a bit poorly used here, since it doesn\u2019t include the whole software engineering practices: networking, APIs, CI/CD, Dockerization, etc, you name it. Unfortunately, you need them all for the ML Engineer path (here I assume the context of Data Scientists is contained within analytics and visualization tasks, in other words, those who don\u2019t have to write production code. Again, it\u2019s subjective).", "There is a myriad of online courses and great articles in TDS about how you should sharpen this skill set so I won\u2019t be going through them again. There is only one point I would like to share: the great concept of encapsulation, and that I don\u2019t mean just in OOP. This helps me greatly in learning.", "You can learn almost any software engineering tool/skill in isolation, and a complete software application can be broken down to granular modules that you can learn each one separately. This is beautiful and I couldn\u2019t do it in Mechanical Engineering. This leads to an extremely effective learning strategy: divide and conquer. I have numerous folders like: python-practice, spark-practice, Docker-practice, gRPC-practice, k8s-practice, etc. Each with no more than 5 files contains the most basic example code of the tool. Once you master a sufficient number of these \u201cLego blocks\u201d, designing solution architect will be full of fun. You have the freedom to shape how your AI model will interact with other modules.", "Note that it requires a great effort to bring all of the blocks together to have a functional application, otherwise, software engineers wouldn\u2019t exist since people can just pick the blocks and an \u201cuniversal\u201d program will compile the desired application like you order in a McDonalds self-order kiosk. This is about an effective way that you could use to learn quickly.", "There are two tools that I had to spend fairly amount of time to catch up with when stepping out from ME: git and SQL. It makes sense since in ME, you don\u2019t have to mange code and you don\u2019t have to manage relational databases. For me at the time, Dropbox was good enough to share code, folders followed by prefix such as \u201cbackup_20080202\u201d were good enough for version control, and Excel was okay to keep tables. Life was easy and simple. So I have to up the game with git and SQL.", "git: I had always thought that I am fluent in git by knowing some git command lines, until I needed to merge code with my colleagues. Hence, the best practice I would recommend is to do some pair programming projects with your friends: course projects, hobby projects, or develop a small feature in pair with your colleague. The sooner you do this, the sooner you realize that git is not just about version control, and the better off you will be.", "SQL: In my opinion, it doesn\u2019t matter what version of SQL you are using, as long as you understand all the different kinds of joins in SQL and know how to check the outcome, you are good. Why? Because syntax errors are easy to spot, the platform will say like \u201cError: can not convert a string type to integer.\u201d, your query will fail, you will know. But the joins are silent killers. If you use a wrong type of join, or you trust your query outcome without double checking, chances are you will only find out when your manager calls you in and questions your \u201cridiculous\u201d charts. For instance, if you join a sale table with some other product info table without checking for duplicates, your joined table will have duplicated rows. In other words, one sold product might appear more than one time, and in your visualization, the sale volume suggests that your company is a Fortune 500 rather than a startup. No one would take your presentation serious.", "These are the things that helped me a great deal along my journey, and I hope they are useful for you as well.", "Working in this field of Data is rewarding in many ways, but for me, it is the joy I have when a model is deployed in production and watch it goes, just like when I built a robot and saw the whole thing runs for the first time.",
