As a designer in love with math and science, this email touched me on an emotional level.", "(For New York Times coverage on John Maeda and RISD\u2019s initiative, see here.)", "Supporters of STEAM argue that creativity and problem-solving skills are intricately tied to success in STEM education. Although I do agree with this point of view, this argument can be somewhat arbitrary. For one, we don\u2019t fully understand what creativity means, and even if we did, we know it is not necessarily equivalent to learning how to draw. With a number of years working in both fields, I would like to share my personal opinion on how learning art might benefit one\u2019s practice in data science.", "I always loved both science and the arts, but I constantly had to choose between the two. It was as difficult a question as choosing between mom and dad (quite literally because my mom was a designer, and my dad an engineer). In my childhood, I spent many hours building a line-tracer robot and teaching myself to code, while also filling up books with character sketches. If someone asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I always struggled to choose either an artist or a scientist.", "Despite being voted as most likely to cure cancer in my class, I decided to study visual arts at RISD, graduating into a career as a graphic designer. I worked and grew in this field for nearly a decade before deciding to change directions. I went back to school to do research in cognitive science, falling in love with data and statistics, and ending up in the field of data science. Unlike what many would think, my path did not feel that divergent, and if you asked me, I still don\u2019t want to choose.", "When I was studying human decision making, I became fascinated with the idea of a cognitive map inspired by works of the Nobel Prize winner John O\u2019Keefe and Tim Behrens, a neuroscientist at Oxford University. A very brief summary of this brilliant concept is that our brain uses a grid-like system to map spatial relationships and that we may also use this system for non-spatial relationships as well. This process is thought to center around the hippocampus, the brain area previously known as a memory hub.", "This almost seems too intuitive to be true. We do describe non-spatial relationships similar to spatial relationships. We can feel and describe our relationship with people as a \u2018distance\u2019. We naturally understand two things to be \u201ccloser\u201d when they are similar to each other. The memory from childhood feels so \u201cfar away\u201d compared to that from yesterday. So what is the importance of this concept of the cognitive map? I think (hypothetically) some aspects of art training develop such spatial skills that are tied to navigating and generating these cognitive maps that are useful in other practices in STEM research.", "Conscious training for originality encourages you to connect different concepts. Imagine that you go camping and you need to think of a way to open a can of food. This cognitive process of thinking outside the box away from the usual heuristics is called divergent thinking. When we need to open a can, our brain knows to find a can opener, because a can opener has a direct connection to the opening of a can. But if we are in the woods and not in the kitchen, we need to establish a new connection between the function of the can opener and the things available in the woods.", "Now let\u2019s think about this in terms of cognitive mapping. Our brain has a manual that tells us how to open a can, which links to a can opener. But then what do we do if we are missing the essential tool (a can opener) to carry out the instruction? We remap the properties of the tool needed to follow the instruction (e.g. cut the metal but not my hand) onto properties of other available tools and find the best fitting routes. If we are good, we can map subparts of the instruction to multiple tools and use them collectively (one that cuts the metal and another that protects my hand). If we get even better, we can generalize this to any other maps.", "This is an essential skill in the process of data science where we are inundated with many tools to derive the answers. Yet, how we remap the right attributes of the right tool to the problem at hand is a crucial part of the success.", "Creating art is all about connecting maps across different domains. Many tasks take the form of repurposing a given object or changing the domain of a given concept. For example, I was once asked to pick two random words out of the hat and create a cohesive publication layout that takes those two words (as random as peanut butter and horseshoe) as its theme. The main challenge was to remap some properties of these words onto a design that makes sense to a general crowd.", "This may seem like an arbitrary practice, but it has significant implications for the scientific research process. Flexible remapping of otherwise irrelevant domains into the question at hand allows a dynamic utilization of more resources our brain gathers. We learn to generalize what we learned in one domain to another more easily.", "On a similar note, learning to navigate different maps more fluently helps us to navigate even broader areas. We do this by remapping information on a manageable scale. It\u2019s like having pieces of many maps, selecting locations we need, and putting big circles on them. So even though some details of each map might be fuzzy, we can still use it to plan a rough but efficient route to get all our chores done by their approximate locations. The ability to quickly find the important gist and to cluster those key concepts not only helps in seeing the big picture but also aids with memorization of even a very large amount of information. This is a process of abstraction, which is an integral part of art training.", "For example, when you learn to draw a still life, you train yourself to extract different properties of what you see at a time. First, you may start by only focusing on seeing the overall proportions and relationships between components. Next, you may focus on the boundaries and edges of these components. Then you may extract only how light is hitting the surface. And so on. Art training doesn\u2019t stop here. Often you would tap into other maps in your brain to integrate some new associations in order to add deeper meanings. This process of consciously defining individual attributes builds our ability to quickly navigate between them and to easily switch the scale of our cognitive map. A similar process is expected for a data science project where the ability to fluently deconstruct and compose a problem to a scale that is solvable by any specific algorithm is important.", "When we were drawing a still life above, we started by observing how components are structured in relationships with one another. This is an important skill you learn across any type of art education, and this is the basis of the cognitive map: an ability to think about non-spatial problems as spatial elements. There are many studies that show how training of spatial ability improved children\u2019s performance in math (see references). Art training involves learning to composite or convert multiple elements into simpler dimensions, even before one starts to put these ideas onto a paper. This process involves simulating multiple arrangements and generating relationships between items in our minds.", "This spatial training is then generalized to the non-spatial process. Earlier we discussed how art training can help us connect across different domains and different contexts. Similarly, we can map non-spatial contexts into space and dynamically navigate allowing us to comprehend complex concepts and seeing them from a different perspective. (If you ever watched 3Blue1Brown\u2019s videos, you\u2019d know how handy this skill would be.)", "In summary, I believe the benefits of art education go well beyond traditional design fields, extending themselves through practical uses in science, and technology. I mainly discussed art training in terms of visual arts and design in this post, because that\u2019s what I know best. But I believe these skills are taught across many different types of art practice, including performing arts where the domain of expression is more diverse. After all, it\u2019s about training our fundamental cognitive functions to expand its threshold and to break the usual heuristics, not just a training of technical skills.", "Cakmak, S. (2009).
