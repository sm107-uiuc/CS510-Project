Its popularity can likely be attributed to its ease of use \u2014 with just a few lines of code you are able to produce great visualizations. This is especially great for beginners who are just beginning their journey into R, as it\u2019s very encouraging that you can create something visual with just two lines of code:", "In this article, I want to highlight ggplot\u2019s flexibility and customizability. Alternatives such as Matplotlib and Seaborn (both Python) and Excel are also easy to use, but they are less customizable. In this article, I\u2019ll walk through 8 concrete steps you can do to improve your ggplot.", "In order to make sure that the advice in this article is practical, I\u2019m going to abide by two themes:", "Themes control all non-data display and are an easy way to change the appearance of your graph. It only takes one extra line of code in order to do this, and ggplot already comes with 8 separate themes.", "The ggplot themes are simple. They won\u2019t really stand out, but they look great, are easy to read, and get the point across. Also, if you want to use the same theme over and over, you can set a global theme with one line of code and it will apply to all ggplots.", "For full details on the 8 themes you can visit this link.", "Themes are also super customizable. Beyond the 8 themes that come with ggplot, you can also make your own theme but more importantly use themes that others have created already. In the few companies I\u2019ve worked at, we\u2019ve all had internal ggplot themes. For example, I helped create theme_fb() at Facebook which with input from designers at the company.", "If you wanted to use some other themes outside of ggplot, the most popular package is ggthemes which has some interesting options such as theme_fivethirtyeight(), theme_wsj(), and theme_economist(). A sample of these themes are below, but I definitely recommend checking out this link to learn more.", "When visualizing data, one thing you always want to think about is how many dimensions of data you want to display. A majority of graphs will typically only need 1\u20132 dimensions of data to get a point across, for example:", "As you increase the number of dimensions, a single graph is going to get more cluttered, which makes it harder to get a point across. For example:", "This is where the magic of faceting shines. What if we don\u2019t have to limit ourselves to one graph? My hypothesis for why a lot of us think this way is because we are used to visualizing data in Excel, where we are constrained to a single graph. In ggplot, we can break this mode of thinking, and all it takes is a single line of code to do so. Facets allow us to easily add up to two additional dimensions our visualizations.", "Let\u2019s explore how we can use facets to visualize diamonds data.", "At a basic level, we can view the relationship between the carat of a diamond and its price, which is the main purpose of this dataset:", "This graph only shows two dimensions of data, but there are a few others are also important. The cut, color, and clarity of the diamond \u2014 all of these could are related to the price of the diamond. One way to bring these dimensions in is to have the dots be different colors or use different dot shapes, but let\u2019s give faceting a try instead.", "Use facet_wrap() if you only want to break out the graph by a single dimension:", "Use facet_grid() if you want to break out the graph by two dimensions:", "These are just two examples of how you can use facet_wrap() and facet_grid() , but the key takeaway from this section is that with ggplot, you are not constrained to thinking about visualizations in a single graph.", "Colors serve two key purposes in data visualization:", "There are many ways to color your ggplots, but for simplicity this section focuses on Viridis palettes, which are my personal favorite as they are:", "You can read more theory behind the colors above here, but this section focuses on 4 key functions which allows you to use these colors:", "Protip: Here, I\u2019m using the option parameter to change the color palette within viridis. You can switch between options A-E which reflect the different color schemes in above.", "I introduced this in the last section, but I wanted to address it more explicitly because it can be confusing when you first use ggplot. To color a ggplot, you\u2019ll either use color or fill , and this depends on the graph type.", "So what's the difference? Generally, fill defines the color with which a geom is filled (i.e. geom_bar()), whereas color defines the color with which a geom is outlined (i.e. geom_point()).", "So the takeaway here is that if you try to color a graph and it appears that nothing has changed, simply switch color to fill or vice versa.", "Good visualizations have concise and descriptive labels. They help readers understand what they are seeing, and this especially important if you expect your visualization to be shared. Luckily it\u2019s super easy to label in ggplot.", "Below are ggplot\u2019s most useful labelling functionalities, listed in how often they should probably be used. You can pick and choose which labels you want to use \u2014 for example, if you only want to add a title, you only need to enter the title parameter in labs() .", "Note: The color field is only accessible if you have a color as an aesthetic in your ggplot. This labelling method will also work whether you use fill, color, size, alpha, etc.", "On the theme of telling a story with your visualization, line annotations are a very useful tool. Some examples that I\u2019ve personally used include:", "Whatever the use case, having a line annotation helps communicate an important point to those who will be viewing your visualization. To add a line to your ggplot, you\u2019ll use either:", "The example below will show both of these in action:", "Note that the above code may look a little more complicated than some of the other ggplot code in this article. I\u2019ll try to explain what\u2019s going on there. In order to get the average carat and price, a more straightforward way to get these values is to calculate them before your ggplot code. However, because I am lazy and like reducing the number of variables that I have, I instead pipe the data (diamonds %>% sample_n(1e3)) directly into the geom_line() statements, which work just as well.", "In addition to lines, it is always useful to have some sort of data labelling in your graphs. However, it\u2019s only going to be useful if your data labels are easy to read. For example, if you blindly apply the text geom, you\u2019ll end up with a really ugly graph:", "In this section, I\u2019ll talk about three key tips for using geom_text() effectively.", "In the above graph, you\u2019ll see that the text completely overlaps the point, which looks ugly. You can easily fix this by aligning your text within geom_text(). The way that I think of this is similar to left and right align in Microsoft Word.", "Generally, you\u2019ll have vjust and hjust range from [0,1] but it also takes on negative values and values greater than one (it will just move your label further in the specified direction). The graph below shows how text will be aligned based on your hjust and vjust values:", "This is more of a preference, but know that you can change the color of your text. You generally want to have your text contrast as much with the background as possible, as this makes it the most legible. This is important if you have some lighter colors (i.e. yellow) that may be hard to read:", "Lastly, ordering your graph can make it easier to read, and this is especially useful for bar graphs. All you have to do is use fct_reorder() on the x value such that it\u2019s sorted by the y-value:", "I had a tough time deciding what different topics I wanted to cover in this article. I ended up focusing on topics that were initially confusing to me, and that I wish I understood more when I first started learning ggplot. Hopefully, this article gives you some concrete ideas on how to improve your visualizations or demystifies some of the more confusing/hidden aspects of ggplot.", "Your home for data science.
