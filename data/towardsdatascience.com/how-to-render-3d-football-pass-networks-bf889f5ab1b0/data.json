So why yet another article about it? Well, one rainy Sunday I thought it would be a great idea to boost my science ego by running someone else\u2019s comprehensive Python script on my computer, patting myself on the back for what a great data scientist I am. Not surprisingly, the script executed successfully at first attempt \u2014 obviously not because of my programming genius, but because of the excellent quality of the script I used, namely Sergio Llana\u2019s GitHub repository for building customizable passing networks with Matplotlib. So after a single button press [Run Script], I\u2019m proudly staring at my first \u201cself-programmed\u201d pass network:", "But then a thought comes to mind: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if I could immerse myself into the network to see how many low or high passes were played?\u201d. That\u2019s when I began experimenting with Cinema4D\u2019s built-in Python module. To my own surprise, I was able to realize my idea with minimal effort. In this article, I want to share my (possibly unconventional) visualization approach.", "Disclaimer: If you\u2019re here for analytical insights, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be disappointed. This article is solely about how to transform traditional 2D passing networks into 3D.", "As already mentioned, I was only able to achieve my results because someone else was generous enough to share his/her code. Many code sections I used for the data preparation are taken directly from Sergio Llana\u2019s GitHub page (in particular the import and processing of StatsBomb\u2019s open data repository). People are lazy after all, so there\u2019s no shame in copy-pasting code! \u2026right? That said, you can find my Python scripts and C4D project files on my GitHub.", "I was surprised at how much scouting data is publicly available nowadays. For this project, I used the game Portugal vs Spain (3:3), which took place during the 2018\u2019s World Cup group stage. You\u2019ll find the event data of all matches from the 2018 World Cup at StatsBomb. Another great source worth mentioning is a recently published article in the Nature magazine to which a public data set of spatio-temporal match events is attached.", "A football pass networks consist of a set of circular \u2018nodes\u2019 (i.e. players) that are connected through \u2018edges\u2019 (i.e. passes). Instead of \u2018edges\u2019, I will use the term \u2018splines\u2019 from here on. You'll understand why later. The size of the nodes is usually representative of the total number of passes a player has completed during a game. Each player\u2019s field position (a.k.a. tactical line-up) can be obtained by either (a) calculating the average XY-coordinate from each player\u2019s spatio-temporal tracking data (if available) or by (b) calculating the average XY-coordinate from each player\u2019s scouting events (i.e. passes). Traditionally, the weight (thickness) of the edges represents the number of completed passes that have occurred between two players.", "I will skip the part on how to parse StatsBomb\u2019s JSON files and extract completed pass connections into a separate DataFrame. Sergio\u2019s scripts work like a charm, so I made only minor adjustments. I knew beforehand that I wanted to render each node and pass one by one. That\u2019s why I created two DataFrames that I could save as a text file and import into Cinema4D using its built-in Python connector:", "Cinema4D (C4D) is a 3D design, animation and rendering software which is primarily used for motion graphics, modelling, and texturing; however, it comes with a comprehensive Python module. That said, pretty much every user action can be executed via a Python command, thus allowing the automation of design processes. Below is an example of my customized user interface, showing the 3D viewport (top left), object manager (top right), and material manager (middle right). In between is the Python script manager, allowing to create single objects as well as entire scenes programmatically. The next two paragraphs will demonstrate how easy it is to create any 3D object with just a few lines of code.", "I will use a simple disk to represent a player\u2019s node. Creating a disk and changing its attributes via Python commands is pretty straight forward in C4D. The following code example generates a disk with an outer radius of 100 cm at the origin (0,0,0):", "Instead of showing a single weighted edge between players (representative of the number of passes), I wanted to render each pass individually. To achieve this effect, we have to introduce some randomness\u2026", "I found that the easiest way to render a pass trajectory between two players is to create a spline object. Initially, I thought that each spline should merely consist of a start (passing player) and endpoint (receiving player), but that would have resulted in perfectly straight lines \u2014 as we know it from traditional pass networks. Instead, I wanted to create the impression that (a) each pass trajectory is slightly different, and (b) high passes were rendered as an arc. That\u2019s why I ended up using three spline points for each pass trajectory, giving me the possibility to add a flight curve to high passes, as well as introduce some random offset to the centre spline point (creating the illusion that each pass is displayed individually). The following code example generates ten random spline objects between two points.", "Now that we know how to generate player nodes and pass trajectories, it is time to replace the default values with our player-specific values. This works best with a loop that iterates through the player node file and creates a name and disk for each player. A second loop iterates through the pass value file and generates random pass trajectories between player pairings \u2014 depending on the number of passes that were completed between them.", "All that\u2019s left to do now is to add the field lines, pick your favourite colours (a.k.a. materials), add some informative text, find a decent camera angle, adjust the render settings to your likings \u2014 and hit the [render] button:", "Arguably few for the typical football analyst. But if you\u2019re like me and your interests lie somewhere between data science and graphic design, you\u2019ll be amazed what can be realized by combining a programming language (Python) with 3D design software (C4D).", "Admittedly, C4D isn\u2019t necessarily considered a standard tool for data scientists, and you\u2019ll also need to invest some time to learn the basics. It also remains debatable whether 3D pass networks offer any added value compared to traditional 2D networks. Nevertheless, I enjoyed experimenting with Python in C4D, and I will certainly integrate it more often in the future.", "Animation! C4D shows its real strength when it comes to animation, which is great because some might argue that static pass networks provide a rather superficial insight into the game. Instead, showing how a team\u2019s network dynamic changes over time (and how it reacts to the opposing team\u2019s network) could provide much deeper insights. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s possible. I\u2019ll keep you posted!", "Thanks for reading my article!
