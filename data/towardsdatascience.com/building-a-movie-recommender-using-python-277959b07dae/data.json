This will be a simple project where we will be able to see how machine learning can be used in our daily life. If you check my other articles, you will see that I like to demonstrate hands-on projects. I think this is the best way to practice our coding skills and improve ourselves. Building a movie recommender program is a great way to get started with machine recommenders. After sharing the contents table, I would like to introduce you to recommendation systems.", "Recommendation systems have been around with us for a while now, and they are so powerful. They do have a strong influence on our decisions these days. From movie streaming services to online shopping stores, they are almost everywhere we look. If you are wondering how do they know what you might buy after adding an \u201cx\u201d item to your cart, the answer is simple: Power of Data.", "We may look very different from each other, but our habits can be very similar. And the companies love to find similar habits of their customers. Since they know that many people who bought \u201cx\u201d item also bought \u201cy\u201d item, they recommend you to add \u201cy\u201d item to your cart. And guess what, you are training your own recommender the more you buy, which means the machine will know more about you.", "Recommendation systems are a very interesting field of machine learning, and the cool part about them is that they are all around us. There is a lot to learn about this topic, to keep things simple I will stop here. Let\u2019s begin building our own movie recommender system!", "I\u2019ve found great movie data on Kaggle. If you haven\u2019t heard about Kaggle, Kaggle is the world\u2019s largest data science community with powerful tools and resources to help you achieve your data science goals.", "Here is the link to download the dataset.", "First things first, let\u2019s start by importing and exploring our data. After you download the data folder, you will multiple dataset files. For this project, we will be using the movies_metadata.csv dataset. This dataset has all we need to create a movie recommender.", "Perfect! Our data is all set. Ready to be trained by our model. It\u2019s time to move to the next step, where we will start building our content-based recommender.", "Content based recommender is a recommendation model that returns a list of items based on a specific item. A nice example of this recommenders are Netflix, YouTube, Disney+ and more. For example, Netflix recommends similar shows that you watched before and liked more. With this project, you will have a better understanding of how these online streaming services\u2019 algorithms work.", "Back to the project, as an input to train our model we will use the overview of the movies that we checked earlier. And then we will use some sci-kit learn ready functions to build our model. Our recommender will be ready in four simple steps. Let\u2019s begin!", "We will start by importing the linear kernel function from sci-kit learn module. The linear kernel will help us to create a similarity matrix. These lines take a bit longer to execute, don\u2019t worry it\u2019s normal. Calculating the dot product of two huge matrixes is not easy, even for machines :)", "Now, we have to construct a reverse map of the indices and movie titles. And in the second part of the Series function, we are cleaning the movie titles that are repeating with a simple function called drop_duplicates.", "Well done! It\u2019s time to test our recommender. Let\u2019s see in action and how powerful it really is. We will run the function by adding the movie name as a string as a parameter.", "Congrats!! You have created a program that recommends movies to you. Now, you have a program to run when you want to choose your next Netflix show. Hoping that you enjoyed reading this hands-on project. I would be glad if you learned something new today. Working on hands-on programming projects like this one is the best way to sharpen your coding skills.", "Feel free to contact me if you have any questions while implementing the code.", "Follow my blog and youtube channel to stay inspired. Thank you,", "Your home for data science.
