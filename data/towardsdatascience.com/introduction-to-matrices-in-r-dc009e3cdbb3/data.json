The first argument is the vector box_office , which contains all box office figures. Next, we have to specify nrow=3 and byrow=TRUE to construct the matrix with 3 rows filled row-wise (the first column will represent the US revenue, the second non-US revenue).", "It is often helpful to add names to the rows and columns of a matrix to help remember what is stored in it.

However, this vector is not yet part of the star_wars_matrix . Add this vector as a new column to the matrix and assign the result to a new matrix.", "To add a column, you can use cbind() .

Since matrices are two dimensional, a comma is needed to separate the rows and columns. For example:", "To select all elements of a row, no number is needed after the column.
