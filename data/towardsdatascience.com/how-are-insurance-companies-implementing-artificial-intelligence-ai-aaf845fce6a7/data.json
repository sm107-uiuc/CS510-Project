Still, the industry has made significant progress in AI implementation, although we are still in the early days. In this article we will look at:", "At its simplest, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a set of computerized tools designed to achieve objectives that usually require human intelligence.", "From a business perspective, AI can be used to conduct operations in a faster, cheaper and more accurate way. AI can help automate labor intensive processes, leading to lower costs and saved time. AI can also be used to understand customers better \u2014 companies can use AI to analyze the data they have on customers to predict customer behavior, understand preferences and optimize price and product offerings.", "AI is comprised of many related technologies, some of which are:", "There are many more subsets of AI, but the key takeaways are:", "Insurance is an old and highly regulated industry. Perhaps because of this, insurance companies have been slower to embrace technological change compared to other industries. Insurance is still steeped in manual, paper-based processes that are slow and require human intervention. Even today, customers are faced with time-consuming paperwork and bureaucracy when getting a claim reimbursed or signing up for a new insurance policy. Customers may also end up paying more for insurance because policies are not tailored for their unique needs. In an age when most of our daily activities are online, digitized and convenient, insurance is not always a happy customer experience.", "That said, we are starting to see a global push by insurance companies to augment their technological capabilities so that they can do business faster, cheaper and more securely. In the past few years, there have been some prominent examples of insurers investing heavily in Artificial Intelligence solutions.", "McKinsey estimates a potential annual value of up to $1.1 trillion if AI tech is fully applied to the Insurance industry. Of this, the business areas that can benefit the most are:", "There are many examples of how insurers around the world are implementing AI to improve their bottom line as well as the customer experience. There are also numerous startups that are providing AI solutions for insurers and customers. I will cover a few interesting cases here.", "In a world where the cost and complexity of health insurance is increasing, Accolade Inc\u2019s Maya Intelligence platform uses machine learning to help patients and employers select the most relevant and cost effective health insurance coverage. Accolade reportedly serves over 1.1 million clients.", "British firm Kirontech claims that its software KironMed uses machine learning to analyze medical claims and detect patterns that may signify health insurance fraud or waste (underutilized services). The company has reportedly raised $3.5 million in Series A funding.", "In 2018, SwissRe and Max Bupa Health entered into a partnership with Indian fitness tech startup GOQii Health. GOQii uses data from wearable devices and their own AI-driven \u2018wellness engine\u2019 to track health vitals and provide healthy living advice and risk reports to individual users. When partnering with or acquiring these AI and tech-driven startups, insurers are betting that it will lead to fewer claim payouts and more attractive premiums for health insurance customers down the line.", "As far back as 2017, US insurer Liberty Mutual unveiled a new developer portal through its innovation incubator Solaria Labs. This open API portal combines public data with proprietary insurance data to enable the creation of better insurance products for customers. One such product was reportedly a mobile app that allows drivers involved in accidents to assess damage to their car in real-time using their smartphone camera. The app would also provide repair cost estimates. The AI powering the app will be trained using thousands of images of car accidents.", "Ant Financial, the Chinese fintech firm part of the Chinese giant Alibaba Group, released software called Ding Sun Bao to analyze car accident damage and process claims. Ding Sun Bao uses machine vision, enabling drivers to take pictures of their damaged car using their smartphone camera. The app then compares the photo with its image database to determine the severity of damage, estimate repair costs, and analyze the accident\u2019s impact on the driver\u2019s future insurance premiums. Crucially, Ant Financial claims that the app assesses damages and handles claims in six seconds, whereas human claims adjusters reportedly take around six minutes and 48 seconds.", "US insurer Allstate partnered with the Earley Information Science (EIS) agency to develop a virtual assistant called ABIe (pronounced \u2018Abbie\u2019). ABIe was designed to answer common queries of Allstate\u2019s insurance agents who had switched from selling one insurance product to another. ABIe uses natural language processing to process 25,000 inquiries per month.", "When switching between product lines, many sales agents faced a steep learning curve and Allstate found that its call centers were inundated with questions from their own sales agents on new products. This led to long wait times at call centers for actual customers, which resulted in potentially lost business opportunities. Solutions like ABIe can potentially make a huge difference.", "AI has the potential to transform the insurance experience for customers from frustrating and bureaucratic to something fast, on-demand, and more affordable. Tailor-made insurance products will attract more customers at fairer prices. If insurers apply AI tech to the mountain of data at their disposal, we will soon start to see more flexible insurance such as on-demand pay-as-you-go insurance, and premiums that automatically adjust in response to accidents, customer health, etc.", "We will see insurance become more personalized, because insurers using AI tech will be able to understand better what their customers need. Insurers will be able to realize cost savings by speeding up workflows. They will also discover new revenue streams as AI-driven analysis opens up new business and cross-selling opportunities.", "Most importantly, the AI solutions described above can make it easier for customers to interact with insurance companies. This could result in people being more likely to purchase insurance.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "AI consultant & educator.
