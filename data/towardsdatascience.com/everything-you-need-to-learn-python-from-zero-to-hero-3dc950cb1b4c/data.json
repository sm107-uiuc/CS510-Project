It\u2019s always great to learn skills from books, as they are trustworthy and compact. I find books for programming and coding better to be an ebook so that it\u2019s easier to reference and use. Here are a few I find great for learning Python.", "This constitutes the fundamentals of Python, from installing and setting up python to writing full-blown programs with classes and functions (OOP)", "These consist of more advanced concepts and teach you how to write pythonic code along with projects and applications.", "For a more concise and detailed list, check out this article.", "Online Courses are just like university education, but one that you get entirely free. The rise in MOOCs has been very beneficial towards the communities who are less financially-apt and provides myriads of new opportunities that were once impossible due to the shackles of poverty.

Here are some great courses for Python that I know of.", "Other websites like Dataquest.io, Codeacademy, Educative.io, pluralsight, and Udemy are great courses and has concise pathways for beginners to follow through easily, but they\u2019re pretty pricey so it really depends on prefrence.", "YouTube is one of the great platforms that resulted from the creation of the Internet, even with its abundance of misinformation, click baits, and heaps of advertisements.

Though it\u2019s used in coding interviews is not a realistic representation of the capabilities of a programmer (with enough practice, one can eventually memorize the answers for the challenges), it\u2019s great for building the habit of programming and helps you measure your current ability.", "For more coding challenges websites, check out my article on the top 20 websites for coding challenges.", "Blogs and websites are the pockets of information on the internet, like books in libraries. There are tons of programmers and veterans who give amazing explanations and illuminating insights on programming, along with tutorials and documentation.

Here\u2019s a collection of python resources online", "Podcasts are a free ticket to listen in on conversations and discussions of experts, albeit the occasional sponsorship ads in between.

Picking up a new skill could translate to more job opportunities for you.", "The most important thing about learning online is about focus and attention, both of which are highly being capitalized by social media, streaming services, and that app where people dance a lot.
