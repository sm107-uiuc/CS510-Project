At the time, little did I know that we were on the brink of one of the worse financial crisis in recent history, as well as a monumental event in US politics.", "Some time later in 2009, I met a finance graduate at a university function in Melbourne who, upon asking what I did, remarked about Renaissance Technologies or RenTech, for short. He started painting a picture of the secretive, unorthodox hedge fund that hired no one with finance degree; only STEM graduates, preferably in the hard sciences, such as physics and mathematics. It sounded like a cult of modern day financial alchemists huddled in an office building somewhere in Long Island, New York.", "I was fascinated: here was a hedge fund that didn\u2019t operate like most funds, and did all their trading in an automated, dispassionate manner with minimal human intervention. The story really spoke to me because I\u2019ve always had an obsession with predicting the future, whether it\u2019s in trading or otherwise, and building machines that help us to do that more effectively (at that point, I had no idea I would start a career in data science).", "Again, the name Jim Simons came up.", "The graduate mentioned that I should apply after my PhD dissertation was completed. At the time, academic research still remained something close to my heart, so I never did take a chance on being a quant. Money wasn\u2019t all that important as solving challenging problems and advancing the pool of knowledge of humankind. Or so I thought to myself.", "So it was interesting that a little more than a decade later, I would see Jim Simons and RenTech popping up in my Twitter feed, with Medallion, their flagship fund\u2019s record on display in the tweet, with a brilliant 66% year-on-year compounded annual return before fees (39% after fees). That subsequently led me to Gregory Zuckerman\u2019s account of Jim Simons, RenTech and the brilliant and colorful cast of characters that made RenTech what it is today.", "The story of RenTech and their phenomenal returns is interesting from a data science perspective, because it was one of the first hedge funds to apply similar tools we have today, such as machine learning, to the markets. Here are some lessons that we can extract from this wonderfully written book.", "By the definition of a model, since it is a compressed representation of reality, it can only approximate reality at best. The question is, how far away from reality is it?", "In the so-called hard sciences, the models have high predictive accuracy. Newtonian models of mechanics and gravitation (superseded by General Relativity) works very well, such that we can launch rockets and probes into space with relatively high precision. Moreover, the physical models we rely on today to help us launch rockets is not expected to change several thousand years into the future. That\u2019s due to the beauty of natural processes: gravity in our corner of the galaxy is going to essentially work in the same way as another far-flung corner of the universe. There is a stochastic stability in natural processes.", "Not so when modelling human activity on the market. We just don\u2019t have as much clean data on how the market behaves (although that has changed quite a bit in recent times), and neither do we have as many observations, since the stock market only goes back about a hundred years or so.", "Naturally, we should have a healthy dose of scepticism about the models we build.", "In the book, we were provided with examples of competitors. RenTech was not the only firm that used quantitative methods in trading. One other competing fund was Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), founded by John W. Meriwether in 1994, and had luminaries such as Myron S. Scholes (of the famed Black-Scholes equation) and Robert Merton, two Nobel Prize winners in economics. Unlike RenTech, researchers at LTCM believed their models reflected the truth. Little did they know that their absolute trust in their models would be their undoing later in 1998, losing all their money despite initial impressive gains.", "In contrast, when faced with the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008, Jim Simons overrode the system by selling to minimize the damage, despite protests from his team. Additionally, he hedged the fund with oil put options before the first Gulf War in the 90s. In other words, there was still some decision being made based on human guided intuition. During extreme times, models can fail and human judgement is still needed.", "LTCM\u2019s woes were also compounded by their excessive use of leverage, as touched upon by Ed Thorp, which could range from 30-to-1 up to 100-to-1, beyond what was recommended by the Kelly criterion. There is nothing wrong with using leverage; RenTech used leverage too. But when your judgement is incorrect, and worse yet, you have a false confidence that you are correct by assuming that you know the truth, leverage cuts into your profits deeply.", "The key here is consistency and reproducibility. Models in physics consistently predict accurately over and over again, and their results can be reproduced. In contrast, models in trading, and typically those that deal with human behavior, are not going to be as consistent. New products and features, for example, can affect consumer behavior and sentiment unexpectedly, including the use of the product in unintended ways.", "Sometimes, human judgment is needed when the landscape changes drastically due to unusual circumstances not captured by a model. It is also then doubly important to know the limits of a model, as well as the assumptions that went into it.", "Moreover, as data scientists, it is our responsibility is to manage expectations about the models we build, and to caution stakeholders about the limitations of our tools.", "Like many other data engineers, scientists and analysts around the world, I face data problems on a daily basis. From missing data to wrongly modelled data to a distribution mismatch between training and production data, I\u2019ve seen them all throughout my career.", "Cleaning, checking if the data makes sense, and writing tests on data (collectively data janitorial duties as I call it) isn\u2019t the sexiest part of the job. Look, I get it. Data science is supposed to be the sexiest job of the 21st century. It\u2019s supposed to be fun and glamorous, like booting up a cluster of Tesla V100s training a StyleGAN to generate lifelike fake fashion models for a sales catalogue. Basically, it\u2019s the hidden side of data science that does not get public relations press.", "As downstream consumers of data producers in any company, there will always be imperfections in data simply because there are many more ways of things going wrong than going right. There are UI/UX changes that aren\u2019t communicated to the data team, which happened once in my career. There are changes made to a schema no one was aware of, besides the author. A product feature gets deprecated, causing a model\u2019s accuracy to significantly dip. A server outage causes missing events. Even at mature data-driven companies such as Google, these problems still do exist in various teams and parts of the product.", "In fact, being a data janitor, I mean, purist, is actually one of, if not, the most important part of the job. If you want your models to predict accurately, they\u2019d better be given the right patterns in the first place. The oft-mentioned garbage in-garbage out rule applies!", "In the early days, Jim Simons and his team faced the same problems. There were gaps in commodity price data. A good central database of financial and pricing data did not even exist then.", "Fortunately, the team had a mathematician named Sandor Strauss, who acted as their first data purist. It took a lot of effort on his part to seek out commodity data from Dunn & Hargitt, then catalogued and added them to other historic information. He checked for inconsistencies, got a student to perform data quality checks on the commodity prices Strauss collected, and painstakingly compared the prices he collected with other sources of information, such as yearbooks, and archives of the Wall St. Journal.", "It was Strauss\u2019s complete dedication and obsession to the task that made a huge difference. As the data got a lot cleaner, it opened up a lot more options, providing RenTech the ability to forecast and trade in finer time increments. This gave them an edge over other firms, garnering more profits. The other clean peripheral data Strauss collected later on turned out to be valuable in providing RenTech more of an edge, as the additional signals were added to their core model. All that painstaking investment in ensuring that their most important data stays clean and fresh paid dividends down the road.", "In RenTech\u2019s case, the data was produced by a market that was extremely chaotic, and the data was collected by third parties who don\u2019t always ensure the quality of the collected data.", "Fortunately, unlike RenTech, most of us can effect change in the places we work at, since we typically deal with data generated internally. We can advocate, educate and establish processes that ensure the data is as clean as possible. We can improve communication channels so that upstream changes are known well before-hand, if possible, even at the planning stage. We can convince the stakeholders to make cultural changes to improve data collection and analytics throughout the product. It will never be perfect, but the goal is to minimize data problems rather than eradicate them completely.", "Who knows? Some of these data may open up new avenues for product features in the future, just like it did for RenTech.", "We even have more tools than ever before to provide data quality checks. One of my favourite tools of late is the Data Build Tool or dbt, which definitely made a difference by introducing checks and balances to data quality at Canva.", "One of the prevailing issues in investing is the attachment of a false narrative to explain price changes in the market.", "We human beings love stories. We try to find an explanation for just about anything. We hear of why the market went up a certain day or not in the media. Perhaps it\u2019s the latest change in national employment data. Perhaps it\u2019s a butterfly flapping its wings in a corner of the world. The truth is, no one can absolutely know for certain; if someone claims to do so, that person is either delusional, or a liar attempting to sell you a product.", "The fundamental question we should ask ourselves, though, is that does it matter if we know what the cause is?", "In trading, the causal factors need not necessarily be known. What matters, however, is if a potential signal discovered from the data is profitable. In this sense, the predictions are only constrained to the task at hand, that is, to maximize the probability of a profitable trade; clearly this fits the discriminative model . While correlations do not equal causation, they do reflect aspects of the cause, and are often good enough to be used in the prediction task. Machine learning is really just exploiting a lot of weak correlations together, and trying to reverse engineer the causes that led to this from the model is a fool\u2019s errand.", "Bear in mind though, RenTech, according to the book, only has barely more than a 50% success rate per trade, but they make it up by the sheer volume of trades, as well as position sizing. We can see that prediction accuracy matters, but how the predictions are fed into the decision process profoundly impacts the final result.", "In my recent work on predicting retention at Canva, it was very tempting for me to attach a story as to why some customers retain and others don\u2019t on our subscription product. An algorithm such as XGBoost may provide feature importance scores, but it will never be able to pinpoint the underlying hidden causation factors. In my use-case, however, it is less important that I find out what the causes are, but rather it is more instructive for me to develop a model that does its intended job well: help decide which users need aid in understanding our product.", "Understanding the root causes of retention versus churn will require additional external sources of data and domain knowledge, such as qualitative surveys and social media sentiment, or new techniques such as causal machine learning and interpretable machine learning.", "Admittedly, this is more challenging in the present climate of personal rights to data, with implementations of the law such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the consumer\u2019s right for an explanation of predictions made about them. We can, however, mitigate this by always being explicit about the training data, the assumptions that went into the model, and proper versioning of the models to keep a running record of the past.", "The story of RenTech and Jim Simons is a fascinating tale. Although Zuckerman\u2019s book could not provide much more detail into the inner workings of RenTech given how secretive it is, the glimpses we have are enough to provide us with much needed lessons for data science. The issues that they faced decades ago are essentially the same issues we face today.", "Perhaps one of the most interesting lessons is one that has nothing to do with data science: Jim Simons started his trading career at the ripe age of 41 years. If there\u2019s anything we can take away from that, it is that it\u2019s never too late to start something new!", "Edit: a previous version mentioned that Jim Simons is a Nobel laureate.", "Machine learning engineer at Canva. I work on computer vision and churn modelling.
