While looking into some of the common regression and classification algorithms utilized in the field, I looked for practical use cases for each approach. One of the most common and approachable methods, the k-nearest neighbors algorithms, is commonly used in the recommendation engines that recommend us products, learn our media consumption habits, and work to keep us clicking, consuming, and purchasing. I was intrigued to find out more about how this works and decided to take a deeper look.", "Okay, so what is a recommendation engine? It can be defined as a series of algorithms used to cultivate relevant products or content to users based on user past behavior. When past behavior is unavailable, engines can default to generalized recommendations based on overall user data or the profit concerns of the company. We have all probably felt a little creeped out by the user tracking that follows us everywhere and is just a little too in-tune with our wants and needs. There\u2019s a fine line between good recommendations and an overbearing user experience, but having an effective recommendation engine will often improve user experience and translate to increased sales.", "Recommendation engines can work in a few ways. Simple recommenders will follow overall trends and keep users tuned into general demand for their product. More sophisticated engines will use user feedback \u2013 by way of submission feedback or organic user behavior tracked online \u2013 to segment users into profiles. After segmenting the user base into profiles, new users can be plotted against existing users to be classified into one of those profiles. Similar users who fit the same profiles will likely enjoy similar recommendations.", "Okay, so what\u2019s k-nearest neighbors go to do with this? Well k-nearest neighbors is a classification and regression algorithm that plots an entire training dataset and analyzes the distance between data points. We can look at the distance as a similarity score which allows us to identify the most similar data points to any one plotted point. A simple way to generate this distance value is to calculate the Euclidian distance between points by squaring the difference between each pair of data points, summing the squares, and then finding the square root of that sum.", "As with any simple approach, this has drawbacks. Specifically with feedback like user ratings, Euclidian distance will overlook nuances in user feedback like overall range in ratings per user. If User 1 rates very favorably and User 2 very critically, their ratings aren\u2019t necessarily uncorrelated. Euclidean distance cannot correct for this and will see their scores as being quite different. The Pearson correlation score can correct for this by graphing all user ratings to a line to look for correlation rather than similarity in value. This allows for a more nuanced similarity score.", "Another major drawback of using k-nearest neighbors is that it can be computationally expensive to run. The algorithm utilizes the full training set and that can amount to massive amounts of data being manipulated at any given time. One way that you can offset this is to create pre-generated lookup tables to streamline computations and improve performance.", "There are a multitude of technologies (and alternate methods) that can be used to build a recommendation engine. To no surprise given its popularity amongst data scientists, Python is the most commonly recommended language for working with data in this way because of its many useful libraries. However, the LibRec in Java can also work well. The problem could also be approached with graph theory. For this approach, GraphQL and Neo4j are commonly recommended.", "But how would we build a simple recommender using euclidean distance and k-nearest neighbors? As a first attempt, I built out a simple comedy recommender in vanilla JS.", "First you\u2019ll need to collect some data. For my purposes, I randomly generated user ratings for a set of comedians. (So, keep in mind\u2026 these recommendations will only be as valid as the randomly generated ratings happen to be!)", "I set up a listener on my HTML rating submission form that would collect all the user submitted ratings and corresponding comedians. I sent that data collection into my findNearestNeighbors function. This uses a helper function to find the Euclidian Distance between the new user\u2019s data and all the user data in my dataset. It will generate the 5 nearest neighbors to the new dataset and send an object of those neighbors \u2014 along with the new user\u2019s ratings \u2014 to my recommendNewComedians function.", "Finally, we look at the five nearest neighbors and average out their scores for each comedian that new user is unfamiliar with. This data is then sorted and the five highest scored new comedians are added to a recommendations object which will be used to render results to the user.", "Now we can provide expected ratings based on the nearest neighbor ratings. To be more thorough, you would likely want to do weighted averages, weighing the closest neighbor as a more meaningful response. For this example, I just worked with a simple average of scores.", "It\u2019s probably easiest to consider recommendations in terms of ratings and reviews, but this same process can be used for any sort of user feedback you receive. Imagine valuing user interactions so you could use them for calculations. If a user in an e-commerce platform visits the same product multiple times, adds a product to cart, or makes a purchase, that indicates a positive association with that product. Whereas closing out of a recommendation is a clear indication of negative association. These kinds of scores can be manipulated in the same way to make recommendations based on organic feedback.", "Your home for data science.
