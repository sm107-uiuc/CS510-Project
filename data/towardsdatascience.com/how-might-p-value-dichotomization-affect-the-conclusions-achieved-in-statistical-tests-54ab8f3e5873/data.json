There is an acknowledgement about the need to enforce measures to reduce the estimated number of false positives being outputted in current and future studies. However, there is disagreement about the best strategy to achieve this objective. Strategies range from more voluntary and idealistic ones to more restrictive and pragmatic ones.", "A hot debate in this achievement of more reproducible results has been the lowering or even the removal of the typical 0.05 cutoff of univariate tests (here an introduction to the debate). A typical statistical univariate analysis consists of the calculus of the p-value in a univariate test (e.g. Student\u2019s t-test between cases and controls) for each feature of a dataset. From dozens of features, some features with significant p-values are observed as they are below the cutoff. Then, a story is elaborated which concords with the significant differences found in these features according to the factor analyzed.", "This strategy acknowledges that some false positives and negatives might be produced during this dichotomization of p-values in significant ones and non-significant ones. How different are actually the results in a feature with p=0.049 and the results another one with p=0.051? Intuitively, differences are negligible. However, I sense there is a tacit understanding that a certain arbitrary limit is necessary to remove non-informative data so results (and explanations of these results) can be much easier to be understood by potential readers. To avoid paralysis by analysis, basically.", "I understand this need to simplify. However, I believe there is a current lack of comprehension of how much might conclusions be altered by this simplification. I found interesting to explore how much less reproducible results can be because of the dichotomization of p-values. For this purpose, I used a metabolomics dataset of 113 samples (57 control samples and 56 case samples) and 46 features. On the next table, I show the 10 features with lowest p-value with their associated t-statistic (an absolute value above 1.96 means a p-value below 0.05):", "So we have 7 features with significant differences. With these 7 features, we generate a nice story of how these differences are explained by the factor studied and we have an article.", "But what happens if we simulate data with same properties to the ones of the dataset analyzed? t-tests study the differences between the mean of two sets of samples with normal distribution taking into account the number of samples and the standard deviation in each set. If we simulate data with same traits, we should observe similar results in t-tests. This simulated data should be an optimal representation of the data found in later studies trying to replicate the same effect.", "This is the comparison of the 46 t-statistics (one for each feature) estimated in the original dataset and the simulated dataset:", "When simulating data with same distribution, the simulated data will not be exactly the same than the original one. The slightly different dataset generated explains the slightly different t-statistics observed.", "However, the high correlation between the t-statistic in the original dataset and the simulated dataset is worsened when we dichotomize p-values. The red lines on the left figure below indicate us the 1.96 limit which discriminates between significant and not-significant results. We can observe that there are some values higher than 1.96 in the simulated dataset and lower than 1.96 in the original dataset. Consequently, there will be several more significant p-values in the simulated dataset. On the right figure below, we can observe better the effect of the dichotomization (0=non-significant; 1=significant). This dichotomization generates a comparison between the simulated and the original dataset of worse quality.", "The generation of these different significant and non-significant results helps us understand better the nature of p-hacking, the set of practices destined to maximize the number of significant p-values. Usually, we associate p-hacking with a malevolent face trying to distort the data as much as possible to generate a higher number of significant p-values. Nevertheless, we need to understand that replicates of data with same distribution can generate a much different number of significant p-values. This is the density plot of the number of significant p-values found in the 1000 iterations of simulated data:", "So, without distorting the data but just looking to \u201creplicated data\u201d after processing, we might find a different number of p-values. The range of possible actions to improve the data quality helps accidentally find a configuration that maximizes the generation of significant p-values; we find a posteriori plausible explanations about how this maximization is generated rather by the data improvement than by throwing dices until getting the right combination. Minimization of involuntary p-hacking practice might require enforcing the restriction of data manipulation, a much profound explanation of the need to perform this manipulation or simply the removal of p-value dichotomization if not strictly necessary.", "When dichotomizing p-values, we are essentially turning numerical data into binary classification data. Consequently, we can develop an intuition of the false positives and negatives generated through classification performance metrics such as the area under the ROC curve (AUROC). This metric helps have an intuition of the capacity of a classification model to find true positives without generating false positives.", "Through AUROC, we can compare how the significant and non-significant p-values obtained in the original dataset are replicated in the statistical analyses in the simulated dataset. If we perform 1000 iterations of simulated data and analyze the AUROC value obtained, we obtain this density plot of the AUROC values obtained (it is \u201cAUROC value\u201d, not \u201cAUROC curve\u201d; sorry :)):", "Would you really believe in a model where classification between the predicted and the obtained classification is only slightly better than 0.7? This is how reproducible might be the significant p-values obtained in later studies with the same data distribution.", "When adjusting the p-values by Benjamini-Hochberg, no meaningful improvements are found (a spike in 1.00 values is found; however, this is an artefact related to the generation of a very low number of significant p-values).", "P-value adjustment helps deal with the number of tests performed but might not be able to help with how information is distorted by the conversion of a numerical variable into a binary one.", "This analysis of AUROC values in simulated should be another example of the possible pernicious consequences of p-value dichotomization to reproducible research.", "I believe that most researchers have at least some intuition about how much worsened is information after this dichotomization and how results might not become always reproduced in future studies. However, the intensity of this effect might be underrated because of the difficult interpretation of p-values and t-statistics. A possible better to understand this worsening might consist of showing the % of simulation iterations in which a feature had a significant p-value. The next table compares the p-value, the t-statistic and the % of the 1000 simulation iterations a p-value was significant:", "Why much more importance has to be given to feature 26 than to feature 11 when the significant differences of feature 26 might be only a 4.8% more reproduced in future studies?", "IMHO, a metric like the third one might enable a better understanding of the capacity of each feature to differentiate between case and control. It is easier to detect that three features might serve as single biomarkers to discriminate between case and control. In addition, several other features show a certain capacity to discriminate. However, this capacity seems partial and rather mediated by higher level mechanisms which might be analyzed through feature engineering (e.g., PCA) or multivariate analysis. It just does not make any sense trying to narrate a story based on several features which show a slightly better than 50% capacity to be reproduced in future data with similar distribution. Furthermore, the quality of the stories would be enhanced because of the need to be consistent with the partial differences also found for other features. Lastly, this reporting of other features with partial discrimination would reduce incentives to engage in p-hacking.", "My lack of proficiency with the statistical foundations behind these phenomena makes me prefer not falling into some presumptuous conclusion points. However, I have the intuition some progress could make be done so to ensure more robustness in the stories created to explain the results achieved. As an alternative, I deem necessary at least to help readers be more aware of the actual perspectives regarding the reproducibility of results in later studies.", "Your home for data science.
