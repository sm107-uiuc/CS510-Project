Never mind, I\u2019m back on track and plan to keep up with my regular dose of knowledge and findings. So, let us begin!", "I was reading about Data Science and came across an amazing set of articles which can potentially help us understand what Data Science is.", "Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google in 2010, commented that every two days, we are generating data equivalent to all data since start of civilization to the year 2003. \u2014 TechCrunch", "The data was of the order of 5 Exabytes (10 to the power 18). And today we\u2019ve outgrown ourselves as everything we do today (which is like most of our day surfing the web) leaves a data exhaust behind. The data is immensely useful as it houses information that can help us answer questions, help detect diseases and help drivers stay attentive during commute. The possibilities are limitless. So much so that a new class of engineers/scientists has emerged called the Data Scientists.", "Let us take a deep dive!", "Data can be collected in numerous ways and numerous forms. The locations you visit, the websites you browse, the temperature variation in the city, indices, geographical distribution and what not. And the most fascinating thing is that all this data has potential to be mined for resourceful information.", "In an article, The Economist states how the value of data has even surpassed the value of oil.", "Back in 2010, Google and other companies already realized how valuable data can be. Google was using analytics to do text conversion across multiple languages because the data said so. In 2011, LinkedIn worked on its \u201cPeople you may know\u201d feature that increased their click through rate by 30%. They did that by analyzing data such as a person\u2019s background like the school they studied in, places they worked and more. They also used the triangle closing method which states that if a person knows Joe and also knows Diana, there are high chances that Joe and Diana might also know one another. Furthermore, in many projects, the data lead to getting solutions to problems faster with only slight loss in accuracies.", "But data collection, data processing, analysis and more, is much more than what it seems on the surface. Sometimes there is data with no reference to what each value represents, sometimes data is an HTML page and extraction may be needed, sometimes there will be no structure across how the data is stored or retrieved in the first place. And even when you can find someway to get the data, the values may be missing, or even worse\u2026erroneous. The data format might require a special program to be read or used. There are many obstacles that need to be tackled properly and effectively to get value from data.", "To tackle these problems and actually draw insights, Data Science came into being.", "Data Science is the art of collecting data, processing it and then analyzing it to draw business insights which can then be explained to non-technical people. Just like the image above, data science is the juxtaposition of many things (chemicals if you may) such as computer science, mathematics, statistics, data mining, graphic design and human-computer interaction.", "A data scientist is a hybrid of data hacker, analyst, communicator, and trusted adviser. \u2014 Harvard Business Review", "However, the skills are far reaching. A data scientist needs to know languages like R (and now Python too) to work with data and do data wrangling. To process Big Data, they need to know how to work with Hadoop or technologies based on it. Cloud computing skills are essential to distribute the intensive data wrangling process on multiple clusters/servers. Furthermore, skills such as graphic designing and good communication are key to a Data Scientist\u2019s success. These allow him/her to clearly explain the insights and the probable causes of why something occurs. These skills enable Data Scientists (and aspiring ones like me too) to find patterns in our data. Now, that\u2019s powerful!! We can do so much now including data collection, processing, storage, modification, analysis, modeling and more.", "While many believe and practice Machine Learning for majority of their work as part of a Data Scientist, this is not actually true. Once you enter academia where you start working with your own data, the data itself becomes a problem. How to collect the data? What to collect? If this is a new approach, what to keep and what to discard? What metadata may be required? Is the data of good quality? These questions help us reflect on the fact that a data scientist plays many roles right from problem identification to data collection and wrangling to drawing insights.", "In practice and in theory, there are no correct answers. As George Box said, \u201cAll models are wrong but some are useful\u201d. Data Science is an art where you try and experiment till you find the results with good enough accuracy. The data and its processing is all relative to the problem and cannot be standardized.", "We are all at the center of Data Science. Yes, you, me and everyone else. The sites we browse, the locations we visit, the things we buy, the diseases we have \u2014 all contribute to data. This is the data that allows Data Scientists to do cool stuff.", "The area of Data Science has grown far and wide. There are websites like Kaggle that allow users all across the globe to get a taste of Data Science, compete and win prize money as well as learn from thousands of other. Companies have started exposing several services to allow Data Scientists to use them as they please such as GitHub API and others.", "We can now detect fraud, build self driving cars, identify diseases, classify between cats and dogs (if you really want to, trust me it\u2019s fun) and what not. The range of possible applications is limitless. The best part is that Data Science is not just limited to any specific field anymore. A person with a domain expertise in his/her own area can use Data Science to add value there. You may be a biologist, a physicist, a computer engineer, or a mathematician and you can still take up Data Science and make this world a better place.", "However, it\u2019s not all good for Data Science. Sometimes data collection can be identified as breach of privacy if proper authorization is not taken. This is a big deal as you don\u2019t really want to be tracked. In such scenarios, proper steps have to be taken. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation law which basically states that any resident of EU can ask any company operating there to delete his/her records. Such laws allow individuals to live their lives without worrying about their privacy.", "Data Science is a beautiful domain which has grown a lot in the past few years. We\u2019re doing amazing things today and plan to continue doing the same in the future. While the role may seem quite intensive, it\u2019s really fun to see your work create large impact.", "Do share your thoughts, ideas and suggestions. I\u2019d love to hear from you. You can also reach out to me on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data science and Machine learning enthusiast. Technical Writer. Passionate Computer Science Engineer."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
