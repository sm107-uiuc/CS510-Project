To understand the scope of influence and limitations of this statistic, we must establish a common understanding of what it is and what it isn\u2019t. In this light, let\u2019s start the discussion with an example that will help establish an intuitive understanding of it.", "A fundamental cornerstone of America\u2019s legal system is the presumption of innocence. The burden is on the state to prove guilt \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In civil cases, the burden of proof is much lower, with a standard known as \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d From a practical standpoint, we might interpret these burdens to mean 99% and 51% certainty levels, respectively. In practice, we can\u2019t usually quantify the strength of the evidence in this way, but let\u2019s pretend we can.", "By setting up hypothesis tests, we can assess the significance of each new piece of evidence. The null hypothesis, or default assumption, is that the evidence is meaningless; the alternative hypothesis is that the evidence is meaningful. We work backward, calculating the probability of the null hypothesis being true in light of the evidence. Consider an example from the classic movie, My Cousin Vinny.", "Vinny Gambini (Joe Pesci) is defending two clients accused of robbing a store and shooting the clerk. The evidence against them is primarily based on the testimony of three eyewitnesses who identified the defendants and their car. Under the presumption of innocence, how likely is it for three witnesses to incorrectly identify the suspects? The only way to explain that would be as Vinny describes it:", "Is it possible, the two defendants entered the store, picked 22 specific items off of the shelves, had the clerk take money, make change, then leave, then two different men, drive up in a similar looking car, go in, shoot the clerk, rob him, and then leave?", "It\u2019s not impossible, just very improbable. That\u2019s like a one in a million chance of bad luck. That one in a million chance is what we would call the p-value: it is the probability of finding observed evidence when the null hypothesis is true. The lower the p-value, the greater the significance of the evidence. The significance (or confidence level) is calculated as one minus the p-value. In this particular case, those values are:", "While prosecutors try to convince the jury that the p-value is low, the defendants\u2019 attorney will try to show that it\u2019s high.", "It is important to note here that the confidence level does not mean probability-of-guilt; that requires an assessment of the full body of evidence. As the defense presents its case, it aims to show that the evidence against its clients is much more plausible in a world where the client is innocent. As much as I would like to illustrate this with Vinny\u2019s superb cross-examinations, I don\u2019t want to spoil the movie for you if you haven\u2019t seen it! So, let\u2019s use a different example.", "Consider a crime scene wherein investigators found the defendant\u2019s DNA and fingerprints. If the defendant didn\u2019t commit the crime, it would be very improbable that such evidence would be found; so the p-value would be very low, and our confidence level in the evidence would be very high. But what if we later find out that the crime scene is the defendant\u2019s home? All of a sudden, the evidence is much more plausible; in fact, it would be weird if investigators didn\u2019t find such evidence in the suspect\u2019s own home. The p-value given the evidence goes up, and the confidence level goes down.", "From a scientific perspective, researchers act as prosecutors trying to prove the existence of a given phenomenon, such as the impact of CO2 levels on global average temperatures. The null hypothesis for any given experiment is that no relationship exists, and the alternative hypothesis is that higher CO2 levels result in higher temperatures. Unlike legal prosecutors, these researchers can precisely measure p-values, and the scientific community decides whether the results are significant enough to be added to the larger body of evidence. In other words, can the work get published?", "As one might expect, this creates an incentive for researchers to find higher confidence levels and lower p-values to justify and get paid for their work. The generally accepted confidence level for legitimate publication is 95% (a p-value of 5%). What happens when results are found to be significant only at the 94% confidence level?", "Giving up is not an option. And getting more data may be prohibitively expensive. This situation has the potential to lead to some unscrupulous behavior. When working with models that have hundreds or thousands of inputs, might it be possible to simply omit a few select features that are hurting the results? How would anyone ever know?", "The answer is simple: peer-review. Other groups of researchers replicate the work to verify the results, and as experts in their respective fields, they will be able to identify these types of shortcomings. Does this invalidate all results entirely? Not necessarily. There\u2019s no need to throw out the baby with the bathwater. There\u2019s just one problem: a vast majority of research funding goes to support new research, and very little goes to replication. According to the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine:", "Concerns about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research.", "The report does provide some viable options for dealing with this problem, but the more important point here is that the problem hasn\u2019t been solved yet.", "Does this mean that scientific studies are unreliable and can\u2019t be trusted? Absolutely not. Just because the challenge of replication and reproducibility hasn\u2019t been solved doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t ways of managing the problem. The National Academies study also points out that \u201cresearch synthesis and meta-analysis\u2026are valuable methods for assessing the reliability and validity of bodies of research.\u201d", "To understand the answer to this question, consider a game of darts with four players. This particular game is straightforward: the first person to hit the bullseye wins. Below is a chart that shows where the darts landed for each player:", "As we can see, each player has a high amount of bias in their throws, and none of them are likely to win the game any time soon. However, consider a spectator watching this game and studying how each player throws. By taking all biases into account, that person has a much higher chance of hitting the bullseye in a follow-up match.", "Meta-analyses work the same way. By performing an evaluation on a large subset of studies on a given topic, taking all biases into account, we can build models that provide sufficient approximations of reality. However, these approximations often come with higher degrees of variance in the results, so while they are helpful, they are not a permanent solution.", "It is worth noting here that p-hacking isn\u2019t always intentional. If a particular data point makes the results less reliable, is that data point itself actually valid? Or is it just noise that should be omitted anyway? The answer is simple: it depends. Who is going to use this research? Is this a variable that can be controlled in future experiments? Are we trying to understand historical data or build a tool for the future? These are not easy questions to answer. Suddenly, the researcher has to act like a business-person trying to make a decision that best satisfies all relevant stakeholders.", "One way to go about this would be to deliberately hack the p-value, then go back to understand how the applicability of results might be limited. These limitations must be sufficiently documented in the results to avoid misuse. Unfortunately, such nuance is often lost by the time the findings make their way to consumer-facing media publications. Even then, there\u2019s no guarantee the researcher has adequately accounted for the full scope of limitations.", "Setting aside the issue of p-hacking for a moment, there is one other thing to be aware of: p-values can help us understand if a relationship exists between variables, but they do not tell us anything about the strength of those relationships.", "Consider a recent analysis I conducted on the impact of state gun laws on homicide rates. As part of the initial data review, I wanted to know if the grades assigned by the Giffords Law Center were sufficiently correlated with homicide rates. With a p-value of 0.14% (confidence level: 99.86%), it was clear that a relationship existed. Just one problem: look at what happens when we graph the grades and homicide rates in a scatterplot.", "It is clear that as the grade gets higher, the homicide rate drops, but there are a lot of exceptions. To quantify the strength of the relationship, we use the r-squared score. This score tells us what percentage of the variance in homicide rates can be explained by state gun laws. Here, the r-squared value is a mere 6.73%.", "I can see the headlines already: \u201cNew Study Finds Gun Laws Over 99% Effective.\u201d No! That\u2019s not what I said! Overreliance on the p-value for broadcasting results without proper consideration of other metrics often leads to widespread misuse of research.", "There is nothing inherently wrong with p-values. They are a valuable tool to help us understand the significance of our evidence. However, overreliance on a single metric or a single study to support broader hypotheses is dangerous. Consumers of such research must keep a broader perspective, and media outlets must refrain from sensationalizing the results of any individual study. Ultimately, p-values are useful tools, but it is up to us to make sure we are using that tool properly.", "Your home for data science.
