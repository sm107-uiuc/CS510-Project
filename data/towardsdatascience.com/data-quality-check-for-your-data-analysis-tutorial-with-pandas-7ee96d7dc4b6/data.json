The topics will cover units of analysis, missing values, duplicated records, Is your data makes sense, and truth changing over time.", "The tutorial will be written in the pandas library. The most famous data manipulation library in python.", "You start your analysis with 2 data frames. Transaction and customer data sets. When you work further, you have to merge both of them. That\u2019s when you should be careful.", "The following snippet is the basic merge method from thepandas library.", "No matter what order you join the data set, the result will be at a transaction level. As you can see, the shape of a resulted data frame remains at the ten rows, equal to the transaction data frame.", "The unit of analysis changes from the customer level to the transaction level.", "You have to keep in mind this behavior. It could happen anytime during the analysis. If you want to summarize some number, you have to genuinely know what the unit of analysis your data frame is.", "What if you still want to analyze the customer level? You can even do it with the aggregation of the transaction data. You have to wrap the transaction up to the customer level before merging them. Otherwise, it will be returned the smallest granularity of the data.", "Sometimes, after merging the data frame, you may lose some transactions. It leads to the wrong conclusion for your report.", "You should often check your target's summary number from a data quality perspective, like the sum of your total revenue. If the number is inconsistent, you can still track the reason behind them before it\u2019s too late.", "Here is the summary of the missing value type in the pandas data frame. Please be reminded that the look of missing value could change based on the library or framework you use. Like aspark, there has a different way to treat the missing value.", "One important thing here is that not every kind of missing data can be detected by the default method of apandas library. If the missing value has been encoded as an empty string or arbitrary value.", "You need the metadata or data owner expert to clarify what kind of value they treat as a missing value. Guessing by yourself can lead to another mistake.", "Let\u2019s see the impact of containing the missing data within your data frame. If you don\u2019t take care of it, it can backfire you without warning.", "For example, I would like to count the number of distance values in the following data frame. I can use the method value_counts provided by the pandas library.", "Everything looks good now. But where is the missing value we see in the mock-up data figure?", "By default, there is a dropna argument that controls the behavior of this function. You have to explicitly pass it to the function to make it return the missing value as well.", "The behavior depends on the data manipulation library/framework you use. You have to keep in mind and often try checking about it.", "What if you present the above conclusion without knowing there are almost 50% of data missing? That could change your whole final decision.", "Pro tips: some other methods/functions treat missing values differently. Like the pivot table, it will neglect the missing value out of the returned result. Often check the summary number (like total records, rows) will help you a lot here.", "Duplication can occur in several ways. The following data frame shows you the full duplication (record number 0 and 4) and partial duplication (record number 0, 4, and 5 for cust_id, time, and member_card)", "It\u2019s easy to detect what row is duplicated by calling the duplicated() method", "Also, you can detect partial duplication by specifying your target columns.", "If you know what level you would not want the duplication. Simply call the drop_duplicates method to drop those rows.", "For partial duplication, you have to pass specific columns name to the method like the following example.", "One thing to keep in mind is that you have to know the duplication level you want to detect, whether full or partial duplication.", "Duplication can be hidden under the data set due to the data source system. Slice and dice your data and see the summary number could help you identify the duplication.", "For example, your summary number maybe doubled from the operation report. You can suspect some duplicated occurred in your data set, leading to the increasing summary number.", "Dealing with duplication in low-dimensional feature space is easier for analysts. You should try defining the useful column and remove those unnecessary ones.", "Sometimes, duplication happens with business logic. If the entrance and exit date are the same, and the value column is Null, You can drop this transaction form analysis because it will be duplicated.", "No matter the pandas method can detect something like this. Your curiosity is the only thing you can rely on.", "This is a hard topic to show you an example in the tutorial because the complex data cannot be illustrated here. But I will try my best.", "Let\u2019s start with the following data frame. You can see that for the age column. Some values don\u2019t make any sense. The age should be more than 0 and maybe not exceed 122 (the oldest person who lived in the world was 122 years old).", "This is a simple example of is your data makes sense. In the real operation, there could be any other values such as the sales, revenue, number of customers, number of employees, etc.", "You should have a Benchmark, which could be a daily/monthly report from the operation. The metrics/KPI they are usually tracking. The number of your data set of the conclusion should not deviate from that number much.", "It\u2019s difficult for you to familiar with all the baseline metrics from the start.", "The more time you spend with the data, the more understanding you can derive from it.", "The good thing takes time, keep going, and you will be an expert with it!", "Real experience: I have to validate and check the quality of data before analysis. Sometimes, It\u2019s not about the summary is close to the operation. I have to compare transaction by transaction to see the difference between the data that I pull from the system and the one that the business team exported.", "You have to find the reason behind any changes to support your report's validity. You may find something missing from the current operation and make it more valid for the company-wide.", "Besides, is your data makes sense. This is another topic that is hard to demonstrate with the tutorial.", "I provide 2 data frames here, which are the customer data frame from 2020-12-05 and 2021-01-05 . It\u2019s one month difference in time. And you can see that the data in row number 7 has some change. age increases from 42 to 43 and wealth_segment changes from medium to rich. It\u2019s still the same customer with the cust_id = z .", "If you are analyzing at a different time, you will get a different result. To solve this problem, we can use the process_date column as a time reference for your data.", "Unfortunately, it depends on your data system, whether it keeps the historical data or not. If the table only contains the latest data, you need to dump it at the analysis time and save it somewhere for later use.", "The problem here is that nobody can reproduce your analysis if they can\u2019t access your backup data. It can make your conclusion unreliable if the other parties try to query the same way you did with the newer data.", "In some applications, you only need the latest data. But, trust me, the historical one is also important as well for other applications.", "If your company use only the latest data without storing the historical, I recommend you to initiate this issue with the data engineering team to make some improvement to your data lake system.", "We have gone so far from the starting point. You see many examples with code for detecting the data quality problem. There are some that you have to figure with a more complicated method.", "You can improve the concept you found here by creating a library or framework to capture your data abnormality. You can also use the provided snippets for making a monitoring and alerting system if the system captures unexpected things.", "The possibility is limitless. Here is only the first step.", "You can find the code of this tutorial in Google COLAB", "if you like this article and would like to see something like this more.", "Your home for data science.
