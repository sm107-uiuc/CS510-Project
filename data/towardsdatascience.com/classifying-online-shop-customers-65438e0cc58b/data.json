With features aggregated from the raw data, such as the number of visits and number of page views, forecast models are trained and visualized.", "Special attention is paid to the visual presentation of the forecast models with the help of 2-D plots and coloring of the decision boundaries. The peculiarities of the different methods become apparent as well as situations with under- and over-adjustment of the models. To make visualization possible, I consider very simplified models with only two features.", "Let\u2019s load the raw data from a CSV file. These are from the Kaggle data set https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store. It is the same data source I used in my article about segmentation and visualization:", "For the presentation and analysis, I use only a part of the data.", "These are 1,000,000 data records on product pages of an online shop with characteristics such as product category, brand, price, user session id, and more.", "For further processing of the data, we form a data frame which aggregates the data of individual anonymous visitors and calculates the number of page views and visits to the online shop. Furthermore, the number of purchased items is calculated for each visitor, and thus a label is created whether the customer is a buyer or not.", "To simplify the presentations in the following, the data of some visitors was removed from the analysis.", "This provides us with data from 121 visitors to the webshop.", "Before we start the analysis, let\u2019s look at a 2-D plot of the visitors, which uses the number of visits and page views as axes. Whether a buyer or not is represented by a color code. The library \u201cPlotly\u201d (https://plotly.com/) is used for the plots.", "The red and green dots are mostly concentrated in certain areas of this \u201cfeature space\u201d. In the following, we try to create classification models that correctly identify visitors as buyers based on their position in the features space.", "In order to be able to visualize the models and their predictions, we need an auxiliary function that also draws the decision boundaries in the 2-D plot. After training the models, the function performs a classification forecast for a narrow grid of points, and then uses this information to color the areas according to the forecast.", "For the implementation of the classification models, we use the library \u201cScikit Learn\u201d (https://scikit-learn.org/). We consider the different methods including the parameters with our visualization function.", "A Bayesian classifier is a classifier derived from the Bayesian theorem. It assigns each object to the class to which it most probably belongs. Formally, it is a mathematical function that assigns a class to each point in a feature space.", "The Naive Bayes classifier is very popular because of its fast computability. The naive basic assumption is that the attributes are independent. In our example this is not fulfilled, the number of page views depends on the number of visits.", "As the following graphic shows, the quality of the result is also modest. The classifier only roughly delimits the areas of the red and green dots. Many points are in the wrong areas.", "We start with a linear support vector classification. With a linear kernel, the best possible separation is realized by a straight line. In the figure, you can see how the straight line is laid to keep the distance to the points near the classification boundary as large as possible. The possibilities of such linear models to define complex areas are naturally limited.", "In the variant with a polynomial kernel, a polynomial is used up to the specified degree as a separation. The figure shows the use of polynomials up to degree 4, which gives the method more possibilities to adapt to the data.", "If the degree is set high, more complex regions can be defined in the feature space. The region with mixed points is still not resolved better. However, with increasing polynomial degrees there is a danger of overfitting.", "With neural networks, functions and thus regions of any complexity can be defined. This is defined by the number of layers and neurons. In the figure, a neural network with 3 layers of 25 neurons each was used.", "More about neural networks for classification under:", "Decision trees can form more or less complex classification regions depending on the maximum depth allowed. However, always only with decision limits in the axis directions. This results in regions in step form.", "At great depths, decision trees quickly tend to over-adapt. This can be clearly seen in the figure by the narrow stripes, which each classify only one data point.", "If one does not use individual decision trees but a multitude and then lets the majority of the individual classifiers decide on the overall classification, one speaks of random forests. These have some of the advantages of decision trees such as simplicity and good explainability, but they can delimit the classification areas more flexibly and do not tend to over-adapt so quickly.", "This illustration shows the very flexible decision limits but also approaches to over-adaptation.", "Using this example of buyer classification with only two characteristics, we have visually illustrated the typical properties of some very widespread classification methods. This helps to develop an intuition for the methods and to better assess risks such as over-adaptation.", "Your home for data science.
