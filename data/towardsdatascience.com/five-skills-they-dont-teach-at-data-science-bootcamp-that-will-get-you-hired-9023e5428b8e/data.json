Having gone through my share of data science courses/bootcamps/MOOCs on Udacity, Udemy, Coursera, EdX, and General Assembly, I can attest that no interviewer ever said, \u201cI see on your resume that you took a data science bootcamp, you\u2019re hired.\u201d In fact, none of my interviewers ever mentioned my education from online courses and bootcamps.", "The truth is that data science bootcamps aren\u2019t some silver bullet to getting your first job in data science. They\u2019re often marketed as a magical solution that if you spend 4 months in the program, you will learn all that you need to get your first job. In reality, bootcamps are more like launchpads. They\u2019re a great start for transitioning into a data science career.", "Drawing from my own personal experience as a data scientist and asking my colleagues in industry, here are five skills that we see most applicants lacking when applying to their first data science job.", "You\u2019re probably pointing out that you already know SQL from your courses. That\u2019s why I say intermediate SQL. All data science programs will cover SQL, but they don\u2019t take the time to go in depth on SQL. Remember that 80% of your time will be spent on data wrangling. SQL is part of that 80%, and knowing how to write SQL well will save you lots of time.", "Why is SQL so important? In your courses, your data is provided to you as a csv file. In production, your data exists in databases. Knowing how to write efficient SQL queries against multiple tables will allow you to pull your own data.", "\u201cSELECT * FROM TABLE\u201d is a telltale sign that you\u2018re inexperienced.", "When working with production databases, tables can have billions of rows and hundreds of columns. SELECT * is a quick way to lockup the resources on your database. If you absolutely need to do SELECT *, please include a limit clause, so that the results can actually be retrieved and displayed.", "You should also know how and when to use window functions, self joins, and cross joins. Knowing them will make or break your code when working with billion row databases.", "In data science bootcamps, you\u2019re doing everything locally on your laptop. In the wild, everything is hosted in the cloud. Navigating through a company\u2019s cloud infrastructure on AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud is among the first things you\u2019ll do in any tech job.", "But how is knowing cloud technologies going to get me hired? Job descriptions sometimes don\u2019t explicitly say AWS. Instead, they reference services and technologies on the cloud like \u201cEMR\u201d and \u201cSageMaker.\u201d", "In the job description above, we see that they\u2019re hiring for BigQuery experience. BigQuery is Google Cloud\u2019s serverless data warehouse (Yes, you query it using SQL). From this, you can probably assume that their services are hosted on Google Cloud, and any experience you have with it will automatically make you more hire-able than the next candidate.", "In one of our interviews, we asked the candidate, \u201cThat\u2019s a good solution, but where do you get the data?\u201d", "The answer to \u201cwhere does the data come from?\u201d is not pd.read_csv()", "As a working data scientist, there\u2019s no folder on my desktop that I click open for my data in a csv file. I\u2019m usually working with parquet and gzip files that\u2019s hosted in a cloud bucket or querying a database to retrieve my data. For example, to get the necessary data to answer a business question, I may need to work with several engineers to understand different parts of the process from how it\u2019s generated to how to efficiently pull all the data into one central location for analysis.", "In practice, data science is much more messy. Like stochastic gradient descent, we\u2019re iterating towards a solution, but often without good indicators. Something seemingly simple as answering the question \u201cWhat was sales last month?\u201d can often turn out to be much more complicated as the data can exist across multiple databases and a co-worker\u2019s excel sheet. You\u2019d be surprised how much of data is some excel sheet attachment in email chains.", "To gain some real world experience in data science, join in a hackathon, start your own data project, generate your own data, participate in community data events and groups.", "Data scientists are often the middle person to data questions. For example, we work between engineers who generate the data and product managers who want to answer some questions with the data. In other words, we work with multiple stakeholders and resources to solve data related questions.", "To be successful, you need to know how to define your role in the bigger picture. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re hired to create a demand-forecast dashboard. Here\u2019s a set of questions to ask:", "In bootcamps, we\u2019re given problem sets with clear objectives on what\u2019s correct. On the job, success is often not defined, constantly changing at best. This is why it\u2019s important to view the problem in a broader sense and understand what is actually being requested.", "We\u2019re not looking for the perfect answer. We\u2019re looking for the best answer that can be deployed on time. In bootcamps, we\u2019re tasked to improve the accuracy of our models. On the job, accuracy is just one of many metrics that we\u2019re trying to achieve. Others include maintain-ability, deploy-ability, scalability, reproducibility, and can we do all that within a limited time frame?", "We need to be agile and flexible to changing requests and data. The answer that you were trying to solve at the start of the sprint might change mid-sprint. Case in point: the recent pandemic changed a lot of business operations, including that of data science teams.", "The data can change or break. Know that the solutions and models that you built have limited shelf life. Say, the demand-forecast dashboard that you built last month may be outdated/broken because some data that was previously available has changed formats or is no longer available.", "Bootcamps are more like launchpads into the data science field. They are by no means an all encompassing program that you go through to become data scientists. The five skills that my colleagues and I often see lacking from data science applicants are:", "As an added bonus, make sure to include continued education in your data science journey. The field is rapidly evolving every year, so you need to continue learning about the latest technology and techniques. All data scientists I know have some side project or hobby that they\u2019re pursuing to improve their data science skills.", "With that, I sincerely hope that I\u2019ve been helpful in your journey to getting your first data science job. Let me know if you have any questions and what resources will be helpful to you. I\u2019m reachable at jasonwithcoffee on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
