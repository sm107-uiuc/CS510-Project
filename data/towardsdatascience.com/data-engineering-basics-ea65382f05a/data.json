Data Science is in high demand and businesses have quickly found that having engineers to aid the scientists provides faster results.", "The data footprint of many organisations these days is huge. Data is being absorbed from many different sources in a myriad of formats. This dirty data wreaks havoc for analysts and data scientists whose core role is to extract models and insights.", "This is why data engineer job roles are booming as they can help reduce this burden. In this post, I\u2019ll talk through the basic skills required to fulfil this role.", "The Unix shell is your best friend. Any computer engineer should be familiar with command-line tools and data engineers are no exception.", "Unix machines are used everywhere these days and as a data engineer, they are something I interact with every single day.", "Understanding common shell tools and how to use them to manipulate data will increase your flexibility and speed when dealing with day to day data activities.", "Here are some common shell commands that you should be aware of that will allow you to manipulate and process data:", "These tools will turn hour-long tasks into quick 5 minute jobs and over time you\u2019ll build up a portfolio of commands and scripts that you always go back to for performing quick modifications to data files.", "SQL itself is quite easy to understand. If you\u2019ve done any programming at all then SQL will be fairly straightforward to pick up. The language itself isn\u2019t important, it\u2019s the concepts it utilises that are required for the data engineering brain.", "SQL concepts such as extracting, filtering, grouping, joining, aggregating and writing data are all vital. Understanding how to filter data, join datasets together and group and aggregate to perform calculations will fulfil the majority of your requirements.", "Even if you\u2019re not using SQL, understanding the application of these concepts is important, as regardless of the programming language, you will find yourself applying these skills to data.", "Another key skill is understanding all the ways to get data from point A to point B. Most modern businesses will have some sort of data lake or data warehouse where they are collecting data for analytics.", "This data will come from disparate sources and different techniques will be required to transport it. Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as extracting data to a file and importing it into a database, other times the data may need to be transported in real-time. For this, you\u2019ll need to build a real-time streaming pipeline.", "The first time you copy data into your data warehouse you may find you have to bulk ingest massive data sets, understanding which tools will help do this most efficiently and also resiliently (you\u2019d hate your import to be 90% complete and fail and there be no easy way to pick up from where it failed). After that you\u2019ll probably just need to copy what\u2019s changed, this may require a different set of tools.", "Again, understanding the best tool for the job goes a long way here and that will only come with experience. However, breaking the problem down and understanding there are different ways of achieving it is half the battle.", "Picking the best data storage solution is another important requirement for a data engineer. Businesses will often have several different databases from CRM tools, website databases, data warehouses and data lakes. Each of these serves a different purpose and often data will live and move between a number of them.", "Depending on the requirements you may need a scalable NoSQL database for fast data storage and rapid single row querying or a power-hungry cluster for data warehousing and batch transformation jobs.", "Understanding the pros and cons of different types of databases will help you pick the best tool for the job. A lot of the time, there are several technologies that all suit the job at hand, experience and non-technical factors will often then help with the selection. Again, this comes with experience but is something to bear in mind alongside the technical requirements.", "Finally, a good data engineer should be able to extract and understand what the end-user actually wants to do with the data. Knowing the final destination for the data will help you understand which data movement and storage techniques should be applied.", "These requirements also help you understand what manipulation of the data is required. How should it be cleaned? Does it need joining and aggregating ready for reports? How often does the data need updating? How fast does the data need retrieving, is it for a front end solution?", "Teasing out these requirements will help you build up the data pipeline and tell you everything from what data is required, how quickly it is needed, how it should be processed and how it should be stored.", "Master these and you\u2019re a data engineering pro!", "Looking for more great Data Engineering content? Then sign up for my newsletter to learn about real-world data engineering techniques and receive personally curated content. I also often feature subscribers articles in the newsletter to increase your reach.", "Your home for data science.
