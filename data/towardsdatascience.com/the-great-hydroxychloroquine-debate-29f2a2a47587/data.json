As I wrote previously, finding an effective treatment could significantly alter the trajectory of our global response to the pandemic. At his daily briefing on Sunday, Apr. 5, President Trump asked the country, \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d and has been pushing for patient access to the drug through right-to-try legislation.", "Hydroxychloroquine has been shown in the laboratory to be effective against coronaviruses including SARS and COVID-19 by blocking entry of the virus into cells. What works in a test tube, however, doesn\u2019t always work in humans. In the case of SARS, hydroxychloroquine failed to lower viral loads in mice. Moreover, patients who routinely take hydroxychloroquine for lupus or arthritis have been infected with COVID-19 \u2014 showing that it is not preventative. Nevertheless, hydroxychloroquine may be a promising treatment and is one of many therapeutics that merits study.", "I am personally hopeful that hydroxychloroquine, possibly combination with azithromycin or zinc, will be proven effective in clinical trials currently underway. We all want something to work. The caution, however, is that hydroxychloroquine, especially when combined with azithromycin, can be associated with visual and cardiac complications including arrhythmias. All physicians take the Hippocratic Oath in medical school \u2014 \u201cdo no harm\u201d \u2014 and rightly hesitate to prescribe medications with known side effects in the absence of rigorous studies. Indeed, hospitals in France and Sweden have recently halted clinical trials with hydroxychloroquine citing increased cardiac risks with lack of benefit.", "For daily updates on the latest hydroxychloroquine data, I suggest this blog by pharmacologist Derek Lowe, PhD. The existing data is, in a word, inconclusive. The majority of articles are still in \u201cpre-print\u201d \u2014 preliminary submissions to journals that may not have completed the peer review process required for formal publication. One recent pre-publication abstract and data table from Dr. Didier Raoult caught my attention and was also picked up by the New York Times and Fox News.", "Briefly, Dr. Raoult has become a controversial figure who is championing the use of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin (HCQ-AZ) to treat COVID-19. He initially published on Mar. 20 positive results in a group of 42 patients, of which 26 patients took HCQ-AZ. This paper was immediately criticized for its methodology including the fact that Dr. Raoult chose who received HCQ-AZ versus placebo, and analysis which excluded any patients who fared poorly on the regimen. A re-analysis of the data showed no benefit when accounting for the methodological inconsistencies. An official statement from the journal \u2014 the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy \u2014 stated the following: \u201cThe ISAC believes the article does not meet the Society\u2019s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.\u201d A second publication by Dr. Raoult was issued as a pre-print without peer review and did not include a control group at all.", "Nevertheless, the initial study sparked President Trump\u2019s interest in hydroxychloroquine \u2014 he tweeted about it on Mar. 21 and has referred to it several times during his daily briefings.", "On Apr. 10, Dr. Raoult posted to his Twitter a pre-publication abstract and data table summarizing his findings in just over 1,000 patients. Below, I will report the relevant findings (in bold) followed by the methodological issues and omissions that need to be answered.", "Dr. Raoult\u2019s latest publication appears very promising on first glance \u2014 91.7% cure within 10 days and 0.5% mortality! However, I am concerned about the lack of a control group and the lack of transparency about the patient selection process. An intentional or unintentional selection of a younger and healthier patient cohort may result in excellent outcomes irregardless of hydroxychloroquine. We need the full manuscript to evaluate whether this abstract is indeed promising or misleading.", "The gold standard remains a double-blind, randomized control trial. I sincerely hope we get data from such trials in the near future.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
