With GIS, urban planners may manage, publish, and analyze spatial data. The spatial data is distinct to ordinary data as spatial data has a spatial element that sometimes people overlook. The awareness and intuition about the \u201cspatial\u201d are what makes an urban planner, or geographer powerful.", "As an Indonesian Urban Planner, I deal with spatial data every day, and this essay is inspired by a dataset that is published by Jakarta City, Indonesia. I must say, Jakarta City\u2019s spatial data repository impresses me! It is structured, readable, processable, and well maintained. You do not need digitation. It is a great example of the spatial data repository that many boroughs must look up to. But there\u2019s this one \u201cspatial\u201d data from the Jakarta\u2019s Open Data Portal that raises questions (at least, to me): The Routes of Public Transportation.", "The routes are described in a manner that is understandable for people, but not parsable for computers in a geographical sense. For example, where is \u201cJl. Raya Bekasi\u201d street? How long it is? How does it curve? What are the geometrical properties? To a data analyst like me, this is infuriating. We must look for the street, plot it in GIS software so that we can do further analysis with the computer. This (digitation) process spends time, and time is money. The unprepared data costs analysts and produces tedious works.", "Let\u2019s look at another example: a map like illustrated by the figure below. This is supposed to be a map of an Angkot (\u201cpublic transportation \u2014 Minibus\u201d) route.", "It is not a map per se, it is a diagram. Geometrical properties in the \u201cmap\u201d are just a diagrammatical representation. The length and distance are not the true scaled distance, this is why the \u201cmap\u201d does not have a coordinate system/reference.", "An attempt to include spatial data such as illustrated above should be appreciated. It holds information, but we can do more.", "Now, how should we analyze this spatial data computationally? If you\u2019ve worked with much data especially spatial data, I\u2019m sure you quite understand what I\u2019m talking about. Imagine the digitizing, and cleaning the data. This is not efficient, and only one person/entity should do the cleansing so that not everyone has to. The solution is simple, the provision of standardized, formated, and parsable spatial data.", "The spatial data has so many formats. Most popular, I guess, is the Shapefile (.shp) format developed by Esri in the '90s which is pretty old! This is 2020, it\u2019s been a decade since the era of shapefile, surely many data and techniques have been developed. As I play around with Python, I noticed a connection between GeoDataFrame and the spatial data problems that I encountered. So, this essay introduces another type of geospatial data, GeoDataFame, and how it can solve the spatial data attribute problem for Indonesia.", "This essay consists of 5 parts:", "GeoDataFrame is a spatial data frame that is used by GeoPandas as an object to operate. When we use GeoPandas to analyze and manage spatial data, GeoDataFrame is the target object. The official explanation of GeoDataFrame from GeoPandas is", "\u201cA GeoDataFrame is a tabular data structure that contains a GeoSeries.\u201d \u2014 GeoPandas", "what is a GeoSeries? GeoSeries is a vector that contains the geometries of the data. We can imagine a vector as a single column spreadsheet. It is represented as a column named \u201cgeometry\u201d in a GeoDataFrame. I always think of the definition to be confusing and visualizing it always helps. Here\u2019s what a GeoDataFrame look like:", "As you can see, a GeoDataFrame is basically a spreadsheet that contains one column of geometry. I\u2019d like to say that GeoDataFrame is like rows of data that have a geometry property. Each feature (each row) has values and a geometric property. For instance, as illustrated, \u201cPulau Tidung\u201d has a population of 11305 with a geometry described in the geometry column.", "When we plot or do spatial analysis, this \u201cgeometry\u201d column is the one that is being processed. Dissecting the GeoDataFrame there are 3 components:", "We can also plot the geometry line and make a map. In this example, the population of Jakarta City. Instead of graphs, we can use Choropleth map so that we can overview the spatial relationships.", "Geodataframe is more readable to more common people. GeoDataFrame is basically a table, and everyone knows what a table is, so it\u2019s intuitive. Unlike Shapefile that, I think, not everyone knows.", "If you\u2019re familiar with python, it\u2019s basically a Pandas Dataframe with one additional column that holds the geometric properties. We can do Pandas methods to GeoDataFrame.", "Now, what is the value is inside this geometry column? We\u2019re going to use some Python nomenclatures, but it\u2019s not that complicated as it is pretty much straight forward. Please bear with me a little.", "There are 3 main spatial data types:", "So Spatial data is basically a bunch of coordinates!", "By their nature, Polylines and Polygons consist of vertices. These vertices are Points\u2019 coordinates that are held in the Geometry column. As we can see in the figure below when a value of geometry is expanded, it contains many coordinates of Latitude and Longitude, and when we visualize these vertices, it draws a shape.", "Each geometry is an object of Shapely, a library of Python. Shapely deals with geometrics for math purposes. We can do much spatial analysis such as intersections, unions, and many more. This is a very brief introduction: for example, if I want to create a geometric object, what I need to do is write some command to Python like this:", "This will create a rectangle as there are 3 vertices (3 coordinates).", "Of course, to define each feature\u2019s geometry we do not put it manually. Instead, we can integrate sensors such as GPS to automate the task or do some conversions with some scripts.", "While shapefile is very popular I think GeoJSON is neater. Shapefile consists of separate files, besides the geometry itself, such as the projections and the attributes; while GeoJSON is only one \u201ctext\u201d file.", "Web service that fulfills the OGC standard is a must, this allows websites and algorithms to connect remotely, but sometimes users need downloadable data with common and popular formats such as .xlsx or .csv.", "There are several options that I recommend:", "I think there should be an awareness of spatial attributes in datasets. Spatial attributes are as crucial as the data frame itself, and should not be separated. A spreadsheet (.xlsx, CSV, many more) must be accompanied by geometry in a GeoJSON format, or even embedded in the CSV itself. A tabular data format must have a column that defines the geometry of each feature whenever geometric properties are suitable. Why GeoDataFrame, CSV or GeoJSON? So it is readable to human eyes to those who are not common to spatial data, and common to spatial data. The geometry must consist of coordinate(s).", "I think Including GeoDataFrame should increase the intuition to many people that features do have spatial attributes, and spatially interactable. GeoDataFrame also enables us to compute spatial data in an efficient way. To get started, We can do as simple as \u201conly\u201d adding one column to each of our spreadsheets, that is, the geometry column.", "Your home for data science.
