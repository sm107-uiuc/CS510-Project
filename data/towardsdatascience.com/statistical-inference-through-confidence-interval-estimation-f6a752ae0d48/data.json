Rather they take a small bite elegantly, their eloquent chewing creates an optimal environment of thrill, and finally, their curated judgment renders insight into the quality of the food. That golden judgment holds a strong belief from both the audience and aspirants which gives a sense of uniqueness, precision and a good representative of those who is concerned to achieve similar results in cooking that particular genre of a dish.", "It is similarly intriguing of a particular idea of rough approximation practices which has been seen to draw the consideration across age gatherings to improve thinking abilities. In one way or another, I feel it gives a feeling of tremendous delight when the disclosure of our closeness to the specific is exact without knowing the width of a hypothesis.", "In this article (as a continuation of my past) we would take cautious steps to encounter some stimulating real factors of certain realities we inspected in the sections above.", "A population is the set of all members about which a study intends to make inferences (et al Albright & Winston).", "Each unit of a population is known as a frame. The dispersion and spatial distribution characteristic is the only important attribute of a population that we can carry forward in this discussion.", "A sample may refer to a small portion of the population which is simpler to control yet all the while ought to be doable to separate and must hold genuine qualities of the population.", "If we practice writing or pronouncing the term \u201cTarget\u201d together with \u201cPopulation\u201d instead of plain vanilla \u201cPopulation\u201d then I strongly believe we can narrow down our intent about a purpose rather than a blind date with the English Dictionary. This undeniable basket of two terms says a thousand words eradicating the need for much reading or explanation.", "The process of picking a sample or a set of such samples is known as sampling and data science has been bestowed upon various kinds of sampling techniques. It is futile to divert and discuss each one of them now, however, it is worth mentioning that every technique has its unique design and cognitive approach. It solely depends on the concerned person what technique to choose to reach the desired guesstimate, and there is no such rule inscribed on stone. That being said I would like to share my own opinion with my readers on the different common techniques. Every one of them has been scaled in a request for four characters (i.e. implementation, representativeness, cost, and randomness). The dispersion and spatial distribution feature of the population are responsible to an extent for the variation in the aforementioned four characters.", "The more we shift from left to right we get an easier technique in terms of implementation. The more we move upward the technique becomes relatively less precise in terms of representing all traits of a population. The size of the circles represents the cost of execution. The bigger the size, the greater is the cost of executing the technique. Finally, the red color covers the techniques which involve a degree of probability or randomness in selecting the samples. Whereas the blue circles solely focus on non-probabilistic or judgemental techniques where there is no randomness assigned. Although we would deal with only one of the techniques from the second quadrant which is Simple Random Sampling, yet iterating that the above view is purely based on my fair comprehension rather than prejudice. I dare not to claim that the view holds a signature from the National or International statistical body, therefore do keep this in mind before blindly accepting my view. It may or may not match your version of the story.", "Now allow me to clarify the reason why I made you imagine an image of \u201cignorance\u201d and \u201cbalance\u201d right at the Sub-title. Firstly, despite the artistry imbibed by the judge while taking a bite of the dish to evaluate the aspirant chef, there would be some margin of error because finishing the entire dish is always left out and impossible to accommodate in the allotted time. Secondly, keeping the former error aside, despite the designing or cognitive expertise of the judge, the contestant in question may miss some ingredients or techniques that do not abide by the theme or objective of the competition. There can be some error from the judge too in interpreting the submission of the contestant. I would better reveal that the second kind of error may be referred to as a Non-sampling error, whereas the first one is more of a sampling error. Irrespective of both types of errors the balance is customary to make the show go on and allowing more and more participants to encompass the process. It is inevitable to submit an answer to a guesstimate question without a little margin of errors. I would either get a prize or I won\u2019t, but the process has to survive to ignore the impact of errors.", "To keep you from dozing off, instead of looking at the definitions of different kinds of Non-sampling error, let us look at a few examples that could lead to such possibility.", "The above is a classic case of Non-response error which is a common kind of Non-sampling error. Non-voters with a relatively higher percentage than voters in the 18\u201329 age group may raise questions on the awareness of voting rights from early high school days which in turn may affect voting patterns of taxpayers.", "The above graph shows the response from all data analysts employed by an organization named \u201cLife of Data Science\u201d. The responses came out as part of a survey conducted by the CTO to guess the scale of VBA training planned. Although everything looks majorly okay, except the fact that a good 5% data analysts don\u2019t use excel at all in their job role. This sounds potentially nontruthful where the organization very well knows that each data analyst has renewed his/her annual Excel license.", "The above graph shows the response of applicants to a job post from a company that requires a Programmer explicitly. Options like Usually, Sometimes or Rarely do not give a clear qualifying picture to the recruiter who should be more focussed on candidates who either program or not. Therefore the setting of the question may not truly capture the intention of the recruiter causing a measurement bias.", "Students who passed out last year had always aspired to a hangout area inside the campus where students (who are relatively new to the college) can spend a good time with seniors to exchange course curriculum and other extracurricular activities. A lot of presentations and convincing later they got permission from management to conduct a survey based on which the establishment cost would be decided. Second-year students did everything to maintain fair means but missed the critical need to campaign this objective to current 1st-year students. The result says that 90% of 1st-year students who voted, do not want a night time cafe, whereas they were initially the target audience last year. Therefore the current 1st-year mindset differs in some respect from potential respondents causing potential Voluntary response bias.", "We don\u2019t have the foggiest idea about the qualities in child Simpson that have originated from which phase of human advancement, in any case, the attributes permit us to infer upon specific attributes of mankind.", "A population characteristic is described by a measure known as Population parameter. Mostly this value always exists but remains unknown in real-life scenarios except for some experimental cases. The characteristic of a sample is described by a measure known as the Sample statistic which qualifies as a Point estimate later. We can make use of the sample statistic to make certain conclusions about the population. Mean and Standard deviations are two such measures common to both Population parameter and Sample statistic. Let us consider another example to discuss the above a little more.", "The chief of a neighborhood drive-through joint is keen on improving the service provided to customers who go through the caf\u00e9\u2019s drive window. As the initial phase in this procedure, the director requests that his associate record the time it takes to serve countless clients at the last window in the office\u2019s drive-up framework. The outcomes comprise of about 1184 help times. For this problem, we can assume that the population is known. (et al Albright & Winston)", "The ask is to produce a straightforward arbitrary sample of size 30 from the information and afterward figure a gauge of the population boundary (mean) from the example chosen. Here Sample statistic can also be referred to as the sample mean.", "As we said, the most common measure of a population parameter is it\u2019s mean, and to estimate this population parameter, the most common sample characteristic is the sample mean. Although median or other measures are also qualifiers yet, we would stick to sample mean here. The black dash-dot line in the above charts is the population mean of serving time for all 1184 records. The brown solid line, on the other hand, is the sample mean. Notice the first chart where we just have one sample there, we have only one sample mean, but as we keep taking multiple samples of size 30, we can get a distribution of the means, and thus we can evaluate the mean of the distribution which is denoted by the brown line. Also, notice as we move across the charts and compare them with the second row we observe that the black and brown lines almost overlap. Therefore as repeated random samples of a given size are taken from a population of values, the mean of all sample means tends to meet the population mean and thus becomes an unbiased estimator of the population mean. This is a critical property of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. Hence in real-life cases where the population mean is unknown, we can rely upon this unbiased estimator to draw some idea about the population mean.", "Presently in the above diagram, I request you to see just one change. Do we notice the range of the X-axis suddenly looks narrower relative to its counterpart where we took only 30 units per sample? Thus we see less spread over larger samples. The standard deviation of all sample means is directly related to the sample size (100 in this case). The standard deviation of all sample means in a sampling distribution is known as Standard error. Hence if we can bear the cost to increase our sample size (e.g. 100 > 30) then we may achieve a lesser deviation of the sample means or in polished words less standard error. This is also known as the variability property of an unbiased estimator.", "Although in real life the actual population distribution may not be available yet, for the sake of this article let us assume we have the population distribution from 1184 customer records and when we plot it, we get a right-skewed distribution as denoted by the blue curve in the above picture. The green curve denotes the sampling distribution of the sample mean. We have done this exercise 6 times where each time we have taken a sample size of 3, 5, 25, 30, 50 & 100. We have limited ourselves to 100 repetitions and have deliberately not changed it.", "We see that as sample size increases the shape of the green curve (roughly after size 30) gradually resembles a normal bell shape. The distribution of sample means will tend to achieve a normal distribution as long as the sample size is large enough, irrespective of the fact that the population distribution could be heavily skewed or normally distributed. This gives us a subtle overview of a magic theorem known as the Central Limit Theorem (a.k.a CLT).", "So far examining the serving time example above we have discussed how a point estimate or unbiased sample statistic can be derived through random sampling. We are aware of how much this point estimate may deviate as we change the sample size or repetitions of the sampling. We have also checked how the sampling distribution of the point estimate closely resembles a normal distribution for a sufficient sample size. We would now look at one final question.", "What is the 95% confidence interval of the average time taken to serve customers in the restaurant who receive orders?", "If we reframe the question considering standard normal distribution we may then ask,", "How many standard deviations of all the sample means in the sampling distribution do we need to move in order to achieve a 95% confidence interval?", "If we remember the above chart from my previous article we had read, that in python subtracting stats.norm.cdf(-2) from stats.norm.cdf(2) gives us 0.9545 approximately, not exactly 0.9500. This is achieved by;", "Therefore let us assume the point estimate (which is the mean of all sample means in the sample distribution) is 55.45 minutes. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is 4.46 minutes. We were asked to consider a sample size of 30 in the original example. Hence the standard error (which is the standard deviation of all sample means in the sampling distribution) is 4.46 divided by squared root of sample size. The value is 0.814. We also account for a correction factor worth 0.99 due to the fact we know original population records. The final standard error is now 0.99 * 0.814 which approximates to 0.81. Let us assume that the point estimate and standard error values are given to us.", "We are 95% confident that the average time taken to serve customers in the restaurant who receive orders lies between 53.87 minutes and 57.03 minutes.", "For the sake of simplicity let us just know that Student\u2019s t distribution is a good alternative when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown. Please remember that both conditions need to fulfill. In other words, looking at the graph we may feel that estimating the deviation relying on a small sample leads to greater uncertainty resulting in a more spread out distribution, as can be seen by the t-distributions with heavier tails. Although speaking about degrees of freedom would be opening a pandora\u2019s box at this point, yet it is just enough to know that subtracting 1 from the sample size leads to the value of degrees of freedom (a.k.a df) for t. To get more information, you may visit here. For now, it is okay if we realize that as sample size increases, the degrees of freedom increase, and thus t-distributions gradually approximate to a normal distribution. I would be happy if the intent of the graph stays with you because it was a nightmare for me to visualize both at the same time in my early days. The above graph is one of the many ways to justify using a t-distribution instead of a Normal (or Z-distribution) when the sample size is less than 30. My fellow readers from the Quality control domain may be able to relate my opinion.", "The basic ingredients to evaluate a confidence interval for a population parameter are a point estimate, the standard error of the point estimate, and a multiplier that depends on the confidence level or sample size. We have seen the first two but just to revisit the third one (multiplier) may depend upon specific distribution we are choosing (Normal or Student\u2019s t), based on which we can plugin stats.norm.ppf or stats.t.ppf functions accordingly. The question could be that can we not use any other distribution other than these two? Of course, we can post necessary due diligence and investigation.", "Keeping the above fundamentals in mind we would discuss one more intriguing form of population parameter known as Population Proportion. In this form instead of estimating the mean as a characteristic, we deal with a share or portion concerning the whole. Examples could be a 95% confidence interval of the true proportion of voters who favored a particular candidate, a 95% confidence interval of the true proportion of households that use wifi network in a particular city, a 95% confidence interval of the true proportion of stocks that go up and down in a given month, a 95% confidence interval of the true proportion of customers who are satisfied with the services offered by a fast food joint, etc.", "One of the easy ways to identify a proportion estimation is to check first if there is any underlying mention of the mean as a characteristic. Secondly, after we have drawn a random sample of a given size there should be a probability of success or failure to form the proportion. Examples could be Voting \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d for a candidate, Wifi \u201cis\u201d or \u201cisn't\u201d used, Stocks \u201cdo\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d go up, Customers \u201care\u201d or \u201caren't\u201d satisfied, etc. To be precise the property of the sample proportion should be a binomial random variable.", "The manager of the same restaurant who wanted to estimate mean service time now wants to perform another estimation. He has launched a new sandwich during winters. He has collected a sample of 40 customers who were asked to rate the new sandwich on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 is worst and 10 is best). He wants to estimate the proportion of customers who rate the sandwich 6 and above. He believes that this interval is likely to purchase a sandwich on the next visit. It is known to us that the sample of 40 customers has 25 of them who rated 6 and above.(et al Albright & Winston)", "The below python code may give help us with the understanding,", "Most people use statistics like a drunk man uses a lamppost; more for support than illumination ~ Andrew Lang", "A sample is more like a subset taken from a population and infer to the population. The two main types of sampling are probability sampling and non-probability sampling. Every element in a population frame have an equal opportunity of being selected in the sample and this particular process is simple random sampling. If we take a sample of a given size, evaluate a sample characteristic (most commonly mean or proportions), and repeat these two steps a large number of times, we would get a distribution of the sample characteristic referred to as sampling distribution. When we measure how dispersed the sample characteristic is we get a standard error. The outcome of each random sample is different because the chance of selecting the sample is attached to some probability. In reality, the distribution of population may not be known, but if the sample size is sufficiently large the sampling distribution would resemble a normal distribution, also known as CLT. As the sample size increases the standard error reduces. The magnitude of our confidence in estimating a population parameter is proportional to the number of standard deviations we move in the sampling distribution. This magnitude acts as a multiplier with standard error and choosing the multiplier depends on whether the population variance is known and the sample size is large enough.", "Some regular & common codes referred in this topic are given below;", "The link to access the \u201ccustomer serving time\u201d example dataset used in this article is here.", "The intent of this article is not to focus on any specific toolbox, rather raising awareness and getting familiar with a problem of this nature and then approaching various toolboxes as needed.
