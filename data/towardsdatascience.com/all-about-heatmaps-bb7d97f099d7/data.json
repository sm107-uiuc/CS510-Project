Best Practices of using HeatMaps", "11. How to Read a Seaborn Heat map", "14. Create a default Heatmap using Seaborn", "17. Generating colormap from seaborn Palletes", "19. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with the heatmap", "Heatmaps visualize the data in a 2-dimensional format in the form of colored maps. The color maps use hue, saturation, or luminance to achieve color variation to display various details. This color variation gives visual cues to the readers about the magnitude of numeric values. HeatMaps is about replacing numbers with colors because the human brain understands visuals better than numbers, text, or any written data. Human beings are visual learners; therefore, visualizing the data in any form makes more sense. Heatmaps represent data in an easy-to-understand manner. Thus visualizing methods like HeatMaps have become popular.", "Heatmaps can describe the density or intensity of variables, visualize patterns, variance, and even anomalies. Heatmaps show relationships between variables. These variables are plotted on both axes. We look for patterns in the cell by noticing the color change. It only accepts numeric data and plots it on the grid, displaying different data values by varying color intensity.", "Typically, there are two types of Heatmaps:", "o Clustered Heatmap: The goal of Clustered Heatmap is to build associations between both the data points and their features. This type of heatmap implements clustering as part of the process of grouping similar features. Clustered Heatmaps are widely used in biological sciences for studying gene similarities across individuals.", "The order of the rows in Clustered Heatmap is determined by performing hierarchical cluster analysis of the rows. Clustering positions similar rows together on the map. Similarly, the order of the columns is determined.", "o Correlogram: A correlogram replaces each of the variables on the two axes with numeric variables in the dataset. Each square depicts the relationship between the two intersecting variables, which helps to build descriptive or predictive statistical models.", "Heat maps are used by any organization that collects and uses data to improve their finances, sales, operations, customer service, or marketing.", "Some of the industries that use Heatmaps:\u00b3", "Choropleth maps are sometimes confused with heat maps. A choropleth map features different shading patterns within geographic boundaries to show the proportion of a variable of interest\u00b2. In contrast, a heat map does not correspond to geographic boundaries. Choropleth maps visualize the variability of a variable across a geographic area or within a region. A heat map uses regions drawn according to the variable\u2019s pattern, rather than the a priori geographic areas of choropleth maps\u00b9. The Choropleth is aggregated into well-known geographic units, such as countries, states, provinces, and counties.", "Many different color schemes can illustrate the heat map, with perceptual advantages and disadvantages for each. The color palette choices are more than just aesthetics because the colors in the HeatMap reveal patterns in the data. Good color schemes can enhance pattern discovery, and poor color choices can hide it.", "The seaborn Heatmaps are the grid Heatmaps that can take various types of data and generate heatmaps. The primary purpose of the seaborn heatmap is to show the correlation matrix by data visualization. It helps find the relationship between multiple features and which features are best for Machine Learning model building.", "A correlation matrix denotes the correlation coefficients between variables at the same time. A heat map grid can represent these coefficients to build a visual representation of the variables\u2019 dependence. This visualization makes it easy to spot the strong dependencies. A positive correlation indicates a strong dependency, while a negative correlation indicates a strong inverse dependency; a correlation coefficient closer to zero indicates weak dependence.", "The heatmap transforms the correlation matrix into color codings. The correlation matrix shows how the variables are correlated to each other on a scale of -1 to 1. 1 being positively correlated and -1 being inversely correlated. As only numerical features can show the correlation, the heatmap cannot visualize categorical features. Strings need to be encoded to be pictured on the Heatmaps.", "Three input types for the heatmap\u2078", "To understand each argument in the heatmap function, please refer to the following Document.\u2077", "Heatmap takes one mandatory parameter: \u2018data.\u2019 The CSV format dataset is downloaded from the below link.", "cmap parameter can take matplotlib colormap name or object, or list of colors.", "The currently available Matplotlib colormap names are listed below:\u2079", "Seaborn Color Palletes: The Color Palletes are a full range of digital colors used for visualizations using seaborn.", "The seaborn function color_palette() provides an interface to generate color palettes in seaborn.

The first two have a vast luminance range and are well suited for applications such as heatmaps.", "o Sequential cubehelix palettes: The cubehelix system offers an RGB-based tradeoff, which generates sequential palettes with a linear increase or decrease in brightness with some continuous variation in hue. The resulting colormaps are not perfectly perceptually uniform but have a parameterizable design process. cubehelix_palette() control how the palette looks.", "o Custom sequential palettes: Both light_palette() or dark_palette() are passed a single color value, which produces a palette that starts either from light or dark desaturated values to that color.", "o Sequential Color Brewer palettes: The Color Brewer library for sequential palettes include palettes with one primary hue.", "o Perceptually uniform diverging palettes: Seaborn has two perceptually uniform diverging palettes: \u201cvlag\u201d and \u201cicefire.\u201d", "o Custom diverging palettes: diverging_palette() is used to create a custom colormap for diverging data. It builds the colormaps with one color on each side. It needs two colors as arguments, converging to another color in the center. Correlations range from -1 to 1, so they have two directions, and in this case, a diverging palette works better than a sequential one.", "Cubehelix palette is a sequential palate. Cmap can take matplot colormaps or seaborn palette as arguments.
