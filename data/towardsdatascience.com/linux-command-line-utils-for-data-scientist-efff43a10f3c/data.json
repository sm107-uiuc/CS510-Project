Nevertheless, what if I say, that you can provide pretty complete and informative data analysis without all this stuff. I want to share with you a set of Linux command-line tools that provide a simple, quick and Linux-styled analog of your favorite data instruments. So, I want to show, that Data Scientist is not bound to a specific environment and is not limited in his arsenal.", "For our luck, Linux has various utils for displaying file content. Though, for the fair search of Python analogs, let\u2019s exclude all text editors since they require all the work to be done manually. We are searching for the scripts, which may act in pandas-way.", "These are simple utils to get definite lines from a file:", "head -n 5 example_data.csv \u2014 get the first 5 lines.", "head -n -15 example_data.csv \u2014 get all the lines except the last 15.", "tail -n 15 example_data.csv \u2014 get the last 15 lines in the file.", "tail -n +15 example_data.csv \u2014 get all the lines starting from the 15th.", "If we want to see a formated table instead of the raw data \u2014 we have another command.", "-s key provides the columns delimiter in the file and -t just provides formatting. It will produce output like this:", "But this command will generate the output for the whole file, so it is better to use it together with the previous command:", "Previous commands work with all the columns simultaneously. But what about the separation of the columns? Let\u2019s check another command:", "It will extract the 2 and 5 columns (given by the -f key) from the separated by comma (given by the -d key) file. You may choose the single columns or a few ones and then you may re-direct the output to get some analysis on them.", "You can also get the columns by the csvcut command from the csvkit suit.", "csvcut -n example_data.csv \u2014 returns the list of columns.", "csvcut -c -1 example_data.csv \u2014 returns all the first column values.", "If you want even more beautiful preview, than this command is for you. It is the part of the csvkit suit, so you can find more details on the csvlook page. The command:", "But what if we want to drop unrequired columns, remove duplicates or delete some unnecessary rows? Well, it is Linux, so we have special utils for all of these activities.", "You should act vice-verse: select not the columns you want to drop, but the commands you want to leave. The simplest way is to use the cut command to extract the columns you need into the new dataset:", "grep is a command which brings all the power of regex. As for me, it is the most convenient instrument to parse the data. For example:", "The command will find all the rows with \u2018C\u2019 symbol, extract them, add the number of lines and write to the new file:", "You can add -v key to get the reversed searched: all the lines, which do not contain \u2018C\u2019 symbol. Or you may add -i key to ignore the letter-case while searching. So, you can use grep together with cut pipeline to inspect some column, get indexes of filtered rows and select that rows by the sed or awk commands.", "These two packages are too powerful and can carry almost every imaginable command for work with the dataset. Sometimes they can be treated like another built-in language and interpreter inside the console. Check awk and sed documentation to get more examples, as they are too big for the article.", "No more words, but a single command:", "What is happening here? We take the data without headers, notice, that columns are separated by comma (-t key) and sort it by the first three columns: the first column in numerical (-g key) order, the second one in numerical and reverse (-r key) order, and the last one in default lexicographical order. The number of columns to be sorting keys (-k command key) can vary or be represented by a range of columns.", "Clean data looks pretty but it is useless without further investigation and analysis. So, what can we do without all the pandas features?", "Simple command wc allows to get these values:", "We will get the number of lines, words and bytes in the file. The number of bytes may be also treated as the number of the symbols in the ASCII-encoded file. This command also has -m key to use the console encoding.", "As always, Linux has prepared util:", "It will show the unique lines without the duplicates. Though, it will be more useful when applied to the column:", "This will return all unique values in the second column of the file.", "There is a special instrument to get common calculations for the chosen column: min, max, sum, median, mean, std. It is the part of the csvkit suit.", "csvstat also works with categorical data and shows the number of missing values and the list of unique values. So, it will be convenient for pandas users.", "Let\u2019s imagine, that our data is cleaned and prepared for the statistical analysis or model building. What is the next step? In most cases, it is a sampling of the data or test/train splitting. Within Linux console, we can easily do it with the shuf command (for shuffle).", "shuf -n 4 example_data.csv \u2014 produces 4 random rows from the file.", "To exclude the header from the sampling we should use the next command:", "Again, you are free to use redirects to write the output of the command to the file.", "I believe, that the main thing, that represents you as Data Scientist, is not a set of tools and instruments, but rather the knowledge you can apply to the task and the methods you can implement with your knowledge. You may use different programming languages, different supporting programs, various scripts or packages, but your knowledge and skills should be independent of the toolset, so you will be able to work in any environment.", "But it is good to test yourself and see, how can you accomplish an analysis without your warm and familiar Python libraries in the cold and dark Linux command line, isn\u2019t it? Also, more useful Linux utilities exist, so they cannot be covered in a single article. So, you are free to share more examples of how to work with the data in the terminal.", "Your home for data science.
