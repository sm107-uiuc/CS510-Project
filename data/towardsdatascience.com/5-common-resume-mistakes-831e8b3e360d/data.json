If you can avoid these mistakes, you will have made great progress in getting your resume to a good spot.", "So \u2014 here are 5 common resume mistakes:", "I\u2019ve found that it is increasingly common for people to try to make their resume different. Things like skill charts or personal touches, while they look cool, are often distracting. Business Insider did a comparison of 2 resume formats and tracked recruiters\u2019 eye movements. Here are the results:", "The resume on the right, with a more standard and clear format, was more thoroughly observed. Recruiters have to analyze hundreds of resumes. You want your resume to feel as familiar as possible so recruiters can find the information they are looking for quickly and efficiently.", "When I graduated, I had minimal experience, and I remember feeling like I had to do everything I could to make my resume feel \u201cfull.\u201d I guess my hope was I would somehow look more experienced if my resume was denser. I now realize that was a mistake.", "Again \u2014 recruiters and hiring managers don\u2019t have a lot of time. They don\u2019t want to read about unrelated jobs or maybe less inspiring job experience. You should make sure your resume focuses as clearly as possible on what you are most proud of \u2014 what you think makes you the perfect fit for your job.", "Too often, I finish reading resumes and nothing unique really stood out to me. Make sure you remove the fluff from your resume so that even when read very quickly it is evident to a hiring manager what makes you a fantastic fit for the role. In my opinion, this means you should never have a resume that is longer than 1 page. Even with decades of experience, I think people can summarize what really needs to be known in a single page.", "I get it \u2014 you took a class and did some C++ for a project. The job mentioned C++ as a beneficial skill to have, so why not add it to your resume? Why not add all the programming languages you have ever programmed \u201cHello World\u201d in?", "While often not that extreme, be careful making a laundry list of technical skills for which you have a very basic knowledge. Anything listed on your resume is free game for questions and it looks pretty bad when your C++ knowledge turns out to be limited to a few lines of code. So, try to be honest with yourself and only add skills for which you feel decently proficient. This isn\u2019t to say you have to be an expert in everything you list, but you should be comfortable fielding interview questions related to your skills.", "Sometimes when interviewing candidates experiences come out that are super relevant, but were not on their resume. Usually, this is because the experience didn\u2019t fit well into previous work experience or education.", "For example, maybe a side-project or open-source contributions. Make sure you make room for the experiences you feel have prepared you to be a great fit for the job. As mentioned in point 2, remove the fluff, and make room for these non-standard experiences you have. They will hopefully make you stand out among all the other resumes.", "School projects are awesome and can help you learn a ton. Unfortunately, they tend to pretty boiler-plate and the real downside is that many other people have done them as well. If you have a bunch of school projects listed on your resume that you know many other people have done as well, it\u2019s likely recruiters have seen them before, and basically just glaze over them when reading your resume.", "A strong GitHub account is an amazing thing to list on your resume. I love looking at candidates\u2019 GitHub profiles because I can instantly see examples of code and projects they have worked on. I strongly recommend people find time to have a few projects on GitHub they are proud of \u2014 it can go a long way to help you stand out.", "That being said, listing a basically empty GitHub account isn\u2019t a great idea. If you have one push for your one school project, that actually isn\u2019t very much code, and might not be code you\u2019re proud of, maybe skip putting your GitHub on your resume. If you\u2019re GitHub is empty, definitely skip it (you would be surprised how often I see this).", "I hope this was helpful for you to improve your resumes!", "Get your Free Guide to creating an amazing data science project.", "Your home for data science.
