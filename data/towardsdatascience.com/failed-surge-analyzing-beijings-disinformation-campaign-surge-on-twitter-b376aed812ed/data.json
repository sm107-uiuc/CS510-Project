Twitter is banned in China but troll accounts from the Chinese operation reportedly accessed the service using VPNs and unblocked IP addresses, according to Twitter\u2019s press release.", "But there was no obvious connection when looking through that first tranche of about 3.6 million tweets released by Twitter on August 19 2019. Most of the 890 troll accounts in this tranche were created in 2017 or earlier, and their activity peaked in 2017, especially in November and December that year (charts and analysis of this first tranche in my earlier Medium post on the subject).", "Now, a major piece of the puzzle has finally emerged. On September 20, a month after its initial announcement, Twitter released a second tranche of tweets related to China\u2019s state disinformation campaign against the HK protest movement.", "In this bigger set of about 10.2 million tweets, I found a clear spike in activity among the Chinese state trolls between May and July 2019, a period when political tensions in Hong Kong escalated sharply. This \u201ccampaign surge\u201d, I would argue, could ironically be one of the key reasons why the network set off alarm bells at Twitter and got taken down.", "Some top line figures from my analysis:", "The tweets/retweets during this period were primarily in Chinese, with English tweets making up just 6%, or 3,723, of the 69, 402 state troll tweets in a filtered subset where I took out tweets involving a running war of words with fugitive Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui. An interactive version of the chart below is available here.", "For instance, upon creation, 43 new Chinese state troll accounts went on to tweet out that default first tweet \u2014 \u201cJust setting up my Twitter. #myfirstTweet\u201d \u2014 as suggested by Twitter, before going on a retweet spree to spread messages by the lead trolls (@RuthMiller916, @eituji1994 and @bindarsou feature quite prominently in this second tranche of Chinese state troll tweets).", "Here\u2019s a sample of what one troll account \u201c\u2018Qduaf1s3ZCBagXgQdzLa3+CXVR4TP5SsCiEBdRqiNws=\u2019\u201d \u2014 its user name was hashed by Twitter \u2014 tweeted:", "That default \u201cJust setting up my Twitter\u201d message is a variation of the famous \u201cfirst tweet\u201d sent out by Twitter\u2019s co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey on Mar 21 2006. The trolls would send their final tweets soon enough, after their operation was uncovered by Twitter.", "This is the third in a series of posts by me analyzing China\u2019s state disinformation campaign against the Hong Kong protests. I\u2019ll explain my approach in greater details in the sections below. My earlier posts on this subject are here and here.", "Here\u2019s the repo for the project, and the notebook for this post. It is unlikely to display properly on Github due to its file size. You are better off downloading or cloning the repo and running it on your local machine. Warning though that the notebook is computationally expensive to run due to the heavy use of interactive graphics.", "The CSV files are too big to be uploaded on Github. Download them directly from Twitter instead.", "Before filtering the second tranche of troll tweets to focus on the \u201csurge\u201d period, I first compared the two sets at the broad level:", "The far higher number of unique users in the second tranche of tweets offer the first major clue as to where to start digging \u2014 in this case, the account creation date. The state trolls behind Beijing\u2019s campaign could have done one of two things: acquire more existing accounts, or create new ones in large numbers. The latter is a major tell-tale sign of state sponsored disinformation campaigns, such as the one we\u2019ve seen the Russians wage in the US ahead of the 2016 Presidential Election.", "The second tranche of Chinese troll tweets was not just bigger in all aspects, but as the 2nd chart on the right shows, a suspiciously large number of new accounts were created in 2019. The spike from May to July far outstripped what we saw in the first tranche of Chinese troll tweets (left):", "The 2,320 accounts created between May and August 2019 accounted for nearly 54% of the total number of accounts in the second tranche of 4,301 troll accounts. Beijing likely felt that it had to step up its campaign in the face of escalating tension and protests in Hong Kong.", "But this likely backfired as there\u2019s no way Twitter\u2019s monitoring team wouldn\u2019t have noticed a suspiciously high number of accounts in a country that has banned Twitter (Twitter said the accounts were \u201cbased in the PRC\u201d).", "Due to time and resource constraints, I chose to focus my analysis on the Chinese state troll accounts created between May and Aug 2019. A number of of the top trolls in this second tranche, however, were created much earlier.", "A deeper dive into the entire second tranche will have to be left to better resourced research institutes. Below are some of the interesting characteristics of the second tranche that I found:", "A. LANGUAGE SETTING, TWEET LANGUAGE USED", "The full set of tweets in both tranches comprised multiple languages, such as Bahasa Indonesia, and were stuffed full of spam content on sports, porn, global politics etc.", "But the Chinese agency behind the disinformation campaign appeared to be more focused during the \u201csurge\u201d phase, creating troll accounts that were predominantly set to English and Chinese. These new troll accounts also tweeted primarily in Chinese and English, as the breakdown below shows:", "As expected, the troll accounts created during this \u201csurge\u201d period were tweeting/retweeting most frequently in July, when the protests and clashes on the streets escalated to a level hitherto unseen. Let\u2019s break it down in greater detail:", "For about a third of the time in July, at least 400 troll accounts were tweeting on any given day. The peak was on July 9, when 420 troll accounts were tweeting/retweeting on the same day.", "Worth noting what took place on July 9: HK CE Carrie Lam announced that the extradition bill was dead and that her government\u2019s work on the legislation had been a \u201ctotal failure\u201d.", "I broke the distribution of the tweets down further into specific day-hour-minute timeframes. You can explore the detailed breakdown by downloading the interactive version of the chart below here:", "A detailed and rigorous content analysis of the full corpora of the tweets is outside the scope of my abilities. I would recommend a separate look as well at the text of the retweets, as they often reflect the key messages that the trolls and their bosses are trying to spread.", "A simple term frequency chart also re-confirmed the influential role of one of the lead troll accounts \u2014 @ctcc507, aka Dream News. Note how prominently the account\u2019s screen name appeared in this list of top50 most used terms in the English retweets during the \u201csurge\u201d period:", "Here\u2019s a quick sample of the @ctcc507 tweets that the other troll accounts retweeted:", "@ctcc507 was retweeted 465 times in this small subset alone. The sample above leaves no doubt as to the messages the troll accounts were trying to push. Elsewhere in the retweets, we see the trolls continue to promote the conspiracy theory about foreign intervention in the HK protests (several variations of \u2018ulterior motives\u2019 ranked near the top).", "To deal with the far larger body of text in the Chinese tweets, I focused only on the tweets in July. The Chinese tweets that month was however the largest chunk by far during the surge period, and consisted of about 35,000 tweets. And like in the case of the English troll content, retweets made up the bulk of Chinese language troll tweets.", "Top terms in Chinese \u201coriginal\u201d tweets:", "What I\u2019ve noticed from the term frequency counts above and a weekend of looking through the tweets is the higher usage of terms condemning the protestors who turned violent. The term \u66b4\u5f92 (violent thugs) and the call to punish the violent protestors (\u4e25\u60e9 \u66b4\u5f92) came up more prominently in the second tranche of tweets, compared to the first.", "But a fuller content analysis is needed to confirm if this indeed reflected a change in \u201cnarrative\u201d focus in the disinformation campaign.", "I had previously used Scattertext plots to visualise the first tranche of Chinese state troll tweets. The visual value of such plots isn\u2019t that high a second time round, I feel, but I kept the plots in the notebook for the useful search function at the bottom left corner of the plots.", "If you download the html files, you can use use the search box to easily find tweets and retweets associated with the desired search terms, such as \u201culterior motives\u201d. This could be valuable for future research.", "However, when you attempt to create Scattertext plots from a large corpora of Chinese text, the resulting files are huge and practically un-useable on consumer-level computers.", "So for practical reasons, I opted to focus just on just 2 top trolls in the second tranche of state troll tweets \u2014 @bindarsou and @hk_observer. Both were retweeted regularly by the less active troll accounts, and account for about 45,000 tweets between them. @bindarsou is by far the larger of the two accounts.", "A quick re-cap on interpreting the Scattertext plot:", "Well, this is about as much time a \u201ccitizen data analyst\u201d like me can devote to this analysis.
