They are near and dear to us, we want to keep working on them, and we see the value in them. Each project adds to the amount we have provided, and we don\u2019t always want to share that work. But what if someone comes up and wants to take your new project from you? Would you let them?", "At work, I began working on a project to combine analytic results and analyze their performance in a new way. I thought it might be an exciting project to work on and familiarize me with the analytics we had thus far. As I started this project, I hosted several meetings with different groups of people to understand their use cases and how they would use the code in the end. I wanted to make sure I understood as much as possible to develop the work\u2019s architecture in a usable and expandable way. What I was not prepared for was the last meeting I had on this project.", "The last meeting included two data scientists who would be end-users of the code, and one software developer who I thought may have some good insight into how to progress the work forward. I was not prepared for them to step off the meeting and ask for a quick call. This call was to express their excitement at the proposed work and how they felt after finding a passion project that would provide value to the team. After this call, I developed a series of user stories that would be worked on for this feature that they now owned. We met later in the day, and by the next sprint, had planned out how they would begin working on the development of this code.", "After many meetings, discussions on the work at hand, and a sprint planning session, the project I thought I would work on was no longer mine. And that is okay. After sitting back and reflecting on this situation, it taught me a few things.", "Projects come and go in the workplace, but sometimes those projects go to other developers or data scientists. You need to step back and understand when it is okay to let go and let someone else take on the work. In my case, it was clear that this developer had found something they were passionate about and that they felt could provide value to the team. Instead of keeping the project, I let them take on the work and enjoy it. Understand that these moments will come to you, and you will need to decide on the next steps. Do you give the project to someone else, or do you keep it?", "This moment was one of my first experiences in realizing that, as a team lead, I needed to make sure my teammate\u2019s voices were heard. Taking a step back to evaluate the situation and defining the work scope with this developer allowed us to talk one-on-one with each other. This time allowed for an open and honest discussion of the proposed work. We discussed how the work would benefit the team and how the developer felt compared to others and their work.", "Getting to sit back and listen to this person\u2019s viewpoint on the situation gave me more insight into how they perceived the team and their contributions. It was clear they were beginning to feel that they were not providing enough valuable work even though other groups outside our own were utilizing their contributions. Take that step back and recognize these moments. Have conversations with those you work with to better understand how they feel about their work. Do they think they are not contributing enough or that their work is not valued? Is there anything you can do to work with them on that? You may not have all the answers, but you can start the conversation.", "After stepping back from this work to allow someone else to take it over, we continued to discuss how the end product can be used for different use cases. These discussions brought up one of the original use cases I had in mind, and the more we talked, the more I was able to see the vision of a new project come into play. In the end, the work taken over by the other developer made that person happy that their project would be valuable to the team. This work resulted in me writing more user stories for the envisioned next project and planning future sprints that would incorporate the developer\u2019s work.", "All in all, I walked away from a project I wanted to work on, and it gave me more than I could have asked for. As the project started, I got a happy developer working on a passion project that they are excited for and a new project planned for future work after his developments have been added. As for myself, I pivoted to something else that provided me with some unique challenges to face.", "Sometimes you need to let a project go to someone else, and that\u2019s okay.", "Your home for data science.
