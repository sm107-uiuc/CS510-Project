It will not be a stretch to say that these AI models know us better than we know ourselves! While this is quite amazing, it is also, at the same time, quite frightening. With increasing algorithmic complexity, we are paying the cost of decreasing interpretability and trust. It means that the more complex a model is, the less likely we understand how it works. It is the main reason why these AI models are called black-boxes: we do not know the why behind these complex algorithms.", "The reality is that these algorithms are becoming a part of our daily lives: from the Facebook newsfeed to TikTok to our recent online credit card applications are interactions all driven by power AI algorithms \u2014 most of which are black-boxes. As we are actively using these algorithms in mission-critical use cases like predicting cancer or accidents or evaluating a candidate based on text representing them, we need frameworks and techniques to help us navigate and open up these black-boxes.", "In short, model developers need to answer these five major questions:", "The role of the data scientist or the model developer is to answer all these questions confidently. Responsibly building these algorithms, removing biases, understanding model behaviour and ensuring trust are the core of what a data scientist needs to accomplish.", "In light of the increasing importance of xAI, I provide a model explainability framework to ensure interpretability and fairness across the ML lifecycle.", "Please note, I will not dive into various explainability techniques in this article, but I will be publishing a series of articles and videos that will introduce explainability concepts in a thorough but fun way. So stay tuned for them.", "To circumvent the scope of the framework, I will only focus on the Model Building & Validation Stage of the machine learning lifecycle. I also assume that you have already defined the use case, prepared the data and are now ready to build the model.", "In the model building and validation stage, there are two personal goals you have to achieve:", "Confidence: ensure your model is robust, reliable and fair.Communication & Trust: share model insights with stakeholders", "So here is the five-step framework:", "First things first, in high-stake environments where even a single mistake can have a dramatic impact or can cost a lot of money, you should always start with interpretable models. Starting with black-box models can usually be an uphill battle.", "Regardless of what type of model you decided to go with, start with defining test cases \u2014 sets of cases for which the model should behave as expected. Do this exercise to verify and validate your model. This step also requires collaboration with other stakeholders who have the domain and business knowledge to offer.", "After defining the test cases, go one step further and build edge cases \u2014 sets of cases for which the model behaviour is particularly uncertain or unexpected. It is an excellent strategy to stress-test your machine learning model.", "Next, you should employ model agnostic interpretability techniques like SHAP, counterfactuals, surrogate decision trees, ProtoDash or IG. These methods provide explanations on a global level (explaining the whole model) and on a local level (individual predictions made by the model).", "Unfortunately, there are so many techniques out there that it is overwhelming to choose the right one. Once you finalize the interpretability method, you have to code it, customize it to fit your model and data, fix any errors along the way, optimize it for speed and use other toolsets for visualizing the results.", "Every different technique comes with its own set of challenges. Luckily, you can use explainX, which is an open-source explainable AI library that provides state of the art model interpretability techniques under one roof and makes them accessible with just a single line of code \u2014 saving a tremendous amount of hours of coding, debugging and effort from your side.", "By accessing these interpretability techniques, you should describe your model through four lenses:", "Most of these lenses are pretty straightforward, but you should also focus on features to gain a better understanding of your model. You can quickly test your model plausibility and suitability by analyzing feature rankings. Additionally, explaining a single model is helpful but comparing & contrasting two or more models in parallel is more effective. It helps you progressively build, compare and refine your models.", "After you understand your model through multiple lenses, it is time to communicate your narrative with stakeholders. The goal here is to improve your model through feedback and obtain their trust. Remember, the communication will be iterative, and feedback will be crucial in helping you further optimize your model performance.", "Ideally, share an interactive dashboard with insights using language and representations that stakeholders can understand. Stakeholders should be able to add their comments or ask for clarification seamlessly.", "Kudos for making it till the end. Explaining and debugging a black-box machine learning model is a difficult task. But with the right framework and explainability techniques, you will be able to do it in no time. Good news for you: explainX is open-source.", "In the next article, I will share an interpretability framework for deployment, maintenance and the usage stage.", "Till then, let there be light.", "Your home for data science.
