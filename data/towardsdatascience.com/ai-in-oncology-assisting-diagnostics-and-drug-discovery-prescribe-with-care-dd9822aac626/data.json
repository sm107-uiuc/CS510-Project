Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a growing market \u2014 especially in healthcare \u2014 with no signs of slowing down. The use of AI in healthcare alone is anticipated to reach $6.8 billion by 2021. Companies and countries alike are seeing the value of focusing on AI research. The European Commission announced last year they would be investing \u20ac20 billion into AI by the end of 2020. This investment would cover many aspects of AI technology, including healthcare.", "But what is AI exactly and more importantly, what\u2019s all the hype about?", "Simply put, AI is the development of computer programs to complete tasks that imitate human intelligence. Things such as visual and speech recognition as well as complex decision making are tasks AI is developed to complete. Rather than just collecting and organizing data, AI applications are able to interpret and adapt to large amounts of data and documentation.", "Healthcare databases are often highly complicated but full of useful information that can be used for drug discovery and precision medicine. Using AI In healthcare can help improve the organization of data as well as accelerate research breakthroughs.", "AI does this by using various methods like Machine Learning. Machine learning tools are able to recognize patterns in user behavior or patient outcomes to create their own logic. This allows AI healthcare programming to learn and evolve \u2014 constantly improving outcomes and efficiency.", "Machine Learning is one of the many tasks AI applications are capable of. Another is Natural Language Processing where AI programs interpret spoken, typed, and handwritten words. This is especially helpful when evaluating healthcare dictation software as well as medical documentation. Interpreting this large amount of data and storing it is what is called big data, where AI applications are constantly collecting and organizing data. The more information these programs have to learn from, the quicker they adapt and increase productivity.", "Cancer screening and detection, as well as advances in oncology research, are all areas that benefit from AI technology. I am the COO of Universal DX \u2014 an oncology diagnostics company \u2014 which uses machine learning for diagnostics research. Working with AI in oncology provides many insights into the benefits and challenges of AI. Below I take a comprehensive look at current advances in AI as well as precautions that must be made.", "The use of AI in healthcare has a far and wide reach. From cancer diagnostics to robotic-assisted surgery, AI applications are helping improve efficiency and patient outcomes in oncology. You can see in the graph below how diagnostics are a major component in healthcare AI deals \u2014 illustrating the value AI technology can bring to research studies.", "There have been many studies already done showing how AI can be just as effective \u2014 if not more effective \u2014 than human interpretation of radiology studies and lab results. Researchers in China recently studied how using a deep learning program helped improve interpretation outcomes when evaluating a new brain tumor diagnosis. This program evaluates MRI imaging to classify and map out images as well as assist with surgical planning. When compared to tumor segmentations done manually by the surgeon, the AI application to aid with cancer detection was found to be more accurate and efficient.", "Breast cancer is the most common cancer found in women and it\u2019s no surprise researchers are looking for more ways to assist in cancer detection and treat breast cancer. Therapixel has developed an AI program to interpret mammogram results by comparing a current image to thousands of stored mammogram images. By comparing and analyzing the collection of stored images, this AI program will provide data determining if the patient needs additional tests to rule out cancer. Therapixel claims their AI program more accurately assesses the need for a patient to return for further imaging compared to a radiologist \u2014 a step that can be costly as well as stressful for the patient.", "Evaluating pathology slides when determining a cancer diagnosis is very time-consuming to pathologists as there is such a large amount of data to review. Harvard Medical School developed an AI program to assist pathologists in diagnosing breast cancer cells. Researchers created a program to evaluate millions of pathology slides identified as cancer and noncancer cells. This allowed the AI program to create prediction algorithms and produce probability heatmaps. The AI program predicted with an accuracy of 92% compared to 96% of the pathologist accuracy. But, it did show a pathologist using the AI program had the highest accuracy rate \u2014 highlighting how AI tools may be best utilized when being used by researchers versus completely autonomously.", "In the same vein of improving diagnostics, Google is developing an AI microscope program to help pathologists detect cancer. Google\u2019s Augmented Reality Microscope actively analyzes images using Machine Learning algorithms. Not only are AI diagnostic tools helping pathologists, but they are also assisting patients as well. Skin Vision is a company that has developed an app for iOS and Android users that takes pictures of your skin to evaluate a suspicious lesion. The app then helps determine the risk of that spot of being cancerous \u2014 prompting further evaluation from a healthcare provider.", "It\u2019s now well known personalized medicine creates better patient outcomes when treating cancer. In addition to detecting cancer, AI technology is showing promise when it comes to differentiating genetic mutations to allow for precision medicine. By evaluating and pinpointing genetic mutations, oncologists are better able to treat their patients.", "Personalized, or precision medicine requires constant analysis of genetic mutations in order to discover new treatments. Using AI tools such as Machine Learning and big data can help streamline this data collection and even help with drug discovery.", "Switzerland\u2019s Sophia Genetics is using big data to help analyze the genomic makeup of a patient\u2019s cancer cells. They offer a kit using AI technology to compare a patient\u2019s DNA to a large database to determine if there are genetic mutations to target using precision medicine. Using AI technology, Sophia Genetics is helping to detect alterations in many countries around the world when treating solid tumors such as lung, colorectal, skin, and brain cancers.", "AI technology helps differentiate healthy versus cancer cells and determine genetic mutations \u2014 but it\u2019s also helping researchers develop cancer treatment drugs. The pharmaceutical company Novartis has teamed up with technology powerhouse Microsoft to apply AI tools to drug discovery efforts. Using big data and Machine Learning technology from Microsoft, researchers at Novartis can analyze vast amounts of data looking for new ways to apply gene therapy. By having these tools, the time it takes to make these discoveries could be drastically shortened, leading to faster drug discovery and development.", "Although AI is providing a lot of hope and promise in regards to healthcare advancements, there are a few challenges that must be addressed. Prior to analyzing big data, there is the task of combining the data. The rise in the use of electronic health records has created a wide variety of options for healthcare organizations to choose from. With so many healthcare database platforms in use, this creates the challenge of sharing information amongst them. There can be different verbiage used for the same diagnosis or treatment, discrepancies in the documentation, as well as erroneous data entry.", "Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a global network for providers and healthcare organizations to share medical information with one another nor a global way to \u201cstructure data\u201d. In order for AI tools to work effectively and identify trends, healthcare data must be collected and combined safely \u2014 keeping in mind the data being used is personal medical information.", "Companies are actively working on addressing this issue, but there is still work to be done. Riovant is a pharmaceutical company that claims to normalize healthcare data, by taking into consideration all the variances of data collection. By normalizing patient and research data, this ensures the accuracy of data interpretation when developing new drugs. Combining electronic health records as a whole will take more time, as there are many financial and proprietary factors at play.", "Another challenge lies in that databases are not all created equal when it comes to quality, clean data. A minor tying error can mean the difference between nanomolars and millimolars when collecting data on the binding affinity of molecules. When using AI technology, seemingly small errors can create a snowball effect of misinformation and misinterpretation. Essentially, the results produced are only as good as the data being used to create the AI algorithms.", "Another challenge to AI in healthcare is the limitation to audit and evaluate how well AI programs are evaluating big data. AI programs often take large amounts of data and provide an answer, but there isn\u2019t always a way to evaluate how that conclusion was made. The human touch to consider pros and cons to decision making isn\u2019t present \u2014 which can sometimes eliminate looking at the big picture of patient care. AI program outcomes cannot be interpreted as infallible facts as the very allure of AI is there is a reasoning component which may not always align with the reasoning of the researcher, physician, or patient.", "It\u2019s clear AI in healthcare can provide many benefits to researchers, healthcare organizations, and patients. By applying AI tools, breakthroughs in cancer diagnostics, as well as treatment, can be made faster than ever. But caution must be taken to ensure data is shared safely and that data is shared accurately. There must always be a fine balance of human touch and machine to help prescribe with care.", "Your home for data science.
