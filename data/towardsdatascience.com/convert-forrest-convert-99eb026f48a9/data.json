He earned his PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from Dartmouth College. His graduate research applied machine learning techniques to functional neuroimaging data to understand how the brain interprets object identity in photographs and drawings.", "For my Insight project I collaborated with Ongo Science, a start up based in San Francisco. Ongo is a platform that builds apps for content creators in the health and wellness space and facilitates information flow to and from their users. Most online wellness experts broadcast out information on topics like nutrition, meditation, and athletic training and count \u2018likes\u2019 or read comments to decipher their impact. Ongo enables a more detailed view, providing content creators with insights about their users\u2019 goals, progress, and challenges. This information can help guide and customize new content and maximize engagement and impact. The role of data in personalized health and wellness is expanding. In fact, researchers estimate that the average person will generate more than 1 million gigabytes of health data in their lifetime.", "As a nexus between devices, apps, and experts, Ongo is positioned to streamline the process of data ingestion and analysis to help people live healthier lives. In my consulting project, I analyzed data from The Run Experience, an Ongo app that provides content related to training, injury-prevention, and racing as well as personalized coaching and a community hub for runners. I used interactions with the app as well as data from smartphones and wearables to predict which users would convert to the premium subscription plan. The name of my project draws on the enthusiasm of people throughout the 1994 movie Forrest Gump who encouraged the protagonist with shouts of \u201cRun, Forrest, Run!\u201d In this case, however, the aim is encouraging users of The Run Experience to convert from the free version to the paid premium subscription.", "User retention is a big problem for mobile apps, with approximately 80% of users leaving within 3 days of installation and 90% leaving within the first month. Although paying subscribers usually make up only a small proportion of users for most apps, they are much less likely to leave, churning at an average rate of 5\u201330% per month. Renewals from continuing subscribers is an important revenue stream \u2014 especially for apps in the start-up phase \u2014 and analyses from the Harvard Business Review estimate that increasing retention by just 5% can lead to long-term increases in revenue up to 95%. Health and fitness apps are particularly effective at retaining loyal users, with 75% of users engaging with these apps at least twice a week and 26% engaging more than 10 times per week.", "With these statistics in mind, my project aimed to identify whether or not users would eventually convert to the premium subscription based on their initial app use. This information could help target incentives and promotions toward active users who might not subscribe otherwise, increasing the base of loyal users and associated revenue.", "I was given access to over 2 billion rows of data hosted on Amazon Web Services, comprising activity from The Run Experience app as well as GPS data from the app\u2019s run tracker and Apple HealthKit data from iOS users who had linked their accounts. One table of data also included information on the user-set goal (related to health, injury-prevention, racing, etc.) and subscription history. I filtered the data down to approximately 24 million rows from the user population described below and temporally aligned it based on the date of download in order to aggregate and examine activity within the initial period of app use.", "Before launching an app with Ongo, The Run Experience was already the #1 YouTube channel for running. Possibly because of previous experience with this channel, many app users begin a premium subscription immediately after downloading the app. The Run Experience also offers a 7-day free trial of their premium features and many users begin it on day 1. Most of these users convert at the end of the trial. Users continue to subscribe over a variable time period after this initial burst so I made the assumption that those who take longer to decide are more likely new to The Run Experience and probably base their decision on interaction with the app itself rather than prior experience with the content.", "I chose to focus on active users who did not subscribe within the first 2 weeks. This decision allowed me to exclude users who were already familiar with the product, and to incorporate data over a sufficient time period to differentiate users who would subscribe and those who would not. These users have similar overall numbers of logins during their first two weeks.", "Data within the app spanned a wide variety of activity types including metadata from viewing workout session videos, GPS tracks of runs recorded in the app, and social content such as posts and likes. Upon downloading the app, each user was also prompted to select a goal \u2014 Overall Health, Injury-Prevention, Racing, or Other. Users on iOS devices who linked their Apple HealthKit data also had information about their step counts as well as heart rate and weight if they had smart devices that recorded this information.", "\u201cSession\u201d data included information about what videos the user watched, whether they completed the video, and feedback on the session (thumbs-up or thumbs-down). Users could also join a \u201cProgram,\u201d such as a 5k or half marathon training program, made up of session videos designed to reach a specific goal. Social interactions included posting questions and comments in the forum as well as liking other users\u2019 posts. GPS data included the distance and time of each run among other metrics.", "From this broad variety of data, I engineered 19 features. These included measures of in-app activity such as the number of sessions videos started and percent completed, enrollment in programs, and social interactions as well as the number of times a user logged 500+ steps within 30 minutes or registered an elevated heart rate (over 120 beats per minute) during the 2-week period examined. My features covered a broad set of user behavior, but future iterations of this project could include features engineered from more fine-grained details in the data, such as the actual text of comments; distance, time, and elevation of GPS-tracked runs; and minute-by-minute average heart rate.", "I compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict subscription. Logistic Regression estimates the log odds ratio of a binary class label (subscriber vs. non-subscriber in this case) using a linear combination of independent variables. A strength of this model is that the weights the model learns for these features can guide interpretation of how individual features contribute to the prediction. Unfortunately, correlated features can mask each others\u2019 effects, leading to low weights for predictive features. Random Forest classification is a non-linear ensemble model that uses bagging and random feature-sampling to build a forest of decision trees, with each contributing a \u201cvote\u201d toward the final prediction. Aggregating information across uncorrelated trees increases the robustness of the model and divides importance among collinear features, but sacrifices ease of interpretation, although feature-importance can still be extracted from the model using metrics such as Gini importance.", "Python\u2019s scikit-learn package provides simple implementations for both of these models along with functions for cross-validation and evaluation. I began by partitioning the data into a 60/20/20 train/validation/test split. I used 5-fold cross-validated recursive feature elimination (using scikit-learn\u2019s RFECV) on the training data to choose features for each model, stratifying the proportion of subscribers and non-subscribers across the training and test data within each fold. Since there were far fewer subscribers than non-subscribers, I weighted the classes proportional to their inverse frequency using the class_weight=\u201cbalanced\u201d parameter when initializing each model. Since it is important from a business perspective to identify both subscribers and non-subscribers accurately I used weighted F1 score (a combination of precision and recall, weighted by frequency and combined and across classes) as the metric for evaluation. This procedure indicated an optimal number of 6 features for Logistic Regression and 12 for Random Forest.", "I retrained each model across all of the training data using Recursive Feature Elimination with the selected number of features. At this step, I also used SMOTE to deal with the class imbalance in the data. SMOTE creates new exemplars of the minority class in the training data by using the k-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm to find points in the space of features near to actual exemplars of this class, repeating this process until the number of positive and negative classes (subscribers and non-subscribers) in the training data is equal. I compared the two models by evaluating performance on the validation data. Random Forest performed better, with a weighted F1 score of .74 compared to .65 for Logistic Regression. This makes sense, since much of the data consisted of counts for various activity types. Random Forest modeling is particularly well-suited for this kind of data because it proceeds by finding informative cut points within the range of values for each feature at each branch of the decision trees that comprise the forest. This non-linear approach likely lead to the improved fit compared to the assumptions of linearity implicit in Logistic Regression.", "For the final model evaluation I trained the Random forest model on data pooled across the training and validation sets and used SMOTE again to address the class imbalance. I used the same features identified at the model comparison stage and evaluated the model on the held-out test set. The final model performed fairly well with a weighted F1 score of .79 and accuracy of .78.", "The model performed particularly well identifying non-subscribers (Precision=.87, Recall=.86), suggesting that this model will be useful for identifying users who are unlikely to subscribe despite relatively high levels of overall activity. Ongo and The Run Experience can put this model into use incentivizing this population to convert, possibly by offering further incentives such as a discounted rate or a preview of the premium coaching services.", "Looking at the feature importance scores extracted from the Random Forest model reveals that actions are particularly important in predicting who will convert. The number of logins over the two weeks was the most important feature by far, with the number of sessions started and information from Apple HealthKit about periods of elevated step count and heart rate also showing a large amount of importance. Early intervention could lead to higher subscription rates and a significant increase in revenue.", "These features track fairly well with intuition \u2014 users who started and completed workouts or have proof of higher physical activity tend to stick with the app. Somewhat counter-intuitively, however, the users\u2019 initial goals were not predictive of eventual subscription and were eliminated during the feature selection stage. This indicates that differences in goals are not generally associated with a change in likelihood to subscribe, at least in the sample examined in my project. Social interactions were also not very predictive, although these interactions were fairly rare. Another way to turn this insight into action is for Ongo and The Run Experience to encourage users to focus on getting started with workout sessions and runs right away rather than spending time scrolling through the community platform. Although it is unclear whether the relationship is causal, users who follow this pattern are more likely to subscribe.", "I am interested to see if the patterns observed in Apple HealthKit data hold for users who subscribe immediately after downloading the app. Once users link their HealthKit, previously recorded step counts, heart rate, and weight data become available to The Run Experience. These data could differentiate whether downloading the app is associated with an increase in activity or if subscribers already tend to be more active than non-subscribers before downloading the app.", "My final deliverable includes a workflow implemented in a Jupyter notebook that ingests data from Ongo\u2019s S3 bucket on AWS; cleans, pre-processes, and temporally aligns it to the date of app download; and engineers features from Apple HealthKit data and activity within The Run Experience app. The data is then fed into the model in order to predict the likelihood of subscription for active users of the app who have not subscribed after an initial period of use.", "Your home for data science.
