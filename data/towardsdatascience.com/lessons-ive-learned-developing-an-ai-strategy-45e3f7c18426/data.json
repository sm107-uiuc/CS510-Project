In this article, I wanted to show how a large firm thinks and builds its AI strategy.", "Many companies are trying to transition from a state of low maturity to an AI-first model. However, becoming an AI-first organization is proving to be extremely difficult but also highly rewarding...", "I believe that large firms have reached the era of Operational AI. They have a couple of AI projects that have reached production and bring a real added-value in their processes or products. Moreover, they have established AI results as a new standard across the company and are engaged in an ongoing cycle of improvement.", "Before thinking about AI, we spend a lot of time always improving our data culture through several initiatives (curated data pipeline, data lakes, etc. ). It is the foundation for an AI ecosystem to work in the first place.", "Obviously, companies with data lakes of high quality data can train the best AI systems; the best systems find the widest usage; the wide usage of these systems contributes yet more data to the data lakes of the largest companies with the best AI systems.", "That data can then be used to improve existing models and create entirely new ones, creating a reinforcing/virtous cycle. Those with the most data are often able to train the best AI systems and those with the best AI systems are often able to collect the most data.", "This race to data has a strategic importance. Indeed, once enough data is collected (and the processes for data collection in real-time are efficient) new companies attempting to move into the industry have little option but to rely on data controlled by the early movers.", "I believe that the idea of first-mover advantage is even stronger when it comes to data & AI. Indeed, access to an extensive and relevant dataset means that new efforts at collecting data are pretty much doomed to be highly time-consuming and therefore commercially difficult.", "Our goal is to reach a level of data domination.", "I believe that the data assets that many companies have spent so much time and money accumulating are not really worth that much since they don\u2019t provide a way to dominate a market from a data perspective.", "The best scenario is one in which your proprietary data is extremely valuable (hard and costly to replicate), \u2014 which is why so little is free. I believe that developing your repository of proprietary data will yield value and defensibility over time. We build our strategies by keeping in mind that our data is a way to defend our position on the market.", "Data domination also enables you to test various AI-based ideas. For budget reasons, smaller companies cannot afford to take so much risk. The smaller your data advantage, the lesser your data strategy can work separate from your business strategy. It\u2019s no accident that companies now reaping the benefits of AI invested long before their competitors. Obviously, there also needs to be readiness to close down AI PoCs where no clear benefit is emerging from the early stages.", "The sooner you get started, the harder it will be for competitors to catch up. Better predictions will attract more consumers, more consumers will generate more data to train the AI, more data will lead to better predictions, and so on, creating a virtuous circle. Adopting too early could be costly, but adopting too late could be a strategic mistake.", "Another important element often underestimated is the need to develop partnerships. We spend a lot of time thinking of how we could accumulate more strategic data by partnering with other organizations, universities, data providers or government departments. Establishing a mutually beneficial relationship can offer your company exclusive data and associated benefits.", "I noticed that despite having a lot of data, large firms are still struggling in building effective AI systems. On the other hand, AI startups lack relevant and high-quality data sets to train their models. This situation creates an environment in which both entities need and often collaborate with each other.", "Large companies sit on a lot of data that they don\u2019t even know what to do with, so usually, it\u2019s those people who need help in figuring out what to do but on the other hand, the startup, if they only use open data they might not have the relevance and the quality they really need to train the algorithm.", "I also realized that only a few large firms tend to use open data. Indeed, many companies feel that the types of data published openly by public sector organisations are often of poor quality, and would need to be extensively cleaned and combined with other proprietary data sets to prove useful.", "However, many AI systems are actually trained primarily or exclusively on open or publicly accessible data. For instance, it is possible to train natural language processing systems on text from open sources like Wikipedia or social media like Twitter.", "We also pay a lot of attention to everything that could help us develop our projects with less data. Indeed, we already rely on data augmentation techniques or transfer learning to help but, in the future, we might see another shift thanks to new ways to leverage data.", "Decision-makers are now aware that traditional business models will simply not do in a continuously disrupted business environment. One of the key challenges while building an AI strategy is to find ways to gather useful data and use them to strengthen your position. One of the most interesting ways for gathering data is to build something valuable even without machine learning, and then sell it at a cost to gather data or even give it for free. Usually, this strategy is often used by startups as a business model.", "This idea of building a \u201cdata trap\u201d is useful when you want to collect large amounts of data by providing a lot of value to users from the start. The data exhaust is just a by-product of the utility of the product.", "We also try to move the discussion away from data and more towards intelligent products and processes. Indeed, data may be the foundation, but the foundation needs to be designed to support what sits on top: more intelligent products and business processes.", "Our goal is to enhance all our products or back end operations through AI and create real added-values for the end consumer. I often hear people saying \u201cwe must get into AI\u201d but it is a mistake. Part of the issue is that there is no such thing as an AI business case. Instead, the business case will be for a particular business scenario, problem or use case that employs AI methods and techniques as part of the overall solution.", "In most of our AI projects, we pay great attention to finding the right balance between maintaining our brand image (precision, efficiency, etc.) and the overall accuracy delivered by our models. No model will be 100% error-free. Models will always make some mistakes, but you have to know what the consequence of error is. How will it impact your brand image? How will your customers react?\u2026", "We also seek to create new revenue streams by leveraging the new information at our disposal thanks to AI. We use this approach to drive holistic growth whereby companies are using AI to continuously identify areas where a combination of their own and external data provides them with access to a new market.", "The business model shift is strategic in building long-term competitive advantage because AI is of most value in driving growth when a company uses it to do new things instead of doing the same things, only slightly better.", "For instance, applying AI through a chatbot to improve your website experience sounds great. But, a growing number of companies do this same thing, it\u2019s not differentiating any more. We always try to transform the customer experience, offering something completely new.", "We also think a lot about how can we sell the insights created thanks to our AI initiatives. AI\u2019s knowledge capture ability creates an opportunity for businesses to switch from selling physical products to selling knowledge. For example, a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant could use AI systems to white label its knowledge or processes to its competitors in the same sector.", "AI is more than just a technological solution. We spent a lot of time building a culture around it. Indeed, instead of fighting against each other, different divisions now share their innovative knowledge to provide a customized and cohesive customer experience.", "To enhance our processes, we decided to push to overhaul the company with machine learning. We realize that promoting our datasets and challenged became a powerful lure for potential hires.", "From the early stages of AI adoption and beyond, many companies are either stopped in their tracks or slowed due to several obstacles that range from data, to talent, to the technologies themselves. While AI provides unique abilities to open new markets and create new revenue streams, its benefits are maximized when implemented at scale across an enterprise.", "I firmly believe that a strategy for AI is not enough. Creating a strategy with AI matters as much \u2014 or even more \u2014 in terms of exploring and exploiting a strategic opportunity. Optimizing carefully selected KPIs becomes AI\u2019s strategic purpose.", "Your home for data science.
