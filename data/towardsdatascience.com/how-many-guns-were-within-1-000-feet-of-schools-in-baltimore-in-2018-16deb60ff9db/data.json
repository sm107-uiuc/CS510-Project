With that in mind, I got curious about how many homicides by firearm happened in Baltimore. It was part of my dissertation, but it had to be cut from the dissertation and the presentation because of content and time constraints.", "My data analysis for the dissertation only went up to 2017, so I\u2019ve been curious to see what happened in 2018. So how about we take a look and use R to see what happened? (Please note that a firearm homicide or shooting within 1,000 feet of a school may not have necessarily been done with an unlicensed gun.)", "First, we get data on the firearm homicides and shooting in Baltimore in 2018 from the Baltimore City Open Data portal:", "This gives me a list of 5,343 incidents in which a firearm was used and where there was a location noted. They boil down to this. (Note: These are all crimes reported. The actual number may be different.):", "With that in hand, including the longitude and latitude, we throw them on a map to see where they happened. To create that map, I used the shapefiles of the Community Statistical Areas (CSAs) from the city\u2019s Open Data portal.", "Of course, I could have done all this in QGIS or ArcGIS, and it would have produced a map like this:", "It\u2019s very crowded because there were that many firearm-related crimes. The thing about doing this in QGIS and other programs with point-and-click interfaces is that you\u2019re not exactly recording what you just did. You\u2019d have to take the time to write a how-to manual to replicate this map above exactly. That, or you\u2019d do a screen recording.", "This is where programs like R come in. With it, you\u2019re literally writing the how-to manual as you write your code. Well-commented code allows for the next person to grab your code and replicate your results exactly, with little effort to figure out what you did and how you did it. So let\u2019s replicate the map above in R, and even get some statistics on which school had the most number of firearm crimes.", "First, we\u2019re going to load some libraries. I\u2019ve commented the use of each library.", "Now, let\u2019s bring in the data.", "Now, let\u2019s turn crimes from a dataframe into a proper shapefile, and give it the right projection.", "A simple line of code to look at the number of firearm crimes by type.", "Next, because we\u2019re going to be putting layers on top of each other, we need to make sure that they all have the right projection (Coordinate Reference System).", "With all the layers on the same projection, let\u2019s build our first map using tmap.", "Let\u2019s build a second map of school locations. (Here, I don\u2019t have as many comments because it\u2019s a replication of the first map above.):", "Now, let\u2019s create a map of firearm-related crimes and school locations:", "Now, we\u2019re going to create a 1,000-ft buffer around the schools:", "Make sure you convert your feet to meters, and make sure to verify that what you\u2019ve created is what you were looking for.", "Now, let\u2019s see those buffers around the schools on a map:", "Here is what it looks like:", "And now, let\u2019s create the final map:", "And this is what that looks like:", "Does that look like the map created in QGIS? Absolutely. Just some tweaking to what the markers look like \u2014 and their sizes \u2014 and we get two similar maps.", "The good thing about tmap is that it allows you to create an interactive map with just a quick line of code. (The other R package, leaflet, does something similar, and might even be a little more \u201crobust,\u201d in my opinion.)", "Now, for analyzing the data, let\u2019s create a dataframe by joining all the points into the buffer zones.", "If \u201cNAME\u201d is NA (not available), then that means that the point is not inside a buffer. I subsetted that into \u201ccrimesbuffer\u201d where I will do the analysis of the 182 schools with at least one (1) gun-related crime within 1,000 feet, and I could even do an analysis of the 2,485 crimes that happened within 1,000 feet of a school.", "From this, I found that the school with the most firearm-related crimes within 1,000 feet of it was William Paca Elementary at 200 N Lakewood Ave.", "That school had 81 firearm-related crimes within 1,000 feet from it.", "From here, the types of analyses you can do are only limited by your data and your imagination. You can extract socioeconomic data from the CSA shapefiles and do a regression to see if anything is predictive of the number of firearm-related crimes within 1,000 feet of schools. (Remember that you\u2019re dealing with count data, so you\u2019ll need to use the Poisson distribution or maybe even a negative binomial regression. Also, remember to deal with spatial autocorrelation.)", "At the very least, you can now go to policymakers or the parent-teacher associations and tell them which schools are at higher risk of having firearm-related crimes close to them. If you\u2019re really ambitious, you could use the time codes on the crime data and compare crimes during school hours versus crimes after hours. Finally, you can expand or reduce the buffer to something that is significant to your audience.", "A previous version of this blog post appeared on my blog, Epidemiological, on May 19, 2019.", "Ren\u00e9 F. Najera, MPH, is an epidemiologist, amateur photographer, running/cycling/swimming enthusiast, father, and \u201call around great guy\u201d (according to confidential sources with knowledge of the internal workings of his head).
