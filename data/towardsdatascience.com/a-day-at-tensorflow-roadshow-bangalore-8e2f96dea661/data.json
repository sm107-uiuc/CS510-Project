I didn\u2019t get a confirmation last year but I was glad I got a chance to witness the event this time and I have decided to share all the things that happened over the course of the event.", "There were a total of 16 talks and I would like to give a brief of overall information that is shared", "A brief overview of what developments have allowed the rapid development of deep learning is present which are", "Few applications of usage of Tensorflow in real world are shown :-", "Has support for preprocessing and tokenization in-built in tensorflow", "Support for Ragged tensors since the tensor size need not be constant for text", "Different types of tokenizers like whitespace tokenizer, unicode tokenizer and wordpiece tokenizer are discussed", "Has in-built support for vocabulary but supporting all the languages is a huge task. Wordpiece vocabulary generation is used to reduce the vocabulary", "TF Lite is used to deploy on-device models on mobiles and embedded devices. On-device ai is important due to latency, network connectivity and privacy reasons.", "TF Lite runs on Android, IOS, Raspberry, Microcontrollers etc.", "Google\u2019s portrait mode uses on-device ai", "Model performance on edge devices can be improved in below 3 methods", "In TF 2.0 Delegates are used to move tasks which need to be accelerated using accelerator such as GPU.", "Tensorflow Select acts as bridge for supporting unsupported ops in Tensorflow Lite although unoptimized. TF Lite allows the developers to reduce binary size by removing unnecessary ops.", "Beyond mobile the code runs on other embedded devices like Raspberry, microcontroller etc. with no changes required.", "Easy and simple support for distributing training load across GPU with just a few lines of code. The below strategies are supported", "tf.data input pipeline works seamlessly with any distribution strategy", "Tensorflow Javascript can be run either in browser or with Node.js", "TF JS has support for running inference of existing models, retrain existing models or write a model in Javascript from scratch", "Nothing needs to be installed, TFJS runs by default. All data resides on the client side and hence privacy protective.", "No server-side calls, everything runs on browser. Used WEBGL to get all mathematical operations needed for computation rather than starting from scratch.", "Code runs on laptops, mobiles, anywhere Javascript runs", "TFJS runs with Node.js. Models trained using Tensorflow in python can directly be used in Javascript.", "TFJS api for peprocessing data is available now.", "React Native support is added now.", "To get involved with Tensorflow, Explore ML academy events are happening across India. Interested students can volunteer.", "Tensorflow usergroups are present in Bangalore and other places for interested people.", "Can join any Special Interest Group for Tensorflow as well.", "Tensorflow RFC\u2019s can be commented upon for suggestions or issues", "Model optimization can be done in two days, optimizing after training or optimizing along with training.", "Quantization :- Reduce precision from float32 to float16. It improves the performance, reduces the model size but is a lossy transformation.", "Post training quantization :- Train and save the model, convert using TF Lite converter. Optimization options can be specified during converting. But there is more loss since optimization is done after training", "Can quantize just weights using hybrid optimization or can perform full integer quantization of weights+activations by sending a representative dataset.", "Quantization aware training :- Apply optimization during training such that the network is aware of the optimization happening and hence can perform better compared to above. In this the optimization is applied on the forward pass of training just like how it\u2019s done during inference. Since now the network is being trained on the kind of weights it will see in inference it can optimize better to achieve good results within the constraints.", "Tensorflow Extended(TFX) helps you build a complete end-to-end machine larning pipeline. TFX integrates with a meta-data store. This helps in tracking multiple experiments, comparing results and model performance etc.", "Has support for data visualization using Tensorflow Data Visualization(TFDV)", "Support for preprocessing such as tokenization with Tensorflow Transform", "Tensorflow Serving for versioning and supporting multiple models.", "Provided an example of the pipeline demonstrating dealing with Chicago Cab Dataset .", "The advantage of Swift compared to Python is it\u2019s fast and it has interoperability with both C and python directly. Cross-platform, easy to learn and use, opensource. Supports differential programming.", "Demo and colab code for swift is displayed.A new course by fast.ai for Deep Learning with Swift is released.", "Overall it has been an exciting and informative day. Could get to learn a lot of things which I hadn\u2019t heard about before and get updated with all the latest developments. I am looking forward to what awaits in the future.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Deep Learning Engineer@Samsung R&D.
