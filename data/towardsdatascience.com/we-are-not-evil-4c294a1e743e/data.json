Overall, this particular global subculture, to which I count myself, is mostly optimistic, believing in progress, and ultimately wanting to improve the world through technology.", "Following the news, you might get a different picture of AI and the people behind it. When the Banjo story broke [1], we learned that major figures throughout AI history have been White supremacists [2]. Since the COMPAS scandal [3] we read about gender and racial bias in just about any major AI system out there. Just a few days ago, IBM, Amazon, and Google desperately pulled the plug on their facial recognition Softwares [4\u20136], seeing no other way to prevent unfair treatment of minorities. Even worse, statistics, the very mathematical discipline behind all modern Machine Learning and Data Science, has now itself been suspected of being racist, as it has been developed, in large parts, by eugenicists [7, 8].", "Although statistics, like science in general, is certainly full of ethical contamination (to use a term by Ron Howard [9]), it is, by itself, hardly evil. Neither are we, the vast majority of passionate data scientists and Machine Learning engineers from all around the world, who rely on statistics in everything we do.", "No, statistics is not the problem, it is vital to the solution. It is the one necessary tool to reveal discrimination and injustice anywhere.Only by means of systematic data analysis and statistics, can the unfair practices prevalent in today\u2019s companies and institutions be at all revealed. Statistics allows us to quantify injustice and to monitor whether we are making progress reducing it.", "How did ProPublica uncover the COMPAS scandal? By use of statistics and Data Science, as you can see from their code. How do we know that AI research and development has a diversity problem? By looking at \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 statistics [10]. How could Cathy O\u2019Neil write \u201cWeapons of Math Destruction\u201d? By drawing on her knowledge and experience as a mathematician and Data Scientist. She\u2019s one of the many of us who actually care.", "The problem is not the AI that learned your unethical behavior. The problem is that you behaved unethically, in the first place!", "True, incidents such as the COMPAS scandal show that AI makes unethical decisions. But, dear companies and institutions, the problem is not the AI that learned your unethical behavior. The problem is that you behaved unethically, in the first place!", "A lot of work is done, to identify and correct this. Ethical AI has become an active field of research, resulting in new tools, methods, and best practices to achieve data transparency and algorithmic explainability. And yes, the era of explainable AI is going to be uncomfortable for some corporations and institutions because with increased transparency comes additional scrutiny. Ultimately, though, there is no alternative. It will be through the contribution of statistics that inequality is detected, measured, and fought systematically.", "And we, you and I, will be the ones to bring this about.", "[1] M.
