I\u2019ve selected five articles that I believe will be beneficial in many ways for different levels of machine learning readers. I would recommend finding one or two articles presented below that sit well with you and exploring their contents.", "The selected articles are well written and contain interesting content for different types of machine learning enthusiasts.", "Sukanta Roy\u2019s article touches on a topic that a lot of Machine learning practitioners can relate to, the tutorial trap.", "The tutorial trap is essentially the process of an individual undertaking a series of tutorials on a particular topic and neglecting the need for actual practical knowledge.", "Not only does he explains what the \u2018tutorial trap\u2019 is and the \u2018illusion of competence\u2019 it creates; he also provides us with four guiding beacons that we can hold on to prevent us as learners from repeatedly falling into the tutorial trap.", "One of the mentioned guiding beacons is the holy grail of learning anything machine learning related, which is completing a personal project.", "Sukanta article is a must-read for anyone embarking on their journey in obtaining knowledge in machine learning through online courses.", "It\u2019s impossible to avoid any articles on Covid-19 on the internet. But Cassie Kozyrkov\u2019s article adds a whole different perspective to the Covid-19 conversation that is currently being held.", "She presents 20 guidelines for an individual to consider when consuming Covid-19 related information on the internet.", "Yes, there is a lot of information overload on the current pandemic, which I believe is very much needed. But it is also essential for an individual to be able to separate the noise from useful information, and Cassie\u2019s guidelines do precisely that.", "The presented guidelines are split into two groups of Do\u2019s and Don\u2019t, and each guideline is supplemented with a link to an article that further expands on the topic.", "I am impressed by the sheer amount of information that has been previously written by the author. Some articles are dated months or years ago, but they prove relevant years later.", "I love explanation articles, and even better, simple explanation articles. Megan Dibble has written an interesting article that explains some key topics and concept in machine learning in the most simplistic way possible.", "Although this article is aimed at beginners, I do believe there\u2019s some value to be found for everyone at various levels in machine learning.", "For those who are a bit intimidated by maths within machine learning, Megan has avoided the inclusion of equations or maths and instead supplemented each explanation with some simple and clear diagrams.", "She presents standard supervised and unsupervised machine learning models such as k-means, support-vector machine, and linear regression.", "I still doubt a five-year-old would understand the content of this article, perhaps a genius.", "Still, nonetheless, this article is an easy introduction to standard machine learning terms you are bound to encounter continually.", "Midway through April and the world is still in the grips of the current pandemic.", "We are all aware of the pressure on the global healthcare system and also the impact of the pandemic on the worldwide economy.", "Edouard Harris\u2019s article writes about how the current state of the economy and job market is affecting Data Scientist at work or those seeking work.", "Edouard\u2019s article is very insightful and informative, and he provides statistics for the number of data scientists that are affected either by layoffs or withdrawn of placement.", "Although this article might seem a bit bleak, Edouard\u2019s comparison of the current month, April, to March almost paints a picture of hope.", "The article ends on a light note that reinforces a drastic change that is coming to the way companies work.", "Failure articles are very humbling and interesting, as there is a wealth of knowledge to be discovered from other people\u2019s experience.", "Kyle\u2019s article on the hardship he faced before landing his first job is one that contains detailed information on the interview process a traditional data science job role entails.", "The article provides information on Kyle\u2019s shortcomings and failures that we can all learn from.", "While sharing his experiences on the interviews process and how he finally lands a role, he also provides some tips for readers on how to approach and prepare for interviews.", "I won\u2019t spoil what the main tips are, but they involve tips on how to deal with anxiety, lack of preparation and more.", "This article is suitable for job seekers, but also an interesting read if you just want to pass the time and take a break from coding.", "Your home for data science.
