This article gives an overview of Data\u2026 | by Gaurav Goel | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Data Modeling: An Overview", "description": "If you look at any software application in the world, you will see that at the very fundamental level, it will deal with organization, manipulation and presentation of data to fulfill the business\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["If you look at any software application in the world, you will see that at the very fundamental level, it will deal with organization, manipulation and presentation of data to fulfill the business requirements.", "A data model is a conceptual representation to express and communicate business requirements. It visually represents the nature of data, business rules governing the data, and how the data will be organized in the database.", "The process of data modeling can be compared to the process of construction of a house. Assume that a company ABC needs to build a guest house (data base). It calls a building architect (data modeler) and explains its building requirements (business requirements). Building Architect (data modeler) develops the plan (data model) and gives it to company ABC. Finally company ABC calls civil engineers (DBAs and database developers) to construct the guest house (database)", "Entity and Attributes: The entities are the \u201cthings\u201d in the business environment about which we want to store data e.g Products, Customers, Orders etc. Attributes provide a means of organizing and structuring data. E.g we need to store certain information about the products we sell, such as selling price or quantity available. These pieces of data are the attributes of the Product entity. Entities generally represent tables of database while attributes are columns of those tables.", "Relationship: The relationship between entities describes how one entity is linked to another. In a data model, entities can be related as any of: one-to-one, many-to-one or many-to-many. This is said to be the cardinality of a given entity in relation to another.", "Intersection Entity(Reference Table): In case of many-to-many relationship among entities, an intersection entity can be used to resolve it to many to one and one to many relationships. A simple example is: There are 2 entities, TV Show and Person. Each TV show may be watched by one or more persons while a person can watch one or more TV shows:", "This can be resolved by introducing a new intersecting entity \u2018Viewing record\u201d as follows:", "ER Diagram: A diagram that shows the entities and the relationships between them is called ER diagram. An ER diagram can take the form of Conceptual Data Model, Logical Data Model or Physical Data Model.", "Conceptual Data Model: Conceptual data model includes all major entities and relationships and does not contain much detailed level of information about attributes and is often used in the initial planning phase. An example:", "Logical Data Model: It is an extension of the conceptual data model. It includes all entities, attributes, key groups and relationships that represent business information and define business rules. An example:", "Physical Data Model: It includes all required tables, columns, relationships, database properties, for the physical implementation of databases. Database performance, indexing strategy, physical storage and denormalization are important parameters of a physical model. An example:", "Depending on the business requirements, your data model can be either relational or dimensional. A relational model is a design technique that seeks to remove data redundancy. Data is divided into many discrete entities, each of which becomes a table in the relational database. The tables are generally normalized to 3rd normal form. In OLTP applications, this methodology is followed.", "In case of warehousing requirements, data is denormalized to improve performance. In a dimensional model, the data is split into dimensions and facts whose design goals are user understandability, query performance and resilience to change.", "A company ABC has 200 grocery stores spread over eight states. Each of the stores has different departments like Daily Needs, Cosmetics, Frozen Foods, dairy etc. Each store has roughly around 20000 individual products on its shelves. The individual products are called stock keeping units(SKUs). About 6000 SKUs come from outside manufacturers and have bar codes imprinted on the product package. These bar codes are called Universal Product Codes(UPCs). Data is collected by Point of Sale (POS) system at 2 places: front door where customer takeaway is measured and backdoor where vendors make deliveries.", "At the grocery store, management is concerned with the logistics of ordering, stocking and selling products while maximizing profits. Several promotional schemes such as temporary price reductions, ads in newspapers, displays etc, also keep rising.", "Design a data model for analyzing the operations of this grocery chain.", "Management wants to better understand customer purchases as captured by the POS system. The model should allow analyzing what products are selling in which stores on what days under what promotional conditions. Also, this a warehousing environment, so a dimensional model is needed.", "In the case of a dimensional model, we need to identify our fact and dimension entities. Before developing the model, the grain of data that is required needs to be clarified. In this particular case, we need the grain is individual line item on a POS transaction. As per the requirement, we need to see data about a particular product in a particular store, on a particular day under a particular promotional scheme. This gives us an idea of the dimensions we require:", "The quantities to be calculated(e.g sales quantity, profit etc) will be captured in a Sales Fact table.", "A preliminary data model will be made based on the information gathered about entities. In our case, it will look as follows:", "Step 4: Finalization of attributes and Design of Logical Data Model", "Now, the attributes of the identified Fact and Dimension tables need to be finalized. In our case, the following attributes are finalized:", "Sales Quantity: (e.g no. of cans of veg noodle soups)", "Sales Dollar Amount: Sales Quantity * Unit Price", "Cost Dollar Amount: Dollar cost for the product charged by vendor", "Gross Profit Dollar Amount: Sales Dollar Amt \u2014 Cost Dollar Amt", "The logical data model will look like:", "Step 5: Creation of Physical tables in database:", "With the help of the data modeling tool or by writing custom scripts, the physical tables can now be created in the database.", "Data Modeling is one of the most important tasks in the design of a software application. It lays the foundation of how the data will be organized, stored, retrieved and presented.", "Your home for data science.
