The lack of fairness described in algorithmic bias comes in various form, but can be summarised as the discrimination of one group based on a specific categorical distinction.", "Algorithmic bias takes several forms, for example, racial bias, age discrimination, gender bias etc.", "I\u2019m not aware of what age, race or gender you the reader might be, but I can assure you that everyone is susceptible to the dangers of algorithmic bias.", "What truly is the cause of algorithmic bias, can we truly point any fingers at who\u2019s to blame?", "The bias within algorithm and machine learning systems today emerges as a result of many circumstances.", "Deep learning models function in a manner that draws from the pattern recognition capabilities the neural networks.", "Therefore, it could be said that deep learning models cannot be directly biased by design, and any emergence or cause of bias is external to the architecture and design of the neural network.", "The outputs produced by machine learning models and AI systems are simply a reflection of the training datasets they are exposed to.", "So, we need to take a step back and observe the training data.", "For those who aren\u2019t aware, training data are examples of expected categories that are fed to a neural network. These examples reflect the data exposed to the neural network when used in a real-life scenario.", "There are two main methods I believe training data can cause algorithm bias within AI systems.", "Do note that there might be other ways training data causes algorithm bias. I\u2019ll just focus on the two mentioned above.", "Individuals similar to you and me commonly source training data. Knowingly or unknowingly, we all have internal biases that can be projected in the data collection process involved when building machine learning models.", "Environment bias could occur as a result of locally sourcing training data for an AI system that is purposed to be utilized on a global scale. The AI system might not have been trained with enough data that is representative of the actual scenario it\u2019s expected to operate in.", "In 2015, Jacky Alcin\u00e9 wrote the tweet below. His tweet expressed his concern on the classification algorithm behind Google Photos. The algorithm had misclassified his friend as a gorilla.", "Google claimed to have fixed the issue. But in 2018, Wired tested the system again, and it appeared Google solution was to avoid altogether classifying gorillas and some other primates. It seems that they simply worked around the issue.", "Fast forward to April 2020, and there is still news that Google image labelling service is exhibiting racial bias when it comes to the classification of arms with objects held in them. The labelling system seemed to have classified a black hand holding an object a gun.", "The object held is a thermometer, many of which you might have seen on the news lately. During the current Covid-19 pandemic, these thermometers are becoming a familiar sight as they are used as a method of identifying ill individuals.", "This form of bias, amongst many others, is happening now, in real-time.", "Imagine in the next fifty years, advanced robotic law enforcement systems start governing communities, and they fail to distinguish between a person of colour holding a non-threatening item, from an actual gun.", "What\u2019s even sadder is this is not far from the reality many individuals face today. The only difference is the lack of robots. But that\u2019s an entirely different conversation, that\u2019s addressed continuously.", "One word comes to mind when thinking of a solution to Algorithm and AI bias.", "A step forward would be the inclusion of diversity efforts at the early stages of any process or project within the AI industry. We can even go as far back as encouraging diversity in academic institutions.", "I have experienced the lack of diversity within the technology field. During my MSc in Machine learning and Computer Vision, I could count the number of black students in the whole course. Four to be exact, myself included. There were over 200 students on the course.", "The lack of diversity within institutions might not be intentional, but it should be addressed woefully. If we have more individuals with diverse backgrounds gathering data and building AI systems, we could possibly see the inclusion of segments of datasets that might have been previously overlooked.", "Throughout this article, I\u2019ve focused on the racial bias that exists within an AI system. But we should also be aware of the other forms of bias that can occur. Take, for example, the study carried out by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in 2015 that brought to light the gender discrimination that occurred within Google Ads.", "Long story short, women were less likely to be presented with high paying jobs adverts when compared to their male counterparts.", "Again, the cause of bias within these systems can not be directly pinpointed, but solution efforts can be implemented in all processes associated with the development of an AI product.", "A good start will be ensuring that training data are indeed representative of the practical scenarios that these AI systems are utilized in.", "Another solution can be observed within the legal and policy-making sector. There are organizational bodies that are driving critical policymakers in the direction of ensuring that measures to reduce algorithm bias are a mandatory measure, as opposed to a choice.", "In the majority of the cases, engineers that are building an AI system do not have an inherent internal bias and prejudice against a specific group of people.", "Still, due to the lack of exposure to other cultures and walks of lives, there might be a disconnect between the actual reality the developed systems are expected to operate, in and how the creators intend for it to be used.", "Ethics education within companies and organization are one of the solutions to reducing algorithm bias. Educating employees on cultural and lifestyle differences can create an awareness of groups within the society that might have been overlooked or not even considered.", "Some companies are making active efforts within the AI space to increase the inclusion of underrepresented groups within academic institutions and AI-focused coursed. Take, for example, DeepMind scholarship program.", "The scholarship the program presents is aimed at individuals from low-income backgrounds; African or Caribbean heritage or Women.", "To solve global challenges, it takes the coming together of great minds and individuals from all background. And this is what we are starting to see.", "Toward Trustworthy AI Development is an effort by researchers coming together to define a set of guidelines that enables developers to be responsible in their development of AI systems.", "Majority of the readers of this article are probably employed within the AI industry, and some might even be directly involved in engineering the machine learning models utilized in several software products. I commend you for taking the time out to read this article and invite you to explore the subject even further.", "You are an essential component of the overall solution to algorithmic bias. The solution starts with you. The data gatherers, machine learning engineers, data scientists and researchers all have a crucial role to play.", "This article wasn\u2019t written for the purpose of shaming individuals or companies.", "Instead, it was written to show the AI community that there is rhetoric being held on the matter of algorithm bias.", "I believe the increase in the conversations and actions that are taken towards minimizing AI bias should be proportional to the rate of advancement of AI itself.", "Your home for data science.
