It has drastically improved the ease and speed at which I\u2019m creating machine learning models for various different use-cases, and I\u2019d really like to share it with you so you can enjoy the same benefits!", "To quote the summary of its own website: \u201cPyCaret is an open source, low-code machine learning library in Python that allows you to go from preparing your data to deploying your model within seconds in your choice of notebook environment.\u201d", "Simply put, it enables anyone (even people with very little technical background) to create machine learning models within minutes for whatever use-case they can think of. If you know how to use Jupyter Notebook, you have pretty much enough knowledge to start using it!", "So what are some bottlenecks your business is dealing with? Do you want to classify which customers are likely to leave? Do you want to predict how much in sales you\u2019re going to do next quarter? Maybe you want to cluster internal issues based on its problem description? You can build a model for these kind of problems quick & easy using PyCaret!", "Alright, so what would it look like in practice?", "These 6 simple lines of code (if we ignore the imports) are all you need to:", "Wow! If you\u2019ve tried out the process above using traditional modelling methods, you probably know you\u2019d have to write dozens of lines of code in order to replicate this (especially when it comes to model performance comparison)!", "Since the above example is indeed pretty basic, I suggest you check out the Getting started guide which the creators of the module made to help you on your way!", "Next to that, I\u2019ve created a demo walkthrough in a Jupyter Notebook where we explore everything from pre-processing, to model creation, to model improvement for 4 types of machine learning algorithms. It\u2019s quite extensive with a lot of comments on what\u2019s going on in between, so feel free to check it out when you have some spare time. If you\u2019d like a better view of the code and outputs, check it out on my Github profile.", "As with anything that sounds amazing, there\u2019s always a catch. However, the catch doesn\u2019t have much to with the module itself, but more so with how you use it.", "Because it\u2019s so beginner-friendly and low-code, it\u2019s very easy to miss or forget certain aspects about the data which should be specified during the pre-processing or modelling. It\u2019s extremely handy (and tempting) to let the PyCaret functions infer everything about the data. If you intend to do something more than building a quick & dirty model however, it\u2019s recommended to investigate and really understand what you\u2019re doing during the pre-processing and modelling part of the process.", "Having said all that, I think PyCaret is an amazing addition to programming with Python and has potential to facilitate the lives of many Data Scientists. I believe these types of low-code modules will become the industry standard in the near future and I\u2019m really excited to see what future implementations are on the horizon!", "Your home for data science.
