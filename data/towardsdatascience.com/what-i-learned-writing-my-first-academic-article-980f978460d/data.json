Especially being in my situation.", "I am an undergraduate, studying a subject that is completely unrelated to Machine Learning, even to Computer Science. I came to learn some Machine Learning basics guided by passion and only passion, without any academic perspectives on the whole field. I don\u2019t know anything about how the academic world really works.", "Why on earth should I even attempt to write an authentic academic article? Am I even entitled to think about it?", "My thoughts were persuading me from the whole \u201cpaper\u201d idea, taking it further and further from me, making it seem unreachable, impossible.", "After discussing my internal dilemma with some people, I realized that the advice I was receiving was always the same one.", "This answer didn\u2019t really remove all my hesitation on the matter, but it indeed made the whole situation more accessible, down to earth and less of an unreachable task.", "What do I have to lose?", "It could all end up in a big, beautiful mess, a heavy slap on the face of academic literature. However, deep inside me, the academic researcher has been a captivating figure for a long time. And to really get a feeling on what a researcher does and experiences, I needed, I wanted, to get my toes wet.", "After days and days of hard work, that some may even describe as extremely stressful, I had my paper. It was not perfect by any means, but I was incredibly proud of my little creation.", "Only after finishing all the work I realized with full confidence that I made the right choice. I learned many things throughout the journey, and after sitting on my experience for a few months, I am ready to share with you what I learned from writing a paper as the only author while being an inexperienced student.", "This lesson may sound cheesy, but as I previously explained it is very easy to feel discouraged if you don\u2019t already have experience in this world.", "You may tell yourself that you don\u2019t have the necessary knowledge and know-how to make an impact in a field that seems so unreachable and mature. And maybe that\u2019s true.", "But little step after little step you are going to get there. If you don\u2019t really know if your work is deserving of a paper seek help in professors and friends that may give you some incredibly useful advice, which takes us to the next lesson\u2026", "I once thought that I could do and learn everything by my own. That a helping hand would only distract me and make me slower.", "But this whole way of thinking went missing as soon as I had the opportunity to meet the right people.", "If you\u2019re feeling like you are at your best by your own, it probably means that you haven\u2019t met the right people yet.", "Asking for help is often the most efficient way to achieve a goal, if not the only possible one. It can also open new interesting opportunities, as the people you talk to now have an idea of what you know and what you don\u2019t, and thus may redirect you to new, more interesting projects and challenges.", "However, I would recommend you to stay away from biting the helping hand: always try to respect the people you ask help to, and if they are not always available for you, put yourself in their situation and try to understand why.", "Showing immense respect to peers is a strong pathway to create meaningful and fruitful relationships: try to keep walking this trail, without showing signs of arrogance and dominance, and one day, sooner than later, you will be able to acknowledge the results of keeping this mindset.", "Now that you have your motivation and you can rely on some kind of external guidance, it is time to put yourself to work.", "It is a good thing to get excited about your endeavour, as it may help make the time you spend researching and writing more enjoyable for you. However, being overly excited can lead you to really want to finish your entire project as soon as possible, which is likely an effective way for mistakes and conceptual discrepancies to sneak into your paper.", "I would highly recommend to first prepare a detailed to-do list with all the necessary steps of your journey; with that done, you should take your time, step after step, without working long hours and constantly feeling fatigued and nervous. In this calm and relaxed state, your efficiency and quality of your work can only increase.", "The topic of citations in academic literature is very deeply discussed in the the whole field of academia.", "It is extremely important to be aware of who came before you. While most academics start working on their research with an extremely large understanding of the history of their topic, it is not rare to come up with an idea regarding a subject that may be new and not well understood: this often happens whenever researchers apply a technology from their main field of interest to another different one.", "This phenomenon is fairly frequent in Machine Learning, as many of its core concepts are continuously applied to every imaginable field (Medicine, Engineering, Agriculture, Biology\u2026).", "No matter what, previous techniques on which you are building upon should always be researched. Other than giving credit to deserving researchers, you will build a deeper understanding on whatever you\u2019re investigating and, who knows, maybe you might discover that your new state of the art technology was actually already known 50 years before (unfortunately this happens more often than you may think).", "In other words, try to make the act of writing the \u201cPrevious Work\u201d section of your paper as part of the entire research process, and not just the last thing you do because \u201cyou have to do it\u201d. I can almost guarantee that this deeper understanding is going to influence and enhance the way you look at your research.", "I have no doubt you already know that the abstract is what you are going to be judged on most of the times. However, I would really like to insist on its importance.", "Only a percentage of the number of people who read the abstract of your paper will continue reading the rest. Your main goal shouldn\u2019t consist in maximizing this percentage, instead you should focus in igniting interest and curiosity in the kind of people you think may benefit from your work.", "While it is lately very common to make bold and general claims in the title and in the abstract of academic articles, this often results in a form of \u201cclickbait\u201d which yes, attracts a lot of general attention, but in the end what is really proposed in the paper doesn\u2019t leave any real dent in the field.", "Having an abstract that is precise and explains truthfully your intent, on the other hand, can really help capturing readers that are truly interested in what you are proposing, and will, maybe, one day, build upon your work.", "This is exactly why writing the abstract is extremely important and should require a great deal of time and energy, as condensing entire months of research in a very limited number of lines, without the risk of falling in the \u201cclickbait\u201d trap, is no easy task.", "I have heard more than once from people in the field that the more formulas you include in your paper, the higher the chance it will be accepted in a conference. I don\u2019t know if this claim is really valid or not, but what I do know is how much I dislike unnecessary formulas in academic articles.", "It\u2019s true, formulas can be very alluring: they appear to give your work a seal of authenticity, and to make you, as the author, appear smarter, more knowledgeable.", "However, as you probably may have understood, I believe this is just another shiny trap in which is incredibly easy to fall into. I prefer to think that a more streamlined, direct but clear approach at explaining your research can only help in making your work more successful in the field.", "While keeping this in mind, also remember that very long formulas are often needed to get to the point of your study, and in those cases it is crucially important to include them, ideally next to an extensive explanation of how they all precisely work.", "Just try not to get carried away with them, as sometimes a nice schematic is way more understandable than two lines of greek symbols.", "When reading papers, I am sometimes extremely pleased to be greeted with clear and well designed schematics. They really help the reader get to the point of how the proposed system works, or, in general, what is the intuitive thinking behind this particular research.", "On the other hand, when in academic articles I can only find piles and piles of black on white text, with maybe a couple long formulas sprinkled on top, my enthusiasm about what is proposed steeply falls, making the reading experience slow and stressful.", "This is not to say that papers without big, large, colorful images shouldn\u2019t exist, but sometimes taking a concept that on its own it is very hard to grasp and turning it into a clear schematic is possible and can really help the overall clarity of the article.", "The use of colors in this kind of conceptual representations is also crucial: colors can be used to add another layer of depth to the concepts you wish to explain with your schematics, but an improper or illogical use can only create more confusion, ruining the positive benefits of a clear diagram.", "It is finally time to write the conclusion of your paper.", "Many researchers will consider this section as the easiest one, and in order to reach the end of their long work as soon as possible won\u2019t dedicate much time and thought on this particular part.", "The conclusion, however, serves the role of a deep reflection on what has been proposed in the sections that came before, and not as a simple and brief summary.", "This is the perfect moment to take a moment to consider how your research can be misused, and in general what are the possible shortcomings and points of weakness: I would also recommend to include the main ones in your abstract, as being sincere about your work from the beginning is always greatly appreciated.", "In the field of Machine Learning the theme of misusing a particular proposed system is vastly discussed, and often, alongside a technology that can be possibly misused, a way to counteract the same technology is also proposed.", "This is the best way to tackle unexplored applications of technology that can result in dangerous outcomes, but if what you are proposing can only achieve a goal that is completely unethical, you should maybe rethink about sharing it with the world.", "After carefully reading and checking your precious article, and asking other people, that did not take part in the research process, to do the same, high-five yourself and take some time off to let your mind relax after the heavy load.", "Unfortunately however, if you wish to submit your paper somewhere, there\u2019s still a lot more work to do.", "I should insist on the fact that not submitting an article to a conference or journal, but only publishing it on platforms like Arxiv, especially if you\u2019re working independently, is completely fine and shouldn\u2019t cause you any embarrassment.", "In the case of submitting to a conference or journal, get ready to receive some negative reviews: this can be a moment of high frustration for the majority of researchers, as after working on a paper for months, a negative review, maybe from someone who doesn\u2019t really know much about the field of interest, can be very stressful.", "Whatever happens, try to always understand the point of view of the reviewers:", "In every review, even the most infuriating ones, there should be something to learn.", "With that said, I really want to thank you for reading and for your precious attention.", "And if you are about to write an academic article, or you are currently writing one, I wish you good luck! I hope it will be a fun ride for you as it has been for me.", "Ask me questions or connect with me on LinkedIn and Twitter!", "Read my blog post explaining my first paper on Voice Conversion and Music Style Transfer:", "Read my blog post on what I learned Training GANs for a Year:", "Studying Energy Engineering. Artificial Intelligence is pretty cool too."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
