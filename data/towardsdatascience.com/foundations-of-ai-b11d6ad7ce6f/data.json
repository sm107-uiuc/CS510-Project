Stories of intelligent robots and artificial beings have pervaded our myths and legends since antiquity, sparking both excitement and fear as our ancestors considered the existence of autonomous machines. These myths continue to influence the narrative surrounding AI and, though we\u2019re closer to developing artificial general intelligence than ever before, it can be difficult to separate fact from fiction given today\u2019s buzzword-laden media.", "Though certain use cases have undoubtedly been overhyped, AI has the potential to transform every aspect of how we work, play, and live. In this post, we\u2019ll lay the foundation for understanding this technology by:", "Artificial Intelligence is the automation of activities we normally attribute to human thinking and rationality, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and learning. AI lives within the intersection of many classic disciplines, including philosophy, neuroscience, behavioral economics, computer science, and mechanical engineering. These interdisciplinary roots help explain why AI has captured our imagination: this burgeoning research field offers a little something for people of all interests and backgrounds. As we evolve our understanding of what AI is and how it works, we simultaneously make headway against the academic community\u2019s most challenging research questions:", "AI is certain to impact your career path over the next decade. Though most industries are still in the early stages of proof-of-concept (POC) development, many early adopters are already starting to enjoy the fruits of their labor. In one study, researchers found that F500 companies that proactively adopted AI technology have 3\u201315% higher self-reported margins than their competitors. These early success signals have triggered a wave of investment, motivating VCs and Corp. Dev. departments alike to spend tens of billions of dollars each year to develop and scale new AI capabilities. This funding has substantially increased the demand for data scientists and ML engineers, giving rise to new educational models (e.g., MOOCs, bootcamps) that support this virtuous cycle by accelerating the pace of AI adoption. No matter what role you play in our economy, you\u2019ve probably already started to notice the effects of this wave:", "It\u2019s always wise to approach funding statistics with a healthy dose of skepticism, and it\u2019s unclear whether these same trends will continue in a bear market. Still, the momentum behind these trends suggests that AI will have a long-lasting impact on the business community.", "Outside of the office, AI will also have a far-reaching impact on our society. Though AI has the potential to expedite and improve our daily lives in ways that we haven\u2019t yet discovered, it could just as easily be misused and abused. A few representative examples include:", "The concept of \u201cArtificial Superintelligence\u201d (known in research communities as artificial general intelligence, or AGI) is particularly divisive. Though we\u2019re decades away from developing an autonomous agent \u00e0 la Terminator or Ex Machina, many thought leaders have already started to debate the existential threat posed by superhuman AI. In one corner, Stanford professor and deeplearning.ai CEO\u2019s Andrew Ng is optimistic about the role that AI will play in society:", "\u201cAI is the new electricity. Just as 100 years ago electricity transformed industry after industry, AI will now do the same.\u201d", "In the other, Tesla and OpenAI CEO Elon Musk argues for a much more conservative approach to AI development:", "\u201cIf I were to guess what our biggest existential threat is, it\u2019s probably [AI]\u2026 With artificial intelligence, we are summoning the demon.\u201d", "Experts disagree on when we\u2019ll finally achieve AGI, but, as we\u2019ll soon illustrate, we\u2019ve made significant progress towards this goal over the past few years.", "In their 1995 classic Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, Berkeley\u2019s Stuart J. Russell and Google\u2019s Peter Norvig broke AI into five distinct research areas originating from the Total Turing test:", "Though the lines between each of these five disciplines has started to blur as we\u2019ve made progress towards AGI, this framework serves as a helpful starting point for understanding AI. In this second section, we\u2019ll offer examples and recent trends across each of these five disciplines.", "Machine learning (ML) is the science of empowering machines to make decisions without human intervention. This sub-discipline forms the backbone of AI, enabling computers to learn and interpret patterns in images, sounds, and structured data using multidimensional arrays. ML is further subdivided into four types of learning:", "Supervised learning is the most common form of ML used in the business world today, but that balance may shift as we continue to discover new use cases for the less traditional learning methods. An illustrative example of each learning type is offered below:", "Machine learning is to thank for many high-profile innovations over the past few years, but it\u2019s more difficult to do correctly than commonly believed. If statistical best practices aren\u2019t observed, ML models will overfit on previously-observed data points and lead business users astray. We\u2019ll go deeper into this last point during a future discussion.", "An expert system (ES) is an artificial agent which leverages pre-programmed knowledge to offer advice or make decisions. In its simplest form, we can think of an ES as a complicated decision tree or nested if-then logic: if x, y, and w happen, we instruct the computer to do z. Though expert systems don\u2019t enjoy the same hype as machine learning, there are many reasons why we might prefer an ES over ML:", "Expert systems are the most prevalent type of AI and are often incorporated along-side ML to help reduce the downside risk of errant predictions. Google\u2019s Nest home automation technology is a prime example of an ES at work. Users program their preferences into Nest over time, enabling the system to automatically adjust housing temperature to desired levels and reduce heating expenses. Using ML to predict desired temperatures could lead to wild swings in settings and energy costs, so user-defined logic is critical to stabilizing these predictions.", "Computer vision (CV) is the automatic extraction, analysis, and interpretation of images or videos. CV converts photos and videos into numerical arrays, enabling ML algorithms to draw inferences, make predictions, and even generate new images based on user-defined inputs.", "Potential uses for CV have been studied for decades, but CV has only recently become possible at scale thanks to three innovations:", "These three innovations have opened the floodgates for new CV use cases, including self-driving cars and automated retailers (e.g., Amazon Go). As cameras, LIDAR, and other spatial sensors become less expensive, we\u2019ll soon find ways to alleviate many of our most inefficient processes using CV.", "Natural language processing (NLP) is the automatic extraction, analysis, and generation of human language. NLP algorithms parse sentences in various ways (e.g., splitting by word, splitting by letter, reading both left-to-right and right-to-left, etc.) to automatically draw inferences about the writer\u2019s meaning and intent. NLP\u2019s various use cases include:", "Like CV, NLP has come a long way over the past decade thanks to innovations in deep learning that have made it faster and easier to train ML models on human language. In the past, engineers would spend hours examining, filtering, and transforming text to avoid computational bottlenecks. Today, out-of-the-box solutions like fast.ai\u2019s NLP library can crush reading comprehension accuracy records without need for time-intensive preprocessing.", "Siri and Alexa are great examples of NLP in action: by listening for \u201cwake words\u201d, these tools allow you to play music, search the Web, create to-do lists, and control popular smart-home products \u2014 all while your smartphone stays in your pocket. These virtual assistants will continue to improve over time as they gather data from existing users, unlocking new use cases and integrating with the modern enterprise.", "Robotics is the science of designing, constructing, operating, and applying robots to solve human problems. Robots come in thousands of shapes and sizes, making it difficult to nail down the precise meaning of the term. Joseph Engelberger, a pioneer in industrial robotics, said it best:", "\u201cI can\u2019t define a robot, but I know one when I see one.\u201d- Joseph Engelberger", "The field of robotics research has evolved at breakneck speed over the past decade, enabling new designs and use cases that seem to have come straight out of a science fiction novel. Private manufacturers continue to push the envelope of robotics within their respective niches:", "Most robots rely on expert systems to accomplish their objective, but the robots of tomorrow will become exponentially more useful by incorporating machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing into their operating systems.", "Russell and Norvig\u2019s framework provides a useful structure for thinking about AI, but these five categories aren\u2019t meant to be mutually exclusive; the most exciting innovations of the last decade have occurred within their intersections. This disciplinary blending will only become more pronounced as time goes on: delivery drones, self-driving cars, and artificial general intelligence must tightly integrate all five disciplines if they are to succeed. Still, every complicated problem has to be broken down into its core components before it can be solved, and this five-discipline framework provides a foundational mental model for understanding AI.", "As you put this new-found knowledge to use, there are a few guiding principles worth taking back to your team:", "Your home for data science.
