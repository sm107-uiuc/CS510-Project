You might have wondered how governments and agencies make decisions when it comes to enforcing lockdowns, closing schools, banning indoor dining, etc\u2026 These decisions aren\u2019t blindly made. They\u2019re made through simulations.", "A simulation is simply an imitation of a situation or a process. In the case of this pandemic, governments use simulations to see how different factors, like the ones listed above, impact the spread of COVID-19.", "Simulations are useful for a number of reasons:", "A big misconception about simulations is that they\u2019re really complicated, and that\u2019s not necessarily the case! Simulations can end up being very complex, but they can also be very simple.", "In this article, you\u2019ll learn how to build a very simple simulation/model of population growth, as well as how it can be improved.", "Note: In this article, the terms \u201cmodel\u201d and \u201csimulation\u201d will be used synonymously.", "Be sure to subscribe here or to my personal newsletter to never miss another article on data science guides, tricks and tips, life lessons, and more!", "The most basic human population simulator that we could possibly create would be something like this, where the initial population is 50 and we want to see how the population grows to 1,000,000:", "If you can tell, this program is simply an exponential function and is too basic of a model to be able to simulate population growth. As you might have already thought, the total number of people in an environment won\u2019t increase by a set percentage every cycle, and there are many factors that affect the population that aren\u2019t included.", "This is okay! This is how a simulation starts. It starts off simple and gets more advanced. Let\u2019s see how we can improve on this.", "If we want to run a more realistic simulation of the human population, we\u2019ll need to establish some factors and use them to control when people are born, reproduce, and die.", "So, let\u2019s set up a more complicated simulation. Although there are millions of variables that can change population, we\u2019ll stick with just a few major ones. Once these are set up, we can program them to fluctuate, and they can be tinkered with to imitate different scenarios.", "I\u2019ve chosen eight very simple factors:", "I\u2019ll explain how each of these works as I go. Let\u2019s create a new Python script in the IDLE. We\u2019ll use the random function quite a lot, so import that first:", "Now we assign a value to the variable startingPopulation. This can be virtually whatever you want, but I\u2019m using fifty.", "Realistically it would be impossible to grow a population significantly from just fifty people, and inbreeding would cause endless genetic diseases, but let\u2019s keep it simple.", "Our next variable is infantMortality. This is the chance of a child dying in their first year of life. Our World in Data estimates an average infant mortality rate of ~25% over the past two millennia. I\u2019ll use that because it can give us a good historical simulation.", "The variable, agriculture, will be how many \u201cunits\u201d of food each person produces. One unit of food feeds a person for a single year. In our simulation, each person must eat one unit of food every year or they will die. Therefore, if agriculture is exactly 1 in a given year, everyone eats. If it is 0.5, fifty percent of the population dies. If it is 1.5, there is a fifty percent excess of food, and this can be stored and used as a backup if the agriculture in the next year is not enough to support the population.", "Explained simply, if the agriculture value is not above 1, the population cannot grow, because the population would starve. To start, I\u2019ll use a value of 5, meaning each person produces enough food for themselves, plus four more people:", "Then we have disasterChance. This is the probability every year that some natural disaster comes along and damages the population. It will affect the population by a random percentage, from 5\u201310%. To start with, I\u2019ll leave the disasterChance at 10%, meaning on average every ten years a disaster will come along.", "food is pretty self-explanatory. Every year we will run a \u201charvest\u201d function and the output of that harvest will be the population multiplied by agriculture. Even if your agriculture is below 1, if you have stocks of food, you can theoretically maintain your population.", "Finally, we have fertilityx and fertilityy. These are the ages at which a women can become pregnant in our simulation. For my program, I\u2019m using the range of ages 18 to 35.", "Now, we need a way for these factors to control our population on a year by year basis. We could do this a mathematical way and use all sorts of percentages, but I think it\u2019d be more intuitive and versatile if we used object-based programming to simulate each person.", "Each person will be an object with a few factors, and every cycle (that is, one year of our simulation) that person will be affected in some way \u2014 at the least, their age will increase by 1. We need something to store all these people, so let\u2019s create a list:", "That\u2019s where each object will be stored and we can use a for loop to cycle through each person year by year and alter them. If you are not familiar with Python classes and objects, I would probably read up on them. But if you\u2019re already up to scratch, let\u2019s define a class which we can use for every human:", "This is the way we\u2019ll \u201cspawn\u201d a person. As you can see, each person has a gender and age. You may notice that when we \u201cspawn\u201d a person, their age is not set to 0. The reason for this is because when we initiate the simulation, we\u2019ll use this class to create a group of people with random ages, so we don\u2019t want to immediately set every person to 0 years old.", "There are several functions we need to include in this program. For now, we want the program to simulate a population that exponentially increases over time \u2014 just like our very simple demo program from the start of this article. Therefore, the following must happen:", "With this model, the population should increase exponentially, because enough infants are born every year to outweigh the number of people dying from old age, and as these infants reach 8+ years of age, they produce food to support the civilization.", "Every year of the simulation there is a \u201charvest\u201d. The function takes the food and agriculture values. It calculates how many \u201cable\u201d people there are to produce food by counting those over 8 years of age. Of course, we multiply the number of able people by agriculture to get the total food produced for the year.", "If the food is not enough for each person to eat 1 unit of food, then the dictionary of people is limited to the amount of food available, and the excess die from starvation. This ensures that if there is not enough food to go around, people who cannot eat die, and the population is effectively limited. But if there is excess food, each person consumes 1 unit, and whatever is left is stored for the next year!", "To grow our population, we need a reproduce function:", "Here I have assumed that 1 in 5 women will become pregnant every year. Of course that figure isn\u2019t exactly accurate to real life, but it\u2019ll work fine for our simulation! The reproduce function cycles through every person in the dictionary of people. If any person is female and between the ages of 18 and 35, they have a 20% chance of giving birth, and a new person of age 0 is appended to the dictionary of people.", "Fantastic, we have our very basic functions laid out. Although this could be done more simply using maths, setting our code out as an object-based script allows for more flexibility; if you wanted to expand the program and make it more realistic, you could add various characteristics to each person, such as medical conditions or social class.", "We need a way to initiate our simulation. To get the ball rolling, we spawn fifty people, with random ages between 18 and 50. This is our beginSim function:", "As you can see, we add fifty people to our people dictionary, each of which has a random age. We can call this function at the bottom of our script, like this:", "After starting the program and creating these people, we need a system to cycle through each year, and perform the harvest and reproduce functions. We\u2019ll call this function runYear:", "Let\u2019s see what is going on here. The runYear function takes agriculture, food, fertilityx and fertilityy. It runs the harvest function to find out if the food will leave some people to starve to death, or if there is enough to be stored. We then perform the reproduce function, so that 20% of women between 18\u201335 give birth to a baby.", "Next, we cycle through the people dictionary and remove anyone who is over 80. The rest of the population increases by 1 year of age. If you wanted to improve the simulator, you could make it more random which age you die at.", "Finally, we print out the total population. To keep the runYear function going, we\u2019ll include this line just below where we initiated the program through beginSim:", "This just ensures that the program stops when the population reaches 0 or 100,000.", "Congratulations! We have population growth, the basis for our simulator. If you import this data into Excel, we get this graph:", "This looks just like our graph from the simple first program of the article. It makes sense based on the current code, but it\u2019s not very interesting. Let\u2019s spice it up a little.", "Remember those variables, infantMortality and disasterChance we talked about? Let\u2019s factor those in.", "20% of women give birth every year, according to our simulation, but 25% of those infants die. So let\u2019s update our reproduce function and include this:", "Note: You\u2019ll also want to update the runYear function, and also the line where we call it, so it can accept the infantMortality variable. Otherwise, you will get the error \u201cinfantMortality is not defined\u201d.", "As you can see, instead of giving each woman a 1 in 5 chance of giving birth, even if she does give birth, there is a 25% chance of the baby dying. You can see from our random clause that any random numbers generated between 0\u2013100 that are below 25% = baby dies, any above = baby lives. If infantMortality is high, then very few of the infants will survive. Ideally, you want to get it down from 1% to 2%.", "When we run the simulation with a 25% infant mortality rate, the results are quite gloomy and inaccurate:", "Instead, let\u2019s allow infant mortality rates to decrease over time, as healthcare gets better. You\u2019d think after a hundred years they would make some advances, right?", "To keep the infantMortality variable updated, we\u2019ll make this change to where we call the runYear function:", "That way, we can make a change to the infantMortality rate every year, and it\u2019ll be returned from the runYear function so it can be used for the next year!", "We\u2019ll then add these two lines to the runYear function:", "This is also really simple. We\u2019re decreasing the infantMortality by 1.5% every year, and returning it so the updated mortality rate can be put into the function for the subsequent year.", "Run the program and we get these results from the data in Excel:", "Last but not least, we\u2019ll add in our disasterChance. I feel like the 25% initial infant mortality rate will be a bit unreasonable for this simulation, so I\u2019m setting it to 5%, and then we\u2019re ready to add in disasterChance, right above where we print out the population:", "This is a rather long clause, but I\u2019ll try to explain it. If the random number between 0 and 100 falls within the disasterChance range (for us, that is 10%), then a disaster is initiated. We generate a random number to figure out how much damage we\u2019ll do. It\u2019ll fall between 5% and 20%. We\u2019ll multiply this by the length of the people dictionary to get a 5\u201320% slice of the population. We\u2019ll then cut that slice out (effectively killing 5\u201320% of our population).", "Once again, you\u2019ll want to update the line where we call the runYears function so it sends the disasterChance to the function. Those are all the remaining changes and updates you must make to finish the simple population simulator!", "It\u2019s complete! You can see that about every ten years, there is some kind of significant disaster that kills 5\u201320% of the population. These disasters are barely noticeable for the first seven hundred years, but they get very exaggerated thereafter.", "While this is a simple and incomplete model, you now know how to build a simulation! To take this to the next level, you can update and advance this program to include way more factors like health conditions, social class, urbanization, healthcare, various kinds of disasters, geolocation, etc. Overall, I hope this inspires you to build your own simulations for the pandemic, population growth, or whatever else you can think of!", "Not sure what to read next?
