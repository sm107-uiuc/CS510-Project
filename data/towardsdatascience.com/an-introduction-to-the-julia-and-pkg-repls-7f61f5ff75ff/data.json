What language should you learn first? To answer this question, you should of course always gauge your personal interests and career goals. While options like Python and Java-script could give you a potential leg-up for things like web-development, you will surely fall short with such languages when approaching more software-oriented problems, such as compiling an executable.", "This is where Julia really shines. Although Julia certainly retains its primary purpose as being the scientific programming language of the future, it is also one of the most versatile high-level general purpose languages with an open-source license today. Julia comes with a host of advantages over most of its competitors in this field:", "I\u2019ve gotten to a point where I have an article for everything.", "Whenever I was first introduced to Julia, I made the fatal mistake of installing the language from my package manager. While this will give you a stable and perfectly usable version of Julia, version 1.1, with long-term support, you will not get to reap the benefits of all the advancements that have been made since then. Multi-threading in particular is something that I much prefer in 1.4 +, and soon even Lathe will be using the spawn macro and will be incompatible with 1.1\u20131.3.9.", "With that in mind, it is very important that rather than installing Julia through Brew, Apt, Pacman, or Yum, you go directly to", "and download the official and latest binaries. After that, you can follow the installation instructions listed below for your respective platform:", "Firstly, download the tarball from the Julia mirror. You can do this via your web-browser, or wget:", "Next, you will want to extract the tarball. This can be done by either double clicking in your file-manager (depending on your file-manager, but I know this will work in Nautilus and Dolphin,) or use tar zxvf:", "Now just create a link to your Julia executable in PATH in either .bashrc or .bash_profile with your favorite text editor:", "I recommend using your bash_profile so you NEVER OVERWRITE PATH!", "As for installation on Windows, the process is quite simple. Download the installer and install Julia. Next, you\u2019ll need to add Julia to your PATH just as we did on Linux. First press the Windows key + R, this will open up \u201c run.\u201d After that, type in undll32 sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables", "Hit enter, and then under the \u201c User Variables\u201d section, find the row \u201c Path\u201d and click \u201c edit.\u201d Click new, and then paste in your Julia directory. This is usually inside of app-data, which can be accessed by typing %appdata% into the search bar and hitting enter.", "To install Julia for Mac, take the regular MacOS installation procedure with the .DMG file provided on the Julia website. Next, navigate to /usr/local/bin and remove the julia file. Then link it using this command:", "The Julia REPL is a quick and convenient way to test and execute Julia code. It\u2019s also a great way to access Pkg to activate new environments and add new packages. REPL is an acronym for Read Evaluate Print Loop \u2014 which is exactly what it says.", "Read \u2014 meaning read the input text.", "Evaluate \u2014 meaning evaluate the logic inside of the text", "Print \u2014 meaning show the return", "Loop \u2014 meaning that there is a while loop for the entirety of the application\u2019s life-span.", "If you need to open the Pkg REPL from within the Julia REPL you can simply press", "This will allow you to use commands rather than Julian syntax to work with your Julia packages. There are a couple different commands that you might have at your disposal, but the most important ones to learn immediately are", "Add will add a new package, of course. Status will report the contents of the .toml file in your current environment, which we will get more familiar with in a future rendition. Instantiate will update all project dependencies. Build will build a selected package, and can be useful when a package or component of a package is not working properly. Rm is the inverse of add, and will remove the provided package. Finally, activate will activate a virtual environment and takes a name as a parameter.", "While not necessarily specific to Julia \u2014 there are a few things you might want to know before approaching computer programming as a whole. Programming in simple terms is either the movement of data or the processing of data. This is true from the position of low-level Assembly code all the way up to the highest levels of programming.", "It is important to remember what language you are working with, and how it is going to handle types. If you would like to learn more about languages and how they handle types, and where Julia falls onto the spectrum, I have an article for that, too:", "Julia is an awesome programming language, and I am excited to share more about it with you! This tutorial series is going to take you all the way from the fundamental basics of computer programming to being a great programmer in your own way. In the next tutorial, we will be going over writing basic functions and getting familiar with different types. Towards the end we will touch on conditionals! If you\u2019re already an experienced programmer, it might be a good idea to skip ahead a bit, but I try to keep the pacing in-line so that everyone can gain some sort of knowledge from each tutorial \u2014 and with that, feedback is appreciated!
