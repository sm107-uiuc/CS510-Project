But did you know that Operations Research (OR) is every bit as fun, rewarding, and challenging? Unlike data science, however, OR isn\u2019t 100% fixated on brute force applying classification and regression to techniques to any and all problems.", "I say this a bit tongue and cheek.", "But it\u2019s ~true. There are very few tasks that can\u2019t be coerced into classification or regression problems. But let\u2019s shift gears today and discuss some of those problems. Two high impact problems in OR include the \u201ctraveling salesman problem\u201d and the \u201cvehicle routing problem.\u201d The latter is much more tricky, involves a time component and often several vehicles. But for this introductory post, let\u2019s focus on the easier of the two.", "Consider a salesman who leaves any given location (we\u2019ll say Chicago) and must stop at x other cities before returning home. Wikipedia conveniently lists the top x biggest cities in the US, so we\u2019ll focus on just the top 25.", "Like any problem, which can be optimized, there must be a cost function. In the context of TSP, total distance traveled must be reduced as much as possible. A brute force solution is 100% possible for only 25 cities, however, it\u2019s deceptively trickier than you might imagine. There are 15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000,000 unique permutations of 25 cities. This is ~15.5 septillion. Did you know septillion was a word?", "With these many possible combinations, finding the global optimal solution is a bit like finding a hay in a needle stack. (Yes, you read that right.) In response, our goal isn\u2019t to find the global optimal solution \u2014 it\u2019s to find one of countless ~near optimal solutions and avoid the countless moderately good (and outright terrible) solutions. Which is a great segue into genetic algorithms.", "Genetic algorithms are a class of algorithms that take inspiration from genetics. More specifically, \u201cgenes\u201d evolve over several iterations by both crossover (reproduction) and mutation. This will get a bit incest-y, but bear with me. In the simplest case, we start with two genes, these genes interact (crossover) where a new gene is produced receiving some attributes from one gene and the rest from the other. Then, random changes (mutation) are introduced to the new gene. Now there are three genes, two parents and a child; all three are evaluated in terms of a cost function. If the child is the weakest, we delete it and start anew. Otherwise, we remove the weaker of the two parents, then repeat the whole process over with the two remaining genes. Conceptually, that\u2019 all there is to it.", "It\u2019s basically make x guesses, create y hybrid guess(es), evaluate the fitness of the gene pool and do some pruning. Rinse and repeat until you converge on a solution. (You will converge on a solution, it just very likely will not be the global optimum.) Yes, because computers are drawing inspiration from genetics, but aren\u2019t intrinsically limited by the characteristics of genetics, the algorithm can have any arbitrary number of parents and children in each iteration.", "Early on, mutation is king. This is the explore in the \u201cexplore-exploit\u201d paradigm (very common in reinforcement learning vernacular.) Mutations learn what \u201cworks\u201d. However, as the system begins to learn what\u2019s effective and what\u2019s not, it\u2019s important to shift gears and start putting our knowledge to good use \u2014 via crossover \u2014 and exploit what we\u2019ve learned. There are several ways to do this. It can be an abrupt switch or a gradual change. But the key is to start with the mind of a scientist, learning from the environment, and end with the mind of a businessman, profiting on the lessons learned.", "In the context of TSP, each \u201cgene\u201d will be a sequence of cities, beginning and ending with Chicago. The \u201cfitness\u201d of any given gene is its overall distance round-trip. We start with x genes which are randomly generated. It would be incredible if we just happened upon the global optimal solution but that\u2019s unlikely; likewise, it\u2019s unlikely any starting gene will be the literal worst possible trip. However, some genes will be more \u201cfit\u201d than others. Note we only randomly generate genes once. After this point, every new gene is a function of crossover and mutation. In the context of TSP, this means randomly inheriting cities and their respective indices from a previous gene. For example, we might inherit \u201cDallas\u201d as the fifth element from one parent-gene and \u201cNashville\u201d as the sixth from the other parent gene. Note, we chose these cities and their indices randomly; we have no idea if this will be beneficial. We simply do it and hope for the best. If this was not advantageous, the new gene is scrapped and we start anew. But if this random selection was beneficial, we discard the weaker of the parent-genes and continue. We still have no idea if there was anything magical about the Dallas receiving the fifth index, but it seemed to be advantageous at the time, so the most current gene evolved to keep it.", "This process repeats over and over.", "Eventually, a gene will be \u201cpretty darn good\u201d and it will fail to be replaced in subsequent iterations. Our genes will more than likely get \u201cstuck\u201d in a local optimum. But this is acceptable given that there are over 15 septillion alternatives, and the overwhelming majority are far, far worse. But this is true of life in general. There\u2019s so much variety, who\u2019s to say that the Tiger evolved right and the Lion evolved wrong? Sure, an ancient-psychic-tandem-war-elephant would outperform both (Google it) but this possibility hasn\u2019t yet been realized in our physical universe and (sadly) it likely never will be.", "A couple notes, (A) I\u2019ve included a little function that will query Google Maps for the distance between location. (B) I got the top 25 cities from here and (C) I did use an epsilon parameter that gradually decreased as a function of iterations, favoring explore early on and exploit later on.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at the results. We started at >25,000 miles in total duration and trimmed that down to about ~10,000 miles. (Not bad for an algorithm that took ~3 seconds to run!)", "As you can see, we did get sucked into what I\u2019m virtually certain is a local optimum, but the road-trip actually makes sense, which is really cool! You\u2019d need to tailor this code a good deal to adapt it to a different purpose, but there are for more robust implementations of genetic algorithms on the market. I only hope that this article has expanded your vision of what\u2019s possible beyond the worlds of classification and regression.", "Thanks for reading!
