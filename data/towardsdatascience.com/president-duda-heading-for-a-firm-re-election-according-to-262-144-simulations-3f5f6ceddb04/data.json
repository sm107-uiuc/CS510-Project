It is solely concentrated on delivering data insight from previous presidential elections and modelling possible outcomes in the run-off taking place this Sunday.", "This year\u2019s presidential election race is particularly heated due to the current political balance in Poland.", "The current incumbent, president Duda, is fighting to secure his second term to uphold the current political discourse of the ruling party Law and Justice (PiS).", "On the other hand, opposition supporters seek to put a break on the legislative power of the current government by electing Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, deputy chairman of Civic Platform (PO).", "This choice carries a lot of weight, since the next parliamentary election takes place in 2023, and Trzaskowski\u2019s success could possibly trigger early general election.", "In the first ballot, president Duda received 43.50% of the total vote, the second-best result since 1989.", "Yet his victory over Trzaskowski is still uncertain. The opinion polls over the last week show a two-horse race with no clear favourite.", "Although almost three quarters of voters decided to support candidates of the two biggest parties, Szymon Ho\u0142ownia\u2019s and Krzysztof Bosak\u2019s voters will have a crucial say this week.", "The electorate structure of both Ho\u0142ownia and Bosak have changed over the last couple of months. Besides, opinion polls often include a solid part of undecided voters, which may skew the results.", "To account for that, I decided to analyse the 3 previous presidential elections in Poland in 2005, 2010 and 2015. Based on trends and dependencies between ballots, I try to extract reasonable parameters and model possible outcomes this Sunday.", "Why do I analyse only the last three? It\u2019s because the year 2005 has been a tipping point for political equilibrium in Poland. Since then, only two parties were alternately elected into power \u2014 Law and Justice (PiS) and Civic Platform (PO).", "I dive into this more in the following section, but if you feel comfortable with the Polish political scene, feel free to skip it!", "Before 2005, the presidential palace, as well as the parliamentary majority were in the hands of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD).", "They started losing public support as an aftermath of the corruption scandal of late 2002, the so-called Rywin affair. Since then, three major political powers started to emerge and form a new balance of power.", "The conservative Law and Justice (PiS), liberal Civic Platform (PO) and social democratic Self-Defense of the Republic of Poland (SO), heavily focusing on rural affairs. Due to eccentric nature of SO\u2019s leader, Andrzej Lepper, it lost the race against PiS and PO.", "This duo was meant to create a coalition government after the parliamentary election in 2005. However, after PiS\u2019 victory in both presidential and general elections, the coalition never came to fruition and PiS and PO ended up on opposite poles of the political spectrum.", "Since then, the Polish political scene found an equilibrium, and supporters of either party remain largely consistent in their voting patterns. As parliamentary majority went from hand to hand \u2014 (2005 -2007) PiS, (2007\u20132015) PO, (2015 \u2014 present) PiS, no outside party managed to receive a sufficient share of votes to destabilize this divide.", "Because of the relatively stable voting habits, I decided to include the past three presidential elections into my analysis.", "In this article, I try to extract voting patterns from historical data and use them to model potential outcomes in the run-off this Sunday taking place between\u2026 surprise, surprise \u2014 PiS and PO candidates \u2014 Andrzej Duda and Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski.", "In the following two sections I show insights from the past presidential elections and their impact on the final result in the run-offs.", "If you are not interested in the maths nonsense, jump straight into the Who\u2019s in the lead bit! ;)", "I decided to break voting patterns on a county-by-county basis, which allows me to investigate local patterns.", "Each point in the following plots represent one county. I also focus on candidate share of votes with respect to the total amount of eligible voters instead of the share of total votes. That way, we can account for changes in county\u2019s turnout within our model.", "Turnout changes themselves don\u2019t seem to vary much across presidential elections. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of regressed turnouts stays within 2 percentage point boundary.", "Similarly, voting preferences remain largely unchanged, as people support the candidate of the same party that they voted for in previous elections.", "This is to be expected, as historically PiS has been more popular in rural areas and smaller cities. On the other hand, PO has always achieved strong results in urban areas.", "This year, there\u2019s a particularly strong correlation between the current support and that of 2015. Regression coefficients are bigger than 1 indicating that counties with strong preferences in 2015 support candidates of the same party even more.", "President Duda has also noted a relatively big intercept for this kind of regression \u2014 0.079. This means he managed to increase his voter base uniformly across the entire country by around 8 percentage points.", "These results show an increasing polarisation of Polish political scene over the last 5 years, as voters of either party tend to be more active.", "In fact, third party candidates have noted the second smallest share of votes (26.04%) since the first democratic elections of 1990. It was only smaller during elections taking place in 2010 as an aftermath of the Smolensk plane crash, which was one of the most divisive events in the modern history of Poland.", "To secure a win this Sunday, this race essentially comes down to two defining factors \u2014 mobilising the candidate\u2019s own electorate and persuading the majority of third party voters. The third party electorate has proven to be crucial in past presidential elections.", "Let\u2019s consider presidential election of 2005, where PiS candidate Lech Kaczy\u0144ski came second in the first ballot with 33.10% of votes conceding to his PO opponent, Donald Tusk with 36.33%.", "Although Tusk lead was apparent, the electorate of third Andrzej Lepper (15.11%) has shown its strong support for Kaczy\u0144ski. This is best illustrated by regressing Lepper\u2019s result in each county on Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s and Tusk\u2019s increases in voter base between ballots.", "The opposite trend could be observed for fourth Marek Borowski, an SLD candidate, but his relatively small and more uniformly distributed voter base in comparison to Lepper\u2019s did not compensate for the increased support for Kaczy\u0144ski.", "Kaczy\u0144ski won the election with 54.04% of the total vote taking advantage of a similar voter base with Lepper.", "That\u2019s one part of the story \u2014 the third party candidate flows have a significant (or even deciding) impact on the results in the 2nd ballot.", "However, mobilising one\u2019s own electorate before the second round has always been an important part of the two-week marathon between ballots. As it turns out, not by accident.", "Let\u2019s have a look at the voter base increase of each candidate before the run-off regressed on the result of that candidate in the first round.", "Especially in 2010 and 2015 candidates of both parties have made gains proportional to their initial support in each county.", "This highlights the fact, that many of main parties\u2019 voters decide to vote only in the second ballot, where the final decision must be made.", "Komorowski\u2019s increase was particularly correlated with his initial result, highlighting PO\u2019s electorate effort in preventing Duda from taking the office.", "Modelling the increase of voter base boils down to a candidate\u2019s own result, and their ability to persuade third party voters.", "Therefore, we can fit the linear model to predict a candidate\u2019s increase in each county based on their result and the share of third party votes. I deliberately chose not to include opponent\u2019s share of votes as an independent variable, as it\u2019s mostly negatively correlated with candidate\u2019s own result. The final model is:", "% increase = b0 + b1 x candidate\u2019s result + b2 x third party votes + error", "Running this model for candidates of both parties in the last three elections gives the following models:", "Some interesting details caught my eye straight away.", "Firstly, PiS has consistently been better at increasing voter base in strong third-party counties. This was also the case in 2010, when Napieralski result was highly correlated with that of Komorowski reducing Napieralski\u2019s impact on b2.", "Secondly, both parties heavily rely on increases driven by their less active electorate making their way to the polling stations during run-offs.", "However, each party seems to have a limited capacity for increase. Comparing b1 coefficient with results obtained in the first ballot show decreasing ability to mobilise at higher levels of support.", "Lower 1st ballot result indicate higher capacity for mobilisation and organic increase of the voter base. Consequently, higher levels constrain this ability, as a lot of voters already turned up for voting in the 1st ballot.", "With this in mind, I have chosen a relatively broad range of coefficients that we can expect to see based on historical trends. This is:", "Similar assumptions are made for b2. With each consecutive election PiS\u2019 ability to intercept third party voters weakens. This year it might be a particularly difficult task, as Szymon Ho\u0142ownia\u2019s voters tend to be associated with more liberal values.", "Nonetheless, persuading third party voters will be a challenging task for either candidate, hence we can expect low values of b2 coefficients similarly to 2015 elections.", "Finally, the b0 intercept indicates a uniform increase in the support across all counties. These tend to be particularly high in the case of a big turnout increase, as in 2015.", "On average, they tend to normalize the score, as either candidate rarely receives less than 7\u20138% of eligible votes in any county. Historically, this intercept has been slightly in favour of the PO candidate.", "For the modelling purposes, I assume uniform distribution of these parameters. Truncating each interval into 8 uniformly distributed values and simulating every combination of these gives us 262,144 election simulations.", "The median share of votes puts president Duda in the front-runner position with 50.97% of total votes, closely followed by Trzaskowski with 49.03%.", "The standard deviation for the percentage score is 1.91%, which leaves the winning boundary for Trzaskowski within less than one standard deviation from the mean.", "The model shows that president Duda has 68.8% chance of winning the election this Sunday.", "This is still a relatively thin margin, hugely dependent on the validity of parameter assumptions.", "These parameters cannot be modelled easily relying only on the past three elections. They can be only indirectly inferred from general voting patterns and current political balance.", "What can Trzaskowski do to close the gap?", "Mobilising his own electorate seems to be a particularly effective tactic, due to high polarisation levels.", "Simulations with b1 reaching levels above 0.65, put him on equal terms with his opponent. Trzaskowski\u2019s current voter base has a huge potential for organic growth, and his campaign should try to take advantage of this fact.", "Do you think there\u2019s something missing from this analysis?", "What do you think about the validity of my assumptions?", "Maybe you\u2019d like to chat about this model in more detail?", "Feel free to get in touch!", "I performed all analyses using Python in Jupyter Notebook.", "I downloaded and cleaned electoral data from pkw.gov.pl.
