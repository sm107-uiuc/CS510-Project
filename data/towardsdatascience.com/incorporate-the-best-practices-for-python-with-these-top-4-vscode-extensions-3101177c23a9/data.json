You want your code to be both clean and easy to understand.", "Instead of trying to pay attention to several small details in your code at once, why not using extensions to assist and remind you? This will help cultivate good coding practices.", "VSCode is my favorite IDE because of its useful keyboard shortcuts and extensions. I wrote about my favorite keyboard shortcuts and how these top 4 code viewers in VSCode make it easier for me to review my data. In this article, I will introduce 4 of my favorite VSCode extensions for good coding practice.", "Type hinting indicates the type of value within your Python code, making it easier for the people who use your functions or classes to know which datatype to insert for a specific parameter in your functions or classes.", "For example, by adding type information to a function, it reminds those who use your code to insert an argument of type datetime.", "Type hinting is helpful but it might be difficult for beginners to remember all syntaxes of type hinting. That is when Python Type Hint comes in handy.", "If you are not using Python 3.9, make sure to import List, Set, Dict from typing to specify the data types within your Python list, set, or dictionary", "If you are coding in Python and using VSCode, you definitely should install Pylance. Pylance has many awesome features for Python 3. These features include:", "Have you ever used your class or functions and forgot which parameters to input? Pylance makes it easier for you to input the right parameter and data type by showing the docstrings of the class or function you are using.", "It is quite common to import a lot of libraries or to declare a variable or function that you will not use for the rest of your code in your script. Having unnecessary code makes your code messy and more confusing for others to read your code.", "But it is time-consuming for you to look at every line of your code to make sure you just import the libraries or declare the variables or functions that you will use. Luckily, Pylance makes it easier by unhighlighting the libraries, variables, or functions that are not used!", "Now you can just delete the ones that are unhighlighted! It should look less messy now.", "It is also quite common to use the variables that you have not yet declared in your function or included in your function\u2019s parameter. Pylance detects that and underlines the variables that are not defined.", "And there are more functionalities that I don\u2019t mention here! I encourage you to use Pylance yourself to discover what else this extension can do to help you code faster.", "It is important to have a good docstring with the functions or classes that you write so that it is easier for others to understand and use your code. But you might be lazy to write a proper docstring because it might take you quite a bit of time.", "What if the docstring is automatically created for you? You can use Python Docstring Generator extension to create a docstring for your function or class by simply using Ctrl + Shift + 2.", "Now all you need to do is to replace the words inside the bracket with your description! Your coworkers and yourself in the future will be happy to see well-written docstrings.", "If you prefer other docstring formats, you can switch to one of these formats instead", "Check out the documentation for how to switch the format.", "Nice! Now you have a good docstring, type hinting, and organize your messy code. But there is something you are missing. What if you want to emphasize part of the code that is important or needs to be improved?", "For example, you are using 0.5 as the threshold to convert a list of probabilities into binary values, but you think your results can be improved if you change the threshold.", "However, you want to finish the rest of the code before going back to this code. If you have not just one, but ten lines of code to improve, how do you remember them all?", "That is when code comment with the word TODO comes in handy. But even the comment TODO can be invisible among hundreds of lines of code. Luckily, Better Comments extension makes it easier for you to notice these important annotations.", "With this extension, you will be able to categorize your annotations into:", "Now you can highlight the important comments without being afraid that you might forget the code that needs to be improved or needs to be handled carefully.", "Congratulations! You have just learned 4 different VSCode extensions to adopt good coding practice quicker and easier. Writing good documentation, including type hints, highlighting the important comments, and having clean code will save you hours debugging. Good coding practices will also save your coworkers hours or even days trying to interpret and using your code. As a result, everybody is happy!", "I like to write about basic data science concepts and play with different algorithms and data science tools. You could connect with me on LinkedIn and Twitter.", "Star this repo if you want to check out the codes for all of the articles I have written.
