The Jaccard algorithm will be used to calculate the similarity scores.", "The data consists of almost 60 thousand profiles from one of the biggest online dating websites, OKcupid.com. It consists of features such as age, body type, education, religion and some habits. The features are questions asked to people when they sign up with the dating platform. The first look at the data indicates that it has a lot of non-blank values and require feature engineering.", "First things first, I wanted to get an idea about how positive/negative and polar/nonpolar a person was based on their answers to 10 different essay questions. The questions range from \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing with my life\u201d to \u201cThe six things I could never do without\u201d. To get an overall idea about a person, I appended all the essay answers into one column and ran a sentiment analyzer using TextBlob\u2019s sentiment analysis tool.", "After polarity and subjectivity scores were found, the languages spoken column needed to be changed to integer. That was done by counting the number of commas and adding 1 as default(English).", "Due to the complexity of the data, I used a mode or median imputer rather than a more complex imputing method such as Random Forest Imputer. I then dropped the income and astrological sign columns because they had too many missing values.", "The integer and float columns were turned into a string representation of bins. For example, the age was turned into bins with the code:", "In order to go forward, I wanted to see if my sentiment scores showed significant results and have a relationship with other features. To showcase that, I plotted user positivity sentiment scores against age. While doing that, I answered a popular question. Do people, especially the ones on dating websites, lose hope and get more bitter with age?", "The plot shows that younger people may have written really positive responses but the stand as outliers. On average, the positivity slightly increases as the age of the person increases. There is no strong increment, but definitely a relationship can be observed.", "The Jaccard similarity of sets S and T is |S \u2229 T |/|S \u222a T |, that is, the ratio of the size of the intersection of S and T to the size of their union. We shall denote the Jaccard similarity of S and T by SIM(S, T ).", "The figure shows a Jaccard similarity of 3/8.", "The Jaccard Similarity is coded as:", "The match finding function is written as:", "When we run the function for a random user id 4002; we get the user and the match:", "We can see that the features are mostly similar. The Jaccard similarity score is 0.811. The features are mostly the same, two young people who don\u2019t have kids or do drugs. These are normally more important to an average person but question value isn\u2019t considered in our code.", "Here, we covered only a basic matching algorithm. The top dating websites like OKCupid use more complex code and various other metrics such as distance between users and different weights for different metrics depending on what user values the least/most.", "In this article, I have demonstrated a function that finds a similar user to a selected one. In general, the Jaccard similarity can be used in finding similar products or in text-based problems. Since the data here is from a dating website, I called it \u201cthe match\u201d. The results show that it indeed finds the best match with the most similar features. While I was at it, I showed that positivity increases as the age of the person increases, nullifying the belief that people on dating websites get more bitter with age.", "Have questions?
