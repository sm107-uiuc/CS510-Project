These pitfalls can be avoided by seeking assistance from seasoned developers. According to Chris, he found technical guidance by meeting individuals at tech events, meetups and reaching out through LinkedIn.", "Having a stellar portfolio is age-old advice within the technological industry. Still, Chris provides actionable steps that can be taken to accumulate a series of projects for portfolios. From attending project-based courses to hackathons, it seems Chris has utilised all possibilities of gaining ideas for his projects.", "Bootcamps has quickly become a fast route for individuals coming from unconventional backgrounds to have the necessary skillset to survive within a tech-based role. The article includes a short personal account of Chris\u2019s experience in a Bootcamp and incorporates details on the Bootcamp and price.", "Machine learning related professions have an ongoing learning process. Ideally, the key to success is to understand the fundamentals, and this is the message Chris is sending to readers.", "Chris provides a couple of links that point to learning resources geared towards maths and a summary of theoretical topics that aspiring Data Scientists should have expertise within.", "Taking an MSc is the traditional method of gaining knowledge within a specialised domain.
