In the past few years, the popularity of MOOC platforms has sky-rocketed, prompting many other such platforms to crop up.", "The most popular of them all, Coursera, has been the blue-eyed boy of many learners, for a long time.", "However, not many users are satisfied with all the courses present.", "Sometimes the level of difficulty is too high, or the hands-on labs are outdated, or the instructor hides behind technical jargon, or the videos lack contextual clarity and so on.", "With so many courses coming up, it is essential for the learner to save time and money by choosing only the best course available.", "The real mettle of a course is tested by the number of negative reviews, for only the truly disappointed users bother to write a bad review and give a low rating; which is why even a significantly high rate of negative reviews tells us a lot about the quality of the course. In an age where time is money, it is important we don\u2019t invest time in not-so-good courses.", "But how to do that? There are thousands of reviews for each course, if not hundreds, and most of the reviews displayed on the front page are the top reviews, which are, well\u2026 always good.", "Also, one can\u2019t go by the ratings alone, for they are hardly reliable. Even I have seen ratings as high as 3/4 stars accompanied by a bad review.", "Necessity is the mother of invention.", "A tool was necessary for me to judge which course to opt for without listing down all the reviews and comments from all my prospective courses.", "And that is how CourseraAnalyzer was born.", "In this post, I\u2019m going to walk you through a quick guide on how I developed this indigenous web application that served me an excellent purpose. If you want to delve deeper into the code behind this, feel free to check out the repository for this project.", "Build an application that looked for the course specified by the user, perform sentiment analysis on the reviews, and then display the results as visualizations.", "This had Web Scraping + NLP + Machine Learning + Web Development incorporated in it. Difficult? Yes. Impossible? No.", "My first step was to extract the reviews of the course.", "I used BeautifulSoup (you can use Selenium if you want) for scraping. After taking the URL as an input, I modified the URL to access the course\u2019s reviews page and then scraped all the comments from all the pages.", "(Note: Don\u2019t worry if you cannot make perfect sense of this, since the code snippet is only a small piece of the entire file. My intent is to just give you a tiny glimpse of how this works under the hood.)", "I then used a text classifier (which I had already trained and pickled beforehand) to classify the comments into positive and negative reviews.", "After counting the reviews, I passed the numbers to Chart.js which displays beautiful, interactive graphs on web pages.", "But there was one pesky little problem.", "Scraping thousands of reviews and using a text classifier on them was time-consuming. But I wanted it to go faster.", "So I created a .json file that stored the list of the searched courses, along with their results. If the course entered by the user already existed on the .json file, I simply loaded the results, instead of repeating the same process every time there was a request.", "In the end, I created a small Flask app, defined different API endpoints and functions so as to convert all these programs into one unit. I used Heroku to deploy it on the web.", "This is a screenshot taken of the home page of the site https://courseraanalyzer.herokuapp.com/.", "At the bottom left, there is displayed a list of courses that have already been analyzed. If the course you are looking for isn\u2019t there, enter the URL of the course in the search box and click on \u2018Analyze\u2019.", "It will give a brief report of all the reviews and display a few visualizations to help you reach a conclusion.", "There are many areas where this application is still lagging but for the first version, this works quite well. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any queries regarding this. Thank you!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "IT warlock.
