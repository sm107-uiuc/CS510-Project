Analogy! So, find GANs that \u2018GAN\u2019 pairs of GANs, and you can grow hierarchical abstractions. Use these GANs to make predictions outside of the observed distribution of data \u2014analogies let you zero-shot new tasks.", "I should start with a concrete example:", "Suppose that you have a video-watching neural network that you\u2019ve trained. It\u2019s watched thousands of hours of people holding, throwing, and dropping baseballs. Your network is really good at predicting parabolic trajectories. But, it\u2019s only seen baseballs do that sort of stuff. You show it a single video of someone throwing a rock, and the neural network loses it. Darn.", "But, wait! If you can train a GAN that takes every frame of that rock-hurling video, and converts the rock to a baseball, then you\u2019re golden again! Sure, it might be easier to just get more rock videos, but that problem becomes insurmountable when you try to tackle on-line learning, especially for long-tail events, and the powers of generalization necessary for more adaptive, safer neural networks.", "The key concept here is: take a well-known task (baseball trajectory), combine it with a GAN translator (rock-to-baseball), and thereby make reasonably accurate predictions by means of analogy. (Actually touching-up each frame of the video, to make the rock look like a baseball, is probably too ham-handed. You just want a GAN that does whatever makes the rock-translator network predictive; development in neural network-generated training regimes suggest that the optimal analogy-transformation may look bizarre to us.)", "Think of that GAN\u2019s analogy-finding ability as its own little block of stone. \u2018Cuz we\u2019re building a cathedral with these things\u2026", "Suppose that you\u2019ve been using these GANs to form analogies between hundreds of different tasks. Every task-pair, you check to see if there is a compact and accurate \u2018GANalogy.\u2019 Often, you won\u2019t be able to get a decent GAN unless you make your neural network enormous so that it can memorize everything. Those are the tasks which are, at the sensory level, actually distinct. Ignore those; don\u2019t even bother to train the GAN all the way if it looks like one of them.", "However, there will be tasks that function beautifully even when the GAN analogy-network is pared down to a few hundred neurons. Those GANs are keepers. Once you\u2019ve poke-balled all the GANs you can, you go meta: \u201cFor these two GANs, is there some GAN translation?\u201d These GanGANs will be things like \u201c(rock-to-baseball) works like (sculpture-to-person)\u201d and \u201c(electric field to magnetic field) works like (matrix to matrix)\u201d. Real, useful analogies. Include task-to-GAN and low-layer-to-high-layer GANs, too. Every pair!", "Layer by layer, upward towards greater abstraction, find the GANs that work. Sure, many of them will be redundant \u2014 for example, you might have a baseball-to-rock GAN, baseball-to-slinky, AND slinky-to-rock GAN\u2026 redundancy lets you check your work, similar to the Mixture of Experts neural network models. More importantly, if a few different paths to the answer all give the same result, they are more likely to be the correct answer, because errors tend to differ from each other, while the truth is consistent. Similarly, self-consistency as the sole constraint recently generated near-SOTA unsupervised depth perception from video only.", "I\u2019m reasonably sure that you don\u2019t ever want to explicitly combine the original sensory networks, which is a mistake undertaken in the hopes that \u201cintegrating the numerous tasks into a single, end-to-end neural network will improve performance\u201d. No. Keep all the tiny sensory networks, and keep each separate and redundant GAN, so long as it actually functions as an analogy. That way, any component task has the ability to combine with a new task on its own, forming a specialized and distinct analogy. In contrast, a task which has been integrated into a monolithic, end-to-end network will be obscured from new GAN-analogy formation, due to the fact that the monolithic network as a whole is NOT analogous.", "I\u2019ll keep updating as GanGAN progresses, and I don\u2019t want to overload on details just yet. In brief: there are numerous more-abstract loss functions that may be worth adding to the individual networks\u2019 loss functions, to condition the generation and integration of these GANs effectively. Also, the architecture of GANs for inference phase obviously has a huge role to play; I am inspired by the work on Meta-Neurons for combining the cacophony of GAN outputs. Hinton\u2019s Capsules are a good model to keep in mind, too. Please, feel free to experiment, as well \u2014 I am slow and erratic, so you\u2019ll probably finish before I do. :)", "Your home for data science.
