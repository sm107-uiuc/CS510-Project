Researchers discovered that customers who buy diapers also tend to buy beer. This classic example shows that there might be many interesting association rules hidden in our daily data.", "Association rule mining is a technique to identify underlying relations between different items. There are many methods to perform association rule mining. The Apriori algorithm that we are going to introduce in this article is the most simple and straightforward approach. However, since it\u2019s the fundamental method, there are many different improvements that can be applied to it.", "We will not delve deep into these improvements. Instead, I will show the major shortcomings of Apriori in this story. And in the upcoming post, a more efficient FP Growth algorithm will be introduced. We will also compare the pros and cons of FP Growth and Apriori in the next post.", "Fraction of transactions that contain an itemset.", "For example, the support of item I is defined as the number of transactions containing I divided by the total number of transactions.", "Measures how often items in Y appear in transactions that contain X", "Confidence is the likelihood that item Y is also bought if item X is bought. It\u2019s calculated as the number of transactions containing X and Y divided by the number of transactions containing X.", "An itemset whose support is greater than or equal to a minSup threshold", "Frequent itemsets or also known as frequent pattern simply means all the itemsets that the support satisfies the minimum support threshold.", "Feel free to check out the well-commented source code. It could really help to understand the whole algorithm.", "The main idea of Apriori is", "All non-empty subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent.", "It\u2019s a bottom-up approach. We started from every single item in the itemset list. Then, the candidates are generated by self-joining. We extend the length of the itemsets one item at a time. The subset test is performed at each stage and the itemsets that contain infrequent subsets are pruned. We repeat the process until no more successful itemsets can be derived from the data.", "This is the official pseudocode of Apriori", "Please be aware that the pruning step is already included in the apriori-gen function. Personally, I found this pseudocode quite confusing. So, I organized it into my own version. It should be way easier to understand.", "To sum up, the basic components of Apriori can be written as", "Simulate the algorithm in your head and validate it with the example below. The concept should be really clear now.", "This is the main function of this Apriori Python implementation. The most important part of this function is from line 16 ~ line 21. It basically follows my modified pseudocode written above.", "For self-joining, we simply get all the union through brute-force and only return those are in the specific length.", "To perform subset testing, we loop through all possible subsets in the itemset. If the subset is not in the previous frequent itemset, we prune it.", "In the final step, we turn the candidate sets into frequent itemsets. Since we are not applying any improvement technique. The only approach we can go for is to brainlessly loop through the item and itemset over and over again to obtain the count. At last, we only retain the itemsets whose support is equal or higher than minimum support.", "For more usage and examples, please check out the GitHub repo or the PyPi package.", "There are two major shortcomings of Apriori Algorithms", "We will use the data4.csv(generated from IBM generator) in the repo to showcase these shortcomings and see if we can get some interesting observations.", "By running Apriori on data4.csv, we can plot the process like the graph above. The shortcomings we mentioned above can be found in the observation of the graphs.", "On the right, we can see the itemset size after the three major processes of the algorithm. Two key points can be discovered from the graph", "From the plot, we can tell that most of the running is spent on counting the support. The time spent on candidate generation and pruning is nothing comparing to scanning the original itemset database over and over again.", "Another observation worth attention is that we get a peak in cost at stage 2. Interestingly, This is actually not an accident! Data scientists often meet a bottleneck at stage 2 when using Apriori. Since there are almost no candidates removed at stage 1, the candidates generated at stage 2 are basically all possible combinations of all 1-frequent itemsets. And calculating the support of such a huge itemset leads to extremely high costs.", "Just like what we mentioned above, we knew that the bottleneck of Apriori is normally at stage 2. However, as it shows on the Kaggle dataset plot, this observation may not always hold. To be accurate, it depends on the dataset itself and the minimum support we want.", "As we can see, we need more than one minute to calculate the association rule of data7 with Apriori. Obviously, this running time is hardly acceptable. Remember that I said Apriori is just a fundamental method? The efficiency of it is the reason why it\u2019s not widely used in the data science field. We will take this result and compare it with the result from FP Growth.", "There are many extra techniques that can be applied to Apriori to improve efficiency.
