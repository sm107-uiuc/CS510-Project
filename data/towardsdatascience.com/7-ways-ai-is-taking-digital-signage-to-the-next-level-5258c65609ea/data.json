Today, we are focusing on those opportunities and see the most critical facets of the combination of AI and digital signage.", "Currently, you will conclude that Artificial Intelligence would enhance the capabilities of digital signage. It will use all the data it has to work with to improve how content is created and displayed to the target audience.", "Digital signage is a multifaceted tool, and the addition of Artificial Intelligence expands that versatility and ensures it gets as smooth as it can be.", "Now, let\u2019s have a look at how Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has impacted the world of digital signage.", "The primary purpose of digital signage is to disseminate information. However, today it has emerged to the point where you can collect data with the help of AI.", "Using next-gen digital signage solutions with components like facial recognition, retailers can have a more distinct understanding of who their customers are.", "Since facial recognition comes with its honest share of privacy concerns, the acquired data can impact business strategies or directions in which a firm may go to accommodate their audience. Moreover, digital signage can take the collected information and even use it in real-time.", "As human beings, we are emotional at heart. In fact, something as cold and lifeless as robots and AI can provoke emotion in us. Research has even shown that despite knowing the nature of AI, people still respond to it as if it were a real person. That is why AI brings a new paradigm to the personalized user experience digital signage already offers.", "In digital signage, a customer feels special if the technology treats them in a more personal way. Artificial Intelligence learning enables digital signage to learn and interact with real people in a unique way.", "Digital signage AI can recognize a client and greet her or him. It can communicate the product offers and discounts based on the person\u2019s purchasing history, and more.", "While personalization is an exciting element, when it comes to transactional purchasing, every customer appreciates efficiency.", "Interactive in-store digital signage is always an option. Consumers can see available products, their features, and get more information quicker without waiting for a staff member. Some people might even favor browsing without interruption.", "In the future, AI will make the shopping experience better for customers. For example, a customer will be able to bring one or several items to a nearby display to examine prices and characteristics.", "Digital signage might even enable comparing two products in no time. This can genuinely help to deliver omnichannel shopping experience by bringing many components of online shopping to the real world.", "We\u2019ve mentioned promoting special discounts based on previous purchases of customers. This aspect of Artificial Intelligence can also come into play in producing content. This data can help digital signage to display specific ads.", "On a rainy day or in chillier weather, some products may be preferable to others. You will observe the umbrella vendors come out in real life.", "Likewise, weather information can automatically adjust digital signage content and probably affect purchasing decisions. Ads could be displayed based on not only analytics but also based on weather, time of day, week, year, and more.", "Artificial Intelligence is much more than a technology that identifies a customer\u2019s face. AI also plays a vital role in purchasing ad space.", "It has been here around online for quite some time in the area of showing programmatic ads. It allows the delivery of relevant content and makes real-time bidding more effective.", "Applying this concept to digital signage for retail, proper ad placement can be accelerated. Retailers can take part in programmatic advertising, buying ad space on digital signages worldwide. The efficacy of these ads would be similar to online ads, as digital signage AI uses data about the customers to select which ads to show to them.", "As AI further develops and merges with technology like digital signage, the level of personalization will grow to a great extent. The question is only how far. Productivity will increase as a result of Artificial Intelligence. With digital signage already making customer experience in retail more comfortable for the customer, AI will push this even further. The ease with which consumers find the products and the speed with which they become aware of products suited for them will grow, as well.", "Deep learning is a subset of ML (machine learning) in Artificial Intelligence, where artificial neural networks emulate the human brain in processing information and creating patterns for use in decision making.", "AI-powered engines have access to vast amounts of data. With deep learning, AI-driven platforms can assess large data sets, mostly in real-time, leading to specific reactions.", "With more precision and data processing comes a more solid understanding of the users. But Artificial Intelligence doesn\u2019t necessarily think for you. It\u2019s all about automation. It draws conclusions, detects patterns, and responds to situations.", "The adaptability of smart digital signage allows for different content to be scheduled and displayed at distinct times of the day or even days of a week.", "Content can also be presented in real-time to reflect quickly-changing environments. For example, context-aware digital signage can show content relevant to the weather outside: ads for sunglasses when the sun is shining, or ads for umbrellas can automatically be shown when it rains.", "It can be concluded that AI and digital signage go together hand in hand. The market of digital signage is expected to grow to $32.84 bn by the year 2023, and the market of AI as a whole to $191 bn by the year 2024.", "Both of them have a bright future, from not only a market growth perspective but also the perspective of new developments.", "Several aspects of Artificial Intelligence are already becoming a part of the digital signage world, and it is only a matter of time before they become the famously accepted match.", "Your home for data science.
