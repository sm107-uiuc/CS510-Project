Enjoy the ride!", "Ok, we\u2019ve had a big discussion about what deliberate practice is but let\u2019s now talk about how we might actually implement deliberate practice to reach our end goal and ace the on-site interview.", "Achieve a level 3 rating for each topic.", "We first need to come up with a space where we can objectively capture and track the progress of each topic, each week. To do this, we\u2019re going to take advantage of our 3-point scoring system we mentioned above. This is how we will try to keep this process objective.", "I\u2019m going to walk you through an example of how I might keep track of progress but I encourage you to be creative and think of a format that works for you and your learning style.", "First, create a Google Doc or Sheet to keep track of each topic\u2019s progress. For each topic, create a table to keep track of the topic\u2019s score week-to-week and another table keeping track of your question bank with \u2018right/wrong\u2019 columns.", "I personally also like to have sections to keep track of notes, helpful links and to-dos for each topic. This will become a running list of what to work on next, what you had issues with and what you overcame \u2014 this helps you to become more mindful of your progress throughout the week.", "For me, the layout might look something like this:", "I would also maintain a weekly updated table of the level of each topic at the end of the week. At the beginning, most of these topics will be level 1 (and that\u2019s okay!!). Here\u2019s how I might track this:", "Now that we\u2019ve got an organised space to keep track of our progress, we need to figure out when we\u2019re actually going to fit all this study in!", "Everyone\u2019s schedule is different \u2014 some are interview prepping while working full time, others are job searching full time (\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). For this reason, the time spent and order in which you study each topic is totally up to you and your availability.", "Regardless of how you pick your topics and how much time you have to study, the structure of your study sessions will be the same and follow this cycle:", "We need to give space in between some of these steps. For example, you\u2019re not going to retest the same question within the same hour. It will often be done either later in the day or ideally a few days later.", "We also need to make decisions on how to balance the 20 topics and how to study appropriately for each level. Thankfully, we have a rating system which will help guide us on this.", "Don\u2019t be too harsh on yourself \u2014 if you feel like you\u2019ve made improvement on a topic, MOVE YOURSELF UP!", "However, after studying in this way, you might realise that you need to move something down a level \u2014 don\u2019t be alarmed by this. This is part of the process of uncovering problem areas. You\u2019re probably used to assessing your competence on something by \u2018vibe\u2019 \u2014 now we have an objective measure, so it\u2019s to be expected we might have gotten something wrong.", "For level 2 topics, if you\u2019re spending more time researching than doing questions, then this is an indication that this topic should perhaps move down to a level 1.", "For level 3 questions, if you find that you\u2019re getting them right however it\u2019s consistently poor time and space complexity and your solutions feel a little \u2018hacky\u2019, then perhaps it\u2019s a good idea to move this one down to a level 2 and study some more optimal solutions for these types of problems.", "Trust your judgement here and don\u2019t overthink it!", "Here are a couple of example study plans that show how you might schedule all of what we\u2019ve just talked about. Sorry they\u2019re not very pretty.", "I\u2019ve assumed 2 hours of study/day for each plan. Of course, these are just suggestions \u2014 you can obviously scale accordingly depending on your schedule and time frame. I\u2019m sure you will come up with better schedules!", "The key is to keep the 7-step flow from above.", "I\u2019ve provided the 5, 7, and 14 day plans here to show you that you can fit in study no matter what your schedule is! As a teacher, I\u2019ve heard every excuse under the sun of why \u2018you can\u2019t fit study in\u2019, but I\u2019d be more than happy to sit with you and find time for you!", "Please message me what you come up with \u2014 I\u2019m always interested to see how people get creative with their time!", "I have implemented this study plan with software engineers with great success. I, however, am a data scientist and am currently going through the interview process for data science roles. This field is a little more nuanced than the software engineering interview, given that there still isn\u2019t a straight forward consensus on data science roles.", "Reach out to me directly if you want to have a discussion about preparing for data science interviews \u2014 in case you can\u2019t tell, I love talking about this subject \ud83d\ude1d.", "Now I know, I know. This was a lot and may seem over the top. This is a topic I\u2019m passionate about and that I do believe is in high demand.", "Let\u2019s increase that success rate of on-site interviews and increase our study efficiency at the same time!", "Your home for data science.
