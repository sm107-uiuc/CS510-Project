Its main objective is to build a model that predicts the customers that would or would not subscribe to bank term deposits, and this article aims at sharing my step by step approach of building the model.", "The dataset (Bank-additional-full.csv) used in this project contains bank customers\u2019 data. The dataset, together with its information, can be gotten here. The first step to take when performing data analysis is to import the necessary libraries and the dataset to get you going.", "EDA is an essential part of machine learning model development because it helps us in understanding our data and extract useful insights that will help in feature engineering. Some of the EDA performed in this project includes but not limited to the following;", ".shape returns the number of rows and columns of the dataset.", ".size returns the number of elements in the data i.e the number of rows times number of columns.", ".info() is used to get concise summary of the dataset.", ".describe() is used to view some basic statistical details like percentile, mean, std etc. of numerical columns in the dataset.", ".unique() returns the unique values in a categorical column of the dataset.", ".isnull().sum() returns the sum of missing values in each column of the dataset. Luckily for us, our dataset does not have missing values.", ".select_dtypes(exclude=\u2019number) returns all the columns that does not have a numerical data type.", ".select_dtypes(exclude=\u2019number) returns all the columns that has a numerical data type.", "I made use of tableau (a data visualization tool) for the univariate and bivariate analysis and the tableau story can be found here.", "Correlation shows the relationship between variables in the dataset.", "Seaborn boxplot is one of the ways of checking a dataset for outliers.", "The code above visualizes the numerical columns in the dataset and outliers detected were treated using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

(binary: \u2018yes\u2019,\u2019no\u2019), is highly imbalanced and that can affect our prediction model. This will be taken care of shortly and this article gives justice to some techniques of dealing with class imbalance.", "When building a machine learning model, it is important to preprocess the data to have an efficient model.", "The following preprocessing was done in this stage:", "Machine learning algorithms only read numerical values, which is why we need to change our categorical values to numerical values. I made use of pandas get_dummies method and type-casting to one-hot encode the columns.", "Another data preprocessing method is to rescale our numerical columns; this helps to normalize our data within a particular range. Sklearn preprocessing StandardScaler() was used here.", "To proceed in building our prediction model, we have to specify our dependent and independent variables.", "Independent variables \u2014 are the input for a process that is being analyzed.", "Dependent variable \u2014 Dependent variable is the output of the process.", "The column \u2018duration\u2019 was dropped because it highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y=\u2019no\u2019).", "It is reasonable to always split the dataset into train and test set when building a machine learning model because it helps us to evaluate the performance of the model.", "In a case whereby we have a large number of variables, it is advisable to consider reducing these variables by keeping the most important ones, and there are various techniques for doing this, such as; PCA, TSNE, autoencoders, etc. For this project, we will be considering PCA.", "As earlier stated, we have a highly imbalanced class, and this can affect our prediction if not treated.", "In this project, I made use of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for dealing with class imbalance.", "Note: It is advisable to use SMOTE on the training data.", "Whew!, we finally made it to building the model; data preprocessing can be such a handful when trying to build a machine learning model. Let\u2019s not waste any time and dive right in.", "The machine learning algorithm that was considered in this project includes;", "and the cross validation (this is essential especially in our case where we have an imbalanced class) method used includes;", "As can be seen from the table above, Stratified K-Fold presented a much better result compared to the K-Fold cross validation. The K-Fold cross validation failed to provide the AUC score for the Logistic Regression and XGBoost model. Therefore, for further comparison, Stratified K-Fold results would be used.", "From the result gotten, XGBoost proves to be a better prediction model than Logistic Regression and MLP because it has the highest percentage values in 4/5 of the evaluation metrics.", "XGboost, being the best performing model, is used for prediction.", "The main objective of this project is to build a model that predicts customers that would subscribe to a bank term deposit, and we were able to achieve that by considering three different models and using the best one for the prediction. We also went through rigorous steps of preparing our data for the model and choosing various evaluation metrics to measure the performance of our models.", "In the result gotten, we observe that XGBoost was the best model with high percentage values in 4/5 of the evaluation metrics.", "In this project, I used only three machine learning algorithms.
