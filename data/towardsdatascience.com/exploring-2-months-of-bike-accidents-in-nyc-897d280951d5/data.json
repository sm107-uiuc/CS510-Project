I think it\u2019s so convenient and fun to zoom around the streets and enjoy the city\u2019s amazing atmosphere. I\u2019m thankful for the plethora of bike docks and safe bike lanes that allow me to have these experiences.", "On the contrary, NYC biking can be dangerous because of aggressive driving and an overwhelming amount of cars. In this blog post, I look into an NYC public dataset of collisions involving bikes in Manhattan in January and February 2020. Furthermore I look closer into the details to see why these accidents occurred and what vehicles were involved. We\u2019ll soon see that it may not be the drivers and cars that are the only problems.", "You can read along my code in my jupyter notebook here.", "The original data source is NYC public safety motor vehicle collision crashes. The data shows the exact location of accidents, why they occurred, what vehicles were involved, number of cyclists hurt, time and date of crash. I filtered January and February 2020 accidents in Manhattan and used python pandas to keep only the rows with bicyclists that were either injured or killed (In my data, there were no deaths, fortunately!) The dataframe contains 65 accidents. Here are screenshots of the first 5 rows in two parts. Let\u2019s look at what the data is showing.", "The dataset is organized with vehicle 1 (a driver or biker) as the cause of the accident while occasionally vehicle 2 (the other driver or biker) is blamed as well e.g. both drivers were distracted.", "56/65 or 86% of accidents had contributions from vehicle 1 drivers because of:", "The top reason was driver inattention at 19/56 or 34% and reason \u201cunspecified\u201d in second place. We\u2019ll talk a little about unspecified later. Other reasons include passing, lane usage improper and passenger distraction.", "It\u2019s interesting to read through the lists of reasons to be more aware of these possibilities so that I can be even safer when I\u2019m biking. With 4/56 or 7% of accidents from distracted passengers, I can only imagine how this could\u2019ve cause the accident. Playing music too loud? Talking too much to the driver? Passenger rage towards biker?", "Vehicle 1 consists not only of drivers but bikers too. 9/65 or 14% of vehicle 1 category were made up of bikers with accidents caused because of:", "The top reason was biker inattention/distraction at 67%. The second and third reason are aggressive biking / rage and passing too closely. Lessons learned: Pay attention, keep a cool head, and get space!", "As for \u201cunspecified\u201d reasons by the biker, the reason is also unspecified or missing a reason for vehicle 2, the second party. I assume that there could\u2019ve been a multitude of reasons like unable to conclude what the exact cause. It would be interesting to know the circumstances to lead to two unknown reasons.", "On the other hand, these are some of the reasons how the accidents were caused by both parties:", "The majority of reasons is that both drivers were distracted or not paying attention. Other combinations are cars backing up unsafely while the bike was too close or some kind of error or miscalculation from either driver or biker that caused the accident. Some of the other accidents were caused by Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error. I was wondering what this could possibly be but when I spoke about these accidents with a friend, she told me a personal story. There was a time she was crossing the street texting and did not notice an incoming bicyclist heading her way. The bicyclist tried to avoid her and crashed!", "Let\u2019s look at what vehicles were involved in the overall accidents.", "About 30% of the accidents were caused by taxis, 24% caused by station wagon or SUVs, and 20% of accidents were caused by the bikers! Let\u2019s look closer into how Taxis caused the most accidents.", "Again driver inattention and distraction as well as improperly lane passing. Speaking for myself, I should be careful not to assume vehicles can see me and remember to pass them with caution. New Yorkers taxi drivers are notorious for cutting into lanes without signaling and changing lanes too close to other vehicles. One bad move from the taxi driver or a biker could cause serious injuries!", "Finally I\u2019m also interested in seeing if there were any bike to bike collisions. In 65 accidents, there was only one where one biker passed too closely. Only one biker was injured. Maybe one biker assumed to have enough space to pass by a slower biker but ultimately got too close and caused the crash. I\u2019ll keep my space.", "I love we can look at this data and use our imagination to see how the accident might have happened. 2 months of data already gives me a glimpse of NYC bike safety today. With more months in the analysis, we could start to see more trends. My analysis of these events is helpful to me to understand the ways that I could get into an accident. The reasons above are just a handful of causes but it has also helped me know what else to be aware of as I\u2019m biking. In a future post, I will dive further into this dataset and plot out the crashes along with my Citi Bike trips to learn about my proximity to the accidents.
