This project has been documented to date (linked above); however, in this post, we will summarize our work and discuss our final model.", "In the Fake News Challenge, competitors were given labeled data and tasked with creating a stance detection ML classification model. Stance detection, being the first step in an AI pipeline to classify fake news, is the process of determining the relationship between a news headline and its corresponding body of text. The classes used in stance detection to describe the relationship between the headline and body of text are typically: agree, disagree, discuss, and unrelated. The competition website provides competitors with a training set and a test set, and a baseline GradientBoosting classifier with a weighted accuracy score of 79.53%. The task is a multi-label multi-class problem, in which the model needs to first decide if the headline and body are related or unrelated. Then, if the two are related, categorize their relationship as agree, disagree or discuss. The models submitted to the competition were assessed on a weighted average, 25% weight given to the ability to properly classify the body and the headline as unrelated and 75% weight given to the model\u2019s ability to classify as agree, disagree, or discuss.", "The competition was held in 2016; however, given the advancements in deep learning and the remaining presence of fake news in our society our goal was to create a stance detection model that could outperform the competition winning model. If we were to succeed, our model could potentially be used in a broader AI pipeline used to classify fake news.", "The first step when generating any ML model or deep learning network is typically EDA. The competition provided two csv files, one containing the bodies of text and another containing their labeled stances. In order to better understand the data we first merged the two datasets. The resulting merged pandas dataframe had 49,972 observations with three features: article body, headline, and stance. The dataset was fairly unbalanced as the unrelated label accounted roughly 75% of the data.", "One other interesting thing to come out of EDA was the training data has many different headlines linked to the same body of text. This makes sense considering different authors from different publications often cover the same news topic (different headlines for the same text). The dataset contains 49,972 headlines for 1,683 unique articles for an average of about 30 headlines per article. However, after some more digging, it became clear that some articles are \u201crepurposed\u201d far more frequently than others. The figure below shows one body of text was \u201crepurposed\u201d 78 times, however, generally speaking, the dataset contains mostly unique headline, body pairs. If you would like a more in-depth review of our EDA process, please reference our first post in this series (Part I).", "Next, we wanted to examine the competition winning model to use as a starting point. The model that won the fake news challenge is a weighted average between two models: a gradient-boosted decision trees and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The deep CNN uses embedding applied to the headline and body text. The embedding applies Google News pre-trained vectors. The output of the convolutional layers is sent to a MLP that has a four class output. The four classes are our four classifiers: agree, disagree, discuss, and unrelated. Their model used dropout with a probability of 50% in all of the convolutional layers for regularization. Their hyperparameters were set to logical defaults but were not evaluated to optimize their network. Their CNN structure is further outlined in the figure below.", "The winning submission\u2019s second portion of their weighted average was a decision tree model. This model takes in an input of text-based features which are derived from the headline and body of an article. These inputs are fed into Gradient Boosted Decision Trees in order to predict the relationship between the headline and the body of text (agree, disagree, discuss, or unrelated). This model structure is outlined in the figure below. The inputs into this decision tree model rely heavily on feature engineering. The creators of the winning model conducted feature engineering through preprocessing (generateFeatures.py ), basic count features (CountFeatureGenerator.py) , TF-IDF features (TfidfFeatureGenerator.py ), SVD features (SvdFeatureGenerator.py ), Word2Vec features (Word2VecFeatureGenerator.py ), and sentiment features (SentimentFeatureGenerator.py ).", "In an initial attempt to improve upon the competition winning model we took two steps: we redefined the classification problem and included the engineered features into the CNN.", "The problem defined by the competition, as explained above, is inherently a multi-label multi-class problem. However, we chose to solve it a little differently. We split the problem into two parts, training the models for the two different classification problems.", "A first model is to classify whether the headline and the body are related or unrelated. This model takes in the headlines, bodies, engineered features and labels. It is important to note that the data given by the competition does not have any label name related. We simply created a new dataset with the label related in the place of agree/disagree/discuss. Then a second model is used to classify the relationship between the body and the head as agree/disagree/discuss. These two models are identical in structure, only differing on their classification tasks.", "As shown in the model architecture outlined above, our network includes a third input composed of dense layers. This additional network input replaces the use of XGBoost in the winning model. The input would be an n x 3 matrix, where n is the number of observations and 3 represents the three engineered features: [\u201cfk_scores\u201d, \u201cword_count\u201d, \u201cnum_grammar_errors\u201d]. All of these 3 features are for the body. fk_score is a widely used linguistic metric that measures the complexity of the language the article was written in.", "The convolutional networks, (input 1 and input 2 of the model), follow a simple architecture with two convolutional layers. They output a dense layer with 34 tensors, which then connects to the concatenating layer. The embedding layer, which serves as the first layer of the network, is initialized using the embedding weights previously calculated using Google\u2019s Word2vec. Before we trained the embedding weights we processed the data to take out punctuation and then tokenized the text. Finally the dense layers and batch normalization that complete the architecture (as shown in the image above) also follow a simple structure. The results from this initial model were strong. Using the competition\u2019s specified accuracy score calculation; our overall weighted accuracy score was 89.51%, significantly higher than that of the baseline model score of 79.53%. Additionally, this score was for the test set, and not the final test data that was used in the competition. Therefore, we cannot directly compare our results with that of the winning model. However, it can still be useful to consider the winning model\u2019s accuracy score of 82.02%. This initial model and its results were covered in more depth in the second post of this series (Part II).", "As suggested in Part II of the series, we hoped to use upsampling to rebalance the dataset so that our neural net could better classify unrelated and related headline-body pairs. The balance of the dataset was very skewed towards the unrelated label which accounted for roughly 75% of the data. Note that, from the previous model we split up the task of correctly classifying the different labels into two different tasks. The first neural net had a test accuracy score of 73.13%, which is slightly lower than the balance of the dataset, and so it would seem that upsampling the data may improve the accuracy score of this model. However, upon further consideration, we realized that it did not make sense to upsample the data because real life data will not have an even distribution across classes. Moreover, if we expect the real life data to come from the distribution, then it does not make sense to use upsampling techniques. On top of this, upsampling involves simulating new data and this would be quite time costly given that the nature of the data would require text generation. Therefore, given that we do not know the true distribution of the different classes, it does not make sense to upsample the minority classes.", "While we ultimately decided to not upsample our data, we did train the Word2Vec embedding. In the previous iteration of our model we used Google\u2019s Word2Vec embedding which was trained on newspaper articles. While this embedding is very good and has been trained on terabytes of data, it is not personalized to the data we are using. Training our own Word2Vec embedding unique to the dataset also does not make sense because we lack the volume of data to do so. As such, a convenient and easy to implement solution is one which lightly modifies Google\u2019s Word2Vec embedding. We created two term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) matrices for the headline, and body texts. TF-IDF is a way to measure the relative importance of a word in the context of a larger phrase. The TF-IDF matrices were then multiplied against Google\u2019s Word2Vec embedding to re-weight the embedding. In other words re-weighted embedding = TF-IDF matrix * Word2Vec Embedding. The code for this is provided below.", "Along with re-weighting the Word2Vec embedding, we also redesigned the structure of our neural network. Previously we treated the multi-level classification problem as two separate models, the first of which distinguished between related and unrelated headline-body pairs and the second which distinguished between the following classes: agrees, disagree, and discusses. While these two models performed quite well in conjunction, the solution was quite inefficient. Not only did it take more time to train two models, but training two models is also not the proper solution as the second neural network cannot leverage the weights from the first model to improve the decision making process of classifying the second level of labels. Moreover, the original design of the problem was a multi-level multi-label classification problem, and so we felt that adhering to this structure would improve the model accuracy score.", "Moreover, this model is different from the previous model because it does not use CNN. Instead of CNN layers, the model has bidirectional GRU cells. GRU cells are a more complex version or a recurrent neural cell. GRU cells are designed to circumvent the problem of short term memory where cells will only remember and take into consideration the most recent inputs. When large sequences of text are fed into a recurrent neural cell, the cell may only remember the important information at the end of the text. GRU cells solve this problem by using gates and so can better remember and keep track of the important information in a long sequence of text. In our model, we used bi-directional GRU cells, and so the text is processed through the cell both forwards and backwards to better determine what are the important words in the sequence.", "With these changes, our model initially took 15 hours per epoch to train even though our dataset was quite small. To decrease the training time for our model, we increased the batch size from the default number of 32 to 128 and concurrently decreased the max sequence length of input (number of words considered) from 4,600 to 1000. We decided to reduce the max sequence length to 1000 by looking at the figure 9 below. From the histogram, we can see that there are very few articles where the body has more than 1000 words. We also looked at the number of words in the headlines, but decided that we did not need to decrease the max sequence length (see figure 10).", "The final model structure is illustrated below in two different ways: with a graph, and a table of the layers (figure 11 and figure 12). As we can see below, the largest difference between this model, and the previous model is that the model has bi-directional GRU layers instead of convolutional layers, and that the model is a multi-level multi class neural network.", "As we did before, this model was trained on 39,977 observations and validated on 9,995 observations. We trained the model for 5 epochs due to the intensive time cost of training the model. In the future, the model may perform better if we increased the number of epochs the model is trained for. After 5 epochs, the model had a training accuracy of 92.16% and test accuracy of 90.51%. These values are a 1.1% increase in improvement from the previous accuracy score of 89.51%. While the accuracy score of the final model did improve, it was not as significant as we expected given the number of changes we implemented. Still, the improvement is notable.", "While we are very happy with these model results there is always room for improvement. Potential enhancements can be made to our model by training on more data, experimenting with a deeper network by adding layers to the model, or trying to feed additional or alternative engineered features into the model.", "Github Repo for the third best model in the competition that used a cosine concatenation, when joining the inputs of the neural nets:
