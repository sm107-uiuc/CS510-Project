Three problems I\u2019m observing that this project aims to solve are:", "This module will allow me to \u2018work smart, not hard\u2019, and streamline the data cleaning and EDA stages as much as possible.", "My qdtools, or \u2018quick-and-dirty\u2019 module will initially contain methods for linear regression as well as Ridge and Lasso regularization techniques. It will provide the user with feedback and guidance during use. As expected, the module will lean heavily on existing modules and packages from pandas, sklearn, and statsmodels, and will function primarily for \u2018vanilla\u2019 modeling bespoke for my own needs. Lastly, the module will require continual development and enhancement, and will be open source for collaboration.", "When processing a dataset for a linear regression, a data scientist must follow some defined steps (in short):", "or, as in the CRISP-DM model, data preparation, modeling, and evaluation (repeat as needed).", "Specifically in linear models, I found that some steps of the process could be wrapped in a function to reduce time coding and limit errors, starting with importing modules and flat-files", "Following this is dummy or OneHot encoding, scaling and normalization, and modeling. We will look at how qdtools helps us speed through this process.", "Disclaimer: this demonstration progresses quickly because we are already familiar with the kc_house_data dataset", "First things first, the qdtools.py file is located in the site-packages folder, so I don\u2019t need a copy in the working directory of my jupyter notebook. At this time, the only class to instantiate is LinearVanilla", "Excellent. The user is even greeted with a confirmation that the object was created and some direction to try a help() method. Let\u2019s check it out.", "That is helpful! Ok, let\u2019s jump right in with out kc_house_data.csv.", "Again, how communicative. We typically would view the dataframe and explore some details with .info() and .describe(), but let\u2019s see what the qd_info_df() method can show us", "Yike, that\u2019s a lot of info to throw out there. However, notice anything different? Not only is this the info() and describe() outputs from one funtion call, but they are slightly modified to include some potentially useful information. In this case, we can see some additional quantile data at 1 and 99%; that could come in handy...", "right now. Looking closely at this dataset, I see there is a house with 33 bathrooms, but 99% of the houses had fewer than 6. Lets use the cut99() method to remove some outliers (in other columns as well)", "NOTE: You may not want to (read, you may be told that you shouldn't) cut outliers in this manner or at all, but it was a learning experience for me to include the ability to do it quickly and easily.", "Now let\u2019s split our data and set a categorical feature, zipcode.", "Two short lines of code using methods. I see myself using this method a lot going forward! Unseen here, but the test_size and random_state can be manipulated here as with test_train_split(), from which target_and_split() derives from. Before we run our model (already?!), let\u2019s drop some columns that we don\u2019t want to include in our vanilla model right now, and also, lets take care of some nulls", "Believe it or not, we\u2019re ready to run some models. For LinearVanilla, we run two methods to get the statsmodels OLS and sklearn LinearRegression, Ridge and Lasso scores.", "We can take a peek at our training scores,", "and we can access our OLS summary as an attribute of our object", "We just ran three \u2018models\u2019 on a raw dataset (of which we were familiar) and scored 0.83\u2026 that\u2019s excellent! We even used a categorical feature but didn\u2019t have to deal with coding out the get_dummies(). Also, my original project with an R\u00b2 of 0.87 included engineered features that we did not explore here. Unfortunately, I do not have analysis of the errors as of the date of publish on this blog.", "The development of this module was far more challenging (and time consuming) than expected. The first lesson learned is to define the scope of the module in advance; I found myself celebrating the successful execution of a new block of code I contrived moments prior, only to find it broke a key function of the module.", "Some more technical discoveries include the placement of imports within the module (before declaring the class), efficient control flow,", "and where to store the .py file so the module can be used system-wide (see this useful article). I also gained wonderful experience using a text editor and debugging. All in all, it was exciting to see my code come to life and to create for myself a tool I may use quite frequently.", "I cannot overstate that I am aware the module may not be practical for many data scientists and that it is mostly a practice in OOP. qdtools 1.0 is an exciting and useful module that has some great levers for regression, but it is not without its drawbacks.", "Before more features are added, I will invest time in creating thorough documentation and an organized repository so anyone can use and contribute to this project.", "Your home for data science.
