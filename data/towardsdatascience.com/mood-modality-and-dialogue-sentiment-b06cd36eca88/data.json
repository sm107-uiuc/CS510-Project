For example, cross all the not-included-in-any-VP words from the following customer reviews:", "In order to charge meaning to the sentence, many languages like the verb to admit different inflections such as tense and person. Moreover most of the time we want to express our feeling and opinions about how the proposed action by the verb happened: are we sure, did we see the action by our own eyes, do we think it\u2019s likely or unlikely?", "This is more of a semantic capability, thus one usually needs more than inflecting the verb, more than grammatical constructions. Function of the verb is a broad topic, but I will explain some basic concepts before the statistical parts. You can skip to the next section if you have this background.", "Tense is a grammatical realization of time by means of verbal inflection. English has 2 tenses: past and present. Future is not a tense not having an inflectional marker, but it is rather a time . Future time is formed either by will or with adverbs such as tomorrow , 8 o'clock or next week/month etc. As you see tense is a grammatical concept and time is rather a semantic concept.", "Another concept is aspect, a grammatical category which reflects the action given by the verb happened with respect to time. English has two aspects:", "One can summarize tense and aspect as follows:", "Voice in English is either passive or active, as we learnt in high school. Passive voice has further semantic subcategories, but in this article, we will stay at high school level grammar \ud83d\ude09", "Mood is a grammatical category indicating whether a verb expresses a fact (indicative mood) or conditionality (subjunctive mood). Some examples are:", "Mood is grammatical and associates to two semantic notions: modality and illocution. Illocution of a sentence can be thought as sentence type :", "Modality is a semantic notion that is related to speaker\u2019s opinion and belief about the event\u2019s believability, obligatoriness, desirability, or reality. Modality in English can be achieved by modal verbs (will/would, can/could, may/might, shall/should, must), modal adverbs (maybe, perhaps, possibly, probably), some subordinate clauses including (wish, it\u2019s time,possible, probable, chance, possibility ), some modal nouns (decree, demand,necessity, requirement, request) or some modal adjectives (advisable, crucial, imperative, likely, necessary, probable, possible).", "From now on, we will see the different verbal features that customers use to interact with conversational agents and how those usages lead to different semantics.", "Let\u2019s begin with our Chris, our voice assistant in your car and see some typical user utterances in automotive conversational AI.", "Chris datasets include many imperative sentences:", "Sometimes the utterance consists only of a noun phrase:", "Particles are always a part of any voice assistant dialogue dataset:", "Of course, some cursing and insulting are included, some in the form of sarcasm:", "Chris is a driver assistant, so it is pretty normal that the utterances are succinct and to the point. It is not due to rudeness or roughness, just because one needs to speak short while driving. Compare the following two sentences, obviously, the first one is easier if you are driving:", "Imperative sentences in SLU are very common and definitely does not mean rudeness nor related to any speaker sentiment. Nothing interesting here really, first groups of utterances have verbs in the imperative mood, active voice and unmarked aspect. No modal verbs, no modal expressions or past tense. Sentiment for a voice assistant, in this case, better be calculated from the speech signal.", "Spoken language may not be very exciting so far, then we can switch to written language which allows longer sentences hence more verb forms \ud83d\ude04 I used Women\u2019s E-Commerce Clothing Reviews dataset to explore usage of verbal features. I will use lovely spaCy matcher (definitely not just because I am a contributor \ud83d\ude04) in this section. The dataset includes user reviews and ratings about purchases from a e-commerce website.", "Before starting, let\u2019s remember the POS tags related to verbs as we will go over the verbs mostly. English verbs have five forms: the base (VB and VBP), -s (VBZ), -ing (VBG), past (VBD), and past participle (VBN). Again, future time has no marker. Modal verbs can , could , might , may , will , would admit the tag MD .", "Let\u2019s begin with Voice , matching patterns to passive voice are is/was adverb* past-participle-verb and have/has/had been adverb* past-participle-verb . Corresponding Matcher patterns can be:", "The first pattern is is/was , followed by any number of adverbs, then a past participle verb. POS is for UD POS tags and TAG is for extended POS. The second pattern is similar: have , has and had is represented by lemma : have .", "I\u2019ll first import spaCy, load English model then add these two rules to the Matcher object:", "Then I run the Matcher against the dataset and here are some passive voice examples, both from positive and negative reviews:", "How do the number of passive voice verbs in a review correlate to the review rating? First of all, let\u2019s see the rating distribution of the reviews:", "Next, we see the distribution of passive voice verb counts in reviews. Many reviews do not include passive voice at all, some have one passive verb and few have more than one passive construction.", "Do the number of passive voice verbs correlate to the review rating? From the below, indeed no (checking out the heatmap alone is enough, it points to no correlation at all).", "No surprise looking at the corpus sentences, passive voice can be \u201cdesigned by a famous designer\u201d or \u201cthey are returned\u201d. While referring to the cloths, how it is designed, tailored, done can be negative or positive; it is returned, ruined, presented can be negative or positive as well.", "Let\u2019s see how the time of the verb tense and aspect correlates to the review rating. Remember past and present tense are easy to calculate (by looking at the verb inflection), and future is not really a tense since there is no inflection. We will count number of future time occurrences by counting wills, going tos and time adverbs.", "We can do the tense-aspect table again with Matcher patterns this time:", "I will also count present perfect progressive tense (\u201chave been doing\u201d) and past perfect progressive tense (\u201chad been doing\u201d), they will contribute both perfective and progressive aspect counts for present and past tenses.", "Here are some examples of the tense and aspects used in the reviews:", "What about the future time? Since there is no morphological marker, we can get help from will , going to , plan to , in 2/5/10 days , next week/month/summer , the day after tomorrow \u2026", "and examples from the corpus are:", "According to the below counts, customers used past tense a lot. Present tense is also used widely, whereas future time is used once or twice in each review.", "According to the heatmap below, usage present and future tense is not really correlated to the rating; both negative and positive ratings include these two tensed verbs. However, past tense looks a bit negatively correlated; more usage of the past tense means worse rating. Perfective and progressive aspects also do not look very bright, they are also a bit negatively correlated.", "The below ridgeline plot shows some information, better reviews tends to have a spike towards 0 usage of past tense; unhappier customers tend to have a smoother usage of past tense instead. A possible explanation might be customers complained a lot: \u201cpackage came late\u201d, \u201cwaistline didn\u2019t fit\u201d, \u201cI couldn\u2019t zip\u201d, \u201cI didn\u2019t like it\u201d; whereas happy customers look to the future \ud83d\ude04We all look to the future when we are happier, don\u2019t we?\ud83d\ude09", "As we saw, modality is a semantic notion and the same modal can give different modalities. Let\u2019s see different semantics could introduced for an example:", "could is correlated to both negative and positive sentiment. Possibility mood looks like on the positive side, where irrealis looks like being both positive or negative.", "What about couldn't ? It is a whole another story, examples below show how much couldn't provides semantic richness to both negative and positive sentiment, though almost all examples include only one type of modality:", "would and wouldn't might feel different but statistically, they are similar to could and couldn't :", "Irrealis happens both in negative and positive reviews. Consider:", "Then no surprise that the presence of would/wouldn\u2019t/could/couldn\u2019t does not give away much about the review sentiment.", "MD being the modal verb tag and we exclude will .", "Dear readers, here we reach the end of this article. We had a great time with spaCy, haven\u2019t we (as usual)? \ud83d\ude03 We process huge amounts of data every day but sometimes we forget to read what is written in the corpus.
