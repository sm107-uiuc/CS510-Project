It assumes you have a copy of RStudio installed, which is free for individuals.", "Let\u2019s start by looking at the very basics of how we enter commands in R, to tell R what we want to do. This is called giving R an expression.", "If you open an RStudio session, you\u2019ll see a console with some introductory text, and a prompt (the little > symbol):", "You can type commands after that prompt, and R will evaluate them after you hit Return or Enter; that means it will interpret them for meaning and try to compute some kind of result.", "To begin with, let\u2019s just use R as a glorified scientific calculator. Enter these commands and hit Enter to get some output:", "So R understands numbers and common mathematical operators. This includes multiplication with an asterisk, *, and division with the forward slash, /.", "You can compute powers with the caret symbol, ^ (shift-6), for instance to compute four squared. You can do negative numbers too.", "R understands decimal notation (whether it\u2019s a . or a , depends on your country; R is typically smart about that). We do not use commas or other thousands separators in large numbers though: that will give us an error.", "R also understands and respects the order of operations. Powers come before multiplication, which comes before addition, and so on. Yes, you\u2019ll have to dust off your recollection of high-school math. For operations within the same level, R works from left to right.", "You can modify this order with parentheses, just as you would in any othermathematical context. If you want one plus two to be evaluated first, you put it in parentheses and get a quite different answer:", "We can also use parentheses to define a fraction. This really matters in certain cases. For instance, what if you want to take a root of a number? A root is actually a fractional power. So instead of\u2026", "We want to reverse it, so that we start with 16 and take the square root.", "But we\u2019ve actually done it wrong: the above command won\u2019t evaluate in the order we want, because R will take the caret first \u2014 meaning do the power first \u2014 which means this is really 16 to the first, then divided by two.", "But we want to take the square root. We need to put the fraction in parentheses. Then we get the correct root of 16 being four (not eight).", "Also note in my examples here that I space out symbols in R. We don\u2019t technically have to; these two commands produce the same result:", "But the second is probably easier to read.", "Let\u2019s end the section with a slightly more applied example. We can do a geometry problem like finding the volume of a sphere. The formula for that is four-thirds pi times radius cubed:", "Using an approximate pi and a radius of 100, we can enter this in R like so:", "R also happens to understand the word pi as a special symbol, so we can use that instead and get a more accurate answer:", "Now, a small exercise for you is doing the calculation in reverse: starting with a volume of 100, determine what the radius was.", "That wasn\u2019t so hard, was it? Now you understand how R interprets simple statements. Next you could start thinking about storing values in variables, and how to use them.", "Jasper McChesney is a senior data analyst, with a background in biological science and data visualization.
