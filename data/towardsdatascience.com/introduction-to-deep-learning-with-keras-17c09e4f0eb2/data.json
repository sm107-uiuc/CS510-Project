It enables fast experimentation through a high level, user-friendly, modular and extensible API. Keras can also be run on both CPU and GPU.", "Keras was developed and is maintained by Francois Chollet and is part of the Tensorflow core, which makes it Tensorflows preferred high-level API.", "This article is the first of a little series explaining how to use Keras for deep learning.", "In this article, we will go over the basics of Keras including the two most used Keras models (Sequential and Functional), the core layers as well as some preprocessing functionalities.", "I assume you already have a working installation of Tensorflow or Theano or CNTK. If you don\u2019t check out the links above.", "Keras can be installed using pip or conda:", "Keras provides seven different datasets, which can be loaded in using Keras directly. These include image datasets as well as a house price and a movie review datasets.", "In this article, we will use the MNIST dataset, which contains 70000 28x28 grayscale images with 10 different classes. Keras splits it in a training set with 60000 instances and a testing set with 10000 instances.", "To feed the images to a convolutional neural network we transform the dataframe to four dimensions. This can be done using numpys reshape method. We will also transform the data into floats and normalize it.", "We will also transform our labels into a one-hot encoding using the to_categorical method from Keras.", "The easiest way of creating a model in Keras is by using the sequential API, which lets you stack one layer after the other. The problem with the sequential API is that it doesn\u2019t allow models to have multiple inputs or outputs, which are needed for some problems.", "Nevertheless, the sequential API is a perfect choice for most problems.", "To create a convolutional neural network we only need to create a Sequential object and use the add function to add layers.", "The code above first of creates a Sequential object and adds a few convolutional, maxpooling and dropout layers. It then flattens the output and passes it two a last dense and dropout layer before passing it to our output layer. If you aren\u2019t confident build a convolutional neural network(CNN) check out this great tutorial.", "The sequential API also supports another syntax where the layers are passed to the constructor directly.", "Alternatively, the functional API allows you to create the same models but offers you more flexibility at the cost of simplicity and readability.", "It can be used with multiple input and output layers as well as shared layers, which enables you to build really complex network structures.", "When using the functional API we always need to pass the previous layer to the current layer. It also requires the use of an input layer.", "The functional API is also often used for transfer learning which we will look at in another article.", "Before we can start training our model we need to configure the learning process. For this, we need to specify an optimizer, a loss function and optionally some metrics like accuracy.", "The loss function is a measure on how good our model is at achieving the given objective.", "An optimizer is used to minimize the loss(objective) function by updating the weights using the gradients.", "Augmentation is a process of creating more data from existing once. For images you can to little transformations like rotating the image, zooming into the image, adding noise and many more.", "This helps to make the model more robust and solves the problem of having not enough data. Keras has a method called ImageDataGenerator which can be used for augmenting images.", "This ImageDataGenerator will create new images that have been rotated, zoomed in or out, and shifted in width and height.", "Now that we defined and compiled our model it\u2019s ready for training. To train a model we would normally use the fit method but because we are using a datagenerator we will use fit_generator and pass it our generator, X data, y data as well as the number of epochs and the batch size. We will also pass it a validation set so we can monitor the loss and accuracy on both sets as well as steps_per_epoch which is required when using a generator and is just set to the length of the training set divided by the batch_size.", "We can visualize our training and testing accuracy and loss for each epoch so we can get intuition about the performance of our model. The accuracy and loss over epochs are saved in the history variable we got whilst training and we will use Matplotlib to visualize this data.", "In the graphs above we can see that our model isn\u2019t overfitting as well as that we could train more epochs because the validation loss is still decreasing.", "Keras is a high-level neural networks API, capable of running on top of Tensorflow, Theano and CNTK. It enables fast experimentation through a high level, user-friendly, modular and extensible API and as well as running on the CPU and GPU.", "This article was the first of a little series going over how Keras works.
