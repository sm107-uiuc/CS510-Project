That is why the concept of Hypothesis Testing comes into the picture.", "You can find out more about Inferential Statistics and Central Limit Theorem in my previous articles.", "Using Inferential, Descriptive, and Exploratory analysis, we performed some research on the population sample. We derived some insights from the sample and made claims about the entire population. These are just the claims; they are not exactly true. This type of claim or assumption is called Hypothesis.", "There are some ways or tricks to check the Hypothesis, and if the hypothesis is correct, then we apply it to the whole population. This process is known as Hypothesis Testing. The final goal is whether there is enough evidence that the hypothesis is correct. As we have already seen in Inferential Statistics and Central Limit Theorem(CLT), we will work with sample data and confirm our assumption about the population in Hypothesis Testing.", "In Hypothesis Testing, we formulate two hypotheses:", "The null hypothesis is the prevailing belief about a population. It states that there is no change or no difference in the situation or the claim. H\u2080 denotes the null hypothesis.", "The alternate hypothesis is the claim that opposes the null hypothesis. H\u2081 denotes an alternate hypothesis.", "For Example, in a criminal trial, the jury has to decide whether the defendant is innocent or guilty for a case. Here the null hypothesis is, the defendant is innocent just like before the charges. The alternate hypothesis is the defendant is guilty, and the prosecutor would try to prove this.", "In hypothesis testing, we reject the null hypothesis if there is sufficient evidence to support the alternate hypothesis. If there is no sufficient evidence for the alternate hypothesis, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is how we make claims. In any case, we should never say that we \u201caccept\u201d the null hypothesis.

Null Hypothesis never contains \u2260 or < or > signs.", "The next most crucial step after formulating a null and alternate hypothesis is making a decision to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.", "Let\u2019s take an example to understand how to decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.", "Claim: Average time taken by the employees to reach the office is 70minutes.

Which means the area till UCV (Cumulative Probability till that point) would be 1\u20130.025 = 0.975.", "So, we need to find Z score at the value of 0.975 using Z-Table.

The type 1 error is also called the level of significance of the hypothesis test.", "The Type-II error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, but we fail to reject it, i.e., fail to reject H\u2080 when it is false.In practical terms, this is the most severe error we can make. The probability of type 2 error is denoted by beta (\u03b2).", "As we have seen, a Hypothesis is a claim or an assumption that we make about one or more population parameters. There are two types of Hypotheses, Null hypothesis (H\u2080) and Alternate hypothesis (H\u2081).
