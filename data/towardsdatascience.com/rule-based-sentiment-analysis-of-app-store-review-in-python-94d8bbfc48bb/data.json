We are going to use a Python package called VADER and test it on app store user comments dataset for a mobile game called Clash of Clan.", "Based on the official documentation, VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is:", "\u2026 a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.", "Unlike the conventional machine learning approach, the method used by VADER is geared towards social media posts. It might not work very well for literature or news article. However, one major advantage is that the inference time is extremely fast and you can run it smoothly on a simple laptop.", "There are 3 sections in this tutorial:", "Let\u2019s proceed to the next section and start installing the necessary modules.", "You can easily install VADER in Python via pip install. It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment before you continue with the installation. Activate your virtual environment and run the following command.", "We will need another module called pandas as well when reading the dataset. Install it via the following command:", "Head over to the following link and download the entire dataset into the root directory of your project. You should have a csv file called clash-of-clans.csv with the following data inside it.", "In the next section, we are going to write some Python code.", "I am going to use Jupyter Notebook for this tutorial. Having said that, you can run it normally inside a Python file as well.", "Add the following import declaration at the top of your file.", "Next, initialize an instance of SentimentIntensityAnalyzer class. We are going to reuse this instance each time we calculate or analyze the sentiment of a text.", "Make sure that clash-of-clan.csv reside in the same directory as your file. Load the dataset via the read_csv function. Modify the path to the file if you stored it in other location.", "You should see the following output at the console. The formatting might be slightly different if you are running on Python file instead of Jupyter Notebook.", "You can calculate the sentiments of a single text via the polarity_scores function provided by this module.", "You will get a dictionary containing 4 key/value pairs as follow:", "The pos, neu, and neg scores are ratios for proportions of text that fall in each category (so these should all add up to be 1... or close to it with float operation). These are the most useful metrics if you want multidimensional measures of sentiment for a given sentence.", "The compound score is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). This is the most useful metric if you want a single unidimensional measure of sentiment for a given sentence. Calling it a 'normalized, weighted composite score' is accurate.", "Typically the threshold is set as follow:", "Create a new function and insert the following code in it. This function accepts an input text and returns the sentiment of the text based on the compound score. Sentiment label consist of:", "Once you have created the function above, create a new DataFrame that consist of three columns:", "Run the calc_vader_sentiment function inside a list comprehension as follow", "It should take a few seconds for it to calculate the scores since we have about 50000 rows of data. You can simply view the first 10 results by running the following code.", "You should get the following results.", "If you intend to save it to a file, you can do so via the to_csv function provided by the pandas module. Modify the name of the file according to your preferences.", "Let\u2019s recap on what we have learned today.", "We started off with a brief explanation on VADER and its functionality. Then, we installed the necessary modules via pip install and downloaded the clash-of-clan.csv dataset from Kaggle.", "After that, we moved on to implement our own code to calculate the sentiments score of the user reviews by using just the compound score calculated by VADER.", "Apart from that, we also learnt to save the final output into a csv file for our reference in the future.", "Thanks for reading this piece.
