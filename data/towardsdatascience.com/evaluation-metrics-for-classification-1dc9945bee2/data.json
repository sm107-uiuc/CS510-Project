So, there are other evaluation metrics that help us to have a better understanding of how much performative is the model. Some of these metrics are precision, recall, ROC curve and F1-score.", "Obviously, when we select a metric we have to know the end goal of the machine learning application in mind. So, we need to understand the entire decision-making process in order to build a good model.", "In this article, we will see all these topics and the application with python.", "Before to speak about precision and recall, let me introduce briefly what is the confusion matrix.", "The confusion matrix is the most comprehensive way to represent the result of evaluating a binary classification. Below an example of how a confusion matrix looks like.", "As you can see above a value could be classified as TN(true negative), TP(true positive) or FN(false negative), FP(false positive).", "In summary, you can institutively understand that when a value is classified wrongly in a specific class, the result will be FN or FP. Instead, when the classification is correct we will have TN or TP.", "From this perspective, we can easily compute our accuracy that is given by the following ratio:", "So, we can say that accuracy is the proportion of true results by considering all different results.", "For what concerns the precision, we want to know the proportion of the predicted values which are rightly classified as positive. So :", "Precision is very useful when we want to be sure about our prediction because it shows us how many of the values predicted as positive are actually positive.", "Recall is another very useful metric which permits us for example to know the proportion of the number of values correctly classified as positives upon the total values that are actually positives.", "Part II: Receiver operating characteristics (ROC)", "Now imagine you want to compare the false positive rate (FPR) and the true positive rate (TPR).", "The TPR is the Recall that we have seen before. So the formula will be:", "Instead, the FPR is given by the following ratio:", "So, to compare FRP and the TPR, we can simply use the ROC curve.", "For the ROC curve, the ideal curve is close to the top left. The goal is to obtain a model that produces a high TPR(recall) whit a low FPR.", "However, if we want to summarize the ROC curve using a single number we can compute the area under the curve (AUC). Below a representation of ROC curve and its area.", "A good way to have a full picture of precision and recall is by using F1-score. F1-score gives us the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Below we can see the formula.", "It is important to know that F1-score is a better measure than accuracy when we work with imbalanced binary classification datasets.", "Anyway, from sklean metrics we can import the classification report that gives us the F1-score and all metrics such as precision and recall.", "In classification problems, these are the metrics that are most used to evaluate the performance of a model. So, every time you have to build a classification model, it is a good idea to evaluate the performance of your model by using the metrics that we have seen in this article.", "Thanks for reading this.
