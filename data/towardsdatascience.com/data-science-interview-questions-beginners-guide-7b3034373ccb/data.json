Let\u2019s go back to the 20th Century, where businesses operate without the luxury of the technology we have today. Businesses literally record down their transactions in pen and paper, which they will use later to gain insights about their business.", "These types of questions can be easily answered with a little bit of mathematical computation and data manipulation. Businesses hire what you call \u2018Statisticians\u2019 back then to do exactly that. Hence, Statisticians and Mathematicians inherited the reporting role since then, which is why Mathematics and Statistics are some of the core prerequisites to become a reporting data analyst today.", "However, things have changed.With the development of the internet, businesses start to operate online.People spend the majority of their time on the internet, which is why you are reading my article right now.", "According to digitalcommerce360.com, the eCommerce market alone has steadily been on the rise.With about a 20% increase in spendings each year, the eCommerce market had achieved more than $3.46 trillion in 2019.", "Instead of physical stores, businesses run websites and apps now.Instead of pen and paper, data can be found in databases now.", "This is where you come in.", "You are supposed to possess sufficient mathematical knowledge to deal with data, as well as programming knowledge to know how to store, manipulate and model data in an efficient way.", "As of today, most employers hire data scientists to manage, organize and extract insights from their data for descriptive and predictive analysis. A minority of them", "split the work into data engineering, data analysis and data science where roles are better defined.Hence, you would need to have a broad range of knowledge regarding data if you were to ever have a shot on a role like this.", "If you\u2019re still confused about the role of a Data Scientist, I talk about the role in-depth here", "Being a new industry, the data science role is loosely defined in companies.If you ask around, data scientists from different companies have different responsibilities.", "Some of them manage entire data warehouses including ETL/ELT pipelines, warehouse architecture, and table structures", "Some of them are more analysis-oriented, producing amazing visualizations and communicating with business owners", "Some of them create data products such as image and audio recognition through modeling data", "Some of them do all of the above", "Hence, unlike a traditional software engineer who usually gets coding questions, no one really knows what to expect going into a data science interview \u2014 which is why you should gather experiences from people who had been there.", "You can view a full portfolio of my work here.", "My name is Nicholas Leong. I\u2019m a part of the Business Intelligence/ Data Team in one of the most visited websites/app in my country that provides a marketplace where users can buy and sell second-hand items. I\u2019ve been here for almost 2 years now.", "Right now, my role comprises of a few core responsibilities. I\u2019ve fully built and design ELT pipelines that extract data from relevant sources into our data warehouse for the convenient use of Business Analysts.I\u2019ve written about it here.", "I work a lot in improving our data warehousing functions, including implementing streaming pipelines, proper metadata management, table structures and more. I am also heavily involved in the technical roles of Machine Learning Projects, introducing new data products into our website and app. Besides that, I also perform relevant analysis to assist product managers in making business decisions, as well as maintaining the automation of said analysis for future use.", "Before this, I worked in 2 major financial institutions, one being the largest bank in my country. Both roles were in the data team as well, the first one being an intern while the second being a business analyst.", "Between all of my job switching, I\u2019ve been exposed to a large number of interviews related to data science, ranging from large airline companies whose CEO may or may not be involved in fraud cases recently, to medium-sized companies that sell mattresses.", "When I started, I didn\u2019t know what to expect in these interviews, nor could I find any useful resources online at the time. Hence, I\u2019m going to share my take on data science interview questions, exposing the kinds of questions commonly asked and expectations of the interviewer.", "They usually start with the usuals.Your background, your passion, and your goals.Once that\u2019s out of the way, they would want to examine some of your work.", "Questions like these always pop up for me:", "I know, you\u2019re thinking this is way too obvious, don\u2019t all interviewers ask these questions?", "Well, if it\u2019s that obvious, why do the majority of interviewees lack of a platform/space to showcase their work? Come prepared, if you can host a site that shows all your achievements with proper documentation and code, it adds a lot of points to you.You would be surprised at how rare this happens nowadays.If you are a fresh graduate, showcase some of your projects. It is a great way to bring up topics.", "If you lack the former, you need to explain your work extremely well. Try to avoid establishing what your team had achieved first. Instead, focus more on what you did, be as specific as possible. Make sure to mention the technologies you use as well like GCP Platform and Neural Networks.", "I have been to interviews where they don\u2019t ask a single technical question.On the flip side, I have been to interviews where I had to complete a 4-hour technical test just to get a chance to be interviewed. It varies.", "If you can showcase your work efficiently as I mentioned previously, I would worry less about this part. However, it is normal for a data scientist to be tested technically. Hence, you can expect these kinds of questions.", "A data scientist has to get data from somewhere. Companies usually store all their data in a SQL data warehouse for analysts like yourself to query from.", "If you can\u2019t navigate through SQL fluently, that is one of the red flags you will fail the interview.", "Besides the basics, here are the major topics you should know:", "The way they usually test you is by giving you a dataset and asking for a result in return. Here\u2019s an example of one of the toughest one I\u2019ve got:", "Instead of trying to write out the solution, it will give you extra points if you can work the solution out in your head and just read it out instantly.", "Theory questions will also pop up.Questions like \u2018 how does a left join work\u2019 shouldn\u2019t prompt you to write out any solution at all. Instead, your explanation shows how well you understand SQL. Here\u2019s an answer in my own words.", "I\u2019ve gotten questions I couldn\u2019t answer as well like:", "I kindly replied that I had never used an outer join for my queries before, and hence couldn\u2019t answer the question.", "There are many ways to solve a SQL query. The solutions I usually come up with involve left and inner joins, which is why I lack the outer join knowledge.Don\u2019t be afraid to admit that you don\u2019t know something, as long as you can explain your reasons well.", "Remember, data science is still an evolving industry. Even for Google Cloud Platform, they had just released a new pipeline solution, Google Cloud Fusion a few months ago as of this writing.It is impossible for someone to know every technology and programming language up to date. Hence, it is alright to admit that as long as you have an alternative.", "After obtaining data, data scientists often have to manipulate data into the form they want it to be.It does not really matter what method you use for this, but complex manipulation will require at least some sort of programming language.", "Depending on your role, the requirements of programming languages will differ. If you\u2019re working more on the business side of things, plain excel might do the trick. If you\u2019re working more on the engineering side of things, companies might require you to master certain programming languages.", "This is due to the limitations of the technology stack the company is using.Here\u2019s an example, a company is using Google Cloud Dataflow to ingest data into Google BQ. By default Dataflow only allows Java or Python as their programming language. Hence, if your role involves dataflow, you will need to master either one of these languages.", "Some companies require you to master specific programming languages for data manipulation. If you can showcase your ability in a different language, you will be able to pick up a second language pretty quickly, be sure to tell them that.", "Here are the major topics I\u2019ve been asked about handling data:", "Theory questions may pop up for these topics. Things like:", "Some companies will give a code test for this section.I usually get a CSV file containing data on a specific subject.They will then ask for specific findings in return. Here\u2019s an example.", "I will not go through the solution in detail for this as it is quite lengthy. Steps involved are :", "Strong knowledge in Pandas and NLP is required for this question.Here\u2019s a write-up on Pandas that may help you to master the basics.", "Forget artificial intelligence \u2014 in the brave new world of big data, it\u2019s artificial idiocy we should be looking out for. \u2014 Tom Chatfield", "After dealing with descriptive (past) data, we have the ability now to use machine learning to predict future values as well. Instead of an if-else statement, we let the machines discover these rules in the dataset themselves by providing them the data.", "Machine Learning brings up many possibilities. However, it is still a new subject and only a very small percentage of data practitioners can do it well.Hence, it is especially important to equip yourself with the core knowledge of Machine Learning when you know it is involved in your role.", "I\u2019ve been questioned on Machine Learning multiple times, it usually starts with what kind of Machine Learning projects I\u2019ve conducted, if any at all.My answer is always yes, and I will be sure to show them my work.That\u2019s when the conversation starts.", "For example, I showed them one of the classification projects I did here.", "They usually start asking questions based on that. They usually ask theoretical questions like:", "If you understand Machine Learning to its core, you should be able to answer these questions fluently. Here are a few topics to read up on:", "After that, they will decide if you are qualified for the role or not.Some companies hand out code tests for Machine Learning as well.I\u2019ve been given a few of these, let me show you an example.", "I will not go through the solution in detail as it is a full-blown Machine Learning process. Steps involved are:", "I\u2019ve also been asked in detail on how do I evaluate my model.Answering accuracy alone is not gonna cut it, you have to understand that they are multiple different metrics to evaluate your model like", "As a data scientist, you should have some general knowledge of products as well. After implementing your model/data product, you should know how to track the success of that product.", "Your communication skill plays a huge role here as you are usually required to communicate your findings to non-technical people. It\u2019s not always black and white. Usually, it\u2019s a back-and-forth discussion to find out your thought process on the product side of things.", "Here\u2019s an example of a product question.", "They will probably counter you with some hypothesis/argument. This is where your thought process and experience (if you have any) shines. Product knowledge takes experience. Usually, you won\u2019t be questioned about it if you are new to the industry.", "Thanks for making this far.It means that you really ARE passionate about landing a position in the data industry. I\u2019m glad.", "Please understand that I couldn\u2019t have included everything in this write-up. Instead, these were my personal experiences and the topics I was asked the MOST. There are topics I am aware of that weren\u2019t mentioned.", "The list goes on. Remember, data is evolving and there will be new technologies to learn every day. It\u2019s part of the job description. That\u2019s what makes it interesting.", "If you had mastered all the topics I mentioned in this write-up. You are fundamentally prepared to work in the data industry. Be confident, dress up and show up. Practice in front of a friend and you\u2019re good to go. Remember, it\u2019s not about them looking for the right fit, it\u2019s about you looking for the right company to work in as well.", "Finally, rejections are completely normal.Take it from me. In my team, we had a sudden need for more headcount at a certain point in time, but there weren\u2019t any candidates. If someone were to send in an application, they would get hired right away. On the other hand, I\u2019ve seen way more qualified candidates applied for my team, but we didn\u2019t have the capacity to take them in.", "Job applications are about being in the right places at the right times.Don\u2019t take rejections personally and stay consistent.", "We are not done yet with our data journey. With the lack of talent in the industry, educating yourself with proper knowledge in data and Machine Learning will give you an edge in landing that data role. Stay tuned, I am writing on how to create a data science portfolio for yourself in my next article, as well as more stories, guides, and experiences in the data industry. In the meantime, feel free to check out my other articles to temporarily fill your hunger for data.", "As usual, I end with a quote.", "Consumer data will be the biggest differentiator in the next two to three years.
