We talked about the dark side of AI, without really going into how we would manage and mitigate these risks. In this and subsequent articles, we will look at how to exploit the benefits of AI, while at the same time guarding against the risks.", "A quick plot of search trends shows that the words \u201cAI Ethics\u201d, \u201cEthical AI\u201d, \u201cBeneficial AI\u201d, \u201cTrustworthy AI\u201d, and \u201cResponsible AI\u201d started becoming extremely popular over the past five years. In my (first author\u2019s) early exploits of AI in the \u201980s and \u201890s talking about ethics was relegated to a small fringe of academics and definitely not a topic of conversation in the business world \u2014 at least with respect to AI ethics. It is not surprising that these terms are trending \u2014 given both the adoption of AI and the substantial risks of AI that we examined earlier in the series.", "But what do all these terms really mean? Who is coming up with all these terms? What does it really mean for a company \u2014 especially if you are not a technology company using and promoting AI.", "What\u2019s in a name. That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.", "This famous quote is by William Shakespeare in his play \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d. Does it really matter what we call a set of principles for AI \u2014 isn\u2019t \u201cResponsible AI\u201d as good a term as \u201cTrustworthy AI\u201d or \u201cEthical AI\u201d or \u201cBeneficial AI\u201d? Unfortunately, the answer is an emphatic NO. What we call some of these principles really matter.", "A more apt quote for us might be this one from Charles Babbage, the eighteenth century English mathematician and inventor who conceived the first digital computer.", "What is there in a name? It is merely an empty basket, until you put something into it.", "While ten years back these terms would have been \u201cempty baskets\u201d they do mean something very specific today. Let\u2019s look at each of these baskets and what they mean today.", "Trustworthy AI: The European Commission\u2019s High-Level Expert Group on AI (HLEG-AI) defines trustworthy AI \u201cas lawful (complies with all applicable laws and regulations), ethical (ensures adherence to ethical principles and values), and robust AI (does not cause unintentional harm)\u201d.", "Ethical AI: From EU\u2019s perspective, Ethical AI is a part of trustworthy AI. The ethical principles are derived from five fundamental rights \u2014 respect for human dignity, freedom of the individual, respect for democracy, justice and the rule of law, equality, non-discrimination and solidarity, and citizens\u2019 rights. Flowing from these five fundamental rights the HLEG-AI proposes four ethical principles:", "Principle of respect for human autonomy: This principle means that \u201cAI systems should not unjustifiably subordinate, coerce, deceive, manipulate, condition or herd humans. Instead, they should be designed to augment, complement and empower human cognitive, social and cultural skills.\u201d", "Principle of prevention of harm: This principle requires that \u201cAI systems should neither cause nor exacerbate harm or otherwise adversely affect human beings\u201d.", "Principle of fairness: This principle ensures that \u201cthe development, deployment and use of AI systems must be fair.\u201d", "Principle of explicability: This principle \u201cmeans that processes need to be transparent, the capabilities and purpose of AI systems openly communicated, and decisions \u2014 to the extent possible \u2014 explainable to those directly and indirectly affected.\u201d", "The HLEG-AI also recognizes that there are tensions between these principles and the trade-offs between them should be identified, evaluated, and then acted upon.", "Beneficial AI: The HLEG-AI does not define or delve into this concept. The notion of beneficial AI came from one of the Asilomar Principles. The Asilomar Conference in 2017 defined the research goal of AI as \u201cto create not undirected intelligence, but beneficial intelligence\u201d. The word \u201cbeneficial\u201d requires more scrutiny \u2014 beneficial to whom \u2014 all of humanity; some of them; to company shareholders funding the AI? When is it beneficial \u2014 now, ten years from now? Who decides it is beneficial? and so on. Stuart Russell introduces the concept of provably beneficial AI. According to him \u201cmachines are beneficial to the extent that their actions can be expected to achieve our objectives\u201d. The focus here is on aligning the values of the AI with human values and having the AI learn our values. The notion of \u2018provable\u2019 is more aspirational on what we should be aiming for \u2014 not what we have today.", "It is clear from the definitions that Ethical AI is a subset of Trustworthy AI. However, the relationship between Beneficial AI and Ethical AI is not clear. Can we have AI that is ethical as defined by the four principles, yet not be beneficial? Can we have AI that is beneficial, but not ethical based on the four principles?", "The answers to both these questions can be affirmative based on how we interpret the definitions and the trade-offs inherent in them. An ethical AI, respecting the four principles can still be created in a manner that doesn\u2019t achieve the objectives of humanity (e.g., an AI initiative to explore deep space may respect human autonomy, prevention of harm etc., and yet not be beneficial to the large majority of humanity \u2014 except for a few deep space enthusiasts!!). Similarly, one could have beneficial AI without necessarily respecting all of the fundamental rights and ethical principles (e.g., an AI that imposes severe restriction on human mobility during the pandemic may help save the lives of large numbers of people and yet curtail the freedom of the individuals!!).", "The HLEG-AI document not only lays out the four ethical principles of AI, but it also lays out seven key requirements for the realization of trustworthy AI. These requirements address different stakeholders involved in different stages of the AI model development lifecycle (see Model lifecycle: From ideas to value), including end-users, developers, companies, and society at large. The seven requirements from HLEG-AI are:", "(a) human agency and oversight; (b) technical robustness and safety; (c ) privacy and data governance; (d) transparency; (e) diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; (f) societal and environmental wellbeing; and (g) accountability.", "These requirements capture the key fundamental rights and the ethical principles. No system is by default trusted; in order to earn that trust, systems must demonstrably reflect these seven principles.", "In summary, we do have two distinct concepts of trustworthy AI (that includes ethical AI) and beneficial AI. Now let\u2019s examine responsible AI.", "Now let\u2019s examine the word \u201cresponsible AI\u201d. According to Lima and Cha, The word \u201cresponsible\u201d has three different meanings that are relevant:", "Responsibility as Blameworthiness: This notion proposes that agent i should be held responsible if it is appropriate to attribute blame to i for a specific action or omission. The necessary conditions for such blameworthiness are 1) moral agency, 2) causality, 3) knowledge, 4) freedom, and 5) wrongdoing.", "Responsibility as Accountability: An agent i is considered responsible-as-accountable for a specific action had i been assigned the role to bring about or to prevent it. The necessary conditions for such accountability are 1) the agent\u2019s capacity to act responsibly and 2) a causal connection between i and the action.", "Responsibility as Liability: The duty of liability to agent i implies that i should remedy or compensate certain parties for its action or omission. Here, the focus is on the attribution of liability regardless of moral agency, as legal systems often do through strict liability assignment.", "Trustworthy AI captures the notion of blameworthiness by its requirement of human agency and oversight. It proposes oversight through governance mechanisms such as human-in-the-loop, human-on-the-loop, and human-in-command approach. Accountability is an explicit requirement in trustworthy AI that includes auditability, minimization and reporting of negative impact, trade-offs, and redress. The notion of liability is captured in trustworthy AI, to the extent that there are existing laws and regulations to compensate parties for action or omission. However, it does not explicitly include such compensation as a requirement.", "Another definition of Responsible AI comes from Virgina Dignum:", "Responsible Artificial Intelligence is then an approach that aims to consider the ethical, moral, legal, cultural, and socio-economic consequences during the development and deployment of AI systems.", "Responsible AI is about human responsibility for the development of intelligent systems along fundamental human principles and values, to ensure human flourishing and well-being in a sustainable world.", "This view provides a more holistic view of AI (e.g., not just ethical or moral, but legal, cultural, and socio-economic) and also emphasizes the development and deployment of AI systems. By placing the emphasis on human systems, processes, and governance, as opposed to just the technology of AI, we can assess and determine the beneficial nature of the AI system.", "Now we are ready to present the ten principles of Responsible AI. These principles are derived from the definitions of trustworthy AI, ethical AI, beneficial AI, and responsible AI. Also, the focus for us here is on one of the specific stakeholders i.e., corporates who are building, deploying, buying, or using AI systems.", "Many of these principles have been evolving over the past couple of years as a number of organizations, not-for-profits and consortiums, professional associations, governments, and regulatory bodies have tried to synthesize and agree upon a common set of principles. Our earlier set of principles can be found in a number of publications including the AI Index, the practical guide to responsible AI, and our responsible AI toolkit and survey.", "In the subsequent articles we will focus on how we operationalize some of these principles and examine some leading practices of responsible AI.", "Authors: Anand S. Rao and Ilana Golbin", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Global AI lead for PwC; Researching, building, and advising clients on AI.
