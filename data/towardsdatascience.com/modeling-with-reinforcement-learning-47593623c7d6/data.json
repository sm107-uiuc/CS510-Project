Only a tiny fraction of all possible situations might have been experienced. If that. Even in a familiar situation, a tried-and-true action might, in a particular instance, produce an unexpected result. The environment might throw a curve-ball.", "Actions have immediate and delayed consequences, possibly conflicting. Some delayed consequences might be unknown. Some might not repeat themselves even in the same situation. Some might depend on actions that follow the initial one. The agent seeks to sort through all of this to discover and execute action strategies that suitably balance the two.", "In this post, we introduce the main concepts of reinforcement learning. Our perspective is a modeling one. We consider various use cases. We simulate the process of trying to model them as reinforcement learning problems. Interesting issues arise. Insights are gained.", "Here is how the story goes. We start with the framework and basic concepts. Next, we look at a number of examples to firm up our understanding. Following this, we cover more concepts. Finally, we see an example in more detail.", "Reinforcement learning involves an agent acting in an environment that delivers rewards from certain states. (Sometimes rewards are delivered on actions instead. We\u2019ll delve into this later.) At any given time, the agent is in a particular state. She has a choice of actions she can perform. She chooses one, typically influenced by the state she is currently in. Her long-term goal is to visit states that deliver rewards, accumulating as much reward as possible.", "However, in many use cases, various challenges arise. The first one is that the \u201cenvironment\u201d does not always cooperate. It reacts to her action by moving to another state. This move might not even be deterministic. In the same situation \u2014 i.e., in the same action from the same state \u2014 the environment might react differently. Worse, the reaction might be adversarial. It might deliberately try to prevent the agent from visiting rewarding states.", "A second challenge is that the state space might be huge. It might not even be feasible for the agent to visit a tiny fraction.", "A third challenge is that the states might not be fully observable. That is, the agent doesn\u2019t know everything about the current state. This might hamper her ability to choose the best action.", "A fourth possibility is that the same state may deliver different rewards on different visits. That is, the reward in any particular state is itself a random variable.", "We\u2019ll need more concepts and refinements. Before going further, let\u2019s pause to see some concrete examples.", "You are the agent. The board configurations are the states. Some represent winning states, some others losing ones. The actions are the moves you can make. You want to reach a winning state. That is, win.", "The states are fully observable. The current board configuration contains all the information you need to choose your next move. (How well you exploit this information is another matter.)", "The number of states is huge. Approximately", "The environment is adversarial. Your opponent is trying to make you lose.", "Poker. You are the agent. The states are only partially observable. You might act better if you could see the cards of the other players. But you can\u2019t.", "You are trying to lose weight. The state is your current weight. It is fully observable. Your possible actions are various exercises, various diets, medication, do nothing. Their effects are delayed. You will not lose weight immediately. It\u2019s not even certain you will. Some approaches might not work at all.", "You are a robot aspiring to become a professional golfer. Let\u2019s focus on just hitting a single shot well. Some key elements of the state are distance of ball to pin, and whether you are on the fairway or rough or green or a bunker. Some actions are which club to use. Actions involving your swing are obviously important as well. Imagine a robot swinging.", "You are a robot trying to learn how to drive a car. (I mean the conventional type, with steering wheel, brakes, accelerator pedal, \u2026) Some aspects of state are your current speed and direction as they relate to the road you are on. If you are going too fast, you may want to slow down. If you are zig-zagging on a highway, you might want to \u201cstraighten up\u201d. Some elements of your actions are which pedal to press (brake?, accelerator?), how much to press, the orientation of the steering wheel, and so on. Clearly actions can have both (drastic) immediate consequences and delayed ones as well (going too fast risks a ticket or accident, going too slow means you arrive later, plus lots of cars honk at you).", "You are trying to walk from shop A to shop B in a shopping mall. Conveniently, the mall\u2019s map is right next to shop A. If the mall is not crowded, you might opt for the shortest route. Even figuring this out can be involved, depending on how far B is from A, and how the mall\u2019s walkways are arranged. If the mall is crowded, you have one more complication to deal with. A shortest route may not be a good route if some segments on it are crowded or have people moving in the opposite direction of yours.", "Next up, the afore-mentioned additional concepts.", "A walk is a specific sequence of alternating state-action pairs, starting from and ending at particular states. This is depicted below.", "The agent starts from state s0 and performs action a0. This results in a move to state s1. In s1, the agent performs a1. And so on. Eventually the agent ends up in state sk. As noted earlier, while the agent has full control over which actions to do in any given state, she cannot in general fully control which state gets visited next. The environment reacts however it chooses to.", "The (cumulative) reward on a walk is the sum of the discounted rewards on the states that get visited.", "Here a between 0 and 1 is the discount factor, and ri the reward state si delivers. Why the discount factor? Time flies. There is a short-term. There is a long-term. To seek only instant gratification, set a to zero. To seek longer term rewards \u2014 even when short-term ones are not forthcoming \u2014 set a to a positive number.", "The agent seeks to experience walks that yield high cumulative rewards. How can she try to achieve this? Via the actions she chooses.", "Let\u2019s formalize this as the agent\u2019s policy. A policy specifies the action the agent takes from any given state. The policy may be deterministic, i.e. the agent always performs the same action on every visit to a certain state. Or probabilistic. On different visits the agent reacts differently, albeit some reactions are favored over others.", "Generally when the agent knows what to do in a certain state and its ramifications, she will want to exploit her knowledge. To choose her next action. In an unfamiliar state, she\u2019s more inclined to explore. Try out different things and see what happens. This is the so-called exploration vs exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning.", "Value of State (Under A Policy)", "How good is a certain state? This generally depends on the policy the agent is following. A state that is good for a skilled agent may not be good for an unskilled one. The unskilled agent may simply not know how to exploit its inherent goodness.", "Let\u2019s formalize this. The value of a state, under a certain policy, is the reward the agent can expect from a walk that executes this policy. The word \u2018expect\u2019 reminds us that even under a deterministic policy the walk might not fully be in the agent\u2019s control.", "In chess, the value of a board configuration is the likelihood of the agent winning when starting from it. The policy is implicit. The agent wants to win.", "Next up, our final example. This one fleshed out more. Partly to reinforce the just-described concepts. While at it, to also bring out fresh subtleties.", "Say you commute from home to work (or school). Imagine your commute is \u201ccomplicated\u201d. Not hard to imagine. You drive city streets, highways, possibly dirt roads. You have lots of options. You just read up on how constant use of GPS turns your brain into a \u201ccouch potato\u201d. So you want to practice using your brain to route. Well, plus your limbic system \u2026", "What should be the states? Spacetime sounds reasonable. I.e., a certain location at a certain time. When you start might influence the route from A to B you prefer.", "What should be your actions? The route-segments you can choose from your current location at time T? By route-segment we mean a road emanating from your current state A and taking you to a certain specified location B. Similar to mapping apps breaking their suggested routes into route-segments (turn-by-turn directions).", "What are you trying to optimize? Find the fastest route? Or is it the shortest one, the most scenic one, the least ugly one, the one with the least pot-holes, the one with the least traffic lights, the one with the lightest truck traffic, the one with the best sea breeze, the one with the most trees, \u2026", "Hmm \u2026 Another reason to use your brain. No need to specify the objective in advance, or even explicitly. Your brain will just \u201csense\u201d which routes you like and which you don\u2019t. This works even when you have difficulty articulating exactly what you like, much less combining your preferences into a multi-criteria objective function.", "What should you choose as the rewards on your states? Hmm \u2026 The criteria listed in the previous paragraph pertain to routes not locations. And routes for you are actions. So it seems you want rewards on actions not on states. Actually, thinking a bit more, you might also have preferences on locations you\u2019d like to visit (or avoid) during the commute. So you want rewards both on actions and on states.", "Well, a reward on a route-segment can capture both a reward on the route-segment\u2019s drive plus a reward on the route-segment\u2019s destination. This is because the action explicitly specifies the destination. That is, we are assuming that the state transitions are deterministic. If we take the route-segment A->R->B from A at time T, we will end up at B sometime later.", "This reward mechanism is depicted below.", "Here destination.arrival-time is the time when you reach the destination. This time depends both on when you start the route-segment and also on what else happens along the way.", "If your primary interest is the fastest route, reward(route-segment.drive,T)is a random variable. The driving time in any particular instance depends on traffic conditions and other factors. The start time T captures some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of this dependency.", "You are at point A at time T. You want the fastest route to work from here. The value of your current state is the time you expect it will take to get to work from here. If there is no traffic, this is just the length of the shortest path, with length defined in time, not distance, units. Introducing traffic (and other factors) will inject some variability. This is why we model the state\u2019s value as expected time.", "Again, say you are optimizing for commute time. Assuming there is no traffic, your best policy is to take the shortest path from your current location to your destination. (As before, length is measured in time not distance.) Finding this policy involves solving a shortest path problem. If there is traffic or there are other factors injecting variability, your task is more complicated. All the more so if these factors depend on your start time. You may need to try out different starting states at different times and take different actions \u2014 i.e., next route-segments \u2014 from them. This will help you estimate travel times on various road-segments under various conditions. Of course, you still have to stitch a good multi-segment route from A to B starting at a particular time from all of these.", "The process described above could be seeded with prior knowledge. That is you might have reasonable estimates upfront on the travel times on the various route segments. This can guide you in your early explorations.", "We have introduced the topic of reinforcement learning and key concepts in it. Our perspective has been a modeling one. We\u2019ve looked at stationary environments, non-stationary environments, deterministic actions and reactions (by the environment), and deterministic and stochastic policies.", "We have seen examples in a number of settings: games (chess, poker), control (robot trying to play golf, drive), health (losing weight), and routing (navigating a shopping mall, commuting).", "We hope the reader has acquired a better sense for what reinforcement learning is all about and what types of problems it lends itself to.", "PhD, Computer Science, neural nets. 14+ years in industry: data science algos developer. 24+ patents issued. 50 academic pubs.
