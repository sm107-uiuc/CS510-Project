The first 3 companies obtained the very first virtual bank license issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on March 27, and WeLab joined the club on April 10. There is limited information about these companies, and this article tries to understand more about them by analysing their job openings.", "You may have heard of WeLab as it has been in the field of P2P financing since 2013, and ZhongAn\u2019s parent company listed in Hong Kong in 2017, but the remaining companies seem to be quite \u201cmysterious\u201d to the general public.", "Livi VB, co-owned by Bank of China (Hong Kong), JD Digits and Jardines, SC Digital Solutions, a joint venture between Standard Chartered, HKT, PCCW and Ctrip, and Zhong An Virtual Finance, a joint venture between ZhongAn Online and Sinolink will be the operators of the first three licences, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)", "According to their business plans, these newly licensed virtual banks intend to launch their services within 6 to 9 months after obtaining the license. With such a short committed deadline, the companies have been hiring even more aggressively since the confirming their bank status.", "During the last 2 weeks I have been collecting virtual banking job openings from these 4 companies. As of Apr 22, I have collected 73 job virtual banking openings from these 4 companies from various online sources. There are only 3 companies in the charts because I was unable to find role related to Livi VB. By analysing the job openings posted by these new virtual banks, we can see some interesting patterns about the team expansion focus of these companies.", "Standard Chartered, WeLab, and ZhongAn have similar number of openings, each hiring around 25 positions. To understand what area each company is focusing, I labeled these roles into their corresponding business function. For example, the role \u201cSenior FP&A Manager\u201d is classified as \u201c Finance\u201d business function, and \u201cBackend Developer\u201d is classified as \u201cEngineering\u201d etc.", "I found the following radar diagram quite interesting:", "When we try to put related business functions together in the radar diagram, it reveals the relative expansion focus of each company \u2014", "Other than high level insights like expansion focus, there are other interesting findings if we drill deeper into the job descriptions.", "A job description usually consist of at least 2 parts \u2014 (i) the responsibilities of the role, and(ii) the requirements of the role. Responsibilities is more about the role (the tasks), while requirements is more about the person (the needed skills). I separated these 2 parts from each other and apply keyterms extraction (top 5 keywords) on each of them.", "We use the SGRank algorithm provided by a package called textacy, which provides a lot of handy NLP toolkits on top of spacy. The top 5 keywords extracted by the SGRank algorithm is pretty good, even without any fine tuning.", "For example, for the Executive Assistant role in WeLab, the responsibilities keywords are [\u201cground transportation\u201d, \u201ctravel booking\u201d, \u201cbusiness meetings\u201d, \u201cmeeting schedules\u201d, \u201clevel executives\u201d], and the requirements keywords are [\u201ccommunication skills\u201d, \u201cms word\u201d, \u201cexcellent interpersonal\u201d, \u201chigh flexibility\u201d, \u201cgood english\u201d]. These make a pretty good summary of the role nature and the skills needed.", "spacy provides us with noun_chunks and word embeddings which are very useful when we are trying to cluster individual datapoints into groups. spacy built-in part-of-speech annotator does a pretty good job in extracting noun_chunks from a given text. These nouns are good representation of the role nature.", "If you get the .vector property of a noun chunk, it will return the word embeddings (vector representation) of the noun chunk. Word embeddings allow us to quantify relationship between words (how similar 2 words/phrases are). It even make arithmetics on words possible!", "In our case, I take an average of the noun_chunks word embeddings of the Requirements column for each role, and applied a method called t-SNE to reduce the 300-dimension vectors into (x, y) coordinates. The results are visualised in an interactive plot created by bokeh.", "If we hover on the adjacent points, we can see some structure among these points. The lower part of the plots are mostly engineering roles, and fullstack developer is between frontend developer and backend developer. On the left, admin roles like Administrative Assistant, Executive Assistant, Receptionist etc are close to each other, and similar structure exists in other parts of the plot. This technique could be useful when HR managers/Recruiters are trying to analyse the job openings by competitors in the market.", "There is a lot information we can tell from the job openings of a company, especially when the company is actively hiring. This may explain why \u201csecretive\u201d industries like hedge fund tend to hire via agents.", "At the same time, the job openings could serve as a signal to the candidates/investors/general public about the \u201cstage\u201d or \u201ctaste\u201d of your company \u2014 what kind of roles you are hiring the most may tell story about the \u201cstage\u201d; and the techstack/skills listed in the job description tells a lot about the \u201ctaste\u201d of your company.", "The virtual banking scene will only be going forward, given the advantages enjoyed by this sub-sector. In 2018, Standard Chartered spent 790M HKD[1] on rent/building related matters, which contributes 6.78% to the 11,647M total operating expenses. And the 7,074M staff cost could be utilised more efficiently when banks can go branchless. The retail banking industry could be very different in a few years from now.", "Your home for data science.
