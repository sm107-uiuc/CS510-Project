Most of the time, you will be given a 30\u201345 min interview with a single data scientist or a hiring manager in which you\u2019ll answer a multifaceted business problem that\u2019s likely related to the organization\u2019s daily work.", "When I first started to prepare for the case study interview, I didn\u2019t know there are different types of case studies. The fastest way to be an expert in the case study is to know all the frameworks to solve different kinds of case studies. A case study interview can help the interviewers evaluate if a candidate would be a good fit for the position. Sometimes, they might even ask you a question that they actually encountered. Understanding what the interviewers are looking for can help you better prepare for your answer.", "\ud83d\udccc Logical and actionable thinking process", "\u25b6\ufe0f The interviewers care about your thought process and how you get the solution. If you are able to get the answer without any framework, the interviews might think this might just be your lucky day, and you wouldn\u2019t be able to solve a problem next time.", "\u25b6\ufe0f Sometimes, if you are heading in the wrong direction, the interviewers might throw you some questions to help you get back on track. If this happens during your interview, you were likely missing something they felt was important.", "\u25b6\ufe0f It\u2019s normal to be nervous during a job interview. However, as an analyst, if you don\u2019t believe in yourself, how can others believe in you?", "\u25b6\ufe0f As an analyst, the ability to analyze data and interpret your results is very important. Depending on your company, some analysts do need to present their analysis to the stakeholders.", "They want to know if you can take a systematic approach to problem-solving, and that you can describe it clearly. For example, they might ask you: \u201cThis month the active user accounts have increased by xx%, can you tell us what\u2019s going on?\u201d", "To answer this type of question, you don\u2019t have to have an answer ready right away. What matters the most is your thought process. Don\u2019t tell them any of your guess or assumption immediately. Answer it with a framework. Ask them questions to show that you understand the business.", "They want to know if your answers cover all aspects of the problem. For example, they might give you a situation and ask you questions like \u201cHow does it look,\u201d \u201cWhat is the current problem,\u201d \u201cHow can we improve,\u201d etc.", "There are many ways to answer these types of questions. The key to getting the perfect answer is to be concise and provide a recommendation at the end. Let\u2019s say the Vice-president (VP) of Marketing asks you \u201cHow does it look?\u201d in 2 mins, you can answer it by stating what the current goal is, where we are at, how far away we are to the company\u2019s goal, what we are planning to do next to reach the goal (suggestions), and how long it would take for us to get there.", "They want to see if your answer is practical and could realistically be implemented. Be more precise; use numbers when possible.", "I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of analysts often forget to use numbers to support or back up their points. If you want to let the manager know it\u2019s not possible to reach specific goals based on your calculation, you should use the numbers from your analysis to prove why it. Using numbers can help your suggestions be more convincing and reliable.", "Sometimes, they might ask you to answer a vague question such as \u201cHow does it look,\u201d to different people (your manager, the CEO, etc.). This is similar to when a recruiter asks, \u201cTell me about yourself,\u201d you don\u2019t want to get down to the nitty-gritty of the projects you\u2019ve worked on because your recruiter may be losing interest. On the other hand, the hiring manager might expect you to talk more about your past projects.", "This also applies to a case study interview. Knowing who your audience is is significant. If you are talking to the Vice-president (VP) of Sales, he or she might care more about the number of customers. On the contrary, if you are talking to VP of Marketing, he or she might not care about the number of prospects as much as the VP of Sales, and instead, they might care about how to increase response rates and conversion rates.", "This gives you a general idea on how to get to the perfect solution. However, for each type of case study question, we could have a different framework.", "There are several types of case studies. Here are the main types of case study interview questions:", "One of the reasons why interviewers like to ask case study questions is because consultants will often need to help the clients solve a vague problem without knowing where to get started. The clients state a profit/loss problem they are facing, and they expect you to help them figure out why this happened. A typical scenario is that a company has been relatively profitable over the last few years, but suddenly their profit recently dropped. What should they do?", "You can break this problem down into two parts \u2014 revenue and cost. We know that profit equals revenue minus costs. If the profit decreased and costs remain the same, then the revenue is the issue. We will need to think about how to increase revenue. If it\u2019s the other way around, then we will need to come up with a solution to reduce costs, such as cutting production and labor cost.", "Expanding into a new market can be an effective way to grow a business. Therefore, some clients might ask the consultant whether it\u2019s a good idea to enter a new market.", "Before answering yes or no, you should ask some clarifying questions to know more about the client\u2019s company.", "Here are some clarifying questions you could ask:", "I wish there were an ultimate way to increase sales for all companies. Unfortunately, depending on the industries and the market size, the ways to grow the company and increase sales would be different.", "Here are some ways a company could try to grow its business:", "\u26f3\ufe0f Investigate the company and the industry: we need to know if the industry is growing. If so, how much money can the company invest in expanding the company? How is the company growing relative to the industry/their competitors? Are our prices in line with our competitors? Who is our target market?", "\u26f3\ufe0f Choose the most suitable growth strategy: once we understand more about the company and its industry, we can recommend the most suitable growth strategy accordingly. For example, if the client wants to acquire a company in a completely different industry, it might not be worth it since the target audience would be completely different.", "As an analyst, the ability to make reasonable estimates is essential. Your interviewer might ask something like: How many square feet of pizza are eaten in the United States each month?", "This is a classic guesstimate question. The trick to answering this type of question is to break the question into different parts, round-up or round-down any number for easy calculation and explain why you\u2019re estimating what you\u2019re estimating. I decided to break the questions into 4 parts.", "Let\u2019s assume around 2/3 of the people in the U.S are pizza eaters. There are around 320 million people in the U.S. However, instead of multiplying 2/3 to 320, we can use 300 to make calculations easier. Now we know that 200 million people in the U.S are pizza eaters.", "2. How much pizza does the average American eat in a month?", "We can estimate that, on average, an American eats pizza once a month. Assuming people usually eat 3\u20134 slices of pizza for each meal, we can estimate the average pizza consumption per person is 4 slices. Now we need to translate pizza slices into square feet.", "3. Pizza Slices into Square Feet", "If a pizza slice is 4 inches at the base and 5 inches long, the area is 10 square inches (1/2*base*height=4*5/2). Since, on average, a person eats 4 slices of pizza per month, the pizza area for a pizza eater per month is 40 square inches. Multiply that by 200 million people (U.S. pizza eater population), and now we get 8 billion (200 million * 40) square inches. Lastly, after converting square inches into square feet (divide by 144 \u2192 round down to 100), now we get around 80 million square feet of pizza per month.", "Knowing some handy information beforehand can help us better estimate the market size. Here are some handy information listed in the book Cracking the PM Interview:", "Here is a list of resources I use to prepare my case study interview.", "\ud83d\udcdaCracking the PM Interview: How to Land a Product Manager Job in Technology", "\ud83d\udcdaCase in Point 10: Complete Case Interview Preparation", "\ud83d\udcdaInterview Math: Over 60 Problems and Solutions for Quant Case Interview Questions", "Your home for data science.
