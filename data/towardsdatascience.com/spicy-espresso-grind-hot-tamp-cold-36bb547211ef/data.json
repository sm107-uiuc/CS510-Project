They have found some effect on taste and extraction, but not a definitively better taste. Some have tried freezing beans as well, but there is not an understanding of the mechanisms involved. Previous experiments have fallen short because they failed to fully capture one key variable: temperature.", "Previous experiments did not record post grind temperature; their main concern was the bean temperature pre-grind. I started recording pre-grind, post-grind, and pre-shot coffee temperature. I found pre-heating the beans before grind improves the shot greatly if you cool the grounds to room temperature afterwards, a process I call spicy grinding. It\u2019s spicy because it\u2019s hot but doesn\u2019t stay hot like spicy food on your tongue. We can make it even more fun by cooling the grinds in the refrigerator.", "In this work, I will lay out previous work and other findings that help inform this technique. I believe it is simple enough that anyone could try this with ease, and I hope they would find a similar result.", "With respect to grounds temperature, there is an effort in commercial machines to keep the grinder cool because it is known that a hot grinder will have an effect on the beans. The hotter the grinder, the warmer the grinds are when they come out. This change would cause a barista to have to adjust their shots throughout the day to accommodate temperature variations.", "With respect to extraction, work has been done to show that coffee extraction is higher for cooler grounds than hotter grounds, and the flow is faster for cooler grounds than hotter grounds. Usually, the barista compensates by adjusting the shot timing, volume, or grind to achieve consistency.", "By accident in 2007, one home barista left beans on top of his warm coffee machine, and discovered the impact to having pre-heated beans before the grind. He found the espresso tastes smoother than when not pre-heating the beans.", "In 2019, James Hoffman tried microwaving beans after observing a sous-vide used in the 2015 championship to pre-heat beans with the thought that the process increased extraction.", "In 2020, Sprometheus on YouTube made multiple TDS and extraction measurements on coffee that was frozen or heated before grind. However, he did not record temperature of the grounds before taking the shot, and he thus confused the two variables of pre-grind temperature and pre-shot temperature. He did not use a bottomless portafilter, so it is unknown if the different temperatures caused a difference in flow and channeling. His experiments were consistent but failed to find the massive jump in taste.", "In 2018, Compound Coffee studied how grinder temperature affects extraction, and while their results could not be tested for statistical significance (sample size < 30), their results were interesting. I\u2019m not saying smaller sizes are bad, but I don\u2019t think they should be used for null hypothesis testing. The authors didn\u2019t graph their data, but for your convenience, I have below: on the left are samples unsorted, and on the right, the best extraction from each was compared. Considering each sample is uncorrelated with each other, the best way to compare is best vs best, second best vs second best.", "Even lacking a large enough sample size, the results point to higher extraction without a heated element on the grinder. However, there is more to this story; Compound Coffee also collected the temperature of the grounds, so plotting extraction vs ground temperature gives a different view. A lower temperature seems to give a better extraction, but they didn\u2019t cool the grounds down before brewing, so it is unknown which variable causes more extraction.", "Additionally, Compound Coffee looked at the effects of freezing beans on extraction. They froze the beans, then ground them, and brewed espresso a few ways. Again, it is a small sample, but it\u2019s interesting if we graph and sort them.", "Graphing all samples on one graph after sorting shows that freezing has a slight benefit to extraction, but it is unclear if it is really statistically significant or just a blip.", "I used two metrics for evaluating the differences between filters: Final Score and Coffee Extraction.", "Final score is the average of a scorecard of 7 metrics (Sharp, Rich, Syrup, Sweet, Sour, Bitter, and Aftertaste). These scores were subjective, of course, but they were calibrated to my tastes and helped me improve my shots. There is some variation in the scores. My aim was to be consistent for each metric, but some times the granularity was difficult.", "Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) is measured using a refractometer, and this number combined with the output weight of the shot and the input weight of the coffee is used to determine the percentage of coffee extracted into the cup.", "I discovered the cooling the grinds trick after switching to a new roast. I ground 90g of coffee and immediately pulled a shot, and it wasn\u2019t that great. The extraction had quite a bit of channeling and sprays. For some reason, I had taken the temperature of the grounds because I had been reading about the temperature of grounds. The next shot I had was spectacularly better, but the only difference was 2.3C. The first shot was at 26C and the second was at 23.7C, and thus I started recording the pre-ground temperature and the pre-shot temperature.", "I was curious if grounds temperature had an impact on taste. Looking over all my data from the past year, I didn\u2019t have temperature, but I did have a record of the time of day. So I held constant machine, roast, and staccato (or regular) espresso, and I compared the best shots of the morning against the afternoon. There are other variables involved, but this provides an interesting window into the theory that in the afternoon, the grounds are warmer than in the morning therefore the shot will not extract as well. In most of the shots over the past year, my grinding and brewing had some time between them for the grinds to cool.", "At least according to my data, my afternoon shots were better. I suspect it is due temperature differences, but the variable was not tracked, so it is unknown.", "I have been planning to do this coffee bean heating experiment for some time, and with the Shelter-in-Place, I had the time and patience because I knew the testing would be long. My question with a new test is always whether such a technique will improve the shot and will it improve my best shot, the staccato espresso shot.", "Spicy Grinding: microwave to around 60C, grind immediately, and let rest until room temperature. I did this without planning. I usually grind then brew some time later because usually, I sift my coffee to make a staccato shot. All my coffee grounds are stored in airtight containers, and I haven\u2019t found a degradation of quality by grinding this way even though that\u2019s contrary to common coffee thought. I don\u2019t have a large enough dataset to know what temperature is best for pre-heating the beans.", "I call it spicy grinding because like spicy food, it\u2019s hot at the beginning and slowly cools down on the counter. The intention is not to use grinds hot off the grinder.", "With respect to heating beans, previous work didn\u2019t separate temperature, so I have. I heated the beans to between 60C and 90C using a microwave. Then I ground them using a Rok grinder, and I let the beans cool to room temperature in a sealed jar. I used a Kim Express to pull the shots.", "Additionally, I measured the temperature of the shot after pull, and I drank the shot four minutes after the shot was pulled. I stir the shot before drinking to make sure nothing has settled. I found waiting a few minutes for the shot to cool improved taste, and after these experiments are done, I will let shots cool to the same temperature instead of a set time.", "For shot preparation, I did a staccato tamped espresso shot with a paper filter in the middle. I did some shots as staccato espresso shots with a paper filter (PFF) between the fine and coarse layers. I know these shots are more complex than a normal espresso shot, but they are both better than normal shots. The taste gap between the staccato tamped espresso shot and the staccato espresso shot was reduced by this temperature treatment.", "One last note on preparation, I did not put the portafilter into the machine until right before I pulled the shot so that the temperature of the machine would minimally raise the temperature of the coffee grounds before extraction.", "My current data set is across three roasts, and I have seen big improvements in taste. However, I don\u2019t have the number of samples needed to show statistical significance because I have fewer than 30. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a dependence on output to input ratio.", "In terms of extraction, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a connection between higher extraction and spicy grinding. Both distributions are inter-mixed. The extraction is already very high for the output to input ratio. There are a second set of extraction numbers for higher ratios, and that\u2019s because I pull off the first 1:1 shot, then I weight and measure the TDS for the second bit to come out. I then calculate the 3:1 ratio shot as many people pull longer shots.", "Since I was recording temperature, I looked at shot temperature at the time of consumption, and if this variable had an effect on how I experienced taste. Temperature did not correlate to taste at least for this small sample. Even when broken down by roast, there didn\u2019t seem to be a clear connection between taste and beverage temperature.", "I regularly sift coffee to make staccato espresso shots, and by sifting, I can get a small sampling of the full distribution of particle sizes. There was a shift in the mid-range with more grounds remaining in the coarse range. Usually, I sift 45 to 60 grams at a time at a rate of 3g/minute (weight divided by total time to sift).", "Does pre-heating the beans before grind only shift the particle distribution or does it do something more? What if we take the sifted grounds from the heated beans and blend them to make the same distribution as the original unheated coffee beans? If the shot tastes similar to the unheated beans shot, this test would indicate that heating the beans only modifies the particle distribution and nothing else.", "I found the taste stays the same regardless of the particle distribution which means the heating does something that isn\u2019t simply a different grounds distribution. This is not a conclusive test, but the results were not what I expected. I wonder if just sifting and reforming a shot with the same grinds would give a better shot regardless. The sifting and the heating are the two variables, and I don\u2019t have a clear picture which one causes the improved taste in the small samples below.", "I froze some beans down to -17C, and I ground them straight out of the freezer. The post-grind temperature was 26C (room temperature at the time was 23C), so the grinder warmed them up during the grind. I found the taste wasn\u2019t better than the baseline, and it didn\u2019t extract higher. However, it was a curious finding that if I cooled the grounds down in the refrigerator before the shot, the taste improved.", "So, why not use hot beans to grind and cold grounds to brew? I started with regular temperature beans at grind, and I found cooling the grounds to improve the taste. Here are the steps I followed:", "I noticed a taste improvement. There was not much of a change for extraction. Extraction seems to be maxing out, but something different is being extracted. Maybe the bad bits of the coffee are not getting extracted and more good bits are, I don\u2019t know. A breakdown of what\u2019s in the cup by compound would help answer that question, but I don\u2019t have a gas chromography machine or a spectrometer.", "My sample size is not large enough for my data desires, but I feel I\u2019m pushing the boundary of what\u2019s possible. Looking at past work, they were all simple enough experiments to do, but slight adjustments, like tracking grounds temperature, seem to be the key adjustment to discovering amazing espresso.", "What I love about spicy grinding is that anyone with a microwave and a refrigerator can try it out with relative ease. So I hope to hear from anyone who tries some spicy grinding.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
