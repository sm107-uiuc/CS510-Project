Hello? Hello?Is there any job out there?Just nod if you can hire me.Is there anyone at the HR?", "Come on now\u2026I hear you\u2019re feeling down.Well I can ease your pain.Get you on your feet again.Relax.", "Adapted from Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd", "Last year I did an analysis to understand What Makes a Data Scientist Valuable? The idea was basically to identify what makes someone earn more than USD 100k per year when working in data related jobs. One year after I have moved from Brazil to United Kingdom, from Data Science to Data Engineering, and from earning around USD 14k per year to more than halfway to the USD 100k/year.", "Now I thought it would be nice to compare data professionals skills to job listings around the world. To achieve that I have scraped Glassdoor listings looking for some data related job titles and compared the results with a survey conducted by Kaggle. Hope you find it informative and useful to plan your career!", "First let\u2019s create a metric to enable us compare those two different datasets and also different countries. The following radar charts express the number of Kagglers (this is how I will be referring to Kaggle users) and job listings proportionally to the total of each country. See the example below for better understanding.", "Data Scientists = 30 answers (or job listings if Glassdoor)Developers = 90 answersTotal = 120 answers", "We will be plotting:Data Scientists = 25%Developers = 75%", "Most countries follows the same proportion of Kagglers as United States, with proportionally more data scientists than other professions. And it does make sense because Kaggle is focused on Data Science. But we do have some outliers. Starting with China, where software engineers and Data Engineers are massively present in Kaggle. Are they trying to learn data science and change their careers? Or is it just a knowledge they want to add up to their current roles?", "Looking at Glassdoor jobs listings we see that China has much more jobs in Software Engineering than in Data Science.", "Warning! If you live and China, are a software engineer and are thinking about migrating to Data Science, then reconsider that. You\u2019ll likely have a much harder time finding a job in this new career.", "USA wants data analysts! If you live in the United States and want to be a Data Scientist, then consider getting a job as data analyst. It will probably be much easier as there is proportionally more jobs in that area than in DS.", "Looking at salaries reported by Kagglers we see that China is paying better for Statisticians and Research Scientists when compared to other positions. However, unfortunately, there aren\u2019t many jobs available in this area as the previous chart shows. In USA the highest salaries are in Data Science, followed by Data Engineering and Software Engineering. And of course\u2026 USA pays more than any other country for almost all positions.", "We see that Brazil and India have very similar proportions of Kagglers across all job titles. However Brazil has a higher proportion of Statistician and Research Scientists, it might be an indication that in Brazil there are more people doing DS in the academia than in India.", "Looking at jobs listings, we find out that Brazil has a similar shape to China: huge demand for Software Engineers.", "Data Scientists from Brazil that are struggling to find a job! Consider learning software engineering and joining a company as junior developer. Kagglers from India! There is huge opportunities to start your career as Business Analyst.", "Look at that! Salaries in Brazil are looking great for Data Engineering! Not so easy to get a DE job though (remember that Software Engineers are in much higher demand). In India, you\u2019ll better paid as Data Scientist. If you want to earn even more, then consider moving to another country.", "The Netherlands have more professionals interested in Kaggle, consequently in Data Science. For other countries we see a lack of Data Engineers and Business Analysts. Are they happy in their current positions?", "In Europe the jobs listings are almost equalised (almost same proportion for all titles) which means it won\u2019t make much difference, in terms of job offerings, if you wanna be a Data Scientist or a Business Analyst. But in terms of competition, there will be probably more candidates per listing for data science if we extrapolate the Kaggle survey to the real world.", "Software Engineers from Europe! Might be easier for you to find a job in The Netherlands!", "Finally when we compare salaries in Europe we find out that they are at almost the same range (a little bit higher for UK, maybe because of stronger currency compared to Euro). And now we can tell that Business Analysts are indeed quite happy in Europe, they are earning on average even more than technical folks.", "Software Engineers, Data Engineers and Data Scientists from UK and Germany! Stop coding now and become Business Analysts!", "I\u2019m joking. Don\u2019t do that. Or do.", "In the chart above you can see where are the opportunities depending on where you live. More jobs listings proportionally means more chances of getting a job in that area. More Kagglers in one job title, probably means more competition for you when looking for a job.", "We did expect a increase in salaries with the increase in experience, and there it is! However do you see that people who don\u2019t code at all earn a little bit more than those who are starting to code? This is probably due to managers sitting there on the first group. Once you get some momentum coding, your salary will consistently increase.", "Can we test this hypothesis that managers (without coding experience) are driving increase in the salaries? Well\u2026 kind of\u2026 We expect managers to earn more and also to be\u2026 older, right? Let\u2019s see if that is true.", "It is reasonable to infer that those who have no coding experience are earning more than those with little experience because they are in managerial positions. Except for Data Engineering, where we have younger people, without coding experience, earning more than those who are starting to code.", "The average salary usually increases with the company size. Data Scientists and Statisticians/Research Scientists see the biggest difference in their payslips when moving from a startup to a big corp. Business Analysts can\u2019t expect to much increase in salary just by moving to a bigger company.", "Salary isn\u2019t everything. Consider the pros and cons before going after jobs in large corporations.", "Python has been consolidated as the main language used by people with all job titles, about 3/4 of all respondents use it on a regular basis. R Language is much less popular (and almost no Software Engineers use with it).", "If you want to find a job in Data Science, then Python is the language of choice. More than 75% of all Data Science positions on Glassdoor mention Python in their job descriptions.", "Python is the prefered language for Data Science by the market!", "Statisticians and Research Scientists use less SQL than other professions. In fact only 1/4 of then use SQL! This is a sign that academia is much more used to flat files than to databases. Unfortunately the real world is not served in .csv files.", "Hey you that are doing a Masters or PhD and want to find a job! Look at those two charts above! Learn SQL!", "If you want to start working with data, then knowing SQL will help you get jobs as Business and Data Analyst. Now if you want to go down the Data Engineering path, SQL and Python are musts. Software engineers will find jobs more easily by knowing Java.", "To get a job in the data world, the recommended language to learn is SQL!", "We see that Kagglers are well prepared when it comes to Python usage! Although many respondents use Bash and R, job descriptions don\u2019t mention those languages frequently. SQL is not frequently required for Business Analysts, but knowing it (as Kagglers do) will put you one step ahead. In general Software Engineers and Data Engineers from Kaggle might find a hard time to find jobs, as Java is frequently required and many of them don\u2019t possess that skill.", "Learning Java will help you to move into Software Engineering or Data Engineering", "Learning (and using) multiple languages does not look like a competitive advantage in terms of salary. Pick up to three and be a real Pro when it comes to using them. Limit your languages especially if you don\u2019t have experience in working with data!", "Stop learning multiple languages! Python, SQL and one more language of your choice should be enough.", "We see a lot of Kagglers Data Scientists who are used to working with Cloud Platforms! This is good news for productionizing Machine Learning models, as it is much easier go live with a model if data scientists are not doing everything in their local environments.", "I can confirm that this is true! Since I migrated from Data Science to Data Engineering I started to work heavily with AWS products. Cloud computing platforms have a lot of managed services for the whole data pipeline. Knowing where to apply (and how to use) them is of prime importance for any data engineer.", "Be aware! To work in Data and Software Engineering you\u2019ll need a lot of knowledge about cloud computing platforms!", "Kagglers from academia! Again, working with relational databases should be done more frequently if you wish to be prepared for the marketplace.", "Although they don\u2019t appear frequently in the job descriptions, we see that listings for Data Engineers and Software Engineers often require knowledge of database engines such as PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL Server. Data Analysts with SQL Server Knowledge might benefit from it when looking for a job.", "I created a simple script to scrap Glassdoor listings. The web scraping was done on the 10th of December 2019, and I was able to retrieve more than 165k job listings. More details into that process are available on this GitHub Repository.", "The data was processed and is publicly available as a Kaggle Dataset! The data extraction was limited to the 30th page of each search term per country due to limitations of Glassdoor website. Please check it out and feel free to work on that data as well!", "I could do this study only because Kaggle has released the data from its third annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey. The survey was live for three weeks in October 2019 and got a total of 19,717 responses. The results include raw numbers about who is working with data, what\u2019s happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists to break into the field.", "The notebook with the code to reproduce this study and all charts is publicly available on Kabble.
