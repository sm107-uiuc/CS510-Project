and Movies.6- Next steps.", "If you do know what a Data Scientist is, you are rare to find, as since even the most experienced professionals still have difficulty defining the scope of the area. One possible delimitation is that the data scientist is the person responsible for producing predictive and / or explanatory models using machine learning and statistics. A more complete (or detailed) description can be found in the following link:", "To be a data scientist is to be always studying, updating and learning. Learning to apply Machine Learning will not make you one, change is not just a collection of techniques but a change of mindsight to face problems, it is thinking skeptically, without prejudice and it will not come quickly.This introductory guide is a way to save your time looking for the best material or order of learning, not replacing the hundreds of hours required for your training.", "The first waves of data scientists were primarily from development personnel, computer scientists, and engineers. They were the ones who created machine learning models, that optimized the process and minimizedthe cost function. They would analyze unstructured data, create specific programs for each problem, and, due to limitations of the computational processing, do manual map / reduces. Fortunately that time is gone, most of these operations have been greatly facilitated by high-performance programs and packages, and currently most Data Scientist is spending more time on modeling and less on engineering.", "The good news is, today, this learning curve is not that steep anymore. People from different backgrounds have to opportunity to join this field and one of the main reasons is the intense use of Python which is a high- level language acting as an API for much more performative low- level languages. In other words, you don\u2019t have to waste energy worrying about complicated syntax, because, writing in Python is like writing in English. You just need to study for In a few weeks to master the basics. Besides that, most of the data scientist\u2019s time-consuming stack is being automated or specialized in other areas such as the Machine Learning Engineer and the Data Engineer. Therefore, leaving the part of science for the scientist.", "Working with Big Data today has become as simple as writing SQL in environments such as DataBricks.", "Making algorithms in production highly scalable and available is becoming simpler with tools like SageMaker and its competitors.", "Even the creation of complex feature engineering is being automated with AutoML.", "In a nutshell, today a programming background is still important, but the importance is decreasing, and what I expect for the future is that programming will cease to be the core and it will become an exclusive activity for IT professionals. Therefore, I would like to give you one advice: focus your time and energy on analysis, modeling and science.", "You definitely need to learn how to program, and many languages \u200b\u200bmeet that demand, whether it\u2019s the most performative like Scala, or the more academic and statistical like R, or the general-purpose like Python, the latter is the most obvious decision for anyone starting out and doing. The reason is simple. Python has the largest community for data analysis, it will be much easier to find examples of analyzes in Kaggle (Machine Learning Competition Website Becoming a Portfolio for the Data Scientist), find code examples in the Stackoverflow (Q&A site with most beginner and often advanced questions as well) and job openings as it is the most popular language on the market.", "No way to run, you inevitably have to go through the basics of Machine Learning. When I first started studying Machine Learning in 2014, most of the courses focused on deriving the models, much like expected from a formal degree, and a lot of DS was trained that way,This gives you a tremendous ability to understand how different models work inside and even think about the best model for each problem. My recommendation is that you do not do this. The cost benefit of studying a number of different model classes is very small, you need to know (per hour) that a model is a BlackBox who can turn inputs (our variables such as the person\u2019s height, where they live and how much they earn) into an output (such as their likelihood of being a fraudster). There are many techniques that are common to almost every model and my suggestion is that you learn these techniques first and only then focus on understanding the their mathematical difference and implementation details.", "I have left the best, the most important and (unfortunately) the hardest in the end. It is this skill that will differentiate is a Data Scientist from a Machine Learning Engineer. There are not many shortcuts here. You should start with descriptive statistics, know how to do a good exploratory data analysis (EDA), or at least the basics of probability and inference, understand well the concepts of selection bias, Simpson Paradox, association of variables (in particular variance decomposition methods), the basics of statistical inference (and the famous, A / B testing as inference is known in the market), and a good idea for experiment design.", "This is a difficult question and may have different answers according to each person\u2019s background.
