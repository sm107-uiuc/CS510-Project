Everyone knows that you should learn to use SQL, but what about actually creating and managing a database?", "While you can follow courses that let you play with SQL on a browser with predefined tables (which is not a bad way to learn), it\u2019s also valuable to experience creating, managing, and interacting with a database of your own.", "The DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S) is a tool that makes relational databases accessible to anyone. It allows you to interact with an SQLite database, the entirety of which is contained in a single file. No servers or extensive configuration are needed to get it running. Both DB4S and SQLite are free!", "If you don\u2019t have any experience working with databases or SQL, this is a tool that will help you get up to speed with the fundamentals. The DB4S has a spreadsheet-like interface similar to Excel, which means that you can create and edit tables in your own database without using SQL. You also have the option to write custom SQL queries and view the results.", "Using the DB4S is a great way to get your hands dirty creating and working with relational databases. This piece will get you started with using the tool. The walkthrough is broken down into 7 parts:", "You can check out the installation details on the DB4S website here. You can download the latest versions for both Windows and macOS. It\u2019s also available for Linux based distributions.", "If you have Homebrew on macOS, you can also install the latest release with this line:", "Once you\u2019ve gotten DB4S installed on your machine, open the application and you\u2019re ready to begin!", "When you open DB4S, on the top left you see a button labeled \u201cNew Database\u201d. Click on it, type out a name for your database, and hit \u201cSave\u201d to your desired folder.", "That\u2019s it! You\u2019ve created your first SQL database. You should now see this:", "Now let\u2019s create our first table. To do so, we\u2019re going to import a CSV file with metadata for pieces featured on Medium\u2019s popular page. I got the data in an earlier Python project that you can check out here.", "To create a table with this file, on DB4S, you do:", "After that, select your desired CSV file and hit \u201cOpen\u201d.", "This will prompt another window for a couple of customization options. Change the name to something that\u2019s easy to remember. If the column headers are already in the first line of your CSV file, tick the box to make sure DB4S recognizes that. It will shift the first row to become the column names. Then hit \u201cOk\u201d.", "And boom! You\u2019ve created your first table.", "Exporting the database file to CSV is just as easy. All you have to do is right-click on the table and click \u201cExport as CSV file\u201d.", "Or to bulk export more than one table, do this:", "Now let\u2019s take a look at our table on DB4S. Right-click the table and select \u201cBrowse Table\u201d.", "You will now see the table in a classic spreadsheet-like format.", "If you want to add a new row, just click \u201cNew Record\u201d, and DB4S will create a new row (already with a primary key) for you to fill in with values, just like you would on Excel. In this case, we may want to do so every time a new piece is added to Medium\u2019s popular page. DB4S will even suggest a row value based on the first letters you type in if the value already exists in the database.", "To delete a row, you just need to select a row (click on a primary key on the leftmost column) and then click \u201cDelete Record\u201d.", "Once you\u2019re done with all your changes, click \u201cWrite Changes\u201d to save all your modifications and update the table in your database.", "Now on the table, you can see there\u2019s a column called \u201cfield1\u201d. This is because my CSV extract already included an index column. As DB4S automatically creates an index, I don\u2019t need this column anymore.", "Writing SQLite queries will allow you to make some table schema changes, but there is no one line \u201cDROP COLUMN\u201d feature available. The SQLite docs will give you a workaround for how to drop a column, which involves creating a new table with only the desired columns, copying the data from the old table to the new table, and deleting the old table.", "In DB4S, dropping a column is a lot simpler. To delete a column, in the Database Structure tab, right-click on your desired table and click \u201cModify Table\u201d.", "You will see a list of columns currently in your table. Select the column you would like to delete, then click \u201cRemove field\u201d and \u201cYes\u201d.", "If we go back to \u201cBrowse Table\u201d, we\u2019ll see that \u201cfield1\u201d is no longer in the table.", "Earlier, we added a record with the author \u201cDana G Smith\u201d. If we wanted to look for all articles published by Dana in the table, we just need to write the name in the \u201cFilter\u201d box under \u201cAuthor\u201d.", "You can also add filter by more than one column at a time. If we wanted to find all articles in 2019 that had an 11 minute read time, you would just need to fill in two of the filter columns. The table would refresh automatically to show you just the results you need.", "You can run all kinds of SQLite queries via the \u201cExecute SQL\u201d tab. For example, if we wanted to see all articles with a reading time of 5, just typing \u201c5\u201d in the filter column like we did earlier would show some unwanted results. In this case, we\u2019ll also get articles that have a reading time of \u201c15\u201d.", "To fix this, we\u2019ll write a basic SQL query that filters results to only have a reading time of 5.", "You can easily save this filtered set of results to a CSV. Click the button circled below and select \u201cExport to CSV\u201d.", "Then, you can configure the CSV output and choose the location to output your file.", "Your resulting file will now be filtered to only have articles with a reading time of \u201c5\u201d.", "Say we wanted to create a graph that looked at the total reading time of articles per day over-time. To do so without any SQL, we can use the DB4S plot function. Click on \u201cView\u201d and then select \u201cPlot\u201d.", "This will open up a new dialog for you to select which columns you want on the X and Y axes of your graph. Below, I selected \u201cDate Published\u201d and \u201cReadingTime(mins)\u201d. DB4S generated a bar graph to show me the reading time in minutes for every day.", "You can also generate graphs from your SQL queries. Say we wanted to count the number of articles published every day. We could write a simple \u201cGROUP BY\u201d query and graph the results.", "First, go back to the \u201cExecute SQL\u201d window demonstrated before. Then fill in your SQL query, run it, click \u201cPlot\u201d, and select the columns for your axis. You\u2019ll see a graph version of the table the SQL query generates.", "By now, we\u2019ve gone through the complete set-up and usage of your own relational database using DB4S! The simple visual interface of the tool allows you to easily get started with creating and managing an SQLite database. After you\u2019ve gotten comfortable with that, we also looked at how you can actually use the tool to run SQL queries and even visualize data with simple graphs.", "This piece was meant to help you get started. For further reading, I\u2019d highly recommend checking out the SQLite docs and the DB4S docs.", "If you want to look at how you can write to a database using Pandas, feel free to check out this piece:", "Your home for data science.
