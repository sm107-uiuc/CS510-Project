What you have basically done is memorizing the data\u201d", "Linear Algebra makes the core foundation for Machine Leaning algorithms ranging from simple linear regressions to Deep Neural Networks. The major reason for that is the set of data can be represented using a 2-D matrix where the column represents the features and the row represents the different sample data points. Having said that, the Matrix computations using all of the values in a matrix are sometimes redundant or rather computationally expensive. We need to represent the matrix in a form such that, the most important part of the matrix which is needed for further computations could be extracted easily. That\u2019s where the Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) comes into play.", "SVD is basically a matrix factorization technique, which decomposes any matrix into 3 generic and familiar matrices. It has some cool applications in Machine Learning and Image Processing. To understand the concept of Singular Value Decomposition the knowledge on eigenvalues and eigenvectors is essential. If you have a pretty good understanding on eigenvalues and eigenvectors, scroll down a bit to experience the Singular Value Decomposition.", "The multiplication of a Matrix and a Vector produces another vector which is defined as the transformation occurred to that vector with respect to the specific matrix in the given vector space. However, there exist some vectors for some given Matrix such that their direction does not change even after the transformation is applied (similar to the vectors colored in blue in the above GIF). Such vectors are called the eigenvectors of the given matrix while the scaled valued of the vector after the transformation is defined as eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector. This can be illustrated as follows:", "The concept of eigenvectors is applicable only for square matrices. There are number of ways in finding eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors which we\u2019re not going to cover in this article. I found the following video from 3blue1brown explaining about eigenvalues and eigenvectors in a more animated way. Feel free to have a look.", "The vector space spanned by an eigenvector is called an eigenspace. A square matrix is called a diagonalizable matrix if it can be written in the format:", "Matrix P is nothing but the matrix of the eigenvectors stacked together. There is another special matrix called a Symmetric Matrix where the matrix is equal to the transpose of itself and a matrix is called an Orthogonal Matrix if the transpose of the matrix is the inverse of that matrix.", "The following are some special properties of a Symmetric Matrix with respect to eigenvalues and eigenvectors.", "Since the eigenvectors of a Symmetric matrix are orthogonal to each other, matrix P in the diagonalized matrix A is an orthogonal matrix. So we say that any Symmetric Matrix is Orthogonally Diagonalizable:", "Now that we have covered the basics for Singular Value Decomposition. Diagonalizing a matrix is called in common as Eigendecomposition of a Matrix. However this eigendecomposition is limited to a certain set of matrices. The actual motivation for Singular Value Decomposition arises from the drawbacks of eigendecomposition:", "To overcome the challenges from eigendecomposition of a matrix, the need of more generic representation of any matrices arises and that\u2019s where Singular Value Decomposition comes into play. Let A be any rectangular matrix of shape (m x n) . We can show that both A\u1d40A and AA\u1d40 are symmetric square matrices of shapes (n x n) and (m x m) respectively.", "Moreover, it also can be shown that both A\u1d40A and AA\u1d40 share the same non-zero eigenvalues. If one has more eigenvalues than the other, all of the excess eigenvalues should be zero.", "According to the othogonally diagonalizable property of symmetric matrices, the matrices A\u1d40A and AA\u1d40 can be decomposed as following:", "Let\u2019s say v be an arbitrary eigenvector of A\u1d40A which will be of size (n x 1). The multiplication Av will produce a vector of size (m x 1) since A is a rectangular matrix of shape (m x n). For the time sake let\u2019s assume Av = \u03c3k where k is a vector of size (m x 1) and \u03c3 is a scaler value. If the rank of the matrix D is r, there are r non-zero eigenvalues for the matrices A\u1d40A and AA\u1d40.", "Since we know that V is an orthogonal matrix,", "Now let\u2019s do some simple math to see some exciting results about K.", "It is now obvious that K is nothing but U which is the matrix of eigenvectors of AA\u1d40. Now substituting K by U we can write A=U\u03a3V\u1d40. This form of generic representation of a matrix is called the Singular Value Decomposition. Here in this decomposition we call the vectors in U as the left singular vectors while the vectors in V as the right singular vectors.", "The main intuition behind Singular Value Decomposition is, that Matrix A transforms a set of orthogonal vectors (v) to another set of orthogonal vectors (u) with a scaling factor of \u03c3. So \u03c3 is called the Singular Value corresponding to the respective singular vectors u and v.", "Eckat-Young-Mirsky theorem for matrix methods describes about the Low-Rank-Approximation. In simpler terms, it informs most important part of the given data matrix. We can write our decomposed matrix A as:", "The equation above depicts a matrix addition. What Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem states is, A\u2096 which is addition of singular matrices upto k\u1d57\u02b0 largest singular value is the closest matrix of rank k for the matrix A. It can illustrated as follows:", "This result is proven to be true for many well-known norms of matrices like L2 norm, Frobenius norm etc. A covariance matrix S of a Matrix X is defined as:", "Now that we have gone through the theoretical aspects of Singular Value Decomposition. Let\u2019s dive into an application where SVD comes into play.", "Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique used in many Machine Learning applications including Feature Engineering and Feature Extraction. The goal of PCA is to find a set of orthonormal basis of vectors for a given data Matrix, such that the variance of the dataset projected onto the direction determined by the vectors is maximized. With a set of proofs, it has been determined that those vectors, (commonly called as Principal Components) are nothing but the eigenvectors of the Covariance Matrix ranked in the order of corresponding eigenvalue. We will not discuss about the detailed derivation of Principal Components in this article.", "For a matrix X, the k\u1d57\u02b0 Principal Component is the eigenvector of the covariance matrix of X corresponding to the k\u1d57\u02b0 largest eigenvalue.", "Though this can be processed with the conventional eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix, the drawback comes with the computational complexity. Since our data matrix will be huge one, containing thousands of data, it\u2019s really hard to compute the eigenvalues of the Covariance Matrix which may sometimes cause errors such as Round-off errors.", "However, mathematicians have found stable and precise ways of computing Singular Value Decomposition. One of the methods can be found here. In the SVD (A=U\u03a3V\u1d40), we know that V is the eigenvector of the Covariance Matrix while the eigenvalues of it (\u03bb) are hidden in Singular Values (\u03c3).", "Since n is constant over both the cases, the Principal Components of Data Matrix is the right singular vectors (V) of the given matrix in the order of the Singular Values.", "For a matrix X, the k\u1d57\u02b0 Principal Component is the right singular vector of the covariance matrix of X corresponding to the k\u1d57\u02b0 largest singular value.", "Thus we have came across a more generic way of representing any matrices, Singular Value Decomposition and its contribution in molding up Principal Component Analysis which is a sophisticated method of extracting important features of a Data Matrix in Machine Learning.
