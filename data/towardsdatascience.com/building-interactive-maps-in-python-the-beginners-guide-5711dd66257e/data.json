Data visualization plays an important role in representing data. Creating visualizations helps to present your analysis in an easier form of understanding. Especially when working with large datasets it is very easy to get lost, that\u2019s when we can see the power of data visualization. In this exercise, we will work with climate data from Kaggle. We will build two interactive climate maps. The first one will be showing the climate change of each country, and the second one will be showing the temperature change over time. Let\u2019s get started, we have a lot to do!", "Kaggle is the world\u2019s largest data science community with powerful tools and resources to help you achieve your data science goals.", "Plotly is Python graphing library that makes interactive, publication-quality graphs. Examples of how to make line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, polar charts, and bubble charts. It is also an open-source library.", "To learn more about Plotly: Plotly Graphing Library", "The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives. It is nicely packaged and allows for slicing into interesting subsets (for example by country). They publish the source data and the code for the transformations they applied.", "Dataset can be found at the following link: Climate Data", "The data folder includes the following datasets:", "We will be working with the \u201cGlobal Average Land Temperature by Country\u201d dataset, this data fits better for our goal because we are going to build interactive climate maps, and having a data filtered by country will make our life much easier.", "We will need three main libraries to get started. When we come to visualization I will ask you to import a couple more sub-libraries, which are also known as library components. For now, we are going to import the following libraries:", "If you don\u2019t have these libraries, don\u2019t worry. It is super easy to install them, as you can see below:", "Data Science is more about understanding the data, and data cleaning is a very important part of this process. What makes the data more valuable depends on how much we can get from it. Preparing the data well will make your data analysis results more accurate.", "Let\u2019s start with cleaning process. Firstly, let\u2019s start by dropping the \u201cAverageTemperatureUncertainty\u201d column, because we don\u2019t need it.", "Then, let\u2019s rename the column names to have a better look. As you can see above, we are using a method called rename. Isn\u2019t that cool how easy to rename a column name.", "Lastly for the data cleaning, let\u2019s drop the rows with the null values so that they don\u2019t effect our analysis. As we checked earlier, we have around 32000 rows with null values in AverageTemperature column. And in total we have around 577000 rows, so dropping them is not a big deal. But in some cases, there are a couple other methods to handle null values.", "Now, let\u2019s have a look at our dataframe. I will print the first 10 rows using the head method.", "This step is also known as data manipulation, where we filter the data so that we can focus on a specific analysis. Especially when working with big datasets, data preprocessing/ filtering is a must. For example, our historical climate data is showing temperatures for all 12 months between 1744 to 2013, so it\u2019s actually a very wide range. Using data filtering techniques, we will focus on a smaller range like between 2000 to 2002.", "We will use these operators to compare a specific value to values in the column. The result will be a series of booleans: True and Falses. True if the comparison is right, false if the comparison is not right.", "In this step, we are grouping the dataframe by Country name and the date columns. And also, sorting the values by date from latest to earliest time.", "As you can see above, the dataframe is looking great. Sorted by date and filtered by country name. We can find the average temperature in each month of each country by looking at this dataframe. Here comes the fun part, which is data visualization. Are you ready?", "Before we start, as mentioned earlier there are couple sub-libraries to import to enjoy data visualization. These sub-libraries are also known as Components.", "Perfect, now by running the following code you will see the magic happening.", "Both are the same map, in the first one you can see the change in average temperature. And in the second graph, I am just hovering over some countries, which is showing more detailed information about each of them.", "Thank you for reading this post, I hope you enjoyed and learn something new today. Feel free to contact me through my blog if you have any questions while implementing the code. I will be more than happy to help. You can find more posts I\u2019ve published related to Python and Machine Learning. Stay safe and happy coding!", "I am Behic Guven, and I love sharing stories on creativity, programming, motivation, and life.", "Follow my blog and Towards Data Science to stay inspired.", "Your home for data science.
