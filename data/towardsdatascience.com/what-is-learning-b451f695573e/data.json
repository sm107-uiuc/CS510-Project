As an Artificial Intelligence expert myself, I obviously love this. However, before we can define what Machine Learning is, we need to ask a more fundamental question: what is learning itself?", "Let\u2019s define learning in what might be the most fundamental way possible:", "Learning is a change in the intelligence of an agent.", "An agent can be a human, an other animal or even a plant, but also a machine, as long as it exhibits intelligence. Intelligence needs its own definition, which I borrow from Universal Intelligence: A Definition of Machine Intelligence:", "\u201cIntelligence measures an agent\u2019s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.\u201d", "Using this definition for intelligence, learning then becomes a change in an agent\u2019s ability to achieve its goals. This ability can change by acquiring knowledge: for example, knowing more about your environment can make you better at achieving your goals in that environment. However, acquiring new skills can also obviously make you better at achieving your goals. One can even change one\u2019s moral values, in which case one\u2019s actual goals can change: this obviously changes one\u2019s ability to achieve one\u2019s goals, as the goals themselves change.", "I imagine the reader might object to the definition of learning given in this article, as it doesn\u2019t include the word \u201cbetter\u201d. Mostly, learning is seen as becoming better at something: better at chess, for example. The given definition simply talks about a change in intelligence, so becoming worse at chess would also count as learning. This is not what we usually mean with \u201clearning\u201d! However, becoming better at one skill doesn\u2019t always mean becoming better at achieving one\u2019s goals. Therefore, to avoid confusion, I stick to \u201cchange\u201d in intelligence.", "Thanks for reading! You might also like:", "Your home for data science.
