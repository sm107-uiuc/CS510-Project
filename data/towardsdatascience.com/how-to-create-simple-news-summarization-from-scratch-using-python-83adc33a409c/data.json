You must be wondering, like \u201cHow to make a good model?\u201d, \u201cWhat should I learn?\u201d and \u201cWhere should I start?\u201d.", "Then you start searching for what methods are good for automatic summaries and find methods such as Bart, then you try the pre-trained model, and impressed about its result. Then you are interested in training the model for your native language. But there\u2019s a problem, you live in 3rd words country and no pre-trained models are available or you don\u2019t have any supercomputer to run or you don\u2019t even find a dataset for your language and you\u2019re too lazy to labelled it alone.", "So in this post, I\u2019ll give a simple solutions for you to make your simple news summarization. First, let\u2019s talk about approaches in news summarization.", "In general, the news summarization approach is divided into two, namely extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization means identifying important parts of the text and making it verbatim produce a subset of sentences from the original text; while abstractive summarization reproduces important material in new ways after the interpretation and examination of texts using advanced natural language techniques to produce new, shorter texts that convey the most critical information from the original.", "Since our initial goal is to make a simple summarizer, here we will use the Extractive summarization approach. Let\u2019s get started, if you want to see the full code of this article, please visit my github.", "First, import package that will be used", "Here we use the NumPy, nltk, and re libraries. NumPy is a library for numerical calculations, nltk is a library that is widely used for NLP, and re is a library for regular expressions.", "After that, we define the preprocessing functions that will be performed. It aims to concentrate words and eliminate characters that are not needed. Here there are 3 preprocessing functions, namely:", "Here is the code for the preprocessing process", "In addition, you can also add other functions such as stopwords removal, stemming, or lemmatization. However, because the usage can be different for each language, so the function will not be explained in this article, but an example is in the Github link that I have provided.", "Next, we also need a function to turn the whole story into a collection of sentences", "Next we will define a function to count the number of each word in the document. This process is carried out to give weight to words that aim to determine whether the word has an effect or not. Here is the code for the process", "Then, we will make a function to calculate the weight of each sentence. This process is carried out to determine which sentence is considered to best represent the whole story.", "Now, all the functions we will use are defined. Let\u2019s take a case example. For example, I will use an article from Politico entitled \u201cThe New York Times Surrendered to an Outrage Mob. Journalism Will Suffer For It\u201c.", "We will start by inserting news on the site into a variable by doing copy-paste manually. If you don\u2019t want to do copy-paste and are interested in web scraping, you can read my previous article titled Web Scraping News with 4 lines using Python.", "After that we will process the news by cutting it into sentence form, then for each sentence the preprocessing is done using the function that we have defined above.", "After that, we will count the number of each word in the document from the function we have defined.", "Then, from the results of word calculation we only need to calculate the weight of each sentence.", "After that we determine how many main sentences we want to output as a representation of the news. For example I will output 2 sentences, so here I fill n with 2. Then the system will take the top 2 sentences which have the highest weight. It depends on you to choose many sentences to appear.", "To display the results, use the following code", "So results will appear like this.", "Not bad, right? Although it may not be as good as if we use state-of-the-art methods, we can quite understand the essence of our brief news. And tips from me, by using this method, you can generate your own dataset, although it still has limitations because the results obtained are not always the way you want.", "If you like this post, I want to recommend an article that inspired me.", "Your home for data science.
