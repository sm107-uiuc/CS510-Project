A meta-heuristic is a general strategy that is used to guide and control actual heuristics. Tabu Search is often regarded as integrating memory structures into local search strategies. As local search has a lot of limitations, Tabu Search is designed to combat a lot of those issues.", "The basic idea of Tabu Search is to penalize moves that take the solution into previously visited search spaces (also known as tabu). Tabu Search, however, does deterministically accept non-improving solutions in order to prevent getting stuck in local minimums.", "Short Term memory is based off of recency of occurrence and is used to prevent the search algorithm from revisiting previously visited solutions and also can be used to return to good components in order to localize and intensify a search. This is accomplished by the Tabu List and is also known as intensification.", "Long Term memory is based off of frequency of occurrence and is used to diversity the search and explore unvisited areas of the search space by avoiding explored areas. This is accomplished by frequency memory and is also known as diversification.", "The Tabu List is the cornerstone of utilizing short-term memory. This list stores a fixed amount of recently made moves. In some implementations, complete solutions are used instead of the moves used but this is not ideal if complete solutions are very large due to space limitations. Some examples of these moves are:", "The Tabu Tenure is the number of iterations that a move stays in the Tabu List. The moves that are in the Tabu List are moves that cannot be made again as it was already recently visited. There are two ways to implement the Tabu Tenure (T):", "This is an optional part of Tabu Search. Moves or solutions that are part of the Aspiration Criteria cancel out the Tabu and the move can be made even if it\u2019s in the Tabu List. This can also be used to prevent stagnation in cases where all possible moves are prohibited by the Tabu List. Some examples of Aspiration Criteria are:", "This memory holds the total number of iterations that each solution was picked since the beginning of the search. Solutions that were visited more are less likely to to be picked again and would promote more diverse solutions. There are two main approaches for diversifying:", "Step 1: We first start with an initial solution s = S\u2080. This can be any solution that fits the criteria for an acceptable solution.", "Step 2: Generate a set of neighbouring solutions to the current solution s labeled N(s). From this set of solutions, the solutions that are in the Tabu List are removed with the exception of the solutions that fit the Aspiration Criteria. This new set of results is the new N(s).", "Step 3: Choose the best solution out of N(s) and label this new solution s\u2019. If the solution s\u2019 is better than the current best solution, update the current best solution. After, regardless if s\u2019 is better than s, we update s to be s\u2019.", "Step 4: Update the Tabu List T(s) by removing all moves that are expired past the Tabu Tenure and add the new move s\u2019 to the Tabu List. Additionally, update the set of solutions that fit the Aspiration Criteria A(s). If frequency memory is used, then also increment the frequency memory counter with the new solution.", "Step 5: If the Termination Criteria are met, then the search stops or else it will move onto the next iteration.
