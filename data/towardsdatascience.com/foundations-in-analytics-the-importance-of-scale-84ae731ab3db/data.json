I\u2019ll be covering some simple intros, but this article is primarily to provide you with an example to use when introducing the uninitiated. I\u2019m writing this as a bit of a primer for a semi-trivial project I proposed to some apprentices in the past and would like to share here in the near future. A much more detailed explanation of feature scaling can be found here.", "Much of machine learning involves minimizing for some value. KNN and K-means are among some of the earliest models you will be introduced to and are highly dependent on the scale of the values you pass to them. There are many others that have similar dependencies (PCA, Linear Discrimination Analysis, Hierarchical Clustering, and SVM, the list goes on). Without proper scaling, certain features can overpower the influence others can exert on your results.", "I will be providing code in R. There is another article that covers the common scaling functions used in Python and goes into more depth regarding use cases and outliers. We will only cover the two most basic ones. There is some contention regarding how each should be defined, so for the duration of this article we will define them as follows:", "The primary example we are going to consider can be found here. This is a very simple introduction to elbowing using a within-cluster sum-of-squares for determining an appropriate K value. The site does a great job of introducing this concept, but you\u2019ll see that scale was overlooked. Disclaimer: Perhaps this was intentional. If not, I really hope the site doesn\u2019t correct this. This is one of my favorite examples for apprentices and mentees getting into the field.", "I encourage you to check out the example above if you have not already. We are going to follow the code very closely (but abbreviated) to recreate the solution and then discuss the importance of considering scale for a problem like this.", "As mentioned in the article, you can download the data here. Unzip the file so we can read it in.", "Open up your R environment, I recommend RStudio. In case you don\u2019t have the libraries we\u2019ll be using, the following code will install and load the libraries as necessary.", "We will be using the function file.choose() to select our file (from the unzipped folder above). This will cause a window to pop-up and allow you to select the file for import.", "Now get the models and plot the charts for k = 3 and k = 5. At first glance, k3 looks relatively decent, but you will notice some odd points classified as cluster 1 in the 40\u201360 range of the y-axis (TestB). Looking at k5 makes the problem even more evident. It appears that the value of TestA is much more important than the value of TestB.", "To understand why that is, we need to realize that ggplot2 is actually working against us on this one. Our data is not scaled at this point, but our view actually is. ggplot will automatically scale the view to the variables you are looking at. Notice that our x-axis is 200 points long (100 to 300) and our y-axis is 80 points long (20 to 80).", "In order to see this data at the same scale the k-means algorithm is seeing, let's adjust our plot limits.", "It is now much more clear why we are seeing the current results using the raw scale of the data.", "For our purposes, we will define Normalization by the equation above. This will result in data that is scaled from 0 to 1 where 0 is the min and 1 is the max. Recall with summary(testDf$TestA) that this would convert the 120\u2013290 to 0\u20131.", "We can now apply normalization to our data and verify our range", "And check for an appropriate K value", "Using the above elbow chart, we\u2019ll stick with k3 and k5.", "Note that we are plotting the data using the original scale still, but coloring based on the results of the clustering. You could instead plot using the normalized data testDf_Norm to see the scale from 0\u20131.", "We can see that k3 no longer has such a heavy reliance on TestA scores.", "Looking below we can see the data in the raw points-based scale.", "Be cautious with just using just the min/max of your sample of data. Recall that this problem is using test scores. For this reason, we should consider the fact that a theoretical min/max could be used instead if it is appropriate. This version of normalization is a special case that anyone in your audience should be very familiar with: the percentage. I find this to be the most relatable version of scale for those that were still not quite understanding it\u2019s importance.", "In our case, we know that the theoretical minimum of test scores should be 0, but we, unfortunately, don\u2019t know the theoretical maximum. Since the highest score from test A was 290 and the highest from test B was 95, we will assume that I went back to my data source and consulted with whoever knows the theoretical maximum values and test A had a maximum of 300 points and test B had a maximum of 100. Never guess when using theoretical min/max. If you want to use these values, validate with your source.", "Applying the percentage to our data we have", "It is important to note how this is different from using the min/max of our sample. Compare the summaries of the two data frames and the histograms of their normalized values.", "Notice the difference in the choices of scale? This is primarily due to the distance from 0 being relatively different for the two sets of test scores. If using normalization, you\u2019ll have to apply your judgment to the problem to decide if percentage is appropriate for you.", "Running the elbow plot using plotWss(testDF_Perc) we can check k3 and k4.", "Let\u2019s also look at this one in the Normalized (Percentage-based) scale.", "If the two tests had equal bearing on your grade, this representation could potentially be interpreted as the following:", "Standardization (sometimes referred to as Z-Score Normalization) is the more versatile version of scale. Here we are setting the mean of a feature to zero and its standard deviation to 1.", "In R this could be written using the following x = (x-mean(x)) / sd(x) , but for convenience, the function scale(x) will do the same.", "After plotting plotWss(testDf_Std) we\u2019ll check out k3 and k5.", "We see that k3 performs as expected. k5 is actually similar to the unscaled data, but with a few minor differences in the edges of the clusters.", "I hope you found this example useful and perhaps it can be a resource for providing a simple explanation you can share. This was meant to be pretty basic, but if you have anything you would like to share, please leave a comment.", "Below is the code used to generate the animated gifs above.", "Note the ugly cluster rearrangement below. This is to deal with the colors (from the cluster number designation) not matching up between models. Your rearrangements will be different if you choose to do this.", "Your home for data science.
