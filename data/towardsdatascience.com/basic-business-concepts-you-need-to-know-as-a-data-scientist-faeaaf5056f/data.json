But I bet that you didn\u2019t think about business, which is completely reasonable. If data science was all about business, companies wouldn\u2019t be hiring those with a STEM background.", "That being said, having a basic understanding of business fundamentals is essential for all data scientists. By understanding business, you\u2019ll better understand the motive(s) behind each data science project and how each project benefits the overall company.", "With that said, let\u2019s talk about the main objective of a business.", "The primary goal of a business is to maximize profits for its owners", "Owners refer to the founders of the company, and if the company is public, the shareholders of the company as well. It\u2019s essential that you understand this point because every company's decision revolves around maximizing profits.", "Profits are equal to the differences between revenue and cost. Revenue is defined as income. Cost, also known as expenses, is defined as the money spent on company operations to generate revenue.", "Why is this important for you to know? Because every initiative in business (eg. a data science project) is undergone to either increase revenues or decrease costs to maximize profits. By nature, different departments of the business tend to fall into one of the two categories: revenue-maximizing and cost-minimizing.", "The two main departments that fall into this category are product and marketing:", "A product can be a good, service, or idea and is created to satisfy a want or a need. For example, a car is a good and is created to satisfy the need for transportation.", "However, in the case of business departments, product refers to all activities related to product R&D, development, and maintenance. Don\u2019t get this definition of \u201cproduct\u201d confused with the one above!", "Data science serves two purposes when it comes to product; to create new products and to enhance existing products. Autonomous cars are an example of how data science has helped create new products. More commonly however, data science is used to enhance existing offerings. A popular example of this is how Netflix developed a state of the art recommender system.", "Marketing is formally defined as all activities related to promoting the buying or selling of a product. Marketing includes things like advertising, pricing, and understanding one\u2019s target market. Marketing used to be more of an art than a science, but data science has revolutionized the way companies do marketing.", "Examples of how data science is used in marketing include the following:", "Data science activities that fall into this category can be described in one word; automation. The two main departments where data science plays a huge role is operations and customer service.", "Operations in business refer to the activities that a business engages in on a daily basis. Typically, the main goal in operations is to make tasks and processes as efficient as possible \u2014 this means maximizing time to complete things while minimizing errors. Humans are inefficient and costly, but automation can replace humans in repetitive and mundane tasks. A popular example of automation in operations is Amazon\u2019s warehouse robots.", "Customer service refers to the support that a company offers to its customers. As a company grows in size, it\u2019s fair to assume that there will be a proportionate increase in the number of customers that will need support. Like I said before, humans are inefficiently and costly, which is why data science has also revolutionized customer service. The most prevalent example is the development of chatbots. While chatbots can\u2019t completely replace humans (yet), they can answer simple questions and redirect customers to the right service representatives through NLP algorithms.", "Now that you know the primary goal of a business and how every initiative is conducted to increase revenue or decrease costs, we can talk about OKRs and KPIs.", "OKR is short for Objectives & Key Results and it is a framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes \u2014 you can think of them as goals. Typically, each department has its own OKRs that they set every quarter. For example, the marketing department might have an OKR to increase conversions from X to Y.", "KPI is short for Key Performance Indicators and they are essentially metrics that show how effectively a company is achieving its business objectives. Continuing with the marketing example, a KPI for the objective above can be an increase in website traffic or an increase in marketing ROI.", "These two terms are important to know as a data scientist because they\u2019re a part of the planning phase of the machine learning life cycle, which I\u2019ll talk about next.", "Before you start any machine learning project, there are a number of things that you need to plan. The main point of this step is so that the company can understand how a given project will add value to the company, whether it be through increasing revenue or decreasing costs.", "If you like my work and want to support me\u2026", "Your home for data science.
