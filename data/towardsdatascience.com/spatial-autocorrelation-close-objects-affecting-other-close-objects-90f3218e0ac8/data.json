You are given two options $650K and $2.8M, which one would you pick?", "If you picked $600K, then you already subconsciously know what spatial autocorrelation is. It is the correlation between two nearby objects in some common features (for example house prices).", "A potential application of spatial auto-correlation is that it helps in analyzing clusters and dispersion of ecology and diseases. Questions such as \u201cIs the disease an isolated case\u201d or \u201cIs the rainfall pattern clustered or same across places\u201d can be well understood and answered with spatial autocorrelation analysis.", "Technically, spatial auto-correlation refers to the measure of association between observation of variables that are close to each other at a spatial scale.

As per assumptions of independence in classical statistics, observations between groups and observation within groups should be independent. Hence, spatial autocorrelation clearly violates the above-mentioned assumptions.", "The concept of spatial correlation is a kind of extension of temporal correlation.

A negative spatial autocorrelation occurs when Moran\u2019s I value is -1.

Here are some of the interesting industrial use cases of spatial autocorrelation:", "Autocorrelation has a large influence is migration analysis. This study is a reproduction of the paper here. The case here takes into consideration the analysis of the migration of the foreign population in Italy.", "Migration is a key factor in population dynamics evolutions at different scales, with implications in economy, culture, and environment. Using spatial autocorrelation, we identify spatial clusters representative of the concentration of migrants.", "Technically, the Moran I coefficient\u2019s here represents the difference between the weighted variance of the ratio of the foreign and local resident population and the generalized variance.

These are known as spatial outliers.", "The areas where the migrating population inhibited could be divided into three clusters as follows :", "Spatial autocorrelation not only clusters similar objects with other similar objects but also speaks about the degree of correlation or similarity.
