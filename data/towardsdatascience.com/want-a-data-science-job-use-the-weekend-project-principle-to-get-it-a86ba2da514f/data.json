I got the data from some local websites, looked at the menus and if they mentioned gluten-free options, made sure they were visible.\u2019", "\u2018Henry, I checked out the website you built. My daughter is celiac. It\u2019s always a pain if we get somewhere and she can\u2019t eat.\u2019", "\u2018My girlfriend can\u2019t eat gluten either.
