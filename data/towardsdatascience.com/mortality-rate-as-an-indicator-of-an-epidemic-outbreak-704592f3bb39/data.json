One central discussion is about estimating the mortality rate. As we know, the mortality rate estimate is very unreliable for many reasons. For example,", "The list for both sides can go on and on. And there is plenty of literature to adjust the estimate according to each of these effects. But can we learn something else from this unreliable estimate?", "Rather than focus on the value of the mortality rate itself, we may use it to indicate the epidemic outbreak status. For example, we can use the mortality rate and the confirmed case count to span a 2-D plane, with the addition of bubble size proportional to the new confirmed case to indicate the speed of the recent spread. These visualizations roughly split the plane into four regions:", "If we assume that the \u201ctrue\u201d mortality rate is roughly stable for all countries (a big \u201cif\u201d, but still a useful starting point nonetheless), we can then derive the following for each region:", "The boundaries of these regions are not clear cut but are gradual. For the mortality rate, 0.5%~2% from the Chinese mortality rate outside of the Hubei Province is a reasonable baseline. For the confirmed count, somewhere around 100~500 is a reasonable range to begin to flood a healthcare system.", "Applying the logic we stated above, we can plot the mortality rate vs. confirmed count on two different dates, 2020\u201302\u201326, and one week later on 2020\u201303\u201302 for a set of country/region, using the Johns Hopkins Data. The size of each bubble is proportional to the logarithm of the 3-day moving average of the newly confirmed count. So a bigger bubble means more cases had been confirmed recently, thus an indication of a (detected) faster on-going virus spread.", "From the above plots, we can make the following judgments about the epidemic in each country:", "It was in the Under Detection region on 2020\u201302\u201326, even though its small bubble size indicates not many new cases at that time.", "Therefore, as expected, one week later on 2020\u201303\u201302, its confirmed cases surged from 18 to 191 in just one week, brought down the mortality rate to a more typical 1.6%.", "It was in the Under Detection region on 2020\u201302\u201326, and its relatively large bubble size indicated that the virus was spreading quickly. If the spread was not contained, it may flood healthcare resources in the future.", "The above statement can be confirmed in the 2020\u201303\u201302 plot, where Iran has moved to the under detection and/or healthcare overload region, with even bigger bubble size. So we can say that Iran probably still has a large number of undetected patients, and the healthcare system may begin to be overloaded.", "It sits in the Inconclusive region as of 2020\u201302\u201326. So it was relatively quiet.", "However, on 2020\u201303\u201302, the US sits prominently in the Under Detection region. This is a similar situation as France on one week ago but with a much more confirmed count and bigger bubble size. This indicates there may be many more infected patients undetected in the US than in France one week ago. This is a strong warning signal. Because if we expect the mortality rate in the US to be down to the 0.5~2% level similar to France, we would infer that hundreds or even thousands of infected patients are still undetected.", "On the other hand, we have to be aware that as of 2020\u201303\u201302, 5 out of the 6 deaths in the US are concentrated in the Life Care Center nursing home in King County, Washington State\u00b9. And the mortality rate among the elderly group is known to be higher\u00b2. However, there are only 14 confirmed cases in King County, thus the mortality rate within the county is 35.7%, a few times higher than the mortality rate in any age group. Therefore, it is still reasonable to believe that the US is in the Under Detection region with hundreds of patients undetected, even though the nursing home adjustment makes it less severe than the plot first suggests.", "It sits in the Effective Detection region on both 2020\u201302\u201326 and 2020\u201303\u201302. It has the highest confirmed counts in the world (except China) while keeping the mortality rate low. But it\u2019s large bubble size indicates its main problem is to contain the spread, rather than the virus detection.", "Its situation is somewhere between Iran and South Korea on both dates.", "They were in the Inconclusive region on 2020\u201302\u201326, and slowly moving towards the Effective Detection Region with zero morality. However, their relatively large bubble sizes indicate that their main concern is how to contain the virus.", "It has been between the Effective Detection region and the Healthcare Overload region. So their virus detection is probably less effective than Germany and Spain. It\u2019s crucial to see which direction they go in the near future.", "It was in the Effective Detection region on 2020\u201302\u201326. Which, as we know, the virus detection on the ship was indeed very strict.", "On 2020\u201303\u201302, it remains in the Effective Detection region, but the bubble size diminished. This indicates the situation has been cooling down. Also, its mortality rate stabilized at 0.9%, matches the 0.5~2% baseline very well.", "As we can see, this plot is very helpful in quickly assessing the relative situation of each country around the world.", "Also, making such an informative plot is easy by using my GitHub project. As usual, a fully functional Python Notebook on Google Colab is included in the repo for readers to play with.", "I want to thank my friend David Tian, a Machine Learning engineer, for his generous help on the Google Colab setup, and his valuable suggestions on this article.
