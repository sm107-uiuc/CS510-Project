In women, heart attacks may feel uncomfortable squeezing, pressure, fullness, or pain in the center of the chest. It may also cause pain in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach, shortness of breath, nausea and other symptoms. Men experience typical symptoms of heart attack, such as chest pain , discomfort, and stress. They may also experience pain in other areas, such as arms, neck , back, and jaw, and shortness of breath, sweating, and discomfort that mimics heartburn.", "It\u2019s a lot of work for an organ which is just like a large fist and weighs between 8 and 12 ounces.", "This is multivariate type of dataset which means providing or involving a variety of separate mathematical or statistical variables, multivariate numerical data analysis. It is composed of 14 attributes which are age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, oldpeak \u2014 ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels and Thalassemia. This database includes 76 attributes, but all published studies relate to the use of a subset of 14 of them. The Cleveland database is the only one used by ML researchers to date. One of the major tasks on this dataset is to predict based on the given attributes of a patient that whether that particular person has a heart disease or not and other is the experimental task to diagnose and find out various insights from this dataset which could help in understanding the problem more.", "The dataset was created by: -", "1. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D. 2. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D. 3. University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D. 4. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation: Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.", "There has been lot of confusion about the meta data, as there are various different meta data available out there. Over here below I have got the two most used meta data description from kaggle. So we are going to follow the second description(2 \u2014 description).", "2. Feature Importance \u2014 You can gain the significance of each feature of your dataset by using the Model Characteristics property.Feature value gives you a score for every function of your results, the higher the score the more significant or appropriate the performance variable is.Feature importance is the built-in class that comes with Tree Based Classifiers, we will use the Extra Tree Classifier to extract the top features for the dataset.", "3. Correlation Matrix with Heatmap \u2014 Correlation indicates how the features are related to each other or to the target variable.The correlation may be positive (increase in one value of the feature increases the value of the target variable) or negative (increase in one value of the feature decreases the value of the target variable)Heatmap makes it easy to classify the features are most relevant to the target variable, and we will plot the associated features of the heatmap using the seaborn library.", "Correlation shows whether the characteristics are related to each other or to the target variable. Correlation can be positive (increase in one value, the value of the objective variable increases) or negative (increase in one value, the value of the target variable decreased). From this heatmap we can observe that the \u2018cp\u2019 chest pain is highly related to the target variable. Compared to relation between other two variables we can say that chest pain contributes the most in prediction of presences of a heart disease. Medical emergency is a heart attack. A cardiac occurs usually when blood clot blocks blood flow to the cardiac. Tissue loses oxygen without blood and dies causing chest pain.", "According to this Cleveland dataset males are more susceptible to get Heart Disease than females. Men experience heart attacks more than women. Sudden Heart Attacks are experienced by men between 70% \u2014 89%. Woman may experience a heart attack with no chest pressure at all, they usually experience nausea or vomiting which are often confused with acid reflux or the flu.", "There are four types of chest pain, asymptomatic, atypical angina, non-anginal pain and typical angina. Most of the Heart Disease patients are found to have asymptomatic chest pain. These group of people might show atypical symptoms like indigestion, flu or a strained chest muscle. A asymptomatic attack, like any heart attack, involves, blockage of blood flow to your heart and possible damage to the heart muscle. The risk factors for asymptomatic heart attacks are same as those with heart symptoms. These factors include:", "\u00b7 Family History of Heart Disease", "Asymptomatic Heart attack puts you at a greater risk of having another heart attack which could be d deadly. Having another heart attack also increases your risk of complications, such as heart failure. There are no test to determine your potential for asymptomatic heart attack. The only way to tell If you had asymptomatic attack is by an electrocardiogram or echocardiogram. These tests can reveal changes that signal a heart attack.", "The Beta thalassemia cardiomyopathy is mainly characterized by two distinct pheno types , dilated type, with left ventricular dilatation and impaired contractility and a restrictive pheno type, with restrictive left ventricular feeling , pulmonary hyper tension and right heart failure. Heart problems, congestive heart failures and abnormal heart rhythms can be associated with severe thalassemia.", "Heart Disease is very common in the seniors which is composed of age group 60 and above and common among adults which belong to the age group of 41 to 60. But it\u2019s rare among the age group of 19 to 40 and very rare among the age group of 0 to 18.", "In adults, the total cholesterol levels are considered desirable less than 200 milligram per decilitre ( mg / dL). Borderlines are considered to be high between 200 to 239 mg / dL and 240 mg / dL and above. LDL should contain less than 100 mg / dL of cholesterol. 100 mg / dl rates for individuals without any health issue are appropriate but may be more relevant for those with cardiac problems or risk factors for heart disease. The levels are borderline moderate between 130 and 159 mg / dL and moderate between 160 and 189 mg / dL. The reading is very high at or above 190 mg / dL. Levels of HDL are to be maintained higher. The risk factor for cardiovascular diseases is called a reading less than 40 mg / dL. Borderline low is considered to be between 41 mg / dL and 59 mg / dL. The HDL level can be measured with a maximum of 60 mg / dL.", "Joint plots in seaborn helps us to understand the trend seen among two features. As observed from the above plot we can see that most of the Heart diseased patients in their age of upper 50s or lower 60s tend to have Cholesterol between 200mg/dl to 300mg/dl.", "We have 4 Categorical columns as seen in Data Description using pandas profiling:", "Since one hot encoding dropped \u201cthalassemia_type_fixed defect\u201d column which was a useful column compared to \u2018thalassemia_type_nothing\u2019 which is a null column, we dropped \u2018thalassemia_type_nothing\u2019 and concatinated \u2018thalassemia_type_fixed defect\u2019", "Min-Max Normalization method is used to Normalize the data. This method scales the data range to [0,1]. Standardization is also used on a feature-wise basis in most cases.", "The red dots represent the predicted values that is either 0 or 1 and the blue line & and dot represents the actual value of that particular patient. In the places where the red dot and blue dot do not overlap are the wrong predictions and where the both dots overlap those are the right predicted values.", "The classification report of the model shows that 91% prediction of absence of heart disease was predicted correct and 83% of presence of heart disease was predicted correct.", "The Confusion Matrix True Positive value is 24 and true Negative was 29.

Some areas of cardiac muscles will start to die during a Heart Attack because of Lack of Blood. A person\u2019s pulse may become slower (bradycardia) or faster (tachycardiac) depending on the type of Heart Attack they are experiencing.", "In normal type of rest ECG proves to be important for the prediction model along with the down sloping ST slope. The patient composed of these two features usually has cholesterol level between 170 to 225 mg/dl. The other types of slops with the rest ECG seems to be more spread out and less concise.", "The important features contributing to the accuracy of the prediction are shown through the Heatmap in descending order.
