AI systems, much more than traditional software, are hyper sensitive to changes in their data inputs. Consequently, a new class of monitoring solutions has risen at the data and functional level (rather than infrastructure of application levels). These solutions aim to detect the unique issues that are common in AI systems, namely concept drifts, biases and more.", "The AI vendor landscape is now crowded with companies touting monitoring capabilities. These companies include best-of-breed/standalone solutions, and integrated AI lifecycle management suites. The latter offer more basic monitoring capabilities, as a secondary focus.", "To further the hype, some of the major cloud providers began communicating that they also offer monitoring features for machine learning models deployed on their cloud platforms. AWS and Azure, the largest and 2nd largest providers by market share, each announced specific features under the umbrellas of their respective ML platforms \u2014 SageMaker Model Monitor (AWS), and Dataset Monitors (Azure) respectively. Google (GCP), so far, seems to only offer application level monitoring for serving models and for training jobs.", "In this post we provide a general overview of the current offerings from the cloud providers (we focused on AWS and Azure) and discuss the gaps in these solutions (which are generally covered well by best-of-breed solutions).", "So what do Azure and AWS have to offer regarding monitoring models in production?", "The first part of monitoring any kind of system is almost always logging data from the operation of the system. In the case of monitoring ML models, this starts from the model inputs and outputs.", "Unsurprisingly, both Azure and AWS allow you to easily log this data to their respective data stores (S3 buckets for AWS, blob storage for Azure). All you have to do is add a data capturing configuration to the model run call in your python code. Note that not all input types can be automatically saved (e.g., on Azure, audio, images, and video are not collected). AWS allows configuring a sampling rate for the data capturing as well.", "Once the input and output data is collected, the next step suggested by the platforms is to use their existing analytics/APM offerings to track the data.", "Azure recommends using Power BI or Azure DataBricks to get an initial analysis of the data, while in AWS you could use Amazon Cloudwatch.", "Since the data is saved in the platform\u2019s own storage system, it is usually pretty straightforward to get initial charts and graphs tracking your model\u2019s inputs and outputs.", "Both AWS and Azure offer fairly new tools for alerting on changes in the distribution and behavior of your model\u2019s input data. For AWS this is the main part of \u201cAmazon SageMaker Model Monitor\u201d, whereas for Azure this is done via a very new feature called \u201cDatasets Monitors\u201d.", "On both platforms, the workflow starts by creating a baseline dataset, which is usually based directly on the training dataset.", "Once you have that baseline ready, the platforms allow you to create datasets from inference input data captured as described above, compare them to the baseline dataset, and get reports on changes in the feature distributions.", "There are some differences between the two solutions. AWS\u2019 solution creates \u201cconstraints\u201d and \u201cstatistics\u201d files from the baseline data set, which contain statistical information on the input data. This allows you to later compare to inference data to get reports on differences. On the other hand, Azure\u2019s \u201cDataset Monitors\u201d provides you with a dashboard comparing the distributions of each feature between the baseline dataset and the inference time one. It then allows you to set up alerts for when the change in distribution is large enough.", "However, the above differences are really implementation details for the same basic functionality \u2014 take your feature set, look at their baseline distribution in your training set, and compare it to their distribution in inference time.", "So, the cloud providers do offer monitoring capabilities for the data and model layer, but can you rely on these capabilities to sustain and even improve upon a production grade AI system? We believe that you cannot. Here are a few reasons for that:", "Tracking your model inputs and outputs is good, but it\u2019s not enough to really understand your data and models\u2019 behaviors. What you really need to monitor isn\u2019t a single model \u2014 but an entire AI system. Many times, this will include data your cloud provider cannot easily access.", "For more on context based monitoring \u2014 check out this post about the platform approach to monitoring.", "It is not uncommon for an AI system to work just fine on average, but grossly underperform on sub-segments of the data. So, a granular examination of performance is crucial.", "Consider a case where your model behaves very differently on data coming from one of your customers. If this customer accounts for 5% of the data your model ingests, then the overall average performance of the model might seem fine. This customer, however, will not be pleased. The same could be true for different geolocations, devices, browsers or any other dimension along which your data could be sliced.", "A good monitoring solution will alert you when anomalous behavior in sub-segments happens, including when it happens in more granular sub-segments, e.g., for users coming from a specific geo using a specific device.", "Every AI system is like a snowflake. They all have specific performance metrics, acceptable (or unacceptable) behaviors, etc. A good AI monitoring platform must therefore be highly configurable.", "Consider a case where you have an NLP model detecting the sentiment of input texts. You know that on short texts (e.g., below 50 characters), your model isn\u2019t very accurate, and you\u2019re OK with this. You\u2019d like to monitor your model outputs, but you don\u2019t want to be alerted on low confidence scores when there\u2019s an increase in the relative proportion of short input texts. Your monitoring platform must allow you to easily exclude all short texts from the monitored dataset, when considering this specific metric (but maybe not for other metrics).", "There are many other examples that illustrate the value of fine tuning, ranging from alerting preferences to ad-hoc data manipulations. The completely autonomous monitoring approach sounds good in theory and is easy to explain, but will fail when encountering real world constraints.", "First, it is encouraging to see the major cloud providers beginning to provide more tooling for production AI. Nevertheless, the solutions we reviewed were quite basic and experimental (Azure, for example, does not yet provide any SLAs for the above mentioned solution). Monitoring certainly does not feel like a top priority for these providers.", "At the same time, it is becoming increasingly clear in the industry that monitoring models and the entire AI system is a foundational need that cannot be treated as an afterthought. It is crucial to get this right in order to make your AI production ready, and to make sure AI issues are caught before business KPIs are negatively impacted. The best-of-breed solutions have certainly made monitoring their core focus and priority.", "So, will best-of-breeds have an advantage in the market? It remains to be seen. One possible precedence to consider is that of the APM industry. The cloud providers have long had rudimentary solutions for IT organizations, and yet the market gave rise to a successful category of best-of-breed players such as New Relic, AppDynamics, and Datadog (and quite a few others). Some buyers settle for more basic capabilities as they prefer to deal with fewer vendors, whereas others prefer the most in depth capabilities in every stage of the life cycle.", "In any event, the evolution of this category will surely be interesting to observe and experience.", "Your home for data science.
