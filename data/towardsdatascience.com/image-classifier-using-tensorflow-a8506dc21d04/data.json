You can find the link for the dataset and code below", "I took around 10,000 images from the dataset for easy computation and made a validation folder and placed some random images of cats and dogs to test the classifier after training.", "The dataset contains two folders Train and Test. The Train folder contains two folders which consist of images of cats and dogs which are used for training. The Test folder also consists of two folders which consist of images of cats and dogs which are used for evaluating the model. The training set consists of 8000 images of cats and dogs and the test set consists of 2000 images and cats and dogs", "You can either use Google Colab if your PC or laptop doesn\u2019t have a GPU or else you can use Jupyter Notebook. If you use your system, upgrade pip and then install TensorFlow as follows", "In the above lines of code, I just imported all the libraries I will be needing in the process", "We will apply some transformations on the training images to avoid overfitting, if we do not perform we get a large difference between the accuracy of the training set and the test set.", "We perform some geometrical transformations like flipping the image horizontally, flipping vertically, zoom in, zoom out and many more can be performed, we apply it so that our model won\u2019t over learn our training images. We perform the above methods using the ImageDataGenerator class.", "train_datagen is the instance of ImageDataGenerator class that will apply all the transformations on the images in the training set, the rescale method will apply feature scaling to all the pixels in the images so that it would be in the range of 0 to 1. Now we need to connect it to our training dataset.", "flow_from_directory will connect the Image Augmentation process to our training set. We need to mention the path of our training set. Target size is the size of the image that should be fed into the Neural Network. Batch size is defined as the no of images in a batch, the class mode would be binary as we only have two outputs either a cat or a dog.", "We don't apply transformations for the test set because we only use them to evaluate, the only task to do with our test set is to rescale the images because in the training part we defined a target size for the image that could be fed into the network.", "Now we define the test set that imports our test images from the directory. We do define the batch size, target size, and class mode as same mentioned in the training set.", "The Convolutional Neural Network is a series of Sequential layers, so here we define it with a Sequential Class", "We use add a method to add the layers, Firstly we add Convolutional layers Conv2D class, we need to pass three parameters inside this which are", "filters \u2192 No of Feature Detectors you need to apply for the image, it is also known as kernels.", "kernel-size \u2192 need to define a kernel size for your feature detector in terms of no of rows and columns.", "input_shape \u2192 Whenever we add the first layer in any deep learning model, we need to specify the input_shape, as we are dealing with the images we need to provide the target size we mentioned above in the training set, 3 refers to the RGB channel.", "activation_function \u2192 We need to specify the activation function which triggers the mechanism.", "Here, we consider Max Pooling class and we need to specify two arguments", "pool_size \u2192 It is the size of the frame which we apply for the obtained feature detector in the Convolution layer.", "stride \u2192 By how much the frame should be shifted in all four directions", "Now, we apply the Second Convolutional layer to our network", "Here, we convert all the convolution and max-pooling layers into One-Dimensional which will become the input to the fully connected layer.", "The arguments that we pass into our Dense Layer are the number of hidden neurons as units, activation function we use would be relu.", "The number of output units would be 1 as we are going to predict only one class and the activation function would be sigmoid activation function.", "We consider the compile method in which we take two arguments one is a compiler which is adam and a loss function which is binary_crossentropy and we choose metrics as accuracy.", "We\u2019ll be using the fit method to train with the training set and also use the test set to evaluate the model. We will run it on 25 epochs.", "Let us predict by taking a random image, for that, we import the essential libraries NumPy \u2026 and image for performing image operations. We use load_img function which loads image in PIL format, we mention the path of the test image and also it should have the same size as the training image. Then we use img_array function which converts the image to array fro preprocessing as the model expects it.", "Our CNN model is trained as batches of images, not as an individual image, so we need to add an extra dimension. We will be adding an extra dimension in order to access the individual image. We do it using expand_dim function in NumPy.", "We use the predict method on test images and also access the labels of the image from the batch size and use if-else condition to check whether the image is cat or dog.", "That\u2019s all for now, hope you enjoyed this tutorial on the classification of cats and dogs, In my next blog, I will explain you about the importance of Recurrent Neural Networks and implement an application of it from scratch.", "If you would like to know about how Artificial Neural Networks work along with an application, check out my blogs below:", "Your home for data science.
