That\u2019s the advice given by Reddit\u2019s co-founders in this video: you\u2019ll want to track something and its trends to avoid data debt when starting a product. Product and engineering teams at technology companies now view this as conventional wisdom. A product\u2019s success and quality is only as good as metrics that verify it. You can\u2019t improve it if you don\u2019t measure it.", "Reading the news and watching movies like The Social Dilemma, there seems to be a broad desire by the technology industry and society to move past merely using engagement metrics as success. That said, I\u2019ve encountered surprisingly few approachable online resources that discuss how to design a good metric. That\u2019s pretty surprising since this is one of the core responsibilities of data science teams! This guide is meant to be a step forward in filling that gap.", "Before we design new metrics, we should understand what existing metrics already measure. Personally, I have found it helpful to bucket metrics into two broad categories: precision and recall.", "Analysts can classify existing metrics into these two buckets and find measurement gaps for new metrics to address. Or, this framework can help contextualize proposed new metrics among existing ones. The first recall metric might be more impactful than the tenth precision metric and vice versa.", "Precision metrics measure usage and feedback on the current iteration of the product. These metrics are usually derived from product logging. Teams use them to measure growth and optimize features. In fact, I would say the vast majority of metrics that analysts work with and design are precision-like in nature.", "Recall metrics track product performance against a ground truth. If precision metrics measure growth and optimize existing features, recall metrics help measure product quality and drive new feature development. Unlike precision metrics, recall metrics may need more than product logging to measure. User surveys or data labeling by teams of humans may serve as the data inputs to recall metrics. Sometimes, User Experience Research teams will own survey-based recall metrics instead of data science teams which tend to be more focused on logging-based metrics.", "Now that we\u2019ve established what kind of metrics exist, let\u2019s dive into the process of creating, reporting, and possibly sunsetting a metric.", "Broadly, shifts in product direction and market, product, or customer maturity can drive the need for new metrics. More specifically, new metrics can come from:", "Once analyst teams establish the need for a new metric, analysts begin metric design work. Data science teams expect these analysts to reason through the potential second-order effects of using a proposed metric in experiments and performance tracking", "Data scientist interviews often ask case study questions around this reasoning process. In my experience, the interviewer will either ask the candidate to design a metric or will propose a metric and ask the candidate to evaluate it. Here is a framework to approach these questions:", "This framework encompasses what I have experienced in metric design interviews. In the following sections, I discuss more about empirically validating a proposed metric when on an analyst team and obtaining stakeholder buy-in.", "After proposing a metric, the next step is to complete data and experimental analysis demonstrating the metric behaves as expected and is actionable. There are a couple steps needed to validate a metric:", "At some point in the validation process the data science team will need to present the new metric and its behavior to engineering and product teams for buy-in and feedback to use as a product success metric.", "Metric validation is a form of data analysis, so I would keep in mind Roger Peng\u2019s advice on the topic: A data analysis is successful if the audience to which it is presented accepts the results. Make sure the Product and Engineering teams\u2019 gut checks pass with this proposed metric and the analysis associated with it.", "After stakeholder approval, your metric should be ready for logging! Communicating, visualizing, and telling stories with data is a topic that could fill a whole book. That said, here are some tips which might be helpful:", "In my experience, analysts rarely deprecate metrics. Instead, data engineering teams and code stewardship drive metric deprecation.", "Data teams try to optimize the time it takes to calculate core metrics, often on a daily basis. The more metrics their daily jobs need to compute the longer it takes those jobs to run and the greater the probability of a job failing. These engineering teams have an incentive to stop calculating metrics that analysts and product teams neither monitor nor could find useful.", "Unimportant or unadopted metrics may lack owners after theirs leave a team and logging is not claimed after a long period of time of no updates. Data engineering teams have leeway to deprecate these ownerless metrics.", "So there you have it! We\u2019ve discussed \u2026.", "As always, I consider this to be a living document and I am open to feedback \u2014 feel free to shoot me a note at zthomas.nc@gmail or on LinkedIn if you have any thoughts!
