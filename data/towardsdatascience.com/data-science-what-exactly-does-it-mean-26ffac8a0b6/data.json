In traditional machine learning algorithms, the future is predicted based on historical observations where all prior observations are treated equally. However, a time series dataset is different in that it adds an explicit order dependence between observations: a time dimension.", "A time-series data can be both univariate (e.g., historical daily rainfall or daily sales of a product) or multivariate (e.g., past regular sales of 2 products). Further, time-series forecasting can be both a single-step or multi-step prediction. Single-step forecasting involves forecasting just the one next variable in the future, while multi-step time series forecasting predicts multiple future values.

For example, a content-based movie recommendation algorithm can utilize my age, gender, and location (user profile) or the movie category, language, and lead actors (item description) to recommend my next movie. Bayesian classifiers, cluster analysis, decision trees, and artificial neural networks are generally used to estimate the likelihood of a user to like an item.", "Hybrid systems utilize both collaborative and content-based filtering to build a recommendation system. Netflix is an excellent example of the use of hybrid recommender systems. Its recommendations are a combination of watch and search habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) together with recommending movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly in the past (content-based filtering).

There are some overlaps in the literature between ANN and deep learning. However, for this article, I will consider an ANN to be a network that comprises of only three layers of neurons: an input layer, a hidden layer (where all data and information processing is carried out by a machine learning algorithm) and an output layer. ANNs are designed to learn or adapt themselves iteratively and are extensively used for finding patterns or identifying images that are far too complex or time consuming for a human to program.", "ANNs learn by example, as stated by Howard Rheingold:", "The neural network is this kind of technology that is not an algorithm, it is a network that has weights on it, and you can adjust the weights so that it learns. You teach it through trials.", "Deep machine learning or deep neural networks are advanced ANNs with multiple hidden layers, i.e., information can be iteratively processed through machine learning algorithms by each hidden neuron layer to map the input layer more effectively to the output layer.", "Some of the most common types of deep neural networks are:", "CNNs are mostly used in image or pattern recognition, classification, and analysis problems. CNNs were first introduced in 1998 as LeNet-5. They differ from regular neural networks (in which, usually, each layer is fully connected to all neurons in the previous layer) \u2014 the layers are organized in three dimensions (width, height, and depth) and that the neurons in a layer are only connected a small region in the next layer. As the name suggests, the layers in a CNN are convolutional layers that use a convolution operation on the input before passing on to the next layer.", "Some of the leading CNN model implementations being used nowadays in their respective domains are:", "Introduced in 2014, GANs are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks in an adversarial manner to generate new, synthetic data points that closely mimic real data. They are used widely in image generation, video generation, and voice generation.", "GANs work by generating new data instances by one neural network (the generator), while the other evaluates them for authenticity (the discriminator). Accordingly, the discriminator decides whether each instance of data that it reviews belongs to the actual training dataset or not. Refer to the original paper here.", "RNNs are a particular type of neural network designed for sequence problems. They differ from other deep neural networks in that the output from the previous step is an input for the next step (thereby being recurrent).", "Therefore, in addition to the traditional learning involved during the model training step, RNNs have an additional learning step whereby they remember things learned from prior input while generating an output. RNNs are used for handwriting recognition, speech recognition, time-series predictions, natural language processing, and others.", "Some specific neural networks based on RNNs are:", "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a broad term that encompasses several facets of computational processing of human languages, be it processing a text input (translations, sentiment analysis, etc.), or generating human-understandable text through algorithms (natural language generation, automatic summarization, chatbots, etc.).", "Although NLP algorithms and methodologies are based on ANN and deep networks, I have decided to elaborate on NLP separately since the majority of the latest NLP algorithms comprise of two or more different deep learning algorithms together (ANN, RNN, CNN, etc.).", "NLP related functions performed through deep machine learning algorithms include machine translation, parsing, tagging, named entity recognition, natural language generation, chatbots, sentiment analysis, summarizing, etc.", "Some common pre-trained and otherwise NLP related models and libraries include:", "Although the following support activities are theoretically not classified as part of data science (as each one of them is an independent field of study and domain in themselves), they usually complement machine learning tasks by making our work more efficient and effective.", "Although data engineering is a pretty broad field, for the sake of brevity here, I will briefly go over concepts such as data collection, ingestion, and cleaning. All these tasks form a cornerstone for any machine learning pipeline \u2014 there is no machine learning without data that is clean and transformed in a way that can be used by our ML algorithms.", "The main objective of data engineering is to collect data and transform it in such a way that it is readable and usable by machine learning algorithms.", "Search Engines are NoSQL database management systems that facilitate searching for data content.

It involves removing duplicate, erroneous or irrelevant entries, unifying labels, converting them into a proper format, handling missing data (excluding them altogether or imputing them through other means), and other similar processes to make raw data usable by our ML algorithms.", "Data storage, as the name implies, is simply the process of storing data in a reusable and easily accessible form. Some of the traditional and non-traditional data storage methodologies are:", "Not all data science projects involve big data, but in case yours does, the following are some of the related frameworks and solutions. Most of the following are distributed processing frameworks that are inherently capable of storing, handling, and processing large volumes of structured and unstructured data in a parallel fashion.", "Hadoop is a set of open-source programs, tools, and procedures (i.e., a complete big data framework or ecosystem) that serves as a backbone of big data operations. Developed by Apache, it is an open-source framework; however, various third-party vendors specialize in Hadoop deployments tuned to your specific organizational requirements.", "Some of the most common modules of Hadoop are:", "Spark is another big data ecosystem that is open-source and developed by Apache. You might be wondering why Apache developed Spark when there was already a big data framework available in the form of Hadoop. Spark is usually implemented on top of Hadoop\u2019s HDFS to build upon some of the processing drawbacks of MapReduce \u2014 thereby resulting in a multi-folds increase in the processing speed (especially for massive volumes of live data streaming).", "Although Spark, as a cluster computing framework, can be implemented on a standalone basis. However, it is mostly used within a Hadoop ecosystem to get the best of both worlds.", "Data visualization is the graphical representation of data and helps in obtaining a better understanding of our data and its various intricacies, interrelationships, nomenclature, issues, etc.", "Some of the major data visualization tools and solutions available to a data scientist are:", "With that, we have concluded our whirlwind and a high-level tour of data science. It is an extremely broad, diversified, and a rapidly evolving field \u2014 the above is not meant to be a comprehensive listing of all its facets.
