Of course, keeping blanks makes sense in some cases, but the most common scenario is that you want to display something else instead of it (0 when it comes to numbers, or maybe \u2018N/A\u2019 or \u2018Unknown\u2019 when working with text).", "So, what are the options to handle blanks in Power BI? Let\u2019s check directly there\u2026", "I will use Stack Overflow 2013 database. This database contains tables with more than 20 million records, so if you want to measure performance, it\u2019s definitely better than playing with Adventure Works or similar databases.", "Let\u2019s say that I want to see how many comments were left in every single year. First, since there is no specific year value in the database, I need to create a calculated column Year Comment, using the following formula:", "The next step is the creation of a measure which will count all comments.", "Here, we get the total number of comments per year. Now, let\u2019s say that we want to calculate how many comments were left in 2012 exclusively. This can be done in many different ways, but I\u2019m using the following formula:", "Let me stop for a moment and introduce you to DAX Studio. Maybe some of you are familiar with this tool, but if you writing DAX on regular basis and working with Power BI on a daily level, this tool is a MUST! I will not go into details about what features does it offer \u2014 I would honestly say that it\u2019s awesome and most important \u2014 it\u2019s completely FREE! So, go and download DAX Studio immediately:)\u2026", "I will use DAX Studio to measure the performance of my visuals. Let\u2019s connect our .pbix file to DAX Studio and add our newly created measure to the report.", "I\u2019m also turning on Performance Analyzer under the View tab in Power BI, in order to catch the query which will be executed in the background. Here is the query which Power BI generated to display what we want:", "Now, let me stop for a moment and try to explain what is going on in the background. When you interact with the visuals in Power BI, every time query is being generated and sent to Analysis Services (Tabular) engine (Vertipaq), which runs in the background and doing the \u201cdirty\u201d job.", "In the following picture, we can see how Vertipaq coped with this query:", "Now, we get to handling blank values in the visual. The first scenario is the most obvious and most used I guess. The measure which can solve blanks is as follows:", "And, we get the following results:", "So, here we are: instead of blanks, we are displaying zeros. Let\u2019s check how this query performed:", "Of course, differences are not that big with simple measures, but with complex DAX and different filtering contexts, on multimillion rows tables, variations can be significant.", "Recently, Power BI introduced a completely new function: COALESCE(). For those coming from the SQL world, this is a well-known function, but let me explain briefly for those who are not familiar with it. Basically, COALESCE will walk through the values passed as arguments and return the first non-blank value (not-null in SQL).", "So, COALESCE will check column1, if the value is blank, it will go to check column2 value. If it is also blank, it will continue, until it finds the first non-blank value. As the last argument, you should assign the value you want to return in the case that all checked arguments returned blank, something like:", "Let\u2019s create a measure for our report using the COALESCE function:", "Let\u2019s check the performance of this measure:", "This is a little trick I saw Jeffrey Wang using. For those who don\u2019t know, Jeffrey Wang is one of the DAX's most-recognized names.", "What\u2019s the trick? In DAX, blank + 0 is 0! Yes, I know, for us coming from SQL environment, who think of blank as a NULL twin from SQL, it\u2019s completely unexpected behavior. Try to run following command in SQL Server Management Studio:", "As you thought \u2014 the result is NULL. In SQL, NULL+something is always NULL\u2026In DAX, it is not:)", "So, let\u2019s try this solution in our report:", "Results are again exactly the same:", "Finally, let\u2019s see what happened in the background:", "As you could see, there are multiple ways of handling blank values in DAX.
