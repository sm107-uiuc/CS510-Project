With it you\u2019re able to draw graphs that have a sketched visual. For this tutorial, we will use the disease.sh API to visualize population and Covid-19 data of various countries. The reason I choose this library is to have a more open mind on how to visualize data. With every data visualization, we are telling a story using a different art style can greatly alter the perspective people have on it. This for me is also an experiment to see if a data visualization that uses a tool like RoughViz.js can make a seemingly boring subject more interesting because of the visuals this library uses.", "For this tutorial, we are going to use React to create a project. The easiest way to set up a react project is through Create React App. If you haven\u2019t installed create react app yet, check their docs to have the tools ready to start. We will create and run the project with the following commands:", "The name of the folder can really be anything you like but this is what I choose for this tutorial. executing npm start should show a running page with a rotating react logo. So let\u2019s now install RoughViz.js so we can use it in our project. Since we\u2019re using react we will install the react wrapper.", "We can now start my importing the library in app.js. Remove all the code from the start project and add the import. your app.js should look like this:", "We can now start bij building our first graph. For now, we will use a hard coded array in order to show you the capabilities of RoughViz.js. Don\u2019t worry we will be working with data form an API in a bit after we have set up our first graph. So for this first graph we will use the bar graph. Use the code below and you should be able to see a bar graph with 4 bars.", "I have added a few extra properties which are optional like fillWeight, axisFontSize, roughness and padding. I added these properties so you can play around with it. change the values and see how it affects the graph. Increasing the roughness and fillWeight is especially fun because it allows us to change the graph from figure 1 to something like the figure 2 below.", "For this example we will use the Disease.sh API to show the top 10 populated countries. Lets first set up the API call in order for use to get the data we want. First import useState and useEffect since we will be using that to store our data.", "Next initialize the variable with the useState to store the data in. We also need to initialize a separate array for population and names because We need two arrays, one for the labels and another for the population field.", "Next we will create a fetchData function which will make the API call which will retrieve the data. After retrieving it we can store this response in the setData we initialized above. Try to console log your the data and see if you get an output of the data from the API. If that\u2019s all set we can start to filter our data to only show the top 10 populated countries. We will use the filter function from ES6 to only retrieve these countries and order them from highest to lowest.", "After that\u2019s done we will store this with the .map function into the population variable we initialized above. Finally we will also fill the names array from above to show the names for each country in the labels fields of the graph.", "We can now fill the graph with our newly retrieved data. The code for the graph should look the same, the only thing different is the data property.", "If done correctly your graph should look like figure 3.", "Now we can try out another graph. The code for the scatter graph is more or less the same. The most important difference here is that we store the data in an x and y property instead of the labels and values. We will still use the population array but add an active array to display how many active cases each country has. Next we should also set the radius of each circle shown on the map. I have set mine to 40 but you can set it to anything you want. Next we also added a colors property to add an array of colors. This is used to determine what color a circle based on the value", "If implemented correctly your graph should look like Figure 4.", "Great you now have made two awesome graphs with real API data. RoughViz.js has more graphs such as Line graph, Stacked bar chart and a Circle graph. On figure 5 is another example I made with the same Covid-19 data I used for the scatter graph.", "If you would like to know about their library you can check their GitHub page. They have various examples with code and even wrappers for React, Vue and Python. I hope you liked this tutorial and learned something new. Happy coding!", "Your home for data science.
