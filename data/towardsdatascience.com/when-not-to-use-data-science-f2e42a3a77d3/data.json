Healthcare, little data, one-off tasks, and other situations where data science is not necessary."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://datascience2.medium.com/subscribe", "anchor_text": "https://datascience2.medium.com/subscribe", "paragraph_index": 20}], "all_paragraphs": ["Both Data Science and Machine Learning are useful fields that apply several tools to predict, suggest, classify, and ultimately solve common business problems. You can create highly accurate models that automate previously manual tasks. Data Science can be powerful, saving companies money and time. However, you will find that you do not necessarily need Data Science to solve every problem you encounter. There are certain situations where human intervention is more important, or the situation does not allow for a generalized model.", "I will be describing four examples of when not to use Data Science. As a Data Scientist, I have found that I have slowly, over time, learned, or experienced when Data Science and Machine Learning were not necessary. I hope I can shed some light and intuition for you and your future situations.", "There are several examples of when to use Data Science and when not to use Data Science. Here are some situations that come to mind where a Data Science model is not necessary, and possibly could make the situation worse:", "If this model prediction is incorrect, what will be the consequences?", "However, Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI are constantly evolving and you can expect to see emerging technologies and improvements on model accuracy quickly.", "This example is more common. When you are producing a model, you want to make sure you have sufficient data. Bad data in and a bad model out could occur, and the same could be said about not having enough data that would then produce a bad model. The model could even seem to perform well but it would not generalize well to new situations. You could be overfitting, or simply not exposing the environment to enough possible instances of training data. Before you build a model as well as spend time on development and resources, check to see if you have enough data first.", "This example is a little more dependant on the specific situation. You may be asked to perform a Data Science model from a non-technical stakeholder or leader in your company, and perhaps should ask yourself if Data Science is necessary.", "\u2014 if you are not outputting results daily, weekly, or even monthly, you may not want to spend the time or creating a complex model that incorporates the scheduling of ingesting new data.", "You could apply similar skills to answer this business problem and suggest to the stakeholder that since you only need to have one outputted CSV file, for example, you can answer the question with a simple Python function (you may not need to go in-to-depth with your stakeholders as to why you are not going to use a Data Science model, as some stakeholders just want an outputted result and do not care how you got it). You may just need a small function that manually mimics the themes of a Data Science model. If you know the situation well, you could create bins or weights yourself and apply those to features or columns and come up with your own score. Here is an example of what I am describing:", "While this might not be the most \u2018accurate\u2019, if you need a quick way to organize data, a function like this or something similar could be sufficient.", "Sometimes you may encounter a situation where you want to classify thousands of observations, but you have too much unlabeled data in your dataset. There are ways around this problem like labeling software or unsupervised techniques to create new labels. However, if you find that either using human effort or other software services to label takes up too much time and money, then you may want to reassess the situation. Perhaps you need to perform more data engineering techniques like accessing an API before you implement a Data Science model.", "Depending on how much data you are ingesting and predicting, training a model can be expensive. Your company may not have enough resources yet, and an expensive Data Science model not may be feasible.", "This point goes along with \u2018when you do not have enough time\u2019 as well. You may have a certain deadline that is soon approaching and there are methods other than Data Science that can be beneficial like Python functions and rules.", "There are countless situations when you should use Data Science and Machine Learning. Essentially, you could flip the above examples, or look at if you have an unsupervised, supervised, time-series, etc situation for when you should use Data Science.", "You can also apply the above examples but incorporate both Data Science techniques and manual processes as well. Human-in-the-loop is becoming more common as a good bridge between these two practices.", "Some specific examples of when to use Data Science include, but are not limited to:", "The examples of \u2018when not to use Data Science\u2019 are not to discourage you from utilizing Data Science, but to stress the importance of \u2018just because you can, does not mean you should\u2019. Ultimately, it depends on your specific situation and what the output will be affecting. Therefore, each example can be rebutted to be a use case for Data Science given the specific environment.", "There are caveats to all of these examples, and you may end up using Data Science in these situations. Data Science is evolving and new facets are emerging. Keep in mind, this article is opinion-oriented and these points or examples can change quickly. Feel free to comment down below when you think you should or should not use Data Science for a given situation. To summarize, here are all of the four examples of when you should not use Data Science.", "I hope you enjoyed my article. Thank you for reading!", "Your home for data science.
