Think of it this way, AI can\u2019t grasp feelings or life, at least for now. However, we have found that it is capable of understanding and decision-making.", "\u201cAI doesn\u2019t have to be evil to destroy humanity \u2014 if AI has a goal and humanity just happens to come in the way, it will destroy humanity as a matter of course without even thinking about it, no hard feelings.\u201d \u2014 Elon Musk", "Here is the following thought about the ethics of AI:", "AI has no ethics before it has a free conscience. Without free would, AI will have no legal principle, no better than a hammer.", "Major ethical concerns about the use of AI:", "Here are the following benefits of AI:", "How could you say AI is ethical:", "Someone who is accountable does the job, so they need to consider what morality is and how it works. It\u2019s applied to damage control mathematics. Unfortunately, most professionals involved in this area do not have a clue as to what morality is, and there is no place where they all get together and address it rationally. Luckily, however, those brains can never create strong AI, so they\u2019re not a huge threat to mankind.", "The job of AI is to avoid such injustice in order for making it equal to all, or to strive to make it as fair as possible, but how is justice calculated?", "The way to achieve this is to turn a multi-player into a single-payer scheme by thinking that all players are the same person in loops over time to live all the lives of the individuals (and animals) involved.", "What\u2018s best for the person right now?", "The benefits in one life by abusing others are now compensated by the damage done to those others who are no longer others at all: the harm is now being suffered by the same person. So now it\u2019s easy to see if the action is positive or poor because good ones contribute to larger benefits than losses.", "It becomes a question of adding up the possible amount of pain and pleasure. Individual people are not inherently good at using this approach because they do not usually assume that they would have to live the lives of the people they are hurting, so they prefer to skew it against themselves (or, in some situations, towards themselves), but AI can apply the method without any such prejudice.", "You can do for your own system, but I still hope that the other people\u2019s AI will find the writing about it and be wise enough to understand its correctness such that, as a rule, it will take it upon itself to regulate its actions even though no one has configured any effort to moralize it or to replace the flawed system of computer ethics that anyone else has installed into it.", "If we want to create a general intelligence that is human-friendly, we need to find a good way of developing a kind of ethical processor that we understand and agree on. If we disregard this, it is very possible that future AI would not have our best interests in mind.", "This will be rather complicated on the grounds of the morals and ethical principles that we have now. They are different all over the world depending on the place, culture, and faith. We did not evolve as a single human being, where we might benefit from our experience of life in society. Our world is fragmented in several respects, such as ethnicity, language, values, history, politics. This makes it difficult to describe legal and ethical problems. Even as human beings of the same history, we understand that these ideals vary from one another. Even as human beings of the same history, we understand that these ideals vary from one another. So this will be the first step to resolve it.", "The other part of this will be machined. While there are very \u201csmart\u201d machines out there (the public is not aware of them) that can both process and learn on their own and use their AI capabilities, they were all designed by humans, which means with vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities will have significant implications if we have 100% confidence in computers. AI can point out something that doesn\u2019t work for humans and it develops its own reasoning (moral and ethical) based on what it has as knowledge and what it has experienced.", "It has no conscience and no human brain. Nor does it have the same image as a human being. It uses what it has because it sounds like something the machine lacks. The logical series can also be somewhat different from the human way of thought. The thing is going to be focused on the rules that the machine follows or has been programmed with.", "So, no, it wouldn\u2019t be useful in today\u2019s world, but as man and technology grow to a much higher degree, the interaction between humans and computers might be more feasible. Software science is much more sophisticated than what the public will see. Unfortunately, it is mainly used for power and war games.", "Now, take your thoughts on Twitter, Linkedin, and Github!!", "Agree or disagree with Saurav Singla\u2019s ideas and examples?
