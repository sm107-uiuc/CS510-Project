Hence, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of these concepts.", "This article intends to explain the essentials of probability.", "I will be writing a number of articles on the subject of probability and statistics. They will intend to explain the concepts from the ground up.", "This article is the first in the series.", "Think about it this way; probability is the science of uncertainty. Hence, whenever there is any doubt of an event occurring, the concepts of probability are involved to estimate the likelihood of an event. If we want to predict an outcome of a variable that can take one of many available values then we have to involve the mathematics of probability. All we have to do is to assign a number to an event, for example, it is 30% likely that it is going to rain tomorrow.", "Consider this, don\u2019t we have to use the theory of probability throughout our life? Will we be successful in our exams, our jobs, our decisions? How can we increase the chances of success?", "Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to understand probability.", "Is it really going to be sunny tomorrow? Is the stock price going to stay the same till tomorrow? How certain are we? How likely are we going to receive a phone call within the next hour?", "The fact that probability is an extremely important subject, I decided to start my series of articles with the subject of probability.", "Dependent on how interested everyone is, in the subsequent articles, I will explain the Central Limit Theorem, the law of large numbers, how convergence works, Markov chains, Probability Transitions, Simulation of probability distributions and we will also take a deeper dive into the joint and marginal distributions and their estimations. I aim to explain the complex concepts in a simplified manner. Subsequently, I will also explain the subject of Statistics. This should then form a solid foundation for data science.", "The objective of the article is to explain the following six key points:", "This section will start the subject of probability by explaining what probability space it. The concept of probability space forms the foundation of probability theory hence it is important to understand it.", "A probability space is used to model experiments. It is a mathematical concept and is also also known as the probability triple.", "There are three components in a probability space:", "This is a set of all of the possible outcomes. A set in mathematics is a unique collection of elements.", "The sample space of a stock price movement can be S ={Increase, Same, Decrease}. As Increase is an element of S, we can write it as Increase \u2208 S", "Now the key to remember is that the sample space can be an infinite set. As an instance, the population of a country is constantly changing and it is a random number with an infinite number of possibilities.", "This is a set that contains a combination of outcomes. Hence it is the collection of subsets of the sample space. Each element of the set is known as an event.", "For example, the subset of events of throwing dice can be {1}, {1,2} and so on.", "Therefore, it is important to note that the sample space (1) is an element of a set of events (2). S \u2208 F", "3. Probability Measure \u2014 A function of how events are assigned to probabilities:", "Each event has a probability assigned to it. The probability can be any value from 0 to 1. The key to note is that it is a non-negative number that cannot be greater than 1. The value of 1 implies that the event is guaranteed to occur whereas the value of 0 means that the event will never occur.", "As an example, throwing an unbiased fair dice can result in one of the 6 possible outcomes and hence each outcome has a probability of 1/6. Therefore the probability of getting 4 is P(4) = 1/6", "The more likely it is for an event to occur, the higher the probability measure.", "The sum of the probability of all of the sample space is 1", "The probability of an empty set is 0. It means that no outcome cannot occur.", "Now one important concept I want everyone to take away from the first section is that the probability measure is additive too. It implies that if we want to compute a probability of a complicated event then we can add the probabilities of simple events that make up the complicated event \u2014 as long as they are disjointed.", "As an instance, the probability of a dice showing 1 or 4 is", "Let\u2019s move on to the next section of random variables. We often come across the terms \u201cmeasurable\u201d or \u201cobservable\u201d when reading financial papers. The term observable represents a random variable in an experiment that can be measured.", "A random variable itself is a function. It maps a state space to a set of numbers, hence a random variable is an outcome that is random in nature. Each outcome has a probability associated with it.", "To illustrate, consider that the GDP of a country is a random variable. It can be considered as a function of many variables and constants. Each event has a probability measure associated with it.", "The world is full of random variables. For instance, the population of the world is dependent on time, throwing a dice, flipping a coin, days of a week, the interest rates, exchange rates, price of gold, etc. are all random variables.", "A random variable can be discrete or continuous.", "A discrete random variable is one that has a finite set of possible outcomes. These outcomes can also be countably infinite but the key to note is that the sum of the finite set of outcomes should be 1.", "As an instance, throwing a dice, flipping a coin, days of a week, colours in a particular pencil box, gender, months, days of a month, etc. are all examples of a discrete random variable.", "A random variable that is not discrete is a continuous random variable. It has an infinite set of possible outcomes that cannot be counted.", "As an instance, the population of the world that is dependent on time, the interest rates, exchange rates, price of gold, rainfall in millimetres, etc. are all examples of a continuous random variable.", "The key to take from this section is that the radom number is a function of outcomes where each outcome is random and has a probability associated with it.", "This section will provide an overview of the probability rules which are extremely important to understand.", "Consider that I have a standard fair coin with two sides: heads and tails.", "Therefore if I flip a coin in the air then I might see either Heads or Tails when it lands on my hand. For a fair coin, the probability of getting a Heads, P(Heads), is 0.5 and the probability of getting tails, P(Tails), is 0.5 too.", "We can see that Heads and Tails are all of the two possible outcomes. The sum of the probability measure is P(Heads) U P(Tails) = (0.5 + 0.5) = 1.", "The key to note is that Or means Add.", "If we flip two coins then the probability of seeing Heads for both of the times is P(Heads) x P(Heads). This is the multiplication principle.", "If we flip two coins then the probability of seeing either Heads or Tails is 1 because or means add. This is the additive principle.", "These two events are independent of each other because flipping a coin once does not impact the result of our next trial.", "Now, consider a slightly complex example. Assume that we are standing at the side of a road and are counting the colours and sizes of the cars which are driving past us.", "This example should help us in explaining the probability rules better.", "This circle represents all of the cars which drove past us on the road. This is our sample set S:", "The mini red circle below represents all of the Red cars. The complement of R is written as R\u1d9c. The complement of A is the set that is not A.", "In this instance, anything outside R is R\u1d9c:", "The probability of a car being red is P(R)", "The probability of a car not being red is 1-P(R)", "The mini blue circle represents all of the Blue cars:", "The probability of cars being Red and Blue is 0 because they are disjoint events.", "The probability of a car being Red or Blue is P(R) U P(B) = P(R) + P(B)", "All of the cars that are large are drawn in the green circle:", "In the image above, there were only large red cars. This is marked as yellow in the image and shows the section where the red circle crosses the green circle.", "The probability of a car being Red and Large is:", "This is known as the Bayes Rule which is one of the fundamental rules to remember in data science.", "The \u201c|\u201d here means \u201cgiven that\u201d. It implies that the probability of a car being red and large is the probability of a car being red multiplied by the probability of a car being large given that it\u2019s red. P(L|R) is the conditional probability.", "This is a very powerful formula which we can use to build statistical inference in machine learning algorithms.", "Hence, I will dedicate a full article on it.", "Before I explain what expectation is, I wanted to illustrate the concept of the median first.", "If we take a set of numbers, sort them so that they are ordered and calculate a CDF then the median between an interval (a, b) is calculated as:", "This formula will give us the midpoint, the index of the collection, which is the median. Note: a and b are the indexes of a collection and not the actual\u00a0elements\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0collection e.g. in a set {1,5,8, 10}, the index of 5 is 2 and the index of 10 is 4. Subsequently, the median of intervals (2,4) is 3. The midpoint 3 points to the value of 8.", "The expectation is the mean. It is calculated by summing the probability by the events: \u2211 \u2093 p\u2093(x)", "If the random variable is continuous then the expectation is \u222b xf(x)dx,", "If we multiply an observable with a constant then the new expectation is the constant multiplied by the original Expectation:", "If we add two observables together then their joint expectation is:", "Two observables are independent if their intersection does not contain any element. Therefore the two observables are not correlated with each other and their joint expectation is simply multiplying their expectations together:", "If the two observables are not independent then we need to take their covariance into account.", "A random variable can move in any direction. Standard deviation measures the deviation of the random variable from its mean or expectation. The variance is the square of standard deviation.", "If the two observables are independent then there is no co-movement and their covariance is 0. The variance of a constant is 0.", "Once we know the expectation, we can calculate the variance as:", "The covariance of the two random variables X and Y is:", "We can also calculate covariance as:", "There are some important notes to know about covariance:", "If we take two observables, X and Y, and add a constant to each of them and multiply them with a constant then the covariance will change as follows:", "Note that b and d completely disappeared as they did not modify the variance of X or Y.", "If the two observables are not independent then when we add the two observables together then their joint variance will become:", "Here, the covariance is used as the two variables were dependent and correlated with each other.", "Let\u2019s move on to the core of probability theory. I can promise you that so far, we have learnt the basics of the probability subject which a data scientist must know.", "Every data scientist who has spent time evaluating data and performing features engineering must have come across the following terms; Gaussian distribution, normal distribution, binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, exponential distribution and so on.", "This section will explain what these probability distributions are.", "A random variable has a probability distribution. What it means is that the distribution of a random variable X is the collection of probabilities for all subsets of X.", "Firstly, knowing the probability distribution of a random variable is an extremely powerful tool because it can help you estimate the movements of a variable.", "Furthermore, multiple random variables can have the same probability distribution. This is interesting because if there are two random variables that we can measure (observe) that have the same distribution then we can use the first variable to understand the behaviour of the other variable and consider it as a proxy of each other. We can hence build far superior models. It is important to note that we cannot assume that the two observables are identical and hence it is crucial to evaluate and understand the behaviours of variables.", "If we record the outcomes of a random variable along with its probabilities then we can build a probability distribution.", "Once we have the possible set of outcomes, we can compute their probabilities and then calculate the distributions of the probabilities. From the probability distribution, we can compute a probability distribution function.", "A distribution function must follow the following properties:", "A probability distribution has its own shape, behaviour and properties. I will explain the most commonly used distributions in data science projects.", "A random variable X has a uniform distribution if the probability measure is the same for all of the events. It is also known as the rectangular distribution because all of the events have a constant probability.", "Formally, if the observable is discrete then the probability density function can be written as:", "n is the size of the set.", "For example, if the variable is a dice then n is 6 and if the random variable is a coin then n is 2.", "A fair coin can be in one of the two states; heads and tails. Each state has a 50% probability of occurring. Therefore a fair coin has a uniform distribution.", "If the observable is continuous then the probability density function between the two intervals a and b can be written as:", "b is the maximum and a is the minimum point.", "Hence the distribution is defined by the two parameters: minimum and maximum", "Let me explain the Uniform Distribution with an example.", "Let\u2019s consider that we are measuring the average height of 5-year-olds in a city. Let\u2019s also consider that the height is uniformly distributed from 0 to 3 feet.", "The probability that a 5-year-olds height will be from 1 to 2 feet is going to be:", "Most of the continuous random variables have an exponential distribution when we want to model the time elapsed between the occurrence of events.", "The exponential distribution revolves around a rate parameter \u03bb. This is the value which informs us about the rate at which an event occurs. For example, if one red car drives past us every 10 minutes then the rate of a red car driving past us is 1/10 per minute.", "Therefore \u03bb tells us about the rate between events in a unit of time.", "The exponential distribution is for continuous random variables.", "When a random variable has an exponential distribution then its distribution function is:", "The exponential distribution is memory less and it does not depend on the past.", "It is also worth noting that:", "One of the most important and well-known distribution is the normal distribution. It appears in the Central Limit Theorem. It is also known as the bell-shaped curve.", "A normal distribution is simple to explain. The reasons are:", "The normal distribution is also known as the Gaussian distribution. It\u2019s density is dependent on two parameters: mean and its variance.", "The standard normal distribution is N(0,1). It means that the mean of the random variable with standard normal distribution is 0 and its variance is 1.", "It\u2019s important to note the following properties of the normal distribution:", "If you want to learn more about the normal distribution then read this article:", "Assume we want to flip a coin. The result could either be Heads or Tails. If the probability of getting Heads is p then the probability of getting a Tails is 1-p. The value of p is always 0 < p < 1", "A random variable that can take one of the two possible states is considered of having a Bernoulli distribution. For the sake of generalisation, we can refer to the two possible states as Success or Failure. Success refers to the state when our target event has occurred and Failure is when our target has not occurred.", "A Bernoulli distribution has a parameter p:", "The expectation is p and the variance is p(1 - p)", "Let me explain Bernoulli distribution with an example. Assume that there is a 10% probability that a counterparty will default. It implies that there is a 90% chance that the counterparty will not default.", "This is a Bernoulli distribution as the counterparty can take one of the two possible states. In this instance, the value of p is 0.1.", "Subsequently, the variance of the distribution is:", "One of the most commonly used distribution is Binomial Distribution. It is very similar to Bernoulli distribution. The difference is that we can consider Bernoulli distribution as a special case of Binomial distribution.", "As an instance, if we want to measure default of n counterparties where each counterparty can be in one of the two possible states (Default or Not Default), all of the counterparties have the same probability of default (p) and they are independent then the distribution of the variable is going to have a Binomial Distribution.", "To simplify, Bernoulli distribution as a special case of a Binomial distribution where n is 1.", "Consider that there are n independent random variables and each variable has a Bernoulli distribution with the same parameter p, then if we were to add the variables then their sum will be a Binomial distribution with parameters n and p.", "The expectation is np and Variance is np(1-p)", "The geometric distribution is really interesting. Again it is somewhat related to the Binomial distribution. This distribution is normally encountered in variables where the experiment is about counting the number of times we do not see the target event until the target event is encountered.", "Let me elaborate. Let\u2019s assume we want to test whether a counterparty has defaulted or not. If we start recording the number of counterparties that have defaulted until we encounter the first counterparty that has not defaulted then the variable would follow the geometric distribution. It\u2019s important to note that in this instance, the default of counterparties is considered to be independent of each other.", "Geometric distribution and exponential distributions are related and we can see exponential distribution as a continuous version of the geometric distribution.", "The probability distribution function of geometric distribution is:", "It is very similar to the exponential distribution; think of it as the discrete version of the exponential distribution.", "The Poisson distribution is closely linked to the Exponential distribution. Poisson distribution always involves a time dimension. Poisson distribution can help us understand when the independent events are going to occur in the future.", "As an instance, if we want to measure when we will see a red car driving past us or when a counterparty will default then the random variables follow a Poisson distribution.", "Poisson distribution is discrete. The distribution revolves around a parameter \u03bb which tells us the average number of successes per unit of time.", "If a random variable X exists that has a mean \u03bb then its probability distribution is:", "The expectation of the random variable X is \u03bb and the variance is \u03bb.", "The sum of two independent Poisson distributions is also Poisson.", "The field of data science revolves around probability and statistics.
