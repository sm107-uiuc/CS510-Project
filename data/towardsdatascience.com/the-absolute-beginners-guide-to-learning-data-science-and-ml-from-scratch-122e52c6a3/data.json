All your fears and worries are valid, it is very safe to have questions about learning a new technology especially if you are transitioning from another field. In this story, I will address all the major things I know would probably be bothering you and outline a learning path for you to learn effectively and make the best out of what you learn so you can be a quality data scientist, AI, or ML engineer.", "Enrolling in a school is by far the most preferred form of learning data science and machine learning. It guides you on a carefully written curriculum and learning path and helps you achieve your goals of becoming a data scientist or ML engineer. Aside from gaining knowledge, learning from a school allows you to learn from experts and professionals in the industry and also get to meet like-minded people as your colleagues. This can greatly improve your network or ecosystem of professionals and make your job search even easier.", "Learning from a school can either be facilitated virtually or in-person. Whichever suits you and your schedule best should be the one you should opt for. However, it is worth pointing that learning in-person would most likely enforce your seriousness, reduce procrastination and help you develop more interest in the topic.", "A few specialized schools you can enroll in virtually and start learning Data science and AI on the go are Blossom Academy, FireBlaze AI School and Akademy.AI", "Actually, all education is self-education. A teacher is only a guide, to point out the way, and no school, no matter how excellent, can give you education. What you receive is like the outlines in a child\u2019s coloring book. You must fill in the colors yourself.", "Self-learning is the most common form of learning almost any form of technology in today\u2019s world. With the vast, free and accessible resources available over the internet today, self-learning has become the easiest and most inexpensive form of learning anything, especially programming, data science and machine learning.", "Although self-learning is one of the easiest and cheapest methods out there, it can also be known as the most unproductive method of learning data science. The reason is that, when you teach yourself how to code or learn to become a data scientist or ML engineer, you get entangled in so many resources to and you get lost in an endless loop of learning, commonly called \u2018tutorial hell\u2019.", "Self-learning can yield amazing results when one follows a clear, defined and guided learning path and sticks to his/her learning schedule. In an article I wrote a while ago, The self-learning path to becoming a data scientist, AI or ML engineer, I outlined a clear learning path and recommended some well-curated free and accessible resources that can assist anyone who seeks to learn data science, AI and ML engineer on their own, absolutely without any costs whatsoever. That article has received past 26,000 views and exceeds 30 hours of reading time in less than 3 months of its publishing and I have personally received so many success stories from people who followed the learning path and free resources I shared in that article. I believe it can still of importance to anyone who is looking to start teaching themselves data science, AI and ML.", "To desist from rewriting everything I wrote in that article, I\u2019m just going to give an outline of the learning path here in this story but I strongly advise that you spare a couple of minutes to go through that article for a more detailed discussion on how you can take on self-learning as a method of learning to become a data scientist, AI or ML engineer.", "Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.", "A mentor is any professional or expert in the industry of data science and ML and he/she contributes to your success concerning your prospective career and personality development necessary for a successful career as a data scientist or ML engineer.", "Mentor based learning is practically almost the same as self-learning with the only differences being that when you learn from a mentor, your mentor guides you on the right path to success, carefully making sure you don\u2019t make the mistakes he/she made on his journey to mastery in the field. Your mentor also teaches you stuff he wishes he learned earlier so you can achieve more in a shorter while and easier than he/she did.", "Notitia AI is a good platform for being trained from beginner to expert level in Data Science, Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning where you will be assigned a personal Mentor who will personally and professionally contribute to your growth in the chosen field. It is also the most affordable virtual training and mentorship program you can find out there.", "Notitia AI aims to raise the next generation of data scientists and enthusiasts to form an ecosystem of professionals who build AI-powered solutions and make data-driven decisions.

Choose a learning method that works perfectly for you and stick to a carefully made learning schedule. Be dedicated and keep consistent, seeking knowledge passionately always brings good results.", "Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or Twitter if you want to talk about something relating to this topic or Data science, AI or ML in general.
