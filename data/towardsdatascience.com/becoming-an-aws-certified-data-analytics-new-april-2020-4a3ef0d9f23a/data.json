As you may know, this certification is one of the latest AWS releases (April 2020) and comes to replace the AWS Certified Big Data \u2014 Specialty.

That makes approximately 80% of the exam, also if you have the Associate level certification it will be much easier to pass over the rest of the concepts.", "If I had to start from scratch, I would recommend spending more time learning the most important concepts, details, options, and components of the main data analytics technologies than practicing with practice tests that surely differ from those on the real exam. Furthermore, as of today, there are not many test exams available for this certification.", "I highly recommend doing the Solutions Architect Associate first for these reasons:", "These are the resources that I have relied on to pass the exam:", "Without a doubt, the course par excellence is Udemy\u2019s AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty 2020 (ex Big Data), created by Sundog Education by Frank Kane, Stephane Maarek | AWS Certified Solutions Architect & Developer Associate, Frank Kane", "With its over 12 hours of on-demand video, a comprehensive test exam, and unlimited access to its resources, it is the best guide and one of the best resources to follow for this exam.", "From my point of view, I think it is necessary to watch the videos twice. I listened on 2x speed and reviewed each lecture by skimming through the linked whitepapers and documentation on the resources section.", "Optional: You could also enroll in A Cloud Guru\u2019s AWS Big Data Specialty course for a high-level overview of all of the products and important concepts, as a starting point. For now, they have not launched the specific course for Data Analytics certification.", "Amazon has countless documents that refer to Data Analytics products. However, I would recommend these two papers within the Data Analytics Learning Path that help you to better understand the services that exist. In my case, I decided to read the Kinesis whitepaper as it is a technology with many details to remember and different implementation options, such as its producers, consumers, encryption and security, as well as inputs and outputs of these services.", "\u2014 Streaming Data Solutions on AWS with Amazon Kinesis (29 pages)", "This whitepaper discusses the evolution of analytics from batch to real-time. It describes how services such as Amazon Kinesis Streams, Amazon Kinesis Firehose, and Amazon Kinesis Analytics can be used to implement real- time applications, and provides common design patterns using these services.", "\u2014 Big Data Analytics Options on AWS (56 pages)", "This whitepaper helps architects, data scientists, and developers understand the big data analytics options available in the AWS cloud by providing an overview of services, with the following information: ideal usage patterns, cost model, performance, durability and availability, scalability and elasticity, interfaces and anti-patterns.", "\u2014 Exam Readiness: AWS Certified Data Analytics \u2014 Specialty (Free Course, 3 \u00bd hours)", "This course helps you prepare for the exam by exploring the exam\u2019s topic areas and familiarizing you with the question style and exam approach.", "In a very visual way, it allows you to understand each of the most important components of the exam, the most important details to remember and examples of questions that may appear on the exam. In addition, they include reference links to the main topics or issues that usually appear with these technologies.", "This training, from my point of view, is essential.

These questions help you imagine what the exam will look like and will allow you to assess the knowledge you are acquiring.", "In my case, in addition, I bought the Whizlabs practice tests. These questions do not follow the model nor are they consistent with the official exam questions. However, they help you explore new areas of knowledge that you may not have seen before, considered important, or not covered in such detail in previous materials. The good thing about Whizlabs is that it justifies the answer with new information links and support material.", "A quick snapshot of popular analytics analytic services that you should be familiar for this exam:", "Take this approach to answer the questions:", "That\u2019s all folks.
