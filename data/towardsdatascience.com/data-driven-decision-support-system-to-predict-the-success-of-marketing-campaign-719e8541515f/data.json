We hear lot of buzzwords e.g. BI, Decision Science, Data Science etc. etc.; at broad level but they all support the same goal of using tools & techniques to turn data into business insights. Here, we will analyze a large set of over 100 features related with bank\u2019s clients, identified product and social-economic attributes.", "Steady revenue loss forced a famous Bank to relook at their internal processes and conduct root-cause analysis. One of the reason they found is that, the clients are not opting for term deposit as frequently as they used to. Therefore, the bank would like to identify existing clients, those having higher chance to go for a term deposit and bank wants to focus the marketing effort on such clients.", "During modeling phase, based on the business knowledge, we had performed a semi-automated feature selection to reduce the dimensionality to 17 relevant features for further analysis.", "Feature engineering is the key to Data Mining. In addition to the commonly used bank client and product attributes, here I have used social and economic indicators in the features. The entire data mining process is not shown to keep this simple. After pre-processing, the statistical summary of the data set \u2014", "The mean balance is 1,528.53, but the Standard Deviation (std) is 3,225.41 so we can understand through this that the balance is heavily distributed across the data-set. The duration is highly correlated in whether a potential client will buy a term deposit.", "Average Campaign Duration is 372 (~371.99), let\u2019s see if clients that were above this average were more likely to open a term deposit. So, duration column need to be dropped; moreover, duration is obtained after the call is made to the potential client so if the target client has never received calls this feature is not that useful.", "People who were above the duration status, were more likely to open a term deposit. 77% of the group that is above average in duration opened term deposits while those that were below average 32% opened term deposit accounts (it should be 77/33 or 78/32). Obviously, a good idea would be to target people who are in the above average category.", "We can do clustering and data analysis to find out, historically which variable has most important influence on term deposit such as-", "I will skip all the analysis in this article to keep it simple. I will do a simplistic method for easy understanding by drawing a correlation plot to check which variables that are correlated to deposit.", "We can see from above that, \u201chousing\u201d and \u201cloan\u201d are the two most important having -20% and -11% correlation with deposit respectively. We will focus on \u201cloan\u201d here; let\u2019s look into the loan distribution pattern.", "You may visit here to find other use case of skewed data set. Here, we want to make sure that our training and test set contains the same ratio of 87% \u201cno\u201d and 13% \u201cyes\u201d.", "To avoid over-fitting stratified sampling or cross validation is important, however, we must make sure that at least the features that have the greatest influence on the label (whether a potential client will open a term deposit or not) are equally distributed.", "Here we split the data into training and test sets and implement a stratified.", "Now that train and test sets are ready, let\u2019s check which classification algorithm would fit our case by training 8 models as below \u2014", "We see here, it is most likely that the DecisionTree Classifier and Random Forest classifiers are over-fitting since we get nearly perfect scores (100% and 99.62%) accuracy scores.", "If the data are intrinsically more complicated, we would never be able to fit a line to describe the data set well. The phenomena is called under-fitting. It does not have enough model flexibility to suitably account for all the features in the data; another way of saying this is that the model has high bias.", "If the model fit has enough flexibility to nearly perfectly account for all the features in the data and leads to over-fitting the data. Too much model flexibility ends up accounting for random errors as well as the underlying data distribution. Other way the model has high variance.", "We must employ cross-validation process to avoid this. The main purpose of this is to feed the overall pattern of the data to the model.", "We will go with Gradient Boosting with 84.51% score.", "This report shows a representation of the main classification metrics on a per-class basis.", "Classification report provides deeper intuition of the classifier behavior over global accuracy which can mask functional weaknesses in one class of a multi-class problem.", "The report displays the precision, recall, F1, and support scores for the model.", "To determine how good our model is, we need metrics, such true positive rate (TPR/ which is recall), false positive rate (FPR) and precision, which will vary with the threshold we choose to turn predicted probabilities into predicted classes (0 or 1).", "If we go over every possible threshold and compute these metrics, we can build both Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Precision-Recall (PR) curve for a given model.", "The discrimination threshold is the probability or score at which the positive class is chosen over the negative class. Generally, this is set to 50% but the threshold can be adjusted to increase or decrease the sensitivity to false positives or to other application factors.", "In the figure above we see the visualizer tuned to look for the optimal F1 score, which is annotated as a threshold of 0.41. If the probability >0.41 then the positive class is selected, otherwise, the negative class is. However, this threshold may not be the optimal threshold: often there is an inverse relationship between precision and recall with respect to a discrimination threshold. By adjusting the threshold of the classifier, it is possible to tune the F1 score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) to the best possible fit or to adjust the classifier to behave optimally for the specific application. Classifiers are tuned by considering the following metrics:", "We see that, the plot tuned to look for the optimal F1 score, which is annotated as a threshold of 0.40. The model is run multiple times over multiple train/test splits in order to account for the variability of the model with respect to the metrics (shown as the fill area around the median curve).", "If we graph the fraction of true-positive results (number of true positives / number with deposit) against the fraction of false-positive results (number of false positives / number without deposit) for a series of cut-off points, it will generate an ROC curve. The curve graphically depicts the trade-off between the sensitivity and specificity when the cut-off point is adjusted", "ROC measures the classifier\u2019s predictive quality and visualizes the trade-off between the model\u2019s sensitivity and specificity. The TP rate plotted on the Y axis and the FP rate on the X axis on both a global average and per-class basis. The ideal point is therefore the top-left corner of the plot: FP are zero and TP are one. This leads to AUC, which is the relationship between FP and TP. The higher the AUC, the better the model is. However, it is also important to inspect the \u201csteepness\u201d of the curve, as this describes the maximization of the TP rate while minimizing the FP rate.", "Now we can tell that, if we are willing to accept a FPR of 20%, we\u2019ll get a TPR above 60%.", "Precision-Recall curves metric used to evaluate a classifier\u2019s quality. The precision-recall curve shows the trade-off between precision, a measure of result relevancy, and recall, a measure of how many relevant results are returned. A large area under the curve represents both high recall and precision, the best case scenario for a classifier, showing a model that returns accurate results for the majority of classes it selects.", "In the figure above we can see the precision plotted on the y-axis against the recall on the x-axis. The larger the filled in area, the stronger the classifier is. The red line annotates the average precision, a summary of the entire plot computed as the weighted average of precision achieved at each threshold such that the weight is the difference in recall from the previous threshold. Here it says that, our model predicts with average precision rate of 88%.", "Learning curve shows the relationship of the training score versus the cross validated test score for an estimator with a varying number of training samples. It is a tool to find out how much we benefit from adding more training data and whether the estimator suffers more from a variance error or a bias error.", "The training and cross-validation scores converge together as more data is added, therefore the model may not benefit from more data. The curves are plotted with the mean scores, however variability during cross-validation is shown with the shaded areas that represent a standard deviation above and below the mean for all cross-validations. We can see that, the training score and the cross-validation score are both not very good at the end. However, the shape of the curve shows that, the training score is very high at the beginning (over 92%) and decreases to nearly 86% and the cross-validation score is very low at the beginning (close to 82%) and increases to nearly 85%. So, we see that training and validations scores are almost equal in the end. Adding more training samples will most likely increase generalization.", "\u201cCumulative gains and lift curves are a simple and useful approach to understand what returns we are likely to get from running a marketing campaign and how many customers we should contact, based on targeting the most promising customers using a predictive model\u201d", "Lift/cumulative gains chart used for evaluating the results because there\u2019s a cost to action each result. The information can also be used to decide how many times to call, balancing the marketing costs with the expected returns from the resulting call. There is a cost associated (direct & indirect) with each target customer and therefore objective is to maximize the number of respondents that we acquire from the telemarketing. The reality is that the mining model most likely falls between two extremes; between a random guess and a perfect prediction. Any improvement from the random guess is considered to be lift.", "Using the fitted model we can compare the observed outcomes from the historical marketing campaign, i.e., who responded and who did not, with the predicted probabilities of responding for each customer contacted in that campaign. In practice, the model is fitted to a subset of the data and use this model to predict the probability of responding for each customer in a \u201chold-out\u201d sample to get a more accurate assessment of how the model would perform for new customers.", "A chart can be prepared by sorting the customers by their predicted probabilities, in decreasing order from highest (closest to one) to lowest (closest to zero). Splitting the customers into equally sized segments, we create groups containing the same numbers of customers. So, those customers who we predict are most likely to respond are in decile group 1, the next most likely in decile group 2, and so on. Examining each of the decile groups, we can produce a decile summary summarizing the numbers and proportions of customers and respondents in each decile.", "From the decile summary, we can also calculate the cumulative gains provided by the model. We compare the cumulative % of the customers who are respondents with the cumulative % of customers contacted in the marketing campaign across the groups. This is the \u201cGain\u201d in targeting a given % of the total number of customers using the highest modeled probabilities of responding, rather than targeting them at random.", "This graph tells how well the model segregating respondents from non-respondents. Here, the population is divided into deciles, under a decreasing order of their predictive probability for success.", "The diagonal dashed line represents the results of random guessing, and is the baseline against which to evaluate lift. We get two additional lines: one line shows the ideal results for the training data set, and the second line shows the actual lift, or improvement in results, for the model. Here, the ideal line for the filtered model is shown in Class 1, and the line for actual lift in Class 0. We can tell from the chart that the ideal line peaks at around 60%, meaning that we could reach 100% of our targeted customers by sending a mailing to only 60% of the total population.", "Depending on the costs associated with sending each call and the expected revenue from each respondent, the cumulative gain chart can be used to decide upon the optimum number of customers to contact.", "We can also look at the Lift achieved by targeting increasing % of the customer base, ordered by decreasing probability. The Lift is simply the ratio of the % of respondents reached to the % of customers contacted. So, a lift of 1 is equivalent to no gain compared with contacting customers at random. Whereas a lift of 2, for example, corresponds with there being twice the number of respondents reached compared with the number we\u2019d expect by contacting the same number of customers at random. So, we may have only contacted 40% of the customers, but we may have reached 80% of the respondents in the customer base. Therefore, we have doubled the number of respondents reached by targeting this group compared with contacting a random sample of customers.", "These figures can be displayed in a lift curve. Ideally, we want the lift curve to extend as high as possible into the top-left corner of the figure, indicating that we have a large lift associated with contacting a small proportion of customers.", "Now, as our predictive model is ready, let\u2019s find out the features influencing the result of a Term Deposit Subscription. This can be done using DecisionTree, XGB or RandomForest etc. I have used Decision Tree for this.", "The top three most important features for our classifier are-", "Now that we have done with all the analysis and predictive modeling, time to devise a marketing strategy-", "Your home for data science.
