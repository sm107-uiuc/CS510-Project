The allegory will still work, but I want a fancy dress. With pockets!", "So, you need a new dress. You\u2019re of course just predicting what kind of dress will feel good on New Year\u2019s Eve, because it\u2019s only June.", "You need a model that you can use to predict y based on X.", "Like we said, it\u2019s only June, but this party is going to be v lit, as the kids say. You need to order the dress ASAP. So, while you\u2019re not sure how you\u2019ll look and feel in December, you\u2019re basing it off of your body now.", "Split the dataset into training data and test data.

She forms the dress based on your measurements.", "You fit your model on the training data. You form the model based on X_train.", "The dress arrives about a week later. You try it on to see how it feels. Unsurprisingly, it feels great. That\u2019s because you haven\u2019t changed much in a week, silly.", "You can transform your training data, but the model will likely fit your training data almost if not exactly perfectly. That\u2019s because you just fit your model on it, silly.", "It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve! After six months, your body is different than it was in July. You try the dress on, and it doesn\u2019t feel or look as good as it did the first time you tried it on.", "You transform the test data. This is data we have withheld, so it\u2019s different from the training data that the model is based on. We transform the test data, and it doesn\u2019t predict everything perfectly.", "The dress is PERFECT \u2014 if you still had your July body. When the tailor made it, she made it too specifically for your measurements as they were then, and she didn\u2019t allow for any changes. So, now, whether it\u2019s too tight or falling off you, the dress isn\u2019t wearable on New Year\u2019s Eve.", "The model generated predictions that were great for the training set, but whether it\u2019s overshooting or undershooting on its prediction, it is not predicting the test data target very well. It was tuned too specifically for your training data, and it isn\u2019t useable as a model.", "Since your dress doesn\u2019t fit you, you ponder getting a new one that is one-size fits-all. It\u2019s a total toss-up whether it will fit you at New Year\u2019s because it didn\u2019t even necessarily fit you in July.", "An underfit model does not predict the training data well. It\u2019s a total toss-up whether it will predict the test data well.", "You decide to get the dress altered. That just means that the tailor will take it in or let it out in different areas where it REALLY doesn\u2019t fit you. There are different kinds of alterations you can get.", "To penalize the model where it has large amounts of error, you decide to use regularization. There are a few common ones like Lasso and Ridge.", "At the party, a bunch of people tell you that you look great in your dress and that it fits you like a dream. It\u2019s true. You look great! But here\u2019s the thing. You paid a bunch of money for the tailor, the dress, the alterations\u2026 how do you know if it is worth it? How will you evaluate whether this is a GOOD DRESS? Was spending all that time any better than just borrowing a dress from your friend Shelby?", "Often, the model\u2019s accuracy is a skewed number because we disregard the accuracy of a model that would randomly guess and get the same prediction. When evaluating your predictive model, the evaluation metric should be based on your business use case.", "There are a lot of different ways to extend or change this allegory, but I hope it\u2019s been a helpful one in realizing the difference and usefulness of the fit and transform Python methods.", "Don\u2019t you wish that you could just get a dress made of a material that takes your curves into consideration and immediately fits, sort of like those bubble shirts shirts from the nineties?", "Fit transform is good for instances where you are going to immediately form and use the object that you\u2019re fitting to, which is why it\u2019s uncommon when your object is a model but common when you use StandardScaler or other data preparation objects.", "Your home for data science.
