There are quite a lot of methods to do that.", "\u2014 First one is using statistical values like mean, median. However, none of these guarantees unbiased data, especially if there are many missing values.", "Mean is most useful when the original data is not skewed, while the median is more robust, not sensitive to outliers, and thus used when data is skewed.", "In a normally distributed data, one can get all the values that are within 2 standard deviations from the mean. Next, fill in the missing values by generating random numbers between (mean \u2014 2 * std) & (mean + 2 * std)", "\u2014 Second. Using a linear regression.

Hot-deck: Copying values from other similar records. This is only useful if you have enough available data. And, it can be applied to numerical and categorical data.", "One can take the random approach where we fill in the missing value with a random value. Taking this approach one step further, one can first divide the dataset into two groups (strata), based on some characteristic, say gender, and then fill in the missing values for different genders separately, at random.", "In sequential hot-deck imputation, the column containing missing values is sorted according to auxiliary variable(s) so that records that have similar auxiliaries occur sequentially. Next, each missing value is filled in with the value of the first following available record.", "What is more interesting is that \ud835\udc58 nearest neighbour imputation, which classifies similar records and put them together, can also be utilized. A missing value is then filled out by finding first the \ud835\udc58 records closest to the record with missing values. Next, a value is chosen from (or computed out of) the \ud835\udc58 nearest neighbours. In the case of computing, statistical methods like mean (as discussed before) can be used.", "Some argue that filling in the missing values leads to a loss in information, no matter what imputation method we used.", "That\u2019s because saying that the data is missing is informative in itself, and the algorithm should know about it. Otherwise, we\u2019re just reinforcing the pattern already exist by other features.", "This is particularly important when the missing data doesn\u2019t happen at random. Take for example a conducted survey where most people from a specific race refuse to answer a certain question.", "Missing numeric data can be filled in with say, 0, but has these zeros must be ignored when calculating any statistical value or plotting the distribution.", "While categorical data can be filled in with say, \u201cMissing\u201d: A new category which tells that this piece of data is missing.", "Missing values are not the same as default values. For instance, zero can be interpreted as either missing or default, but not both.", "Missing values are not \u201cunknown\u201d. A conducted research where some people didn\u2019t remember whether they have been bullied or not at the school, should be treated and labelled as unknown and not missing.", "Every time we drop or impute values we are losing information.

Any data value that lies more than (1.5 * IQR) away from the Q1 and Q3 quartiles is considered an outlier.", "Outliers are innocent until proven guilty. With that being said, they should not be removed unless there is a good reason for that.", "For example, one can notice some weird, suspicious values that are unlikely to happen, and so decides to remove them. Though, they worth investigating before removing.", "It is also worth mentioning that some models, like linear regression, are very sensitive to outliers. In other words, outliers might throw the model off from where most of the data lie.", "These errors result from having two or more values in the same row or across datasets that contradict with each other.", "For example, if we have a dataset about the cost of living in cities. The total column must be equivalent to the sum of rent, transport, and food.", "Similarly, a child can\u2019t be married. An employee\u2019s salary can\u2019t be less than the calculated taxes.", "The same idea applies to related data across different datasets.", "When done, one should verify correctness by re-inspecting the data and making sure it rules and constraints do hold.", "For example, after filling out the missing data, they might violate any of the rules and constraints.", "It might involve some manual correction if not possible otherwise.", "Reporting how healthy the data is, is equally important to cleaning.", "As mentioned before, software packages or libraries can generate reports of the changes made, which rules were violated, and how many times.", "In addition to logging the violations, the causes of these errors should be considered. Why did they happen in the first place?.", "If you made it that far, I am happy you were able to hold until the end.
