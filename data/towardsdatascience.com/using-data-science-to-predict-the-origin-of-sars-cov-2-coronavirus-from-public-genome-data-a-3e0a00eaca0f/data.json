Experts think bats are the source of the virus. How did they make such a conclusion?", "Traditionally, most medical scientists will use traditional bioinformatics tools such as BLAST sequence alignments. However, in this article, I will show how we can analyze the coronavirus genomes from a data science perspective. Specifically, we will use data science methods to predict the origin of the COVID-19 by comparing its genome sequences with other coronaviruses that have been infected on other animals such as Chicken, Cattle, Duck, and Bats. Based on our analysis, we will demonstrate how bats are shown to have the highest genome sequence similarity when compared to the other animals.", "The genome sequence of the 2019 Coronavirus is made available to the public via the U.S National Library of Medicine website ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus). In fact, there is an \u201cupdate\u201d alert that you can spot immediately at the top when you visit the web page.", "You will notice that there are 2 types of main types of viral genome sequences: nucleotide and protein. Here, we will specifically analyze the nucleotide sequences of 4 animals, namely, chicken, bat, cattle, and duck. We will compare them with the 2019 coronavirus nucleotide sequences collected from infected people. You can also use the same methods learned here to analyze the protein sequences as well.", "The main goal of this analysis is to determine the likely origin of the virus. In practice, we will need to scan the COVID-19 coronavirus genome with all viruses that circulate among animals. However, due to the limited computing resources, we will only analyze coronaviruses that circulate from chicken, bat, cattle, and duck only.", "First, let\u2019s download the nucleotide sequences of the COVID-19 coronavirus by clicking the nucleotide link from the NCBI virus web page.", "The web page is self-exploratory to use. You can observe that the \u201cSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d is automatically selected under the Virus section of the Refine Results Filter. Further, there are two different sequence types: complete or refseq. For this walkthrough, choose complete sequence type from the nucleotide sequence type section. Next, click on the Download blue button at the top right of the page. The genome sequence will be downloaded to your machine as .fasta file format.", "Once you\u2019ve downloaded the sequence data, let\u2019s open it on your favorite text editor to see what the genome sequence looks like.", "You can observe that the first line starts with \u2018>\u2019 that denotes a single-line description of the virus. At this point of writing, there are are 34 COVID-19 coronavirus samples that have been made available at the NCBI virus database.", "Next, let\u2019s download the coronavirus nucleotide sequences of the four animals (i.e., chicken, cattle, duck, and bat).", "To do this, remove the COVID-19 coronavirus option (i.e. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) from the Virus section of the Refine Results, and search for Coronaviradae instead. Coronaviradae is the scientific name for all coronaviruses that circulate among animals. Selecting this option will give you a list of nucleotide sequence samples of all types of coronavirus family that have been collected by the medical scientists in the past. Interestingly, you can see from the search result that the first collected genome sample of coronavirus was collected in 1983!", "You may start by collecting the chicken nucleotide genome sequence first. The scientific name for chicken is gallus gallus. Proceed to the Host section at the Refine Results, and search for Gallus gallus (chicken). Once selecting the option, the search result list will be updated and you may click on the Download button once again to download the complete nucleotide sequence of the chicken.", "Repeat these steps for the remaining 3 animals: 1) cattle (bos taurus), 2) duck (anatidae), and 3) bat (chiropter).", "Our first task is to read the COVID-19 and the other four animal genome sequences from the sequence data fasta files and place them onto the pandas dataframe. In achieving this, we will need to extract only the sequence characters (e.g., ATTAAAG) and ignore all the single-line description which begins with \u2018>\u2019. The following code identifies each nucleotide sequence by \u2018>\u2019 and extracts the sequence characters in between two \u2018>\u2019 symbols. The extracted sequence characters are then appended sequentially into a list. The list contains the whole string for each animal genome.", "Next, we will need to generate features from the strings that contain our sequence characters. Since the sequence is represented as a series of alphabetical characters, we will need to split the sequence characters into small tokens. For example, a token with 2 characters only, a token with 3 characters, 4 characters only, etc. Furthermore, we will need to convert the tokens into a numerical representation format so that we can feed them into the machine learning algorithm for prediction. One common way is to apply the bag-of-words data representation that computes the frequency/occurrences of each token. It keeps track of two important information: A vocabulary of sequence characters and the number of occurrences for each token.", "To apply both n-grams and bag-of-words together, we can use the CountVectorizer API from the scikit-learn machine learning library.", "For this walkthrough, we will only set the minimum n-grams to start from 2 to 4 sequence of tokens. For example, 2-gram has at most 2 characters (e.g., AT), 3-gram (e.g., ACG), and 4-gram (e.g., ACTT).", "Once the data has been transformed into numerical values as features, we will need to label them for prediction.", "Here you can see that each fasta sequence file is assigned with its own label (i.e., chicken, duck, cattle, and bats). The labeling is done at the end of the data transformation process.", "If you\u2019ve done everything correctly, you should be able to view all the features as numerical values in pandas dataframe format.", "Having all the sequences represented in dataframe format, we can explore the % distribution of our coronavirus datasets. We can observe that 64% of our datasets are nucleotide sequences of the chicken, 31% from the bats, and the remaining 4% and 1% from the cattle and duck, respectively.", "We are now ready to build the predictive model by applying our labeled nucleotide datasets to the machine learning algorithm. In this case, we are going to use the XGBoost Gradient Boosting algorithm to build our predictive model.", "Using the model we built, we can further analyze to determine which regions of the nucleotide sequences have the most influential factors in determining which sequences belong to which animals. We can observe that \u201cCWG\u201d, \u201cAAAY\u201d, and \u201cAAC\u201d are the top 3 sequence regions that differentiate the genomes of the 4 animals.", "Data Transformation and Text Representation for the COVID-19 coronovirus", "Next, we need to load the COVID-19 nucleotide sequence file to our program in order to do prediction.", "Similar to the animal coronaviruses sequences, we are required to perform data transformation and numeric representation for the COVID-19 coronavirus. Both n-gram and Bag-of-words algorithms will need to be applied but additional steps are also necessary. We will explain these steps in detail.", "First, we will load the nucleotide of the COVID-19 coronavirus from our Fasta file.", "Since we are going to do the prediction (instead of building model), we can drop the target label", "Unfortunately, the features generated from the COVID-19 will not be 100% identical to the other coronavirus of our animals. We can observe that the number of features of the COVID-19 coronavirus is 409, which is a lot less when compared to the 1786 features of animal coronaviruses. Due to this mismatch, we are required to perform another 2 types of data transformation before the dataset is fully compatible with our prediction model.", "This means discovering the features that are in the animals\u2019 nucleotide sequences, but they do NOT have a presence in the COVID-19 coronavirus. Once we found such features, we will need to populate them as \u201cunknown\u201d in our prediction dataset.", "We can see that the features \u201cAAAM\u201d, \u201cAAR\u201d, and \u201cAAAY\u2019 are some of the features that we found in the coronaviruses, but they do not exist in the COVID-19 coronavirus.", "It is a requirement to add these features so it matches with our training datasets. Therefore, we can populate the values as unknown. Since the features have to be in numeric form, we will use \u2018-999\u2019 numeric value to represent the \u201cunknown\u201d.", "2. What are the New Features of COVID-19 that never existed in other types of animal coronavirus?", "Most importantly, we will also need to find features that exist in COVID-19 but do not exist in the training datasets. Once we found such features, we will need to remove those features to match them with our training datasets.", "We can see that \u201cAWGC\u201d, \u201cCS\u201d, \u201cCST\u201d, and \u201cCSTG\u201d are some of the new nucleotide regions of COVID-19 virus that have never existed before in the coronaviruses of the four animals.", "After removing all these features from the predicted datasets, our prediction datasets finally match our training datasets.", "We are now ready to predict the likely origin of the COVID-19 coronavirus! The next step is to predict the likely source of origin of the 34 samples of the COVID-19 coronavirus we collected. This can be done easily using the XGBoost predict API.", "Based on the predicted values, we can see that our model predicts all the 36 samples as Bat. Not even a single of the sample was predicted as other animals. To analyze this further, we will use the predict_proba API of the XGBoost to obtain the probability of each prediction.", "Based on the predicted probability, we can clearly see that the predicted probability of bat is extremely high with predicted values of 0.957. This implies that there is a 95.7% chance that the origin of the COVID-19 virus is from bats, while there is only a 4.1% probability that it comes from the duck. The probability that the virus comes from either cattle or chicken is only 0.1%. Therefore, we can strongly conclude that bats are the likely origin of the 2019 novel coronavirus.", "As mentioned at the beginning of the article, BLAST (basic local alignment search tool)[1] is typically the standard method that allows scientists to compare differences of nucleotides or proteins sequences. This program is publicly available here: https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. From the website, you can upload your SARS-CoV-2 sequences as FASTA format, and the program will query your sequences against its database to find any similar sequences that match your query. Unlike our approaches, BLAST does not apply any predictive models on features, but rather it uses a heuristic search algorithm. One major benefit of our predictive approach is that it may discover more insight and it could find the hidden patterns that the standard heuristic search normally unable to uncover.", "[1] R. M.
