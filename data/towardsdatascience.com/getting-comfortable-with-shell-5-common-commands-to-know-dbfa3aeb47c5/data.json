It\u2019s understandable to prefer tools with pretty user interfaces. Before we look at shell, what is shell exactly?", "Let\u2019s keep it simple, by starting with how we use computers. Think of your computer as a robot that\u2019s waiting for instructions. For most of your needs, you use applications to get the computer to perform actions. For example, right now you are using an Internet Browser application (like Google Chrome) to read this article (unless you\u2019re on the Medium mobile app, which I definitely recommend downloading). The application is your method of communication with the computer. In other words, we don\u2019t talk to the computer and tell it verbally \u201cOpen the internet browser and go to Medium.\u201d We get the application to do it. Applications serve an important role \u2014 they translate what we want to do into understandable instructions for the computer. Different applications serve different roles. Google Chrome is used to browse the internet, Microsoft Word to type essays, and Finder/File Explorer to access files.", "Shell is a direct way for us to communicate with the computer and make it perform actions. In technical speak, it is a command interpreter and programming language. Instead of going through an application like Finder to view your documents, you can use shell to directly instruct the computer to show your documents. This direct channel of communication with the computer gives us more power over what we want the computer to do.", "Now back to our point about shell being intimidating. Let\u2019s look at an example.", "Say you want to delete a file called myFile . Doing this on Finder (or File Explorer for PC) is easy and intuitive. You go to Finder, find myFile, right-click on the file, and select Move to Trash/Delete. Simple.", "When using the command line, it can seem more difficult and frightening, especially for first-time users. On a Mac, open Terminal (press command and the spacebar, and type Terminal, then press Enter). To delete myFile, you type code to go to your Documents, and then code to view your Documents to make sure myFile is there, and finally delete myFile with more code. See below.", "If you\u2019ve never opened the command line interface before (the command line interface is the program that you type shell commands into \u2014 Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows), you\u2019re probably intrigued at the gif above. Or intimidated. Or both. Here are three reasons why users prefer avoiding shell :", "You might already be convinced to avoid using the command line interface. But shell proves to be really powerful.", "If you\u2019re pursuing any job that involves coding (software developer, data engineer, data scientist, etc), you\u2019re likely going to use shell at some point in your career. Getting familiar with using shell will increase your productivity and show your team that you\u2019re experienced.", "For many developer jobs, if a candidate doesn\u2019t know how to use shell, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that they don\u2019t have much experience. As a data engineer/scientist, I\u2019m required use shell every single day.", "There are many tasks you can do on the command line that aren\u2019t as easy to do using standard applications like Finder. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re researching COVID-19 cases in Canada. To get the CSV file with the daily updated number of cases, you need to go to Canada\u2019s Public Health website and download the CSV file. If the file is updated every day at 6 PM, then you need to get the updated file daily. This means every day after 6 PM, you need to go to the website and download the file.", "Compare this to downloading the file in Shell. All you need to do is open Terminal, and type the following:", "Let\u2019s break down the code.curl is the command to download a file from a link (curl is short for Client URL). -O is an optional flag (we\u2019ll explore that soon) that tells the computer we want to save the file in the original name (O for Original). And finally we pass the download link. To summarize, we\u2019re telling the computer to download the file at the given link, and save the file with its original name, covid19.csv.", "That was quick! No need to open an internet browser, go to the link, and then scroll to the download button. Just type one line and you\u2019re done. You might be thinking, it\u2019s really not a big deal to go and download the file from the website. However, if your research requires you to download the file daily, you could use write a simple shell script (just once) that automates this daily task. So every day at 6:05 PM (or any time we specify in the script) the new daily file is in your Downloads folder. This already saves a couple of minutes of your day. Now imagine how much time you would save if you have multiple files you need to download daily.", "There are numerous additional benefits to using shell. But let\u2019s explore shell and briefly understand how to use it.", "Shell commands are used in the following manner:", "You don\u2019t need to master using the command line interface. If you try to learn it, you\u2019ll get overwhelmed. Plus, you\u2019ll most likely forget commands if you don\u2019t use them frequently. Here are five shell commands used often that you should know.", "Short for List, ls is the command to list a directory. If you type ls and press Enter, you\u2019ll get a list of files stored in the folder you\u2019re in.", "cd command is used to change the directory you\u2019re looking at. This is like clicking on a directory/folder using your mouse in Finder to look at its contents. For example, cd Documents will take you to your Documents directory. Using the previous command, if you type ls you can list what\u2019s in your Documents.", "Whenever you don\u2019t know how to use a command, or forget which flags to pass, use man. man will show you the help manual of a command that you pass as a parameter. Here we use man to list out how to use ls. Note, you can scroll through the manual by using your mouse, or pressing the spacebar. Every time you press space, the page will scroll down. When you\u2019re ready to leave the manual, press q for quit.", "rm is used to delete a file. It\u2019s important to note that rm will get rid of the file completely, not move it to Trash. To use rm, include the name of the file as a parameter. So to remove myFile, type rm myFile.", "mkdir will make a directory/folder. Pass the name of the directory as a parameter. To create myFolder, type mkdir myFolder.", "While this post introduces you to shell and common commands, I recommend taking an introductory course on shell to get a better understanding. You can find a bunch online. Just google \u201clearn shell.\u201d Two of my favourite shell courses are by DataCamp \u2014 Intro to Shell and Data Processing with Shell. Note, only the first chapter is free for these courses. And I\u2019m in no way affiliated with DataCamp, I just really benefit from their courses due to the interactive exercises.", "The fruits of your learning will show when you come across a task that you perform and want to automate it. Make sure to google how you can automate that task using shell. Chances are, someone has already asked the same question and got it answered. You\u2019ll be off to automating tasks that you never knew were so easy to automate. Till next time, happy learning!", "Your home for data science.
