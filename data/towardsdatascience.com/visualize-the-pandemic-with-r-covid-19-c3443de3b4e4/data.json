How bad did it get over the past few weeks? My phone is constantly vibrating with news from everywhere in the world: first from my hometown in China, and then the rest of Asia, Europe, and here in the US. More than half of New York has already stopped commuting. We\u2019ve replaced handshakes with fist bumps, and now, the new norm: social distancing. Five days ago on Mar 12, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Up to now, over 160,000 people from 142 countries across the world are confirmed with the disease. I feel obligated to create a tracker using R to account for this pandemic.", "I\u2019m using \u201cnCOV2019\u201d, an R package developed by Dr. Guangchuang Yu from Southern Medical University. This package allows us to access the latest data and historical data of cases of all countries, plot data on a map, and create various graphs. If you\u2019re an aspiring data scientist like me, feel free to install the package and create the visual with steps below:", "Basic functions for extracting data embedded in this package are:", "Keeping up to date is very important. Simply printing x and y will refresh the data.", "How to create an overview of the data? x[\u2018global\u2019,] returns the latest global data and automatically sorts by the number of confirmed cases.", "First, let\u2019s explore the overall structure of the current data. DataExplorer is an R package that can quickly build a visualization.", "Data obtained by the get_nCov2019() function includes 3 lists and 5 data frames. These are the latest data of confirmed patients, deaths and recovery cases in China and across the world.", "In order to study the trend, I focused on historical data. Historical data obtained by function load_nCov2019() is a list that includes 3 data frames. The first data frame named \u2018data\u2019 is Chinese historical data on the city level including numbers of confirmed cases, deaths, recovery and suspects. The second one named \u2018province\u2019 is aggregated data on the province level. The third data frame \u2018global\u2019 includes confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery of countries across the world. These historical data cover the time range from Feb 15 to the latest update.", "I used summary() function to get a statistical overview of the data. Globally, the median of confirmed cases is 30 while the mean is 1223.3. The reason is that outlier China has a large effect on the average confirmed cases.", "Visualization is another key method in exploratory data analysis. With visuals, we can easily observe the trend of the outbreak on the country and international level.", "It is already mentioned above how to get the top 10 countries with the most confirmed cases using x[\u2018global\u2019,]. We can also plot the line chart to see the case growth over time in each of these countries.", "This graph shows the top 10 countries with the most confirmed cases outside of China. Italy and Iran are the most infected countries and show exponential growth. Meanwhile, South Korea has flattened its curve and slowed down the growth with an effective containment strategy. Some other European countries along with the U.S. are also seeing hundreds and thousands of new cases.", "How about the overall situation across the globe? We can easily plot the global COVID-19 confirmed number map with plot()function.", "And what about the change over time? It would be a great idea if we can present the change in a gif. I plotted the global map for each day from 02\u201312 to 03\u201315 and created a gif with the R package magick.", "Now we can see how the coronavirus started in China and spread to most countries in the world in only a month.", "Next, we can predict the future growth of cases with existing data.", "Take the U.S. as an example.", "By looking at the graph, we can easily find that the cases grow at an exponential rate. In this case, we can apply log-linear regression to model and predict the growth. I only consider the time period with more than 100 confirmed cases for the following reasons:", "Our log-linear model is a very good fit for the dataset. The 0.9974 adjusted R-square indicates that 99% of the variance can be explained by our model.", "Now we can answer the question, how many cases will we have in 10 days?", "We can use forecast() to make predictions for the next 5 days (the h period is used to set the prediction period).", "The forecast result shows that, if the confirmed cases keep growing at an exponential rate, the number will double in 3 days, and reach almost 70,000 in 10 days.", "That\u2019s why taking precautions is so important. The infected number will grow suddenly after weeks of gradual growth, which initially seems containable. Medical capacity will be overwhelmed and healthcare workers will be in danger.", "It\u2019s essential we all start social distancing and avoid going to public places to slow down the growth rate before it\u2019s too late.", "Several major cities have shut down movie theatres to avoid crowd gathering. However, the wide majority of North American theaters remained open over the past weekend. Is Hollywood affected by the outbreak?", "I scraped daily box office data in 2019 and 2020 from boxofficemojo.com and compared the box office performance of this year to last year. I then plotted the result on a line chart.", "The result is astonishing. The box office plunged 60% compared with last year on Mar 5 and is almost 70% lower on Mar 17.", "According to Variety, ticket sales at North American theaters hit a low not seen in two decades.", "As more cities start to shut down movie theaters, we are likely to see a further dive into box office sales.", "I\u2019ve seen a lot of complaints on Twitter about people still going to bars and restaurants despite CDC\u2019s warning of avoiding crowd gathering. Is it true that people are still dining out as usual?", "I came across data of diner number published by Opentable, the online provider of restaurant reservations.", "The data shows year-over-year seated diners at restaurants on the OpenTable network across all channels: online reservations, phone reservations, and walk-ins. I plotted the change of diners from Feb 18 until today of six major cities in the U.S. and Europe: Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, London, Toronto, and Hamburg.", "The graph shows a rapid drop in restaurant customers since the second week of March in all 6 major cities. Every city has a diner number drop of more than 50%. In Los Angeles, the number has dropped more than 80% compared to last year.", "Data proves that people are dining out way less than usual, which is particularly harmful to the restaurant industry. Since most restaurants have a relatively low profit margin (3%-5%) and a high fixed cost ratio, a small percentage drop in revenue is enough to kill the business and send employees to the streets.", "Even though Covid-19 hasn\u2019t stopped foodies from heading to restaurants entirely, the odds are there will be fewer opportunities for them to do so in the coming weeks. Several food chains like McDonald\u2019s and Taco Bells are closing their dining services. Meanwhile, NYC and Ohio are closing all bars and restaurants in the area.", "Following the steps above, you can create the same, if not better, visuals as I did. While the coronavirus is still spreading globally, as a data enthusiast, you can also explore COVID-19 data with the \u201cnCOV2019\u201d R package, and help inform people with your findings.", "I would like to thank Alice Yang for providing constructive advice.", "Hi! My name is Xinhan Qian. I\u2019m a data enthusiast with expertise in data analytics and data visualization. I\u2019m currently pursuing my master\u2019s degree in Marketing Intelligence in New York City. I have been following the outbreak of coronavirus since it first started in Wuhan, China back in January. Last month I created a COVID-19 in the U.S. dashboard for people to follow the latest situation in the states. (Check it out here) Right now I\u2019m looking for internship opportunities.
