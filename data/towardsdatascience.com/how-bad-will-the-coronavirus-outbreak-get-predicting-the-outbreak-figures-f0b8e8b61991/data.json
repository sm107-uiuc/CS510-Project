Please follow the advice outlined in the WHO website to stay safe and protected\u201d", "The outbreak continues to spread \u2014 As of Feb 1st, the WHO has confirmed around 12,000 cases, and more than 2,000 alone was confirmed on Saturday (That\u2019s roughly 18% of the total reported cases). A total of 48 provinces across 28 countries have been affected. However, only a little more than 2% of these cases were found outside China. Although this number might seem small, Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak, is a major transportation hub of the country. Inter-city travels increasing because of the Lunar New year has aided the outbreak to some extent. During Oct-Nov last year, close to 2 million people flew out of Wuhan and roughly 120 thousand people flew outside the country as well. Hence the outbreak of Coronavirus remains a major concern across the globe.", "The pace and ease at which any outbreak spreads, determine its scale. The Report published by the Imperial College of London suggests that a person suffering from Coronavirus can affect 1.5 to 3.5 healthy people. According to the New York Times, if 5 people with new coronavirus can impact 2.6 others, then 5 people could be sick after 1 Cycle, 18 people after 2 Cycles, 52 people after 3 Cycles and so on.", "I worked on creating a QlikSense base dashboard to monitor the current scenario and track the outbreak. You can find more about it below.", "As of Saturday, the WHO has confirmed 11,821 cases in China. However, figures collated by the Johns Hopkins University suggest a much higher number. A probability that some of the cases are FALSE POSITIVES exists, i.e. someone was incorrectly suspected of having the virus but were cleared off when tested. The average growth in the number of cases reported in China remains as high as 16.3% (higher than SARS cases in 2003).", "It is difficult to predict the outbreak using a time series model, given we don\u2019t have enough data points. Let\u2019s take a look at the growth rate in confirmed cases over time. Three key parameters need to be considered when looking into a time-dependent variable.", "Using total confirmed cases from the previous day and applying an alpha (-2.9%) of recent growth rate, I predicted the outbreak for the next week. The forecast was validated using WHO Situation Report 12 & Report 13, and a MAPE of 1% is observed. Taking a look at the Graph suggests that I ended up over predicting the figures.", "A time series is a sequence where a metric is recorded over regular time intervals. Depending on the frequency, a time series can be of yearly, monthly, weekly or even daily. Since the number of confirmed cases is a time-dependent variable technique like Single or Double Exponential Smoothing or an ARIMA can yield a better forecast. However, I didn\u2019t try it owing to fewer data points. Any time series model requires enough data points to understand the interaction between the current and previous set of values. However, I used the partial autocorrelation (PACF) plot to validate if my assumptions were correct or not.", "I am going to write more about this in my next article, however, if you wish to learn more, visit this site.
