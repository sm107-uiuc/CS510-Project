This article focuses mainly on the five-star rating system, its alternatives and proposes an approach that makes most decisions binary \u2014 there should be no middle ground between rating steps when it comes to ratings.", "When it is not only about products and it comes about people, users, and providers, everything has one more dimension: a trend. How has he/she performed lately?", "So, you probably remember the situation from the school where you received both 5-s and 4-s equally (or A-s and B-s or whichever grading system was used). This way, nobody could technically put your actual level on a scale by simply looking at your grades and therefore you were neither 5 nor 4 but somewhere in between!? Some schools avoid the confusion by adding pluses and minuses to the grades so you would have a 5- or a 4+, depending on the teachers often subjective opinion. Yuck!", "Last school year I accepted the challenge to be a math teacher for a year. The school itself recently decided to change the grading system in a way that each student would get a letter instead of getting a number. The scale, if I remember correctly, was as follows:", "Uneven ranges in grading!? Yuck nr. 2! In order to calculate an average, one should find some sort of a weighted average, and yes \u2014 it is almost impossible to explain it to every 5th grader.", "My solution was architected in a way that each student had a chance to earn 100 points with tests and homework. The number of points collected during the trimester could easily be turned into his/her overall grade.", "Suppose we are deciding whether Joe or Susan is better in math. Their grades were as follows:", "Yes, they were both equally good over that given period (some topics suited better for Joe, some for Susan). Even though the mean score is 3 for both students, let us take a closer look at its development:", "The red line represents the average of the grades and their development. Notice that Joe almost always performs worse than his average score, and for Susan, it\u2019s the opposite. So if there was another test and their skills would be evaluated, it is probably Susan who would get a higher score, don\u2019t you agree?", "By simply following the fact that arithmetic mean is calculated by adding all values together and dividing the result by the number of scores, then all values have the same weight. The first value is as important as the last value and I think that this is the sole reason why we should look for other options. I propose the following methods for calculating scores:", "Now I have listed three different methods. Let us take a closer look now.", "I calculated the weighted average in the following manner:", "The results seem quite satisfying: Susan has a better score right after receiving her 8th score. Although it\u2019s difficult to see from the figure, the final score for Joe was 2.27 and for Susan, it\u2019s 3.73.", "There is a huge BUT. When we have two values in our dataset, the second value is twice as heavy compared to the first one. When we have large datasets and some sort of service provider has more than 1,000 ratings, then the weighted average starts to act pretty much like the arithmetic mean and does not move very much. Whenever you consider using this method, never take more than 50 of the latest scores into account.", "Note: this 50 is just an example based on my experiments. Larger datasets lead to less fluctuation and less fluctuation means less trend reflection. Adjust the number of values considered if you like.", "The concept of finding the arithmetic mean is simple: you can pretty much explain it to anyone who understands addition and division. If you want to change the overall concept only by a little, simply add a trend factor to your score calculation.", "One way to do so is to find the average among the three latest scores and normalize it to a [0; 1] slice. An example:", "In the previous formula, we have to subtract 1, since the smallest score must be 0 (in this way we transform 1 into 0). And we must divide it by 4 because the range between 1 and 5 is 4. This way we get a normalized coefficient we could use. Let\u2019s use it:", "The results can be compared to the arithmetic mean we examined above. If you are giving your best, you are okay. If you get three 5-s in a row then mathematically this model acts exactly as the arithmetic mean. However, if you mess something up and get ones \u2014 your score will be down quite fast.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t get lower scores than 1 in school.\u201d", "Yes. If you are a teacher, you can use the max(score, 1) to avoid this situation. This function returns the highest value of those two: if a score is smaller than 1, return 1, return the score otherwise.", "Let us take a look at another case where the data is not as smooth.", "The scores seem rather low! Whether it\u2019s a good or a bad thing, it is up to you to decide. I believe it motivates a better effort since you must get three consecutive scores to be back on top.", "Yes, this method the most fragile in different situations and exceptions, but let us take a closer look anyway.", "Linear regression helps us determine a line that fits the best through existing data points and since the x-axis represents the queue number, we can easily extrapolate the next value based on the current trend.", "As with the first method, this one should be used only with 10 of the latest scores. Otherwise, the trend line gets way too horizontal and again \u2014 acts as arithmetic mean.", "Suppose we have 10 data points. We use linear regression and obtain a line formula y = ax + b. The expected score will be calculated with x = 11 (larger by one compared to the number of data points we have).", "The corresponding code can be found here:", "Voila! Since the data is smooth (there are no jumps between 1 and 5), it looks quite pretty. Let us take a look at another case where the data is not as smooth.", "It turns out that even for this case, this scoring model obtains values that reflect the recent trend. Even though Joe is alternating between 1-s and 5-s, the scoring model starts to fluctuate less as he receives more and more scores. Therefore having larger datasets leads to having less movement in scores in general.", "Although this article is mostly about this school example, let\u2019s move on to the topic I really wanted to write about: getting rated for services and why current scoring models don\u2019t work as data engineers probably intend.", "I hope that most of you have used an app for ordering a taxi. When a driver gives his/her confirmation, you can see his rating on a 5-star scale. Often this score is calculating simply by finding the arithmetic mean. I haven\u2019t met a taxi driver with a score of less than 4.8 and I never understand the reason behind it:", "Note: I am not entirely familiar with how different companies calculate those scores and I have simply made an assumption that they find the mean value. If you know some platform where it\u2019s done differently, please provide me with a reference. Thanks! :)", "I was recently told that Bolt calculates the score by using the last 40 ratings, and yes \u2014 they are using the average, as expected. Here\u2019s the source of this information. I\u2019ll leave it up to you to decide whether this scoring model is enough dynamical to reflect the most recent activity.", "Quite often I don\u2019t have the time for immediate feedback and my ratings are either maximal (if I\u2019m satisfied) or minimal (if I\u2019m not). I believe that it\u2019s quite difficult to differentiate different scores:", "Therefore I would like to propose something far better: binary scores. Either you are satisfied with the service or you are not. Furthermore, positive feedback is represented as a \u201c1\u201d, negative as a \u201c0\u201d. When combining those scores with the methods described above, you will always get a value between 0 and 1. What you do afterward, is entirely up to you:", "Rating dynamics are awesome! However, there\u2019s a great trade-off between having an easy feedback system (easy enough to explain it to everyone) and a model that reflects the most recent activity.", "If you have some observations or other approaches that might apply well, feel free to share them.", "Your home for data science.
