Thank you!", "Web Scraping is getting more and more important in the current days. I will go out on a limb here, and assume you have already heard the expression \u201cData is the new oil\u201d. If we define web scraping as the ability to quickly gather all sorts of data from virtually any website, it should not be difficult to understand why there are so many businesses and tools offering web scraping services.", "Before you start your own project, it\u2019s good policy to remember what is good web scraping etiquette.", "You can use web scraping to get data as varied as text, numbers, images, videos, sounds, you name it. Not all websites provide an API to fetch the data seamlessly, so more often than not we have to get creative with some good old-fashioned scraping.", "More complex website structures will require more advanced scraping techniques, but you would be surprised by how easy it is to collect data and build your own datasets from scratch. This is especially useful if you want your Data Science portfolio to stand out!", "This article will focus on three different Python libraries that are more than enough for you to get started with your first projects:", "I will go over their main features and limitations, and provide a few examples of when to use one or another.", "Beautiful Soup is arguably the best way to start your web scraping journey if you have no prior experience. It helps to know a thing or two about Python, like how to iterate through lists or dictionaries, and a little bit of pandas too, to handle the data you extract.", "It is the most user friendly of the bunch, but that does come at a cost \u2014 it is also the least flexible, and it does not work with websites using JavaScript \u2014 more on that later.", "Websites are built with HTML code (most of them at least!). If you want to see the code behind your favorite website, just press CTRL+U if you are on Chrome (look for \u201cview source code\u201d in other browsers). You will get to an HTML document with the structure of the page you were browsing. This HTML code is what we feed into Beautiful Soup.", "The first step in the process is usually to use the requests module and a get command to fetch the HTML code and place it inside a variable. Once this is done, you are ready to extract the information you need.", "All you need to do is cook some soup\u2026 get it?!", "It\u2019s actually a good analogy to understand what\u2019s going on in the example below. Once you get the variable with the page code, you transform it into a Beautiful Soup object that will let you pick any ingredient you want.", "In this case, that object is the soup variable, and we will try to print the title of the page. The main title is always an \u201ch1\u201d tag in a normal HTML page, so you can see how easy it is for me to get the soup, and ask for that ingredient.", "Some of the ingredients \u2014 I mean HTML tags \u2014 will require some trial and error! The logic is the same every time. The only difference will be how well the website is structured and how well you can define the tags you want.", "There\u2019s this very nice video that explains it really well, and you can also check my profile if you decide to dig deeper into this subject. You will have a much better idea about how we get specific tags from the pages.", "All we have seen so far will not be enough if you are trying to scrape a website that uses JavaScript to load its content. For that, we will have to use Selenium!", "When you enter the world of web scraping, you will eventually get to a website that contains JavaScript to load content. That means it\u2019s time to move away from Beautiful Soup and load up Selenium.", "If you are unfamiliar with JavaScript, think of websites that are interactive and require you to expand and/or click objects to reveal new information. Booking is a good example of a website that has lots of buttons and dropdowns and\u2026 you get the idea!", "Please make sure you check the website allows scraping and also have a look at the robots.txt file.", "Selenium was created as a tool for automated testing (web apps and websites). Simply put, it works as an automated browser window. It opens a browser window that will let you navigate the site and pull information as you go.", "To use Selenium, you need to install a webdriver that will mimic the browser window. There are various webdrivers for different browsers, but you should probably stick to a browser you know first! I\u2019ve used the Chrome web driver for most of my projects, but you can also get one for Firefox and IE.", "For an option to run Selenium without the browser window actually open, check out the webdriver for PhantomJS \u2014 it is a bit more tricky to use though.", "If you are unsure about the website using JavaScript, look for tags containing JS code inside the page when you inspect it (right-click on page, and select inspect).", "After you take the setup out of the way, it\u2019s time to scrape something! Once the automated browser window opens, you will be interacting with the browser through the webdriver.", "From here it should be very easy to follow-up if you\u2019ve already worked with Beautiful Soup. You will use the same logic of finding HTML tags inside a variable containing the page. Instead of a \u201csoup\u201d, you have a browser window called \u201cwebdriver\u201d.", "I tried to split the code above into easy to read chunks. The automated browser window will open when you call webdriver.Chrome().", "After the window opens, you may recognize the \u201cget\u201d method fetching the somewebsite page. It looks for the \u201cusername\u201d field on the page and sends writes \u201cyour_username\u201d in that field.", "Same with the \u201cpassword\u201d field. And then clicks login. Pretty straight forward, right? The trick is to be able to find the tags though!", "It\u2019s worth mentioning that although Selenium was not built for web scraping, it can be a very interesting and fun tool to work with for that purpose!", "And then I found out about Scrapy\u2026 I had seen videos and tutorials about it, but having to use the shell terminal was a bit intimidating at the time. I ended up using BS and Selenium for a long time until I decided to explore Scrapy.", "Once I understood the concept and set my first spider free\u2026 Well, let\u2019s just say it felt like a whole world of possibilities had just opened.", "There\u2019s a slight chance it will even make you feel like a hacker, since you will be using the terminal and it will print out a lot of stuff while it\u2019s busy. That has to count for something, right?!", "Right off the bat, it\u2019s ridiculously fast. This is not by chance, since Scrapy was built using the Twisted Python framework. This framework gives it asynchronous capabilities which make it unnecessary for Scrapy to wait for each response individually. But that\u2019s probably more than you need to know at this point!", "It also does not require dependencies, so it\u2019s a very portable solution that you can implement anywhere you have Python installed.", "Rest assured, you don\u2019t need to understand the framework behind it to be able to use it. It helps if you have seen a command prompt before and you\u2019re not afraid to type stuff in a terminal!", "Let me explain it without any code, and then I\u2019ll share a short video showing it in action.", "To create your first spider (spiders are the little bots you create to scrape the web) you start in the command prompt by telling Scrapy to generate a fresh spider.", "In case you are wondering, the command prompt I am talking about is the one you get when you type \u201ccmd\u201d on your Windows start menu!", "This command will create a few .py files inside the folder you ran the command. With your favorite IDE, edit the spider and give it a few parameters like:", "We filter which links it follows by specifying something like \u201conly allow the spider to follow url\u2019s containing newspaper.com/economy/\u201d. This way, the spider will only follow links that have \u201ceconomy\u201d articles!", "After you set it up, go back to the shell terminal and type the command to run the spider. It will start with your initial page and immediately gets every link on that page. If we look at a newspaper website as an example, on any article page there will be different sections and even external links (like ads).", "And inside every link it follows, it will try to get the HTML tags you defined previously. It\u2019s like a Beautiful Soup on steroids because of this ability to follow links inside the pages.", "You also define where to export the results in the same command you type to run the spider.", "Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have any public Scrapy projects to show off at this point! But I can share one of the easiest to follow videos I found online. The channel even has a playlist dedicated to Scrapy and the guy does an awesome job explaining it.", "I have given you a very simplistic view of each of the tools, and their core features. Whichever tool you decide to use, make sure you read or watch some tutorials, so you can understand how to select the HTML tags. That will be your biggest challenge regardless of the library you chose.", "So if you don\u2019t have a lot of experience with Python, I would start by picking a simple website like Wikipedia and fire up Beautiful Soup.", "When you get comfortable with it, feel free to look for more advanced projects to tackle with Selenium. I have left a couple of links to my own projects, so have a look there for a start.", "One day you will wake up and decide you want to scrape every article from a specific online newspaper and perform NLP analysis. That will probably be a sign you need to load Scrapy!", "I hope you found this article useful to get you started with Web Scraping or to give you different options for your future projects. I would really like to know what kind of topics you are more interested in, so please take 5 seconds to answer the poll below!
