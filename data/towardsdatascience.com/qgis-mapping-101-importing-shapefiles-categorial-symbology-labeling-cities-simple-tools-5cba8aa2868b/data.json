QGIS has quickly become my mapping software of choice due to its similarity to ArcMap and, best of all, it\u2019s free! Through my endeavor learning this new tool, I thought it might be helpful to some of you out there who are just getting started with it as well. If you\u2019ve used QGIS before, honestly, this blog probably isn\u2019t for you as it is more focused on very basic, entry-level skills. But, if this is your first map I think you\u2019ll find this extremely useful!", "If you haven\u2019t downloaded QGIS go ahead and do that now, here. During my college years I used ArcMap pretty extensively for undergraduate research. Now that I\u2019m on my own and don\u2019t have that luxury, I was looking for something cheap, or better yet free, to get my mapping skills up to snuff. That\u2019s when I stumbled upon QGIS. It is surprisingly similar to ArcMap and I was pleased to see all the features it offers. The user interface is also very nicely laid out, and I couldn\u2019t be happier with this open source software. With that, there is a slight learning curve, as there is with everything, but once you get the gist, things are a lot easier. Today, I\u2019m hopefully going to help mitigate some of that learning curve for you by making a simple geologic map of North Carolina using data from an assortment of resources. With that, let\u2019s begin!", "To start following along, I suggest you download the needed data from my GitHub, here. You\u2019ll find a zip file containing the shapefiles, a CSV file of some coordinates of cities in North Carolina, and also a QGIS file of the end result map. The data is from the the North Carolina DoT and the USDA Geospatial Data Gateway, both very useful data resources with an assortment of GIS data!", "Let\u2019s get to the good stuff. First, open QGIS and create a new project. You should be met with a plain white screen. Let\u2019s add our first bit of data, the map shapefile. QGIS is awesome because it handles and assortment of datatypes, one of the most useful being shapefiles. On the top toolbar select Layer \u2192 Add Layer \u2192 Add Vector Layer. From there you will see a popup. Under Source Type, keep file selected, and let the encoding be automatic. Under Source, click the button with the three dots, navigate to the folder labeled \u201cNC_County_Boundaries\u201d, and select the shapefile from the list of files. Shapefiles are delimited with .shp at the end of their name. Press \u201cAdd\u201d and you will be asked to designate the particular transformation. There are multiple associated with this shapefile, but 2/3 are for military purposes only. Seeing as though this is a blog, we will use the one it already has selected, the one intended for civilians. Click apply and now you should see a beautiful county boundary map of North Carolina. Great job!", "So now that you have your map, and know how to import layers, let\u2019s add in a geologic map to the mix. It\u2019s the same idea: Layer \u2192 Add Layer \u2192 Add Vector Layer. This time, navigate to the \u201cNC_geology\u201d folder and select your shapefile. Once it\u2019s added it should look like the image below.", "Taking a look, all that orange isn\u2019t really useful, and we can\u2019t see the county boundaries anymore. What\u2019s happened is QGIS has imported the new shapefile, but put it overtop the county boundary map, and it thinks we just want to see the lines separating the different geologic types. But, wouldn\u2019t it be cool if we could color-code the map so that each color represents a different rock type? Or, we could even change the colors to represent when the geology was formed! Let\u2019s go with the first idea, and see what information we can get out of our map.", "To the left of your map, you should see a popup frame. Within that frame, there should be a section that says \u201cLayers\u201d. Here, you can toggle the order of the layers, and if they are even showing on the map! Right now, though, we need to get into the layer properties of the geologic map so we can make necessary adjustments. Find the \u201cNC_geology\u201d layer, right click, and select \u201cProperties\u201d. A new window should pop up with the symbology tab open. At the top of the page, there should be a drop-down menu with \u201cSingle symbol\u201d selected. Click that and change it to \u201cCategorized\u201d. This will fix our one color issue and allow us to color-code based on whatever attribute we want! Like I said above, I\u2019ll be categorizing on rock type, but you can choose whatever you please. For Value I\u2019m choosing \u201cROCKTYPE_1\", leaving Symbol be, and selecting \u201cSpectral\u201d for the color ramp. You can choose any of the colors for the color ramp, but I thought Spectral would be nice since I\u2019m interested in how different the rock types are, and don\u2019t want the colors to imply there is some sort of continuum or relationship between them (i.e. choosing a blue gradient). Near the bottom of the pop-up we can choose to classify on either all of the rock types listed, or just a few. Again, I\u2019m interested in the entire map, so all I have to do is press classify and QGIS will automatically assign colors to each label for that attribute. Press Apply \u2192 OK and now you should have a wonderfully colorful map to explore!", "This map is awesome, but it would be super neat to see where the major cities lie on the map, and if they might correlate to a specific geologic type. Thankfully, this is extremely simple to do by simply importing in a .csv file with the latitudes, longitudes, and city names. I\u2019ve provided it on my GitHub, here.", "To import a .csv, go to Layer \u2192 Add Layer \u2192 Add Delimited Text Layer . Navigate to your file as usual, give it a useful name so you know what it is, and for our purposes today that\u2019s all you have to do! Go ahead and press Add, then you should be met with some extremely small and hard to see dots where the cities are. Let\u2019s change these so they\u2019re easier to spot, and give them labels so we know what cities they are. Right click your cities layer, and go to Properties. I\u2019m going to make the markers white and change their size to 5. Then, on the left hand side of the pop-up select \u201cLabels\u201d. Press the drop-down menu and select \u201cSingle Labels\u201d. QGIS should automatically select the \u201cName\u201d attribute from the .csv as the values. I\u2019m going to first change the style to bold, and change the font size to 13. Press Apply but stay in the pop-up window.", "If you take a peak at your map, the names aren\u2019t in an ideal place around the markers. They need to be moved up to look cleaner. By changing the distance, you can move your labels up. Within that same window, press the \u201cPlacement\u201d tab. I set mine to 2mm and am happy with the placement, but it\u2019s up to you!", "The text is still a little hard to see with all the colors in the background. Go back to your geologic layer properties, select Symbology, and press the little arrow next to \u201cLayer Rendering\u201d. Here we can change the opacity of the layer. I set mine to ~68% so I can still see the colors well, but also read the text. You might notice the base map we used, the county boundary map, may or may not bother you with all the extra lines. Feel free to toggle this layer on and off by checking and unchecking the white box next to the layer name. I find it useful to keep these layers around in case I want to examine other possible relationships, but some people prefer to make a whole new map for that. To each their own, and it\u2019s something you will figure out over time!", "Now that we have a basic map outlined, you can take this time to do some exploring! Some useful tools are the Identify tool (found in the upper toolbar, with a blue circle and an \u201ci\u201d in it), the Pan Map tool (upper toolbar, white hand), and the magnifying functions (upper toolbar, magnifying glasses). The Identify tool is extremely useful for quickly looking up the attributes of a particular area, just make sure you have the layer of interest selected or you\u2019ll be left there clicking on an area with nothing showing up.", "Taking a look around the map, and using the trusty Identify tool, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any obvious indication that people chose to settle and create these cities based on their rock types and geology. Darn, who would\u2019ve guessed it!", "Let\u2019s say maybe we want to find out how many distinct rock types there are, or how many different sections are mapped. Using the handy Statistics tools we can easily, and quickly find that out! Navigate to the upper toolbar and click the button with the summation symbol on it. Now, check the left hand side of the screen and there should be a new statistics window. Simply select the layer and attribute you want to know more about, and boom, simple statistic analytics appear! You can also get specific attribute statistics by pressing the summation symbol next to the attribute selection and creating a simple query.", "This was a simple example of how to load and manipulate a map, but the possibilities are endless! There are so many tools you can use, so go wild and play around with it. Doing this sort of initial analysis can be extremely beneficial, and save you a lot of time if you\u2019re planning on creating a machine learning model centered around the data. Let me know in the comments if you come across anything interesting and stick around for more QGIS blogs soon!", "Your home for data science.
