A somewhat famous conceptual figure that Andrew Ng likes to use in his lectures illustrates the relationship between model performance, model size, and data availability.", "In arbitrary units, the figure looks something like:", "Where large models training on small datasets typically underperform appropriately diminutive networks, and vice-versa.", "The availability of large, high-quality datasets is a necessary requisite to take advantage of state-of-the-art models and computational capabilities.", "This has led some to call data \u201cthe new gold\u201d or \u201cthe new oil\u201d in relation to its importance to the modern economy. In 2013, around the time the data floodgates first began to open, some estimated that the world\u2019s recorded data had increased by 10 times in just two years. Exact numbers are hard to pin down, but while we can\u2019t necessarily expect a 1,000% biennial increase in data to continue indefinitely, there\u2019s no doubt that the number of high-quality training datasets is higher now than ever before.", "But this data deluge comes with some unintended negative consequences, and as the field matures the way data ownership and privacy is practiced and regulated is bound to adapt.", "While people have for the most part been surprisingly OK with openly sharing their data for very little in return, growing awareness and an expanding list of data breaches and blatant misconduct is starting to change that at both the public and regulatory levels.", "Big data giant Facebook has had a rough few years of endless scandals, while Google was recently fined for violating the new European data protection laws. People and organizations are increasingly aware of the way data and machine intelligence impact every aspect of our lives and ready to take privacy and data security more seriously.", "Additionally, the main bottleneck in modern machine learning pipelines is more often communication bandwidth than computational power.", "It\u2019s not realistic for a hospital to upload every computed tomography scan to a centralized server for real-time model updates, for example, and there are many other use-cases where it is preferable for learning to occur on-site or in a distributed fashion.", "To revisit the example above, it may not be realistic for the hospital to upload many terabytes of sensitive medical data daily for centralized training due to both privacy and bandwidth considerations. It may still be beneficial to share the training experience of the model, however, and so the updated parameters (or their gradients) can be accumulated across different sites to improve the performance of all instances of the model. This is called federated learning.", "Federated learning is widely used in ML pipelines, and it can also be used for distributed learning on a big dataset.", "But when dealing with private and privileged data, how can we ensure its security? We could just blindly trust all parties involved and this may have been generally acceptable in the past, but we can also run the data through a sharing cipher and employ what\u2019s called Secure Multi-party Computation (SMPC)", "Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) is any protocol for processing data that doesn\u2019t depend on revealing the data to all parties.", "This can be as simple as performing local training on local (unencrypted) data, then encrypting the gradients to upload.", "Another method is to use a homomorphic encryption (aka HE) scheme, where encrypted data still supports mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication. Using HE the aforementioned encrypted gradients can all be added together before being transferred to whoever owns the model and the private key for decrypting the combined gradients.", "Alternatively, with the right HE scheme an encrypted model can be trained on encrypted data, producing encrypted predictions that are only useful once decrypted. This method has the important consequence that the security of valuable models can be maintained at the same time.", "Let\u2019s build our understanding with some code.", "We\u2019ll start out by looking at a simple method for SMPC with only Python\u2019s numpy as a dependency.", "Then we\u2019ll look at teaching a small network the exclusive or function, a classic and infamous example of a non-linear function, using an open source cryptographic deep learning library called PySyft.", "In the example below we\u2019ll see how SMPC can split data into shares while preserving the ability to add encrypted variables to other encrypted variables and multiply encrypted variables with plaintext values.", "As we can see above, after taking the sum of our encrypted variables we get a result that looks like three random integers.", "Those integers are encrypted shares that we can translate into a plaintext result using decrypt(). The important thing to notice above is that if we try to \u201cdecrypt\u201d the result with access to only two shares, we get nonsense. No party with access to incomplete shares can decipher the meaning of the data.", "The example above supports addition of encrypted data and multiplication with plaintext operands. Deep learning neural nets are mainly built of addition, multiplication, and activation functions, and we\u2019ve just shown that the first two can be accomplished relatively easily without relinquishing control of the underlying data.", "This is enough for simple statistical learning models like linear regression, but to take advantage of the ability of neural networks to fit arbitrary data functions according to the universal approximation theorem, we need to introduce non-linearities. That is a main area of development for for privacy-centric deep learning libraries like PySyft, using clever tricks like Taylor expansion series to approximate common activation functions.", "It\u2019s also possible to reduce a non-linear problem to a linear one with a complex random transformation, an approach known as reservoir computing. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do in the next example.", "To run this part of the tutorial we will explore using PyTorch, and more specifically PySyft. But First, you need to understand what system/resource requirements you\u2019ll need to run the following demo.", "IMPORTANT NOTE: We HIGHLY recommend using Docker for the following experiment due to the large number of DL/ML/Math packages that are needed for this exercise. PySyft is highly experimental, and these scripts are stable in PyTorch v0.3.1, we just want to be up front about that. Please use Docker to avoid possible dependency issues.", "NOTE: you can always copy and save the source code below in the \u2018source code\u2019 section instead of downloading the zip file.", "navigate to the folder where \u2018bash encrypted_reservoir_pysyft_demo.sh\u2019 is located for this example just enter the following:", "NOTE: Running the bash file may take several minutes, creates the entire training environment, downloads all dependencies, and installs all necessary packages, furthermore it takes the source code of the script (seen further below) and executes the training script.", "If you want to run the script again, you\u2019ll need to enter the PySyft conda enviroment by using the following command:", "Now run the demo (again) by entering:", "You should see some outputs like the following:", "Now, if you want to experiment more on your own, feel free to modify the source code below.", "In this article we learned that it\u2019s possible to preserve privacy and security of both models and data.", "This is an active and rewarding area of research that is only going to become more important as the role of machine learning and data in our society continues to mature.", "Privacy-centric deep and machine learning is a skillset worth adding to your repertoire, set to experience increasing demand as regulatory, consumer, and business pressures all wise up to good data practices.", "It also is a worthwhile capability for businesses to develop, as valuable models can be protected.", "Finally, homomorphic encryption and secure computation are tools we can use to achieve morally good solutions to the world\u2019s sensitive problems.", "There remains a significant computational cost to deep learning this way, which is in general at least an order of magnitude slower than conventional models. That\u2019s exemplified by the example of training the XOR example above: the training dataset is literally only 12 bits of data including the target values and a far cry from modern deep learning tasks.", "This makes accelerating HE algorithms on GPUs and other specialized hardware an active area of development. Homomorphic encryption libraries are in the early stages of being developed to fully leverage modern GPUs, much like the state deep learning libraries were in a few years ago.", "This creates an opportunity to get in on the cutting edge and influence the direction of the field for the better. An accelerated encryption library called cuHE already claims speedups of 12 to 50 times on various encrypted tasks over previous implementations.", "In the future, it will make sense for GPU manufacturers to cater to demand for good data practices with improved hardware support of cryptographic primitives, much like the tensor cores and decreased precision capabilities developed in response to deep learning demand.", "Deep learning friendly libraries such as PySyft (built on PyTorch) and tf-encrypted (built on TensorFlow), or PySEAL (a python port of Microsoft\u2019s Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library) are developing active communities of users and developers.", "Homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and other privacy preserving schemes are sure to become necessary skillsets for the machine learning practitioner of the future, and there\u2019s no better time to get involved.", "When you\u2019re ready to get started, read the introduction to Craig Gentry\u2019s thesis on fully homomorphic encryption.", "Then when you\u2019re ready to learn more, find a GPU and start working through the examples from tf-encrypted and PySyft.", "Originally published at blog.exxactcorp.com on April 8, 2019.", "Your home for data science.
