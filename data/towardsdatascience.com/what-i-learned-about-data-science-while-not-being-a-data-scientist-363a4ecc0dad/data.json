Being a data scientist is regarded as a boolean consideration. You either are a data scientist or you are not.", "However, in reality even if you secure the title \u2018data scientist\u2019 you probably will not exclusively be doing data science (if, sometimes at all). Alternatively, if you hold a role without explicitly being referred to as a data scientist, you will likely be doing data science (or what people refer to as data science).", "Thankfully the industry is seeing the first wave of specialisation and a distinction between roles that were previously all caught under the catch-all \u2018data science\u2019 umbrella. Given that there is confusion even within the industry about what constitutes a data scientist, I would move away from the fixation of holding any particular title (especially given their fluidity) and instead look for opportunities where you create value while using data to do so.", "For this reason, and the fact that I am one of the many people to come to data science from a career spent in other roles, I just wanted to share my experience of acquiring useful data skills, before I had \u2018data\u2019 in my job title. If, after all Steve Jobs could reminisce how dropping into a caligraphy class as a university drop out helped him in his future role as Apple CEO, then surely I and others could find valuable insights acquired from previous roles?", "I spent the first 4 or so years of my career in consulting. It\u2019s a term that can be used as broadly and ambiguously as \u2018data scientist\u2019. I was working with data, but this was a long way before data science existed in its current form. I was essentially a spreadsheet analyst if I was working with numbers at all.", "However, consulting careers are generally good and I picked up a lot of skills that would help me later as I transitioned into the data space. These included:", "This is the same thing that I find myself doing regularly in data science. You will need to leverage other people\u2019s knowledge to work more effectively (from both a speed and accuracy point of view) so communication skills are critical.", "You may know your domain well, but you will most likely be working across domains, so you will need to learn to bring people together and coalesce them around your projects mission. Soft skills go a long way in achieving this.", "Being able to influence, and demonstrate how your work brings value is a key skill in any profession. On-selling is equally important, once you have completed a piece of work and gained the credibility searching out other problems and opportunities that you can address, and using your credibility with your stakeholders to build support for these projects \u2014 to enhance your sphere of influence.", "These were among the many skills that I learnt in consulting, which I did in one form or another \u2014 eventually moving into data specific consulting \u2014 for the first 8 or so years of my career. After my first consulting job I took a sojourn to Europe, where I had a go at joining a startup.", "Startups are a hustle. The particular startup that I worked with was a data play in a particularly desirable field, but with very little track record of data being used in that field (or any field for that matter \u2014 again, early days)", "To get involved in this particular project, I had to network and hustle, and then once in the team, we collectively had to hustle just to get and keep clients and refine the product.", "The learnings that I had from this period were mostly related to how to break into a very desired field, and how to sacrifice immediate reward for long term benefit, by working on meaningful problems and ones that I was directly passionate about. I learnt also that being passionate was an asset, unlike the inverse you had \u2018skin in the game\u2019 which allowed you to process decisions like a founder or executive \u2014 a valuable skill set.", "However, I primarily gained insight into how to break into a very competitive field, something that all aspiring data scientists are trying to do, doubly so if they are trying to break into a field that is closely aligned with their passion (and that passion is shared by many others). Say for example working in sports analytics. Or, if they are trying to do truly groundbreaking work. The lessons I learned for how to break into a competitive field, where you (or even the industry) may have no track record in included:", "Those were some of the many lessons that I learnt and skills that I acquired, working in this ultra-competitive space. I next would go onto\u2026", "Finally, my last not \u2014 exactly \u2014 data-role \u2014 was working for a spend analytics company. This was the first role that I took as I was transitioning from strategy consulting to more data specific roles. Spend analytics for those that do not know, is the practice of evaluating all the financial transactions that a company has made (i.e. huge amounts of data points) over a given time period and finding any anomalous transactions. Usually, these transactions are erroneous, but they can also represent fraud and the like.", "The role required you to often work with unstructured data and find patterns in the data. It was actually a fantastic training ground for data insights because the essence of the job was finding rare, and unknown pockets of information in data. Persistence, and continually developing and testing hypotheses as to where value could be found \u2014 were the job description.", "However to understand the two main things I took away, you need to understand the fact that the professional services work that I was doing was largely performance-based. We got paid depending on how many of these anomalous data points we found, as a proportion of their value \u2014 once we got them back to the clients. Based on this dynamic, you had to develop strategies, and continually test a hypothesis to see whether the strategies proved fruitful. The main lesson here pertained to time management. Primarily the lessons I learned that served me well in later data roles were to:", "In the end this was purely a lesson in money /time management. Quickly move away from things that are not proving to be insightful and valuable while extracting maximum value from those that are.", "This is a key skill in data science \u2014 and any roles in the space were exponentially growing amounts of data are being used for analysis. In a world of potentially endless hypothesis to address, and massive data sets to do so with \u2014 managing the effectiveness of your strategies is extremely important.", "So they were some of the lessons that I learnt that helped me in data analytics and data science roles while working in roles that had no such direct remit. So, if you aspire to be a data scientist, but currently are not \u2014 rest assured that you are already acquiring skills to help you in your journey, even though you may not yet be aware of it.", "This story was initially published here", "Your home for data science.
