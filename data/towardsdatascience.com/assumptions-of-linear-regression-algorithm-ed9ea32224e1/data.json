This data set contains information about money spent on advertisement and their generated Sales. Money was spent on TV, radio and newspaper ads.It has 3 features namely TV, radio and newspaper and 1 target Sales.", "There are 5 basic assumptions of Linear Regression Algorithm:", "According to this assumption there is linear relationship between the features and target.Linear regression captures only linear relationship.This can be validated by plotting a scatter plot between the features and the target.", "The first scatter plot of the feature TV vs Sales tells us that as the money invested on Tv advertisement increases the sales also increases linearly and the second scatter plot which is the feature Radio vs Sales also shows a partial linear relationship between them,although not completely linear.", "2.Little or no Multicollinearity between the features:", "Multicollinearity is a state of very high inter-correlations or inter-associations among the independent variables.It is therefore a type of disturbance in the data if present weakens the statistical power of the regression model.Pair plots and heatmaps(correlation matrix) can be used for identifying highly correlated features.", "The above pair plot shows no significant relationship between the features.", "This heatmap gives us the correlation coefficients of each feature with respect to one another which are in turn less than 0.4.Thus the features aren\u2019t highly correlated with each other.", "Why removing highly correlated features is important?", "The interpretation of a regression coefficient is that it represents the mean change in the target for each unit change in an feature when you hold all of the other features constant. However, when features are correlated, changes in one feature in turn shifts another feature/features. The stronger the correlation, the more difficult it is to change one feature without changing another. It becomes difficult for the model to estimate the relationship between each feature and the target independently because the features tend to change in unison.", "If we have 2 features which are highly correlated we can drop one feature or combine the 2 features to form a new feature,which can further be used for prediction.", "Homoscedasticity describes a situation in which the error term (that is, the \u201cnoise\u201d or random disturbance in the relationship between the features and the target) is the same across all values of the independent variables.A scatter plot of residual values vs predicted values is a goodway to check for homoscedasticity.There should be no clear pattern in the distribution and if there is a specific pattern,the data is heteroscedastic.", "The leftmost graph shows no definite pattern i.e constant variance among the residuals,the middle graph shows a specific pattern where the error increases and then decreases with the predicted values violating the constant variance rule and the rightmost graph also exhibits a specific pattern where the error decreases with the predicted values depicting heteroscedasticity", "Python code for residual plot for the given data set:", "The fourth assumption is that the error(residuals) follow a normal distribution.However, a less widely known fact is that, as sample sizes increase, the normality assumption for the residuals is not needed. More precisely, if we consider repeated sampling from our population, for large sample sizes, the distribution (across repeated samples) of the ordinary least squares estimates of the regression coefficients follow a normal distribution. As a consequence, for moderate to large sample sizes, non-normality of residuals should not adversely affect the usual inferential procedures. This result is a consequence of an extremely important result in statistics, known as the central limit theorem.", "Normal distribution of the residuals can be validated by plotting a q-q plot.", "Using the q-q plot we can infer if the data comes from a normal distribution. If yes, the plot would show fairly straight line. Absence of normality in the errors can be seen with deviation in the straight line.", "The q-q plot of the advertising data set shows that the errors(residuals) are fairly normally distributed.The histogram plot in the \u201cError(residuals) vs Predicted values\u201d in assumption no.3 also shows that the errors are normally distributed with mean close to 0.", "5.Little or No autocorrelation in the residuals:", "Autocorrelation occurs when the residual errors are dependent on each other.The presence of correlation in error terms drastically reduces model\u2019s accuracy.This usually occurs in time series models where the next instant is dependent on previous instant.", "Autocorrelation can be tested with the help of Durbin-Watson test.The null hypothesis of the test is that there is no serial correlation. The Durbin-Watson test statistics is defined as:", "The test statistic is approximately equal to 2*(1-r) where r is the sample autocorrelation of the residuals. Thus, for r == 0, indicating no serial correlation, the test statistic equals 2. This statistic will always be between 0 and 4. The closer to 0 the statistic, the more evidence for positive serial correlation. The closer to 4, the more evidence for negative serial correlation.", "From the above summary note that the value of Durbin-Watson test is 1.885 quite close to 2 as said before when the value of Durbin-Watson is equal to 2, r takes the value 0 from the equation 2*(1-r),which in turn tells us that the residuals are not correlated.", "We have gone through the most important assumptions which must be kept in mind before fitting a Linear Regression Model to a given set of data.These assumptions are just a formal check to ensure that the linear model we build gives us the best possible results for a given data set and these assumptions if not satisfied does not stop us from building a Linear regression model.", "Your home for data science.
