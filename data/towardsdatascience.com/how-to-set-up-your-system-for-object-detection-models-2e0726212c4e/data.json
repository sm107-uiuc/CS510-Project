Object detection is a particular task in computer vision. It helps machines to identify a particular set of objects without the help of human eyes. Many applications like \u2014 face detection for surveillance in the protected areas, footfall counting in a store, object detection with tracking to estimate the speed of a vehicle, fault detection in a product in the manufacturing industries, etc. \u2014 are using object detection techniques.", "In different social media, I saw many machine learning enthusiasts are trying out different object detection techniques and sharing their results.", "Somehow, I was a bit skeptical about applying these object detection techniques. I had a fair idea of the fundamentals of deep learning algorithms and approaches for general machine learning problems, NLP, and Computer Vision. I worked on some text-based models too. But Computer Vision always repelled me for some unknown reason.", "I avoided working on vision-related projects throughout my career. I used to pass it on to my colleagues. But I couldn\u2019t do it for long. A situation arose when I could not avoid it anymore. I had to do some object detection tasks related to a particular context. So I decided to give it a shot.", "At first, I was not sure about where to start. I did lots of web searches and readings to find suitable material that can guide me through. I realized that there are lots of articles about object detection, but most of them are not complete. As it was a new field for me and I had a time constraint, I needed detailed guidance about each step of the procedure and I also needed a strategy for quick implementation of the model.", "I found some good articles on \u2014 Medium, Analytics Vidya, Machine Learning Mastery, etc. But when I was going to implement it, I faced lots of challenges related to system setup and model execution.", "I faced different error messages, which I could not understand. It took days to figure out the reasons for such errors. And finally, I understood that you need to make a list of requirements and follow a sequential approach to succeed in this journey.", "In this article, I would discuss the strategy you need to implement an object detection model successfully at your first attempt.", "There are two ways of building an object detection model. You can implement an existing model architecture. It takes a lesser amount of time and you get guidance from other implementations. Also, you can benefit from the method called transfer learning, which uses weights from previously built models and re-train the model for the current context.", "The alternative way is to build a model from scratch. It takes more time and requires more resources to train the model. But it gives you greater control over it.", "I decided to use an existing model architecture and re-train it for my task in hand. I chose the Mask RCNN model for object detection. I found some articles in Medium and Machine-Learning-Mastery about its fundamentals and implementation.", "I had a laptop with Windows 10 and 4GB NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1650 GPU. To train it for my task, I needed to set up the GPU and also needed to install jupyter notebook to access it.", "I found a beautiful article on setting up a GPU from here. I have been able to do it after overcoming a few obstacles. The guidelines were a bit old. some of the commands were not working. I managed to replace them with newer ones.", "My next task was to implement the model. I intended to implement an existing object detection model end-to-end so I can quickly adapt to my new use case.", "I followed the article from here. I did all the necessary steps \u2014 downloaded the Mask RCNN git repository(here), downloaded the images and their annotation files, imported the necessary packages, and required files. But, I got stuck when I started training the model of the given data.", "I faced an error related to TensorFlow \u2014 \u201cModuleNotFoundError: No module named \u2018tensorflow.contrib\u2019.\u201d I tried different methods from the web to fix it. But I couldn\u2019t. Each of them led me to another error.", "It took days to understand the secret of a successful implementation. You need to synchronize the versions of packages and software you install for your object detection task. And it starts with setting up the GPU and applicable to every single package you install in the entire project.", "It is the package version that messes up things. In my case, it was the version of TensorFlow. The current version of TensorFlow is 2.3.0. The Mask RCNN model architecture was built for TensorFlow version 1.14 or older. Being unaware of that, I kept on installing all the latest versions of all packages, including TensorFlow, unless something specifically mentioned.", "Realizing (after lots of unsuccessful attempts) that the TensorFlow version is causing the trouble, I decided to uninstall everything and start it fresh.", "I again started from the installation of the GPU and the proper version of TensorFlow. This time it worked. I still faced some issues with the python packages. But I knew the fix. I matched the package versions according to their release dates.", "I did not have to worry about compatibility issues anymore. I could fully concentrate on building my model.", "Before you start building any object detection model, you can follow these steps to gather all information you require to set up your system.", "If you collect all this information correctly, you are ready for the second phase of the journey.", "If you have gathered all the information about the requirements, you can start installing them one by one. Follow this sequence while you are setting up the system.", "Download the Visual Studio version required for the CUDA version you selected. For Mask RCNN I needed Tensorflow 1.14. The CUDA version compatible with Tensorflow 1.14 is CUDA 10. Find this information related to TensorFlow and CUDA versions in this link.", "Now the CUDA version requires a particular version of Visual Studio with an appropriate Visual C++ compiler. In my case, it was Visual Studio 2017 having Visual C++ 15.0 compiler. Use this link for the appropriate version.", "Install Anaconda for Python 3.x version from here. It will help you create a virtual environment that will be enabled with tensorflow-gpu. In this environment, you will launch jupyter notebook.", "Download and install CUDA from here. I had to download CUDA 10 (an older version). Follow the exact installation procedure for CUDA from here (except the CUDA version). CUDA version should be compatible with your TensorFlow version.", "Your cuDNN version has to be according to your CUDA version. Follow this link to find the appropriate version. I had to download cuDNN 7.4 (an older version). The detailed steps for cuDNN installation and setting up environment variables are given here.", "You need to create an environment using Anaconda prompt to install TensorFlow. Select the GPU enabled TensorFlow compatible with your model. Follow the steps from here.", "After you installed TensorFlow, you should check if you can access the GPU. The code snippet mentioned in the above link is not working because of version change. Use the following script to check for the same. It will show the available computing resources.", "It\u2019s time to install jupyter notebook in your environment. Follow the instructions given here. Now you are ready for the exploration of the object detection model.", "Download the model you want to use for the object detection task. You need to clone it from the git repository. I used Mask RCNN. So I downloaded and installed it using the following command. You can find an implementation of the Mask RCNN model here.", "Now you can download other python packages required for building the model. There is a list of requirements in the Mask RCNN repository. It contains all the necessary packages that are required for this implementation. It does not mention the version of all the packages, though.", "I installed all the necessary packages with the required versions to avoid further version conflict.", "Now your jupyter notebook is ready with all installations. You don\u2019t have to think about compatibility issues anymore. You can employ your full concentration on training and inference of the object detection model you desire to build.", "Computer vision is a specialized field of artificial intelligence. The approach towards solving a computer vision problem is a bit different from usual machine learning approaches..I wrote this article to help the newbies in data science to dive into the object detection models. It will also be helpful for those professionals, like me, who never have tried object detection tasks before. I used Mask RCNN as an example to show the procedure. My intension was to propose a structured approach to configuring the system before starting any object detection assignment.", "5.
