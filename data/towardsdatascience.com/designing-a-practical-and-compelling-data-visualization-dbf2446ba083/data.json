It\u2019s also the most \u201ctaken-for-granted\u201d component of analytics. Few analysts have formal training in data visualization best practices.", "Exacerbating the problem is that the default options in applications like PowerPoint and Excel are poorly designed; they\u2019re viewed as acceptable or preferred when they should be seen as a starting point.", "The purpose of data visualization is to allow the viewer to quickly and easily pull out the most important information from the data. I\u2019ve found it frustratingly difficult to find a non-Textbook resource that focuses on practical, business-focused best practices for data visualization that draw on knowledge of psychology and human behavior. Most of the content is graphic-design focused or designing for Verbal Presentations.", "Yet, this gap is where most presentations exist for analytics professionals today \u2014 you have content that needs to do more than \u201clook good\u201d, must be intuitive enough to exist on its own in a slide or dashboard, and should be clear enough to quickly pull out the right message.", "I recently completed a course in my Business Analytics Masters program focused on Visual Influencing. Its intention is to bridge the gap described above. It\u2019s about taking what we know on how to gain attention with design and implementing it into business presentations.", "To illustrate the best practices, I\u2019ll start with the default PowerPoint chart and table to answer a simple question: Which world region was happiest in 2019?", "Have you ever (or commonly) seen a slide that looks something like this?", "The chart and table contain all of the needed information to answer the question but nothing pops. There\u2019s a bland bar chart, nondescript header, and text table. To answer which region is happiest, I need to visually compare Australia, North America, and Western Europe, then reference the table on the right to compare values.", "Let\u2019s consider a few other items too:", "A few simple clean up steps addresses the above and begins to improve the chart design.", "The y-axis was removed and the values added to the top of each bar. By adding the labels to the top, we can remove the table on the right, and the increased space allows us to widen the graph and remove the slanting without reducing font size. The legend was removed too and chart title improved. In summary, everything was taken away except for the bars themselves and the country names.", "It\u2019s now easier \u2014 but not easiest \u2014 to answer our question.", "Aggregating the right data and choosing the right chart are critical steps to communicating the data, but we can do more. We\u2019ll add pre-attentive attributes, which are subtle alterations that we can make to a visualization to have our most important information \u201cpop\u201d. We\u2019ll also adjust the graph to have a more conventional ordering that mirrors how we think \u2014 that is, left-to-right.", "There are a couple important changes to the above graph:", "The chart viewing audience knows exactly where to look even if they don\u2019t yet know the question being answered.", "Bring it to the Finish Line", "The information pops and we\u2019ve created a logical ordering. To finish, remember that we\u2019re trying to inform someone about which region is happiest in 2019. This isn\u2019t a grand unveiling of information, so why would we rely on them to answer the question when we can give them that information along with the data?", "Instead of a descriptive chart title, we can give an informative headline. With the headline, it\u2019s implied that the numeric value represents the average happiness score, so we can remove the chart title. I\u2019ve also grayed out all of the regions other than Australia and New Zealand because we\u2019re not interested in which region is second, third, and so on.", "You may ask why to even include the rest of the data if we give the answer, which is fair. It serves as context for Australia\u2019s value and oftentimes audiences will feel more comfortable with an answer when presented with the information themselves rather than taking for granted the answer you\u2019ve given.", "I added a source at the bottom because we don\u2019t always know who will receive our data and what they\u2019re trying to do with it; adding the source reduces an additional question that you may receive later. Even for internal presentations and data, sourcing where you gathered the information can help your audience (and also help you should you need to reference the data again at some point in the future).", "This example is equal parts dramatized and very real. Take a look at presentations you\u2019ve seen recently. Does it look more like the top visual or the bottom? What are two improvements you would make to the most recent visual you\u2019ve seen?", "The most important advice I can give is to remove every additional piece of information and chart design that\u2019s added to a visual by default and add back the minimal amount of information to convey your message. Then, use color, size, bolding, spacing, and other pre-attentive attributes to enhance your message.", "It takes work to scrutinize every visual that you create, but it\u2019s also immensely satisfying to see the improved discussions that it can generate and the improved outcomes of your work.", "Interested in data visualization?
