It\u2019s not easy to increase sales when other people offer products that are very similar to yours.", "Have you ever wondered what makes buyers choose one seller over another if they all offer pretty much the same thing?", "You might be thinking that it\u2019s all down to the price.", "So did I, but then I couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to see whether there are other factors that come into play here.", "In this article, I step into the shoes of an online seller to see how a data-driven approach using Python programming tools can help answer this question.", "To do that, I took two steps.", "Step 1: Find an online marketplace that is rich in content about sales history. This article was written for educational purposes, so I\u2019d like to keep to name of the marketplace confidential.", "Step 2: Come up with a method that allows comparing different offers. The trick here was finding a product that comes in many similar variants and is sold by a large number of sellers. One of the most commonly sold products on the online marketplace I picked for this study is something we all use:", "In this article, I\u2019m going to ask and answer 4 questions:", "Q1. What are the average prices of our product type?", "Q2. How does pricing affect sellability?", "Q3. What are the most popular screen protector brands?", "Q4. Which brands are the most profitable?", "Python \u2014 our programming language of choice for data science.", "BTW. I also wrote two articles to help you work with Pandas, check them out:", "How to use the Split-Apply-Combine strategy in Pandas groupby", "How to handle large datasets in Python with Pandas and Dask", "The first step is finding a data source. I needed to choose an online marketplace that offers some kind of indicator of sales performance \u2014 that\u2019s how I can evaluate it against other offer features. The platform I picked provides information about the last 100 transactions.", "Note: The web crawler code content is rather extensive and will vary for different marketplace websites, so I decided not to include examples of the scraping code in this article. The Python framework for scraping and web crawling, Scrapy, offers plenty of documentation with easy-to-follow tutorials, so refer to them if needed.", "Here\u2019s a short description of how I got the data for this article:", "First, I manually searched for smartphone screen protectors on the online marketplace and started the crawling process from there. Typically, a search pattern starts with some kind of an offer list where each listing points to an item-dedicated page with more information, possibly even a list of past purchases.", "Note that you can usually harvest valuable information about the product\u2019s presentation already in the search results list (like the seller\u2019s status, points, no. of past purchases). After all, this is the customer\u2019s first exposure to the offer and it may impact their decision-making process.", "After the crawl, I ended up with two Pandas tables. The main table (df) had all of the product information, with each row corresponding to an item. The other table (sale_history), stored information about the past purchases, with each product including many rows of individual sale events data.", "I\u2019ll show you the table examples later on.", "After the data extraction step, it\u2019s time to do some cleaning and data preparation. Besides all the usual steps (removing nulls, casting columns into the right data types, etc.), there were a couple of interesting steps I\u2019d like to mention here \u2014 again, without going into the details.", "As a first step, I tend to go through individual columns with the Pandas unique() method. That\u2019s how I can see whether the values are consistent and sensible \u2014 and catch any potential issues. Then I check for data duplication by grouping rows by the column that serves as the unique identifier for a specific item \u2014 in this case I used product_id.", "One of the first things I noticed is that some product pages were linked to multiple listings in the search results page (coincidence? I don\u2019t think so!). I got rid of the duplicates, but decided to keep this information for analysis. So I created a new column with the number of listings per item first, then deleted the copies except for one:", "Another interesting problem was dealing with multiple currencies used throughout the marketplace. My raw data table contained bare price string values along with the quoted currency symbol (for example, \u2018US $1.09\u2019 or \u2018C $2.42\u2019), so I needed to extract the numeric values and unify all the price currencies by converting them to USD. Here are a few example rows before the transformation:", "Here\u2019s the code I used to transform it:", "Next, I processed the sales history table (sale_history). I performed some basic type fixes, extracted and converted prices and currencies, and filled in the null values (code not shown). I ended up with this table (again, it\u2019s just a snapshot of rows):", "To make it useful for my analysis and plotting, I aggregated the entries by date (and product_id, of course) and calculated the number of sold items and the daily selling rates. Wrapping all this into a single function allowed applying it row-wise to the data frame:", "And applying it to the sale_history dataframe:", "Finally, I merged the aggregated sales stats (sale_history_stats) into the main df table:", "Here\u2019s the resulting df table (again, only a selection of columns is shown):", "Now we\u2019re good to go. So let\u2019s begin our competitor analysis.", "Let\u2019s see how much profit we can make from screen protectors in general. How much do sellers generally charge for this type of product?", "I can analyze the prices in the marketplace and see what customers usually pay for smartphone screen protectors like this:", "And here are the two resulting histograms with overlaid additional information (code not shown):", "As you can see, most screen protectors cost about $1.15 (average ~$3.9). However, it seems that customers often prefer to chip in a few extra bucks to their purchase (average of ~$5, median $~3.8). \u2018The cheaper, the better\u2019 rule doesn\u2019t apply here.", "Based on this insight, we may assume that choosing to price our product around $4 will do the job.", "Pricing is probably the most important factor in the customer\u2019s decision-making process. Sellers often assume that a high price may discourage consumers from buying their products. Striking the right balance between profitability and affordability can become a challenge.", "Let\u2019s check how the number of sold items and daily earnings match the unit price (as a daily average):", "As expected, higher prices mean fewer sales on average. But when we look at the daily income, it seems that profits tend to increase with higher prices.", "At this point, it would be interesting to find out whether the pricing reflects the quality and/or reputation of the product. Unfortunately, that\u2019s beyond the scope of this study.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at brand names. There\u2019s a spectrum of values referring to \u201cno brand.\u201d", "So let\u2019s clean this mess up first and label them all as \u201cunbranded\u201d:", "Now I can put data into work and get a pie chart showing brand names. It indicates that the majority of the products offered on our online marketplace (c. 60 percent) has no branding (or don\u2019t indicate one) at all.", "Consumers may want to stick to a recognizable name, so let\u2019s ignore the unnamed products for a moment and focus instead on the top 20 brands offered in the marketplace that sell the highest number of products daily.", "For this, I will use our sale_history table with all the transactions data.", "Let\u2019s create a table with information about the brands offered on the marketplace:", "Next, let\u2019s see the top 10 brands that have recorded the highest number of sold items so far \u2014 create a table and plot it like this:", "One glance is enough to see that all the unnamed brands combined have accumulated the highest number of items sold. However, Spigen appears to be the runner-up in this category and dominates the market among named brand products.", "Which screen protector brands brought sellers the highest revenue in the shortest time? Let\u2019s bring the unbranded products back to the table as the picture might turn out slightly different when it comes to earnings:", "And let\u2019s visualize it on a bar chart like so:", "That should create the following graph:", "It\u2019s clear now that unbranded products aren\u2019t that profitable. Note that the order of brands changed a lot when we compare revenue instead of the total number of sold items. Brands with mid-range prices are at the top of the list now (like PureGear that costs about $9.5). And that\u2019s despite their relatively infrequent daily rate of sales (c. 1\u20132 daily).", "Answering these 4 questions showed us that \u2018quality over quantity\u2019 is probably the smartest way of crafting a sales strategy for online marketplaces.", "In this article, I focused on taking you through the data mining and preparation process to finally answer four key questions about sales trends on the online marketplace I chose for this study.", "Here are some other questions I could answer from the data:", "Luckily, I\u2019ve already done that.
