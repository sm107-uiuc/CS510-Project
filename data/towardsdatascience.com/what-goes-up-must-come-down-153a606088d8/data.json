In his own words,", "Mediocrity tends to prevail in the conduct of competitive business. [\u2026] Such is the price which industrial (trade) freedom brings.", "However, his conclusion was deeply flawed. Let me explain.", "First, what particular data did Secrist look at? He tracked performance indicators such as income and expenses of hundreds of businesses since the early 20th century. For example, he compiled a list of 120 clothing stores in 1916, ranked them by their ratio of sales to expenses, and divided that list into six groups, the top group representing the best stores and the bottom group the worst. What he expected to see was that the stores in the top group would become more successful over the years, and vice versa for the bottom group.", "However, he found the opposite: the rank of the top companies would always go down, and the rank of the bottom companies would go up in the following years. He found this pattern across the board in all of the industries he looked at. Secrist explained this pattern with market competition: companies would look up to the top performer in their industry and aim to outperform them or steal some of their market share, causing the top performer to do worse in the next year.", "Sounds reasonable? Well, here is the flaw in his reasoning. Secrist fell victim to what we call today the regression fallacy. What he observed was not the result of competitive market forces, but really a statistical effect, namely regression to the mean.", "Regression to the mean is, despite its name, really a selection effect. Here\u2019s a very simplified example. Consider 600 people throwing dice. About 100 of them will likely throw a 6. Now let everyone throw their dice a second time, what will happen? Of course, the vast majority of the selected 100 initial 6-throwers will now throw a number smaller than 6, simply because it is more likely (namely 5 times more likely). Would you suspect that some mysterious force caused the initial 6-throwers to lose their dice \u2018skills\u2019 in the second round? Of course not.", "Back to Secrist\u2019s list of businesses. The top businesses in his ranked list are those who threw the sixes: they were doing exceptionally well in part because of skill but also in part because they were lucky. Just with the dice throwers, we should not be surprised if the majority of the top-group businesses perform more moderately in the following year.", "The first to call out Secrist\u2019s flawed conclusion was mathematical statistician Harold Hotelling, who pointed out that regression to the mean entirely explains the results. In Hotelling\u2019s words,", "\u201cThe thesis of the book, when correctly interpreted, is essentially trivial.\u201d", "Ouch. Hotelling put it even more bluntly when he said that Secrist\u2019s work was analogous to \u2018proving\u2019 mathematical multiplication rules by arranging elephants in rows and columns, and then repeating the same exercise for various animals.", "Psychologist Daniel Kahneman tells the story of when he attempted to teach a group of flight instructors from the Israeli Air Force that praise is more effective than blame for promoting learning. One of the instructors disagreed: in his experience, flight cadets that performed exceptionally well and were subsequently praised performed worse the next time, while cadets that performed exceptionally badly and were subsequently blamed performed better the next time. For him, this was proof that blame, not praise, was the better tool to promote learning.", "Kahneman realized that the instructor\u2019s conclusions were flawed by neglecting regression to the mean. In his own words,", "This was a joyous moment, in which I understood an important truth about the world: because we tend to reward others when they do well and punish them when they do badly, and because there is regression to the mean, it is part of the human condition that we are statistically punished for rewarding others and rewarded for punishing them.", "The point here is that it is expected that exceptional (either positive or negative) performance will most likely be followed by more moderate performance the next time. This is a mathematical fact. Humans however desire to know a reason for things to happen, a narrative, such as the flight instructor\u2019s narrative that blame works and praise does not.", "In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman argues that we humans have two different \u2018systems\u2019 for thinking: the fast, intuitive, animal-like System 1, and the slow, deliberate, cognitive System 2. Narratives, such as the flight instructor\u2019s praise/blame explanation, are the result of System 1 processing information. Identifying regression to the mean in the results on the other hand requires the more deliberate and thoughtful System 2.", "Here\u2019s another example for the regression fallacy. The Scared Straight program, which was pioneered in the United States and adopted in other countries around the world, took juvenile offenders on tours of prisons, where they met inmates who told them about the prison life that would await them if they would not stop their criminal ways. It received high reputation by policy makers and parents, and was the topic of 1978 documentary directed by Arnold Shapiro.", "But did the program work? It appeared that it did: one representative program, in New Orleans, found that after participating in Scared Straight, participants were arrested for crimes half as often than before.", "But, again, think about regression to the mean. Of course, if you take a group of juvenile offenders, you are selecting a sample of the worst-behaved kids in the community. And those kids will likely behave a little bit better (or get caught a little less) next year, simply by chance.", "Given the effects caused by regression to the mean, the only way to get a meaningful evaluation of the program then is a randomized trail, in which you compare juvenile kids that went through the Scared Straight program with juvenile kids that did not. Professor James Finckenauer, from the Rutgers School of Criminal Justice, was the first to perform such a study in April 1978. Based on the data, he concluded that kids who attended the program were in fact more likely to commit crimes in the future than those who did not. Scared Straight had the opposite effect of what it was designed for.", "In 2000, Anthony Petrosino and collaborators published a meta-analysis of a number of controlled research studies, all pointing in the same direction. Scared Straights simply does not work. Petrosino highlights the dangers of evaluating programs such as this one without randomized trials.", "Again, think about Kahneman\u2019s two systems: \u2018Juvenile kids will get scared if they visit a real prison, and as a consequence they will behave\u2019 is a great narrative, and our System 1 loves narratives. It takes the more analytical System 2 to actually look at the data and find the truth. The narrative turned out to be nonsense.", "Some things in life, such as chess, are inherently deterministic, where the outcome directly reflects a player\u2019s skill level. However, most things in life are not like chess, they contain a deterministic component (skill) as well as a random component: business performance, test scores, arrest rates, heart health, success of a sports team, or book sales are some examples.", "Whenever something has a random component, it will exhibit regression to the mean, which can fool us if we are not aware of it. Exceptional performance will most likely be followed by more moderate performance, yet our automatic System 1 will always be quick to find a simple narrative that explains this pattern. This is the regression fallacy. Be aware of that \u2014 think with your System 2.", "Find more of my stories on my profile page, for example:", "Your home for data science.
