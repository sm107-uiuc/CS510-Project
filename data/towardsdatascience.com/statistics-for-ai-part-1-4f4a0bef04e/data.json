The inputs that we deal with-picture, sound, color, etc, have to be converted to numbers so that they can be understood and processed by the computer. In ML, the vector is an array of numbers. One example of a vector would be X=[x1, x2, x3,\u2026.., xn]. Similarly, tensors can be defined as an array of numbers with a dimension greater than 2. The color image is an example of a tensor as it has a dimension of 3-length, width, channels. A scalar is considered as a 0th order tensor and the vector is considered as a 1st order tensor. A point to be noted here, often a 60X60 pixel image(60 taken as an example), or a matrix of 60X60 is unrolled into a single column matrix of size 3600. Matrix is considered to be a 2nd order tensor. Video data can be regarded as a 4th order tensor-Nx X Ny X 3 being the 3 dimensions and time being the 4th dimension.", "Video data can be regarded as a 4th order tensor-Nx X Ny X 3 being the 3 dimensions and time being the 4th dimension. At any given instant, if we wish to know the value of a particular pixel, 4 parameters must be specified: pixel x position, pixel y position, the channel it belongs to, and the time instant. In absence of any one of the parameters, the exact value of a pixel cannot be determined.", "Matrix addition is achieved by adding the values in position(i,j) of one matrix A with another matrix B to get a resultant matrix C. Now, at times, the dimension of one matrix may not match with the other, like the example in the above image where the dimension of matrix A is 2X3 and that of B is 1X3. Now if we use NumPy library or MATLAB, broadcasting is done, which means a duplicate row of matrix B is created and then the addition is carried. Like addition, matrix multiplication happens over all the elements of the matrix as denoted in the above image: over the values of k \u03a3 A(i,k)B(k,j).", "Hadamard product is an element-wise product between the two matrices in operation. For this to happen, the matrix should have the same size as one another. The dot product of the matrices in operation always yields a scalar product. For the dot product of the two vectors to happen, transpose of one vector(a.T)should be multiplied with the other vector(b). Transpose is an operation in which the rows and columns interchange i.e A(i,j)=B(j, i). The inverse of A is A-1 only when A \u00d7 A-1 = A-1 \u00d7 A = I.", "The reason we use norms is that it tells us how big a vector or a tensor is. Norms basically do the mapping of a vector or a tensor to a scalar value. In the above figure, the vector v which has the coordinates(3,4) has a magnitude of 5. We can say that the norm of vector v is 5.", "As discussed earlier, a 60X60 image is unrolled into a single column vector, say V1. The vector V1 holds the pixel values of 3600 positions in the image. Similarly, a vector V2 will have pixel values of a 2nd image. These vectors are plotted on the graph on the right side of the image. By calculating the difference between the two vectors and taking its norm, we can conclude how closely the two images are related. Smaller the difference, greater is the similarity between the images and vice-versa. Norms are a way of measuring the length of vectors, matrices, etc.", "If a vector whose length is 0 is a 0 vector mathematically, the norm is function f that satisfies the following three properties:", "The second equation is also referred to as the triangle inequality which states that the length of two sides is greater than the third side.", "Here, the two vectors x and y have a resultant vector x+y which will always satisfy the triangular inequality rule. Any scalar multiplication(alpha) to the input vector will result in direct multiplication of the scalar with the norm of the vector. In the figure below, the formula for the euclidian norm, 1-norm, p-norm, and the infinite norm is mentioned.", "A linear combination of the set of vectors{V1, V2, V3,\u2026, Vn} is given by multiplying each vector by a corresponding scalar coefficient and adding the results i.e \u03b11V1+\u03b12V2+\u03b13V3+\u2026..+\u03b1nVn", "In the figure below, the vector V3 can be seen as the linear combination of vectors V1 and V2. V3 can be represented as the sum of the two vectors V1+2V2. Also, matrix multiplication can be interpreted in terms of linear combination of columns.", "The span of a set of vectors is the set of all vectors obtainable by a linear combination of the original vectors.", "As seen from the image above, the span of coordinates (1,0) and (0,1) is the entire 2D space. Any vector can be written as a linear combination of V1 and V2. Similarly, the span of coordinates (0,0,1), (0,1,0), and (1,0,0) is the entire 3D space as any vector can be represented by the linear combination of the above three vectors. The span of all columns of a matrix is called the column space. The equation AX=B has a solution only if B lies in the column space of A.", "Further topics will be covered in the subsequent blogs.
