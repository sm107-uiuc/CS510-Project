In the previous post, we talked about the challenges in an extremely rare event data with less than 1% positively labeled data. We built an Autoencoder Classifier for such processes using the concepts of Anomaly Detection.", "However, the data we have is a time series. But earlier we used a Dense layer Autoencoder that does not use the temporal features in the data. Therefore, in this post, we will improve on our approach by building an LSTM Autoencoder.", "In the following, we will go directly to developing an LSTM Autoencoder. It is recommended to read Step-by-step understanding LSTM Autoencoder layers to better understand and further improve the network below.", "About the data problem in brief, we have real-world data on sheet breaks from a paper manufacturing. Our objective is to predict the break in advance. Please refer to Extreme Rare Event Classification using Autoencoders for the details on the data, problem, and the classification approach.", "In our problem, we have a multivariate time-series data. A multivariate time-series data contains multiple variables observed over a period of time. We will build an LSTM autoencoder on this multivariate time-series to perform rare-event classification. As described in [1], this is achieved by using an anomaly detection approach:", "LSTM requires few special data-preprocessing steps. In the following, we will give sufficient attention to these steps.", "I like to put together the libraries and global constants first.", "As mentioned before, LSTM requires a few specific steps in the data preparation. The input to LSTMs are 3-dimensional arrays created from the time-series data. This is an error prone step so we will look at the details.", "The data is taken from [2]. The link to the data is here.", "As also mentioned in [1], the objective of this rare-event problem is to predict a sheet-break before it occurs. We will try to predict the break up to 4 minutes in advance. For this data, this is equivalent to shifting the labels up by two rows. It can be done directly with df.y=df.y.shift(-2). However, here we require to do the following,", "We develop the following function to perform this curve shifting.", "We will now shift our data and verify if the shifting is correct. In the subsequent sections, we have few more test steps. It is recommended to use them to ensure the data preparation steps are working as expected.", "If we note here, we moved the positive label at 5/1/99 8:38 to n-1 and n-2 timestamps, and dropped row n. Also, there is a time difference of more than 2 minutes between a break row and the next row. This is because, when a break occurs, the machine stays in the break status for a while. During this time, we have y = 1 for consecutive rows. In the provided data, these consecutive break rows are deleted to prevent the classifier from learning to predict a break after it has already happened. Refer [2] for details.", "Before moving forward, we clean up the data by dropping the time, and two other categorical columns.", "LSTM is a bit more demanding than other models. Significant amount of time and attention may go in preparing the data that fits an LSTM. However, it is generally worth the effort.", "The input data to an LSTM model is a 3-dimensional array. The shape of the array is samples x lookback x features. Let\u2019s understand them,", "First, we will extract the features and response.", "The input_X here is a 2-dimensional array of size samples x features. We want to be able to transform such a 2D array into a 3D array of size: samples x lookback x features. Refer to Figure 1 above for a visual understanding.", "For that, we develop a function temporalize .", "To test and demonstrate this function, we will look at an example below with lookback = 5 .", "What we are looking for here is,", "This is straightforward with the sklearn function.", "For training the autoencoder, we will be using the X coming from only the negatively labeled data. Therefore, we separate the X corresponding to y = 0.", "We will reshape the X\u2019s into the required 3D dimension: sample x lookback x features.", "It is usually better to use a standardized data (transformed to Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation 1) for autoencoders.", "One common standardization mistake is: we normalize the entire data and then split into train-test. This is incorrect. Test data should be completely unseen to anything during the modeling. We should, therefore, normalize the training data, and use its summary statistics to normalize the test data (for normalization, these statistics are the mean and variances of each feature).", "Standardizing this data is a bit tricky. This is because the X matrices are 3D, and we want the standardization to happen with respect to the original 2D data.", "To do this, we will require two UDFs.", "Why didn\u2019t we first normalize the original 2D data and then create the 3D arrays? Because, to do this we will: split the data into train and test, followed by their normalization. However, when we create the 3D arrays on the test data, we lose the initial rows of samples up till the lookback. Splitting into train-valid-test will cause this for both the validation and test sets.", "We will fit a Standardization object from sklearn. This function standardizes the data to Normal(0, 1). Note that we require to flatten the X_train_y0 array to pass to the fit function.", "We will use our UDF, scale, to standardize X_train_y0 with the fitted transform object scaler.", "Make sure the scale worked correctly?", "A correct transformation of X_train will ensure that the means and variances of each column of the flattened X_train are 0 and 1, respectively. We test this.", "All the means and variances outputted above are 0 and 1, respectively. Therefore, the scaling is correct. We will now scale the validation and test sets. We will again use the scaler object on these sets.", "We will, first, initialize few variables.", "We, now, develop a simple architecture.", "From the summary(), the total number of parameters are 5,331. This is about half of the training size. Hence, this is an appropriate model to fit. To have a bigger architecture, we will need to add regularization, e.g. Dropout, which will be covered in the next post.", "Now, we will train the autoencoder.", "Plotting the change in the loss over the epochs.", "Similar to the previous post [1], here we show how we can use an Autoencoder reconstruction error for the rare-event classification. We follow this concept: the autoencoder is expected to reconstruct a noif the reconstruction error is high, we will classify it as a sheet-break.", "We will need to determine the threshold for this. Also, note that here we will be using the entire validation set containing both y = 0 or 1.", "Note that we have to flatten the arrays to compute the mse.", "Now, we will perform classification on the test data.", "We should not estimate the classification threshold from the test data. It will result in overfitting.", "In Figure 4, the orange and blue dot above the threshold line represents the True Positive and False Positive, respectively. As we can see, we have good number of false positives.", "We see approximately 10% improvement in the AUC compared to the dense layer Autoencoder in [1]. From the Confusion Matrix in Figure 5, we could predict 10 out of 39 break instances. As also discussed in [1], this is significant for a paper mill. However, the improvement we achieved in comparison to the dense layer Autoencoder is minor.", "The primary reason is LSTM model has more parameters to estimate. It becomes important to use regularization with LSTMs. Regularization and other model improvements will be discussed in the next post.", "In the next article, we will learn tuning an Autoencoder. We will go over,", "This post continued the work on extreme rare event binary labeled data in [1]. To utilize the temporal patterns, LSTM Autoencoders is used to build a rare event classifier for a multivariate time-series process. Details about the data preprocessing steps for LSTM model are discussed. A simple LSTM Autoencoder model is trained and used for classification. Some improvement in the accuracy over a Dense Autoencoder is found. For further improvement, we will look at ways to improve an Autoencoder with Dropout and other techniques in the next post.", "It is recommended to read Step-by-step understanding LSTM Autoencoder layers to clear the LSTM network concepts.", "Disclaimer: The scope of this post is limited to a tutorial for building an LSTM Autoencoder and using it as a rare-event classifier.
