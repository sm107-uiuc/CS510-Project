It is now time to take a step forward.", "In this tutorial, we will learn about implementing multi-threading and multi-processing approaches using Python. These approaches guide the operating system to make optimum utilization of one\u2019s system hardware and hence make the code execution efficient.", "Quoting Wiki \u2014 In computer architecture, multi-threading is the ability of a central processing unit (CPU) (or a single core in a multi-core processor) to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently, supported by the operating system.", "Given concurrency, one can initiate parallel execution of multiple processes and achieve faster runtime. Without going into the technical details (google and read about GIL), one thing to keep in mind is that multi-threading is more efficient when performing I/O based tasks like downloading images and files. On the other hand, multi-processing is better suited for CPU based tasks that are computationally intensive.", "To implement multi-threading, we will be using Python\u2019s standard library, threading. The library comes by default with standard Python installation and hence can be imported directly in our code.", "For demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-threading, we will be downloading 5 images from Unsplash. Let us observe the execution time when we download these images sequentially:", "As can be observed, a complete download of 5 images took 51.4 seconds. Also, a new download started only after the previous download has ended. Let us now see how multi-threading can improve code performance.", "Until step 2, all our threads (main thread and parallel threads) were under parallel execution. In such a scenario, the main thread execution can complete much before the parallel threads. To avoid this, joining the parallel threads to the main thread is inevitable. This will ensure that the execution of the main thread completes only after the completion of parallel threads. The following diagram explains these 2 scenarios:", "As can be seen, the execution time to download images has gone down by close to 50% (25.6 seconds approx.). The above example showcases how multi-threading can be helpful in I/O operations and improves the efficiency of the download/upload processes.", "Unlike multi-threading which executes multiple threads in a single process, multi-processing initiates a new parallel process for every task. As mentioned above, it delivers considerable improvement in runtime for CPU intensive tasks, tasks requiring heavy computations.", "Multiprocessing is another standard library which enables multi-processing feature in Python. To understand it\u2019s functionality, we will call a computationally intensive function multiple times. The function used for demonstration purpose calculates the square of numbers from 1 to 10 million. This function is executed in parallel 8 times. Let\u2019s observe the performance of this function under normal circumstances.", "The sequential execution of the demo function took a total of 21.2 seconds. Now let\u2019s check the performance uplift when this is done in a multi-processing setup.", "Under a multi-processing framework, the execution time dropped by 50% to 11.6 seconds. In sequential processing, a single CPU core is utilized at a time whereas, in multi-processing, all the system cores are utilized in parallel. The CPU usage screenshots demonstrate the same:", "Each line in the above graph represents a CPU core. Notice how in sequential execution, a single core is triggered for every function call where as in parallel execution, all the cores are triggered at once.", "From the above scenario, we could see how multi-processing can be a great weapon to fight against in-efficient code performances.", "In this tutorial, we kept our focus on improving the code performance by making optimum utilization of our system hardware. In the next installment, we will demonstrate specific programming practices to improve code performance.", "I hope this tutorial was informative and you learned something new.", "Will try and bring more interesting topics in future tutorials.
