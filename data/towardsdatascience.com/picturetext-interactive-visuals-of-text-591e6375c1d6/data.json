Yet the tools we use to read have largely remained unchanged.", "When researching a topic, reading the news or trying to get an update on an event, we tend to follow a T-shaped process.", "We want to understand, from a body of documents:", "The hunter-gatherer equivalent for information collection.", "Solving this would be a tremendous step forward in how we consume information and I will definitely NOT be able to solve it by the end of this article. My aim is, however, to propose an approach for a tiny step forward.", "What I am proposing here is a utility tool which helps us explore large collections of text quickly. I call it PictureText (silly name but WIP).", "Given a set of short documents (think news headlines) it can group them into hierarchical groups that semantically belong together. The interactive treemap allows the reader to explore each group in more detail by going deeper into a hierarchy and dynamically pulling out of it when needed.", "The approach is intended for grouping large sets of non-domain specific short texts. For instance: news headlines, natural language questions and social media posts would be good candidates.", "This is largely the result of mixing three tools which I will talk about more later. Credit goes mostly to: the SBERT, plotly and fastcluster teams as I simply stitched the pieces together.", "Check out the colab notebook and GitHub for results and examples seen in the article.", "I remember a couple decades ago when I first went to the gym instructors will just tell me how to lift things and that would pretty much be all the theory. They knew those answers mostly from their instructors and personal experience. Obviously some of this would be wrong and have unintended consequences.", "Btw, at the time, I used to go to the gym because I thought that\u2019s how you can get girls to be more interested. Now, I know that writing good code is the way to do that, so I don\u2019t bother with the gym.", "Anyway, at least, back then you would have a finite discussion on what to do and how and can move on to the actual exercise. Now, there are blogs and different metrics and theory, etc. It is really never ending. Which is\u2026 great: progress and all that, I love it, don\u2019t get me wrong. (Don\u2019t want to anger the digital gods or they will put me at the bottom of the endless scroll!)", "Ok, back to the nerdy bit. The point is: too much text, we want less text but retain quality and understanding. For instance by now Medium knows pretty much what I want to read and prods me to do that. But is that all? Is it most of it? Or is it just the tip of the iceberg? No way to know. And what is ALL I want to know anyway? Do I even know that? (the digital gods obviously know but I would like to know too)", "To start small I will \u2018borrow\u2019 the SBERT documentation example for clustering. Consider the sentences", "They represent a minimal example of the problem we discussed. We can see there is definitely a \u2018food\u2019 topic, a \u2018movie\u2019 topic and some \u2018other\u2019 topics. I also slightly extended the examples with some examples of my favourite fast food.", "Using ML and NLP there are a number of ways to group them. For instance, with unsupervised learning we could assign them into groups of similarity based on some representation (using SBERT here). Something like what you see in the picture below where the size of each box reflects the size of each group. Each group is represented by a single sentence belonging to it (more on that later)", "Such grouping already requires a number of assumptions and can go terribly wrong. For instance, the colour coding aims to suggest how well a summary title fits each group with blue being good and red not so good (more detail to follow), you can see that for bigger groups it is more difficult to get a good fit and a summary that provides a good representation.", "What we do not see is that the mentions of pizza and pasta are also part of the \u201cburger\u201d group. Also, \u201cWoman watches TV\u201d is assigned wrongly to the \u201ccat\u201d theme on the right but we can\u2019t see that. In a real world setting we would have thousands of examples for each group so figuring out that some of the \u201ccat\u201d mentions involve women watching TV is going to be even more difficult to disentangle.", "Most of the common clustering approaches will end there. What would help, however, would be if we can drill into a group of interest and see some more granular segmentation. This is how HAC can help. It gives us the ability to iteratively group each observation with the closest group of its peers, see the picture below for the same example via HAC.", "This is very useful because we now not only know how the sentences can be grouped together but also how: the \u201cburger\u201d ones are somehow closer, the \u201cmovie\u201d ones too. The \u201cburger\u201d ones are connected first amongst them and then are most closely related to pizza and pasta. The further to right of that chart we move, the further away are things from one another, i.e. the connection between the two movie mentions at the top is much more obvious according to HAC (and, you know, common sense) than the connection between the different burger mentions \u2014 the movie ones are basically equivalent, whereas the latter kind of talk food but are very different statements.", "Notice how we no longer have any particular clusters, at each step we only reduce the number of overall groups by one by joining the two closest groups or individual pieces of text with one another. There is no clear notion of level 1, level 2, etc.", "We might be tempted to try and summarise some sections but it is not clear exactly which to use in order to do so.", "Consider what the same would look like using PictureText.", "It uses the tree-like diagram (a.k.a. dendrogram) from before and assigns a layer to some fixed number of splits to the data. For instance, if we want our data to split in groups of three in each layer, we will start by going down the dendrogram right to left until we find the first good split of three (if some of the three are tiny, e.g. consisting of just one sentence, we might continue to split into 4 or 5 instead, until we have three decent sized splits). Next, we simply repeat the step within each of the groups we found for as deep as we want this split to go or until we run out of sentences (in practice, I found that with about 6 splits exhausts my attention span and gets to well formed small groups. Notice that due to the power-law growth here after 6 splits we will have 3\u2076 ~ 700 clusters that\u2019s\u2026 quite a few to fit in one picture).", "Each group is represented by a box in the picture above and a title. Within, we would have the next set of 3\u20135 splits.", "As you might imagine, this grouping is far from perfect. Since we haven\u2019t told the algorithm in any explicit way how to group the titles we are just using the only the knowledge of language and semantics that the text representation provides us (more on that below) to come up with grouping. What is useful is to see when are we very confident in the grouping and when not. In unsupervised cases we can use the similarity of the members of a cluster. If on average all members are very similar to the summary, the summary is also a good representation of the group, and vice versa.", "This part is a bit more technical, if you feel like seeing some examples instead you can skip to the next part.", "The code-base uses some reasonable default settings. The \u201dBring your own\u201d batteries options allow you to use your own method of representing the text (i.e. text embeddings) as well as your own way of summarising text as well as tweak how many layers and clusters per layer you see. More examples in the github repo.", "Hopefully, at this stage it all still makes sense. We will now do the same but with some real data. Luckily, tensorflow datasets gives us a number of datasets to get us started quickly.", "The approach to visualisation works well on grouping large sets non-domain specific short texts. For instance: news headlines, natural language questions and social media posts would be good candidates.", "I will use examples here from the datasets respectively:", "Check out the colab notebook and github for results and examples and you can follow along", "CNN-DailyMail is a well researched summarisation dataset consisting of news articles and a \u2018highlights\u2019 text which works as the summary benchmark and typically consists of 1\u20133 sentences. This makes a good candidate for what we want to do.", "I took the first 10k \u2018highlights\u2019 from the data selecting only their first sentence and ran PictureText on it.", "The top level split shows most sections as slightly amber, meaning below average within-group similarity. The smaller one to the bottom right seems a bit more promising with about 500 (ca 5%) docs about what seems like a \u2018sports\u2019 theme.", "Zooming into the \u2018sports\u2019 theme, we see more mentions of game results across football (actual football) and tennis, etc.", "In general, colour-coding blue should work well.", "It is difficult to extract meaning from the biggest topics as they currently summarise a whole chunk of 1\u20132k articles with one sentence. However, picking the middle one, there are some similarities in the content within. A theme of hacks and scams seems to appear:", "There are also plenty of cases, where things make little sense. The middle tile of the same picture mixes news about the Orlando park attack, the great British bake-off, etc.", "As a rule, the way to deal with issues like that would be to drill deeper into a group until a more \u2018blue\u2019 collection of titles appears, this one making more sense.", "The SQuAD dataset is one of the standards for evaluating quality of question answering models. However, it is difficult to get a good sense of what sort of questions we are dealing with as a whole, what works and what doesn\u2019t. We could sample individual questions, or do some distributions of words, etc. but nothing that really gives a good overview easily.", "Similar results can be seen with Questions. At the top level the split makes little sense judging by the questions contained within each of the top three buckets.", "However, digging into one of those \u2018what era utilised Greek Theories\u2019, we see a lot of questions about time periods of history. Digging deeper into those, there also seems to develop some more narrow themes. For instance, one can follow a thread about Slavic / Russian timelines & events. In one other thread, however, we jump from historic topics to questions about TV history such as \u2018when did season five air?\u2019 \u2026 so be wary\u2026", "I really like the results overall and the tool achieves a lot with few lines of code. I hope it can be useful for visualisation, data exploration and even some discussions on data content. However, it obviously has its limitations, here are a few of the things to keep in mind when using this.", "Generic BERT-based models tend to be trained on data derived from the internet, hence they are not ready out of the box for domain specific usage. One of the experiments I performed, was with the CORD dataset, a dataset of COVID-19 research papers. The results seemed very good at first, as many cluster similarities were well above 80% on average \u2014 an indication of very good within cluster agreement.", "However, looking at the actual results, it seemed that articles had little in common. The CORD dataset is obviously focussed within the medical domain and even within that it is very narrow to virology. I presume the algorithm found many tokens which were unknown which can cause misleading results.", "The data science part can and will, as always, go wrong. I have included very basic default approaches with the notion that those can be swapped over for more sophisticated ones as needed", "In an attempt to deal with some of the above, here are some of the possible directions:", "I have developed a simple tool to produce hierarchical clustering of text, generate simple summaries on each level of the grouping and utilise a treemap tool to visualise results. I think this is a powerful method both for data scientists but for anyone who wants to explore large text collections quickly and without much customisation. Open tools such as contextual text representation via SBERT, hierarchical clustering via fastcluster and the interactive tools that plotly power the heavy lifting.", "Check out the colab notebook and GitHub for results and examples seen in the article.", "There are many limitations as with any tool of this kind. Particularly, some of the clusters generated at the onset might be outright confusing.", "However, I hope it is useful to many as it is driven by a long time mission of mine \u2014 one of clicking things while reading\u2026", "Special thanks to Rich Knuszka for valuable feedback.", "Hopefully, this was useful or \u2026 curious (either the good or bad curious).
