A tried-and-tested strategy is to start by spreading out the pieces so they may be taken in with a glance. Then we sort them into recognizable groups, first of edge pieces and then by color. Grouping the pieces according to some pre-defined shared attribute helps us perceive how they may relate to one another, and facilitates solving the puzzle. Clustering in data science follows a similar process.", "Clustering seeks to find groups of objects such that the objects in a group are similar to one another, yet different from those in other groups. It is often used as an intermediate analytical procedure to help in the classification of a variable of interest. For example, I used a K-means algorithm to classify e-commerce customer activity in a previous article, with the classification later feeding into an econometric model. However, clustering can also be useful in itself, by revealing the structure and associations among a seemingly random collection of objects.", "Although clustering falls under the rubric of \u201cunsupervised learning\u201d, we still need to determine the all-important attributes or features with which to organize the objects, i.e. the color of jigsaw puzzle pieces. How might the objects in a group be \u201csimilar\u201d to one another, and how might they be \u201cdifferent\u201d from those in other groups?", "In this case study, I use clustering to understand how various currencies might be grouped in terms of their behavior to global financial market factors. There are numerous clustering algorithms, each with its own merits and demerits. How we decide on a particular algorithm depends on the trade-offs we seek, guided by domain expertise of the subject in question and an understanding of the data in hand.", "Given that I have no a priori view of how many clusters there should be, the popular K-means algorithm is ruled out straightaway. Moreover, partitioning algorithms such as K-means or Affinity Propagation work best with hyperspherical clusters that occupy roughly similar-sized segments of the dimensional feature space, which is likely not the case with currencies.", "A key consideration in the context of macro financial data such as the currency market indeed is that the clusters in the feature space might be of varying densities and radii. In other words, the strength of the relationship within groupings of currencies is likely to vary substantially across groups, as might the spatial dimensions of the groupings. For example, if we group currencies by geographic proximity, which is the general practice, some relationships will be very close (i.e. Euro and Swiss franc) but some will be much looser (i.e. Singapore dollar and Indonesian rupiah).", "A density-based algorithm such as DBSCAN might not work as well in this context. Moreover, DBSCAN likely won\u2019t work optimally with the sample size in hand because the algorithm requires a minimum number of objects within a defined neighborhood to be considered a cluster, and the minimum needs to be at least equal to the number of features plus one. It is in fact not unusual to set the minimum number of observations per cluster at double the number of features when running the DBSCAN algorithm. As I will discuss below, the sample size is only 31.", "I instead turn to agglomerative hierarchical (AH) clustering. Agglomerative clustering is a bottom-up algorithm that starts by taking each object as its own cluster. It then merges the two nearest clusters into a larger group, and continues until all the objects are contained in a single giant cluster. The result is a set of nested clusters organized as a hierarchical tree (or dendrogram), arising from individual objects to a single overarching cluster.", "The dendrogram framework allows us to examine if certain clusters might be closely or distantly related to other clusters. For example, if we are clustering images, we might be interested not only in a \u201cflower\u201d cluster, but sub-clusters of \u201croses\u201d or \u201ctulips\u201d within it. One major disadvantage of this algorithm is that it tends to be slow in analyzing large high-dimensional datasets, but this is not an issue in this particular case.", "The AH algorithm utilizes various methodologies called \u201clinkages\u201d to calculate the distance between two clusters, and they can often produce rather different outcomes. The chart below from scikit-learn shows the four most popular linkages, and their results on a number of \u201ctoy\u201d datasets. I will run the analysis using the Average, Complete and Ward linkages, and compare the outcomes. The Single linkage performs badly on noisy data, and since this is likely to be the case with financial market data, I will not utilize this particular method.", "I took the daily spot exchange rates of the 29 most widely traded currencies, plus the daily prices of gold and silver, from January 2017 through December 2019. I did not include any pegged currencies, such as the Danish krone or Hong Kong dollar, as that would be pointless for the purposes of this exercise. The sample size is 31. There were a total of 781 trading days in the sample period. Some currencies had missing data due to various national holidays, and I took the expedience of \u201cforward filling\u201d the missing data.", "This type of data is easily available from various sources, and I took mine from Bloomberg. For uniformity, all exchange rates, including gold and silver, were rendered in terms of their value to US$1. In common FX market format, it would be rendered as \u201cUSD/XXX\u201d with XXX being the quote currency. A fuller explanation is available here. Think of it as a see-saw from the USD or left-seater\u2019s perspective. When the USD/XXX exchange rate shifts down, USD\u2019s value drops while XXX\u2019s value rises. When the USD/XXX exchange rate shifts up, USD\u2019s value rises while XXX\u2019s value drops.", "As for the features on which to undertake the clustering, I considered the various factors that are frequently cited by FX market participants to influence FX market behavior, and picked what in my view are the three key features.", "The first is a currency\u2019s beta to the broader US dollar (USD) trend (i.e. equivalent to the \u201cCAPM beta\u201d). The USD is the world\u2019s foremost reserve currency, and the most widely traded currency by far. The default exchange rate for almost every currency in the world is quoted against USD. How a currency moves vis-\u00e0-vis the broader USD trend is always a key factor in how market participants perceive and trade it. I use the beta to the US Federal Reserve\u2019s broad trade-weighted USD (labeled \u201cusd_beta\u201d) as the proxy for this attribute.", "The second is a currency\u2019s correlation to global equity markets. In the FX market, it is common to pigeonhole various currencies as being either \u201cpro-risk\u201d or \u201csafe haven\u201d, depending on how they behave in times of rising equity markets and during market sell-offs. I thus use the correlation to the MSCI All-Country World Index (labeled \u201cequity_corr\u201d) as the second feature.", "The third is a currency\u2019s implied volatility, which can differ widely from one currency to another, even in calm markets. For example, the South African rand (ZAR) tends to be a lot more volatile than say the Taiwan dollar (TWD) across market conditions. I picked each currency\u2019s 3-month 25-delta implied volatility (labeled \u201cvol\u201d) as the third attribute.", "The two chief feature engineering tasks were to compute each currency pair\u2019s beta to USD and correlation to MSCI. The CAPM beta is traditionally calculated from simple percentage returns. The procedure involved a linear regression where each currency pair was regressed on the broad trade-weighted USD. The beta is essentially the regression coefficient.", "To work out the MSCI correlations, on the other hand, I first calculated the daily returns then log-transformed them. Pearson correlations are a linear measure, and I used the log returns to reduce the likely distributional skew of daily FX returns. This method enhances the linearity in the relationships between each currency\u2019s returns series, and allows for the appropriate estimation of their linear correlations. I won\u2019t get into a detailed discussion of the differences between beta and correlation, except to note that the former implies a causal relationship while the latter does not.", "The end result of the feature engineering process was a matrix of the three features: usd_beta, equity_corr, and vol. When looking at the matrix on the left it is useful to note again that all the currency statistics are in terms of their respective values to US$1.", "So \u201ccny\u201d at the top of the list is actually USD/CNY, for example. The corresponding usd_beta of 0.5580 implies that a 1% rise in the trade-weighted USD will drive USD/CNY higher by 0.5580%.", "The equity_corr of -0.2680 means that there is a moderate negative relationship in the (log) daily returns between the MSCI ACWI and USD/CNY, implying that the Chinese yuan tends to appreciate when global equities rise (i.e. a lower USD/CNY means USD dropping against CNY).", "The above matrix itself makes for some good explanatory data analysis (EDA). Let me just discuss a couple of points to illuminate the findings. The South African rand (zar or USD/ZAR) had the highest positive usd_beta reading, and also the most negative equity_corr reading. What this means is that USD/ZAR would move by a larger quantum than the shift in the broader trade-weighted USD, whether up or down. At the same time, the pair tended to move strongly (relative to the rest of the data) in the opposite direction to the MSCI index. So when global equities tumbled, the South African rand tended to depreciate (i.e. higher USD/ZAR).", "On the flipside, the Japanese yen (jpy or USD/JPY) had the highest positive equity_corr. By contrast, most currencies in the sample had negative equity_corr readings of various degrees, except for jpy, the Swiss franc (chf or USD/CHF), and gold (au$). The yen also had a relatively low usd_beta. Not for nothing is the yen known to FX market specialists as a safe haven currency that tends to appreciate in bad global market conditions.", "The most crucial point, however, is that the three features are not fully correlated to one another. The Colombian peso (cop), for example, had a moderate usd_beta, among the most negative equity_corr and a relatively high vol. But the euro had a usd_beta of approximately one, a near zero equity_corr and a mid-to-low vol. Silver (ag$) meanwhile had the highest vol on the list and a very high usd_beta, yet also a near zero equity_corr. The features\u2019 correlation matrix is shown below, though there is admittedly an elevated positive correlation between the vol and usd_beta features.", "If the data is not particularly high dimensional, like in this case, it is always recommended to start the analysis with data visualization. It is akin to spreading out jumbled jigsaw puzzle pieces at the outset. Visualization using scatterplots can provide an immediate understanding of whether the data is suitable for clustering analysis. If the data points show no obvious distinct groupings, then clustering is likely not appropriate.", "Happily in this case, there is visual confirmation of clustering behavior in the various two-dimensional scatterplots. We are only using three dimensions in this case, so it\u2019s still possible to visualize the objects in their natural habitat, so to speak. It can be difficult for the human eye to discern how data points in 3D space are distributed in a static plot, and it is recommended to use an interactive plot for this purpose. Two snapshots of the 3D scatterplot are below, with the left in the original axis order and the right with the values inverted. The 3D scatterplot confirms the clustering behavior.", "The AH clustering algorithm starts with every object as its own individual cluster. The algorithm calculates the \u201cdistance\u201d between every pair of objects in the dimensional feature space, and merges the two closest ones. I will jump ahead in the narrative here to show the resulting dendrogram (laid on its side) from the Complete linkage below. Having a visual at hand will assist in understanding the clustering process.", "In this case, EUR and RON were the first currencies to be grouped into a cluster of two. The EUR-RON cluster then became a singular observation, and the algorithm recalculated the pairwise distances across all observations in the multi-dimensional space. The second grouping was formed by ILS and CNY. The process went on, and the various clusters were merged into ever-larger clusters from left to right in the dendrogram, culminating in a universal cluster encompassing all the currencies in the sample.", "One insight from the AH process is how each currency behaves vis-\u00e0-vis its geographical neighbors. There is a strong tendency by currency market participants to group currencies by geography or region, but how might currencies in a particular region behave differently or similarly to their geographical neighbors?", "We notice that the Asian currencies formed a distinct cluster before distance=2, though this cluster also included ILS and CAD. On the other hand, AUD and NZD (the Australasian currencies) quickly clustered among a bunch of mostly European currencies. This first glance at the issue suggests that geographical proximity is no guarantee of behavioral similarities.", "The Complete linkage produced the highest cophenetic coefficient at 0.6410, and hence its dendrogram was highlighted above. The Ward linkage by contrast had the lowest score on this measure. A perennial question with clustering analysis is how do we determine the correctness of the clusters we obtain, in terms of both the numbers of clusters and their relevance?", "Some of the evaluation metrics require \u201cground truth labels\u201d, basically we need to know the \u201ctrue\u201d clusters in order to make a comparison. This is obviously not helpful in cases where we do not have a priori knowledge of the right number of clusters, much less the \u201ctrue\u201d cluster labels.", "One rule of thumb is to cut the stems of the dendrogram with a line (vertical in this case) where they traverse the maximum distance without intersecting a cluster merging point. In the above Complete dendrogram it would be somewhere between distance of 4 and 5, and the result would be three clusters of currencies. The result would be one very large cluster, and two rather puny ones, and I have my doubts whether this is the best outcome.", "A popular scoring measure of intra-cluster consistency is the Silhouette Coefficient. The Silhouette Coefficient score is bounded between -1 for highly uncertain clusters and +1 for highly dense clusters. Scores closer to zero indicate increasingly overlapping clusters. Thus, the Silhouette Coefficient is higher when clusters are dense and well-defined.", "I computed the Silhouette Coefficient scores across various numbers of clusters, and four clusters emerged with the top score across all three linkages. Moreover, the final four clusters were the same, whether using the Average, Complete or Ward linkage. It therefore did not appear to matter ultimately which linkage method was used to determine the final clusters.", "Thus, I settled on four clusters. The pairplots of these four clusters against each feature are below. It is the same chart as the 2D scatterplots above, but this time with the various clusters labeled. Also refer to the dendrogram above for the constituents of the various clusters.", "The cluster of TRY, ZAR and silver is distinguished primarily by their extremely high vol and usd_beta values (\u201cCluster 0\u201d in blue). This is a strong contrast to the JPY, CHF and gold cluster, which had mid-to-low usd_beta, low vol and positive equity_corr (\u201cCluster 2\u201d in yellow). There is also a cluster of mainly Asian currencies (\u201cCluster 3\u201d in green), and it is distinguished from the FX grouping in \u201cCluster 1\u201d (in red) by having generally lower usd_beta and vol values by comparison.", "We can also compare the 3D scatterplot of these four clusters against the original unlabeled one above to see how the AH algorithm has grouped the various objects in their natural 3D habitat.", "Beyond the Silhouette scores, we should also evaluate the distributions of the feature attributes in each cluster. To recap, clustering is about grouping objects such that they are similar to one another in a group, and dissimilar from those in other groups. This implies distinct distributions of at least some feature values between clusters.", "It is therefore crucial that we are able to understand what attributes the objects in each cluster share, and how this might differentiate them from other clusters. In this way, we may hopefully gain an understanding of whether it makes sense to cluster the objects in the manner we have chosen. This is especially important if the clustering analysis was truly an unsurpervised learning project to understand new data.", "The summary statistics of the chosen four clusters are below. A statistical approach to evaluating the cluster distribution could take the form of running two-sample t-tests across clusters for each feature, or ANOVA when the number of clusters is three or more. In particular, I use Welch\u2019s t-test that does not assume equal variances between the two samples. A visual approach to contrast and compare the cluster distributions is through boxplots.", "The boxplots below for the usd_beta feature suggest that Cluster 0 is unambiguously distinct from the others on this attribute. Cluster 3, comprising mostly Asian currencies, has the lowest mean usd_beta of all, but the distribution has some marginal overlap with Cluster 2. There is also some overlap in the distributions between Clusters 1 and 2. The t-tests confirm that Cluster 0 has a mean usd_beta value that is statistically different (with p-value < 5%) from all the others. Cluster 1 and Cluster 3 also demonstrated a statistically significant difference between their mean usd_beta values.", "The boxplots below for equity_corr indicate that this attribute clearly distinguishes Cluster 2 from the rest. It is in fact the only cluster with positive equity_corr values. There are large overlaps between Clusters 0, 1 and 3 that are so obvious that running t-tests would be an overkill. In any event, t-tests demonstrate that Cluster 2 has a mean equity_corr value that is statistically different (with p-value < 5%) from the others. Let\u2019s call this the \u201csafe haven cluster\u201d comprising gold, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.", "Finally, the boxplots for the vol feature suggest that Cluster 0 is again unambiguously distinct from the others on this attribute. The overlap between Clusters 1 and 2 is obvious, and there is some marginal overlap in the distributions between Clusters 2 and 3. The t-tests confirm that Cluster 0 has a mean vol value that is statistically different (with p-value < 5%) from the rest. Cluster 1 and Cluster 3 also showed a statistically significant difference between their mean vol values.", "The statistical findings show that Cluster 0 (TRY, ZAR & silver) is distinguished statistically by extremely high usd_beta and vol values. Cluster 2 (JPY, CHF & gold) is distinguished by positive equity_corr values. Cluster 3 (mostly Asian FX) tends to have the lowest usd_beta and vol values, but with some marginal overlap on these attributes with Cluster 2. Cluster 1, on the other hand, is the \u201cinbetweener\u201d cluster, particular on usd_beta and vol, with usd_beta values generally higher than 1.0 compared to Clusters 2 and 3. All the t-test statistics are available on my GitHub page with link below.", "Despite clustering analysis being a much-hyped form of \u201cunsupervised learning\u201d, real world analysis requires significant guidance from the outset. Domain expertise, or at least an appreciation of the subject matter is of crucial help in determining the features on which to run the clustering analysis. An understanding of the data in hand is also required to help narrow the choice of clustering algorithms.", "I collected daily data from 2017 through 2019 on the most widely traded 31 global currencies, including gold and silver, but excluding pegged currencies. The goal was to cluster these currencies in terms of their behavior. Three features noted for their impact on the global currency market were selected: usd_beta, equity_corr and vol. I also picked the agglomerative hierarchical (AH) clustering algorithm for its appropriateness, given the aims of the exercise and the nature of the data. Exploratory data visualization using scatterplots pointed to the likelihood of clustering behavior.", "I then proceeded with AH clustering, which resulted in the same two through four clusters across the Average and Complete linkages, with the latter having the highest cophenetic scores. Four clusters in turn produced the highest Silhouette Coefficient scores, across all three linkage methods. Inter-cluster evaluation followed using two-sample t-tests and boxplots, which demonstrated the relevance of the three chosen attributes in segmenting the sample of global currencies.", "The results show that geography is of limited utility in clustering global currencies in terms of their behavior to common financial market factors, except perhaps for non-JPY Asian currencies. The USD beta offered the best differencing factor across the four clusters, followed by implied volatility, and lastly by equity market correlation. However, one cluster (\u201csafe haven cluster\u201d) was distinguished primarily by having the only positive equity correlation values.", "(The full Python code for this exercise is available at my GitHub page.)", "If you saw value in reading articles like this, you may subscribe to Medium here to read other articles by me and countless other writers.
