Apple is constantly in need of creative, passionate, and dedicated data scientists that can sit on any number of their teams. From its researched-based artificial intelligence development team at Siri to cloud-base architecture development team at iCloud, Apple has slowly but steadily been building data science teams to handle the avalanche of data accumulated on a daily basis.", "Interested in a specific skillset interview guide? Check out our in-depth analysis of SQL, machine learning, python, and product data science interview questions.", "As with other big tech companies, the role of a data scientist at Apple varies a lot and is dependent on the teams you are assigned to. The actual title of data scientist at Apple functions as the closest thing to a full-stack data scientist. This means the job will require everything from analytics to machine learning software design to plain engineering.", "Given Apple is a huge multi-conglomerate, the data science skillset used will vary by teams as there are many analytics teams across various divisions like marketing, finance, sales, etc as well as more machine learning and deep learning based teams on products and services like Siri, cloud services, and even hardware.", "Apple, for the most part, prefers to hire applicants with at least a few years of experience under their belt as a data scientist. The requirements are as follows:", "Technically speaking, there are no specific types of data scientists that apple hires. Apple hires based on different team\u2019s needs and skills needed. There are data scientists that work on largely analysis work, across many divisions as well as machine learning heavy roles. Depending on the teams, the functions of a data scientist at Apple may include:", "The interview process at Apple is pretty standardized. The interview process starts with a preliminary phone screening by HR, then a hiring manager interview to assess further interest and role fit along with a brief technical phone screen. Finally, there is maybe a take-home assignment depending on seniority and position type before an on-site interview.", "The next step is the technical hiring manager phone screen and possibly a take-home challenge. The technical hiring manager screen is done in a shared coding environment.", "The questions in the technical screen are general Python exercises, SQL questions, and data science reasoning questions. It is important to talk through your thought process in the technical screen and communicate your assumptions clearly. Here your ability to make use of basic data structures and algorithms concepts are tested. The key skill required here is the ability to provide a comprehensive solution and swiftly analyze the runtime complexity of the solution.", "The Apple data science take-home challenge is given with a set time limit of three days to complete. Usually, the challenge will be a machine learning problem to build a model and make a prediction off of a dataset.", "Example Apple Data Scientist technical screen questions:", "We\u2019re given a table of product purchases. Each row in the table represents an individual user product purchase.", "Write a query to get the number of customers that were upsold by purchasing additional products.", "Note that if the customer purchased two things on the same day that does not count as an upsell as they were purchased within a similar timeframe.", "Try solving this question on our interactive SQL editor", "The last step is the on-site interview. The interview panel consists of 5 to 6 interviews usually on the team of the position that is being interviewed for. Each interview consists of one to two interviewers with a lunch arranged on the Apple campus with the hiring manager. Note that while it may be an informal setting, the lunch interview is very much the cultural fit part of the interview.", "Your home for data science.
