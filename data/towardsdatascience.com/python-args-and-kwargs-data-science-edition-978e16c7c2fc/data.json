Today we\u2019ll go through both and show their use cases in your average machine learning task.", "Both *args and *kwargs allow you to pass multiple arguments (hence args) and keyword arguments (hence kwargs) to a function. We\u2019ll explore this in much more details in a minute.", "The ideal reader is someone familiar with the basics of Python programming language and interested in data science. The second part is optional because the first two-thirds of the article revolves only around the programming language itself.", "The article is structured as follows:", "With that being said, let\u2019s start with the first concept \u2014 *args.", "Let\u2019s say you want to declare a function for summing numbers. There\u2019s one problem with this function by default \u2014 it only accepts a fixed number of arguments. Sure, you can get around this by using only a single argument of type list \u2014 and that\u2019s a viable alternative. Let\u2019s explore it for a bit.", "Down below we have your regular function for summing numbers, expecting a single argument of type list:", "We can use it to find the sum:", "But what if you don\u2019t want to use a list? *args to the rescue:", "Yes, I hear you \u2014 this isn\u2019t the best use case since we can use lists as a replacement. But we have a couple more examples under our belt \u2014 the first being unpacking.", "The idea of unpacking is to, well, unpack any iterable object. The single asterisk * is used to unpack any iterable, and the double-asterisk ** is used only for dictionaries. You\u2019ll quickly get the gist of it.", "Let\u2019s say we have the following list:", "The process of unpacking it is straightforward \u2014 and already covered by our nifty sum_numbers() function:", "In a minute or so we\u2019ll talk about dictionary unpacking \u2014 for now, let\u2019s wrap this section with list concatenation.", "Another useable aspect of *args is list concatenation. Let\u2019s say we have two lists:", "How would we concatenate them into a single list? If your answer is somewhere along the lines of iterating through both and storing values to the third list, then you\u2019re not wrong (per se), but there\u2019s an easier and more elegant option. Take a look at the following code:", "And that\u2019s how easy it is. Let\u2019s move along to **kwargs, something a bit more applicable to your everyday data science tasks.", "As mentioned earlier, **kwargs are used to unpack dictionaries. Without much ado, let\u2019s see how one would use them.", "For this simple example, let\u2019s say you want to multiply 3 numbers, but those come from some external source and are stored as key-value pairs. The keys are always identical (obviously), but the values change.", "Down below is your super-sophisticated backend code:", "And here\u2019s the data you got:", "Now, one could take a naive approach and do something like this:", "But as always, there\u2019s a simpler solution. Let\u2019s take the moment to appreciate the beauty of the code below:", "That was simple, clean, and elegant \u2014 as Python was intended to be. I\u2019m sure some ideas are already popping in your head about potential use cases for data science tasks, but let\u2019s quickly go over dictionary concatenation before jumping into the good stuff.", "The idea is basically the same as with lists. Down below we have two dictionaries:", "To concatenate them into a single dictionary, all we have to do is the following:", "The only gotcha you should be aware of is key duplication. If you have the same keys in two or more dictionaries, upon concatenation the value of the ladder is used.", "Now comes the part you\u2019ve been waiting for \u2014 a concrete example in an everyday machine learning task.", "As promised, we\u2019ll use **kwargs to imitate the process of model training. Let\u2019s imagine the following scenario \u2014 you\u2019ve gathered and prepared data, and now would like to do some regression task\u2014 let\u2019s say with the Random Forests algorithm.", "Down below are your imports and initialization:", "As you don\u2019t know the optimal values for the hyperparameters, you decide to do a Grid Search. We won\u2019t do that here, but after performing it you\u2019d have optimal parameters inside of the best_params_ attribute. The following dictionary imitates it:", "The naive approach here would be to rewrite parameter names and values in another Random Forest initialization.", "We\u2019re smarter than this. We know about **kwargs and how they can be used to unpack dictionaries, so we can do the following:", "Do you see how elegant that was?", "Not only that, but you\u2019re also reducing the chance of possible errors in other projects, in case you only copy-paste the code and forget to change the values.", "And here\u2019s where the story ends \u2014 at least for today. We\u2019ve covered a lot, so let\u2019s do a quick recap.", "As a data scientist, being aware of what your programming language of choice can offer can be a decent bonus. The examples covered by this article were by no means groundbreaking, but we\u2019re sure they\u2019ll help you to reduce the amount of code, or to make the code look more elegant \u2014 or both.", "Thanks for taking a couple of minutes of your day and reading until the end.
