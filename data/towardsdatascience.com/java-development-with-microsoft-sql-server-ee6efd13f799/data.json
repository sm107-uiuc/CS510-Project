Accessing an Oracle database via a Microsoft .NET application and vice-versa, accessing Microsoft SQL Server from a Java-based application is common. In this post, we will explore the use of the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API to call stored procedures from a Microsoft SQL Server 2017 database and return data to a Java 11-based console application.", "The objectives of this post include:", "To access data, many enterprise software organizations require their developers to call stored procedures within their code as opposed to executing static T-SQL (Transact-SQL) statements against the database. There are several reasons stored procedures are preferred:", "For brevity, I will use an existing and well-known Microsoft SQL Server database, AdventureWorks. The AdventureWorks database was originally published by Microsoft for SQL Server 2008. Although a bit dated architecturally, the database comes prepopulated with plenty of data for demonstration purposes.", "For the demonstration, I have created an Amazon RDS for SQL Server 2017 Express Edition instance on AWS. You have several options for deploying SQL Server, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or installed on your local workstation.", "There are many methods to deploy the AdventureWorks database to Microsoft SQL Server. For this post\u2019s demonstration, I used the AdventureWorks2017.bak backup file, which I copied to Amazon S3. I then enabled and configured the native backup and restore feature of Amazon RDS for SQL Server to import and install the backup.", "For the demonstration, I have added four stored procedures to the AdventureWorks database to use in this post. To follow along, you will need to install these stored procedures, which are included in the GitHub project.", "Using the latest Microsoft JDBC Driver 8.4 for SQL Server (version 8.4.1.jre11), we create a SQL Server data source, com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDataSource, and database connection, java.sql.Connection. There are several patterns for creating and working with JDBC data sources and connections. This post does not necessarily focus on the best practices for creating or using either. In this example, the application instantiates a connection class, SqlConnection.java, which in turn instantiates the java.sql.Connection and com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDataSource objects. The data source\u2019s properties are supplied from an instance of a singleton class, ProjectProperties.java. This class instantiates the java.util.Properties class, which reads values from a configuration properties file, config.properties. On startup, the application creates the database connection, calls each of the example methods, and then closes the connection.", "For each example, I will show the stored procedure, if applicable, followed by the Java method that calls the procedure or executes the static SQL statement. For brevity, I have left out the data source and connection code in the article. Again, a complete copy of all the code for this article is available on GitHub, including Java source code, SQL statements, helper SQL scripts, and a set of basic JUnit tests. Use the following command to git clone a local copy of the project.", "To run the JUnit unit tests, using Gradle, which the project is based on, use the ./gradlew cleanTest test --warning-mode none command.", "To build and run the application, using Gradle, which the project is based on, use the ./gradlew run --warning-mode none command.", "Before jumping into stored procedures, we will start with a simple static SQL statement. This example\u2019s method, getAverageProductWeightST, uses the java.sql.Statement class. According to Oracle\u2019s JDBC documentation, the Statement object is used for executing a static SQL statement and returning the results it produces. This SQL statement calculates the average weight of all products in the AdventureWorks database. It returns a solitary double numeric value. This example demonstrates one of the simplest methods for returning data from SQL Server.", "Next, we will execute almost the same static SQL statement as in Example 1. The only change is the addition of the column name, averageWeight. This allows us to parse the results by column name, making the code easier to understand as opposed to using the numeric index of the column as in Example 1.", "Also, instead of using the java.sql.Statement class, we use the java.sql.PreparedStatement class. According to Oracle\u2019s documentation, a SQL statement is precompiled and stored in a PreparedStatement object. This object can then be used to execute this statement multiple times efficiently.", "In this example, the average product weight query has been moved into a stored procedure. The procedure is identical in functionality to the static statement in the first two examples. To call the stored procedure, we use the java.sql.CallableStatement class. According to Oracle\u2019s documentation, the CallableStatement extends PreparedStatement. It is the interface used to execute SQL stored procedures. The CallableStatement accepts both input and output parameters; however, this simple example does not use either. Like the previous two examples, the procedure returns a double numeric value.", "The calling Java method is shown below.", "In this example, we use almost the same stored procedure as in Example 3. The only difference is the inclusion of an output parameter. This time, instead of returning a result set with a value in a single unnamed column, the column has a name, averageWeight. We can now call that column by name when retrieving the value.", "The stored procedure patterns found in Examples 3 and 4 are both commonly used. One procedure uses an output parameter, and one not, both return the same values. You can use the CallableStatement to for either type.", "The calling Java method is shown below.", "In this example, the procedure returns a result set of type java.sql.ResultSet, of employees whose last name starts with a particular sequence of characters (e.g., \u2018M\u2019 or \u2018Sa\u2019). The sequence of characters is passed as an input parameter, lastNameStartsWith, to the stored procedure using the CallableStatement.", "The method making the call iterates through the rows of the result set returned by the stored procedure, concatenating multiple columns to form the employee\u2019s full name as a string. Each full name string is then added to an ordered collection of strings, a List<String> object. The List instance is returned by the method. You will notice this procedure takes a little longer to run because of the use of the LIKE operator. The database server has to perform pattern matching on each last name value in the table to determine the result set.", "The calling Java method is shown below.", "In this last example, we pass two input parameters, productColor and productSize, to a stored procedure. The stored procedure returns a result set containing several columns of product information. This time, the example\u2019s method iterates through the result set returned by the procedure and constructs an ordered collection of products, List<Product> object. The Product objects in the list are instances of the Product.java POJO class. The method converts each results set\u2019s row-level field value into a Product property (e.g., Product.Size, Product.Model). Using a collection is a common method for persisting data from a result set in an application.", "The calling Java method is shown below.", "You will notice in all T-SQL statements, I refer to the schema as well as the table or stored procedure name (e.g., {call [Production].[uspGetAverageProductWeightOUT](?)}). According to Microsoft, it is always good practice to refer to database objects by a schema name and the object name, separated by a period; that even includes the default schema (e.g., dbo).", "You will also notice I wrap the schema and object names in square brackets (e.g., SELECT [ProductNumber] FROM [Production].[ProductModel]). The square brackets are to indicate that the name represents an object and not a reserved word (e.g, CURRENT or NATIONAL). By default, SQL Server adds these to make sure the scripts it generates run correctly.", "The application will display the name of the method being called, a method description, the duration of time it took to retrieve the data, and any results returned by the method.", "This post is certainly not about SQL performance, demonstrated by the fact I am only using Amazon RDS for SQL Server 2017 Express Edition on a single, very underpowered db.t2.micro Amazon RDS instance types. However, I have added a timer feature, ProcessTimer.java class, to capture the duration of time each example takes to return data, measured in milliseconds. The ProcessTimer.java class is part of the project code. Using the timer, you should observe significant differences between the first run and proceeding runs of the application for several of the called methods. The time difference is a result of several factors, primarily pre-compilation of the SQL statements and SQL Server plan caching.", "The effects of these two factors are easily demonstrated by clearing the SQL Server plan cache (see SQL script below) using DBCC (Database Console Commands) statements. and then running the application twice in a row. The second time, pre-compilation and plan caching should result in significantly faster times for the prepared statements and callable statements, in Examples 2\u20136. In the two random runs shown below, we see up to a 5x improvement in query time.", "The first run results are shown below.", "The second run results are shown below.", "This post has demonstrated several methods for querying and calling stored procedures from a SQL Server 2017 database using JDBC with the Microsoft JDBC Driver 8.4 for SQL Server. Although the examples are quite simple, the same patterns can be used with more complex stored procedures, with multiple input and output parameters, which not only select, but insert, update, and delete data.", "There may be some limitations of the Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server you should be aware of by reading the documentation. However, for most tasks that require database interaction, the Driver provides adequate functionality with SQL Server.", "This blog represents my own viewpoints and not of my employer, Amazon Web Services.", "Your home for data science.
