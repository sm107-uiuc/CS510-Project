I had released an update to a process through email to the team. In October, I emailed one half of the team to complete the update. The next month, I emailed the other half to complete the update with a reminder to the first group. The goal was that by the end of each month, the groups would complete the tasks so that starting in December, we would be moved over to the new process. I had assigned deadlines in both emails and waited to hear back.", "By December, I had not heard back from over half of the individuals. Meaning, they had most likely not done what I had asked, and we were behind schedule. At this point, the team asking for the process update decided that all individuals need to convert to the new process by the end of January. At this point, I was at a loss. I felt like no one was listening to me.", "I didn\u2019t know what to do, and the response I was getting back from people was the task was not a priority to them, so they would not do it.

People should respect the decisions you are making, listen to the actions outlined, and follow through with the expectations to drive the work\u2019s completion.", "We continued to talk, and he advised me to send another email. I told him I had already provided a call to action, a deadline, and the expected output. In the next email, he recommended I add in a list of names and highlight the ones in red who have not completed it. Call out the individuals who had not confirmed the completion of the task. I had seen others do this on my team, so I took the recommendation and tried again. Within the hour of sending the email, I had a handful of individuals reach out to confirm they had, in-fact, made the change, bringing the total to 75% completing the request by the end of the day.", "Stepping into this role has come with its challenges, but my biggest challenge was getting people to drive action to my requests. After talking with my manager, I sat with his advice for a while and thought upon it.", "If you are stepping into a leadership role and requesting something from your team, you are simply doing your job.
