A platform is a business model that creates value by facilitating exchanges between 2 or more interdependent groups \u2014 usually consumers and producers. Some examples of platform businesses are Uber, Apple, Microsoft, Alibaba, Facebook & Tencent.", "While traditional businesses follow the linear model, owning inventory that shows up in their balance sheets, platforms operating model (POM) is solely focused on building and facilitating a network, not owning the means of production.", "While platforms operating model offers the potential to deliver greater value to customers though better customer experience, faster delivery, reduced system downtime and most importantly of all \u2014 potential 10x growth, traditional businesses tend to face a unique set of challenges when replicating the operating model of the technology world.", "For an airplane to safely take off and land, various components in the ecosystem such as airports, trained pilots, plane controls, systems must work together seamlessly.", "Similarly, for the Platforms Operating Model to work, components for a successful organisational transformation must be present, the 3 key areas are:", "Essentially, having people, process & technology in place are all but enablers to increase information flow across the organization to improve business decisions making (external) & optimize processes (internal).", "In the 2nd half of the article, I will elaborate on how data instrumentation is vital in delivering these objectives.", "One might think that there are no direct linkages between organizational transformation & data \u2014 this notion is far from true. Data driven transformation can accelerate organizational change when executed well. For example, by measuring agility metrics as a proxy to team performance and embedding it into the KPIs of teams, it forces leaders & teams to be aware of how they are working and if they are working in a way that is effective & agile.", "In addition, having data instrumentation in initiatives throughout the firm signals the commitment to be data driven company wide \u2014 indirectly, this helps to utilize the network effects to gradually change mindsets \u2014 especially for executives who are FOMO.", "In most advance technology firms, buzz words such as chatbot, site reliability engineering, data visualizations, error budget & web analytics are often mentioned and products are built with these principles in mind. When teams across the company speak the right language, it clearly signals the commitment to be data driven.", "Finally, having a standardized mode of exchange & interaction across platforms to draw resources from each other is extremely important. To effectively create value in the platforms world, leaders need to have some visibility of backlog to prioritise work according to platform business objectives. Transparency must start from the team level, then to platform level and finally cross platforms to facilitate resource utilisation. There are many tools & methodologies that helps support such tasks such as (JIRA, Planner, Kanban Boards, Wonderwall). When transparency is present, organizations can then look to have the right cross platform interaction systems.", "With the right set of people, process & technology in place, organizations can move towards achieving 3 outcomes:", "1) Best in class product innovation resulting from cross platform interaction & fast data availability. For example, leading platform innovators like Amazon are taking fast data to the next level by testing delivery to vehicles, optimizing deliveries to changing locations. This involves highly connected cross functional logistic & analytic team\u2019s capabilities to coordinate processes that can deliver such results.", "2) Well managed ecosystem balancing supply & demand. Having effective processes in place constructs a strong feedback loop within the ecosystem which self-optimizes & make automated decisions. For example, Uber\u2019s surge pricing is a good case of balancing both consumer and drivers by finding the right pricing model at any given time.", "3) Finally, perhaps the most important objective of the whole transition is to improve customer experience. By having intervention to resolve blockers, it seeks to achieve higher customer satisfaction. For example, FedEx uses traffic data to determine optimal delivery route to get parcel to customers on a timely basis, reducing delay time.", "While the platforms business model can potentially help traditional business achieve 10x growth. It requires a major revamp of traditional thinking which involves breaking functional silos, being product focused and setting up the right architecture, which is by no means an easy task for transformation teams.", "Your home for data science.
