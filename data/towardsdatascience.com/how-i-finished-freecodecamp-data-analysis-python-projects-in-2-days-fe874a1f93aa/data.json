The certification is fully project-based, and the lectures are totally optional.", "This article will solely focus on the final projects, which I decided to test myself with in my after-hours.", "Disclaimer: the estimated course duration is 400 hours (lectures + projects); I have ~3 years of working with Python as a Data Analyst, and while I solely focused on the projects to complete the certification, I have certainly invested upwards of 400 hours in my Python programming journey.", "If you are just starting out, I definitely recommend going through the FreeCodeCamp lectures and putting the estimated time in, as in the long run it will benefit you way more than merely obtaining the certificate.", "The focus of the challenges(to be honest, they are more self-contained than fully fledged projects, and thus the name \u201cchallenge\u201d feels more appropriate here) is more around building self-contained pieces of functionality (i.e. Python functions that analyze data and return either a numerical or visual output) rather than building a massive workflow. In this regard, the setup is not too dissimilar from that of classic coding challenges, although these are probably a bit longer.", "Each challenge is tested against various unit tests which challenge your code under different conditions.", "This is not massively different from the work a Python data analyst will find himself/herself doing once on a project, where you will be potentially tasked to explore the data and answer several questions connected to the business problem at hand.", "The packages you will be using will be mostly numpy and/or pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib and/or seaborn for data visualization.", "Goal: \u201cCreate a function named calculate() that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.\u201d", "Considerations: this felt like the easiest challenge in terms of time, but it is definitely important as it touches some of the key building blocks and concepts of the numpy package, which are of fundamental importance for many complex computations in the data science realm, where you will be working with matrix and array-type data a lot and will need to reshape it and mold it constantly during the data processing pipeline.", "Approach: discover and leverage numpy\u2019s built in functions", "Key concepts: data reshape, axis targeting, numpy arrays", "Goal: \u201cUse Pandas to answer various questions about a Census-based dataset\u201d", "Considerations: This is a classic data analysis challenge where you are given a dataset and need to answer various questions as you explore it. To do so, you will make the most of Pandas\u2019 data manipulation methods, and learn new ones along the way.", "Approach: Convert the general questions into Pandas methods; chain them together to get to the final answer", "Key concepts: Categorical frequency counts and distributions, grouping and reshaping data, filtering and sorting, KPI calculation", "Goal: \u201cVisualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas\u201d", "Considerations: This is a classic data visualization challenge where you are given a medical dataset and need to plot categorical and correlation matrix -type plots, while making use of some popular packages like seaborn, but also of less known methods such as \u201cmasking\u201d a correlation matrix using numpy indexing methods in combination with array data. I had never been exposed to this concept myself and spent quite a bit of time researching useful tips on Stack Overflow. Definitely a neat one.", "Approach: Convert the general questions into Pandas methods; chain them together to get to the final answer; render the final answer using seaborn plotting in combination with formatting arguments supported by numpy", "Key concepts: Reshaping and grouping data, outlier removal, seaborn plots, numpy masks", "Goal: \u201cvisualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots\u201d", "Considerations: Similar to project 3, with the added caveat of having to process time series data to render trends and distributions over time", "Approach: Convert the general questions into Pandas methods; chain them together to get to the final answer; render the final answer using seaborn plotting in combination with formatting arguments.", "Key concepts: Pivoting and grouping data, outlier removal, seaborn plots, time series representation", "Goal: \u201cAnalyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. Use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050 with two different regression models\u201d", "Considerations: In this project the added component of a simple regression model is introduced when working with time series data; you will make use of the SciPy package to fit a couple of regression models to estimate sea level projections. This project is a simple yet useful introductions to a statistical model, which closes off the series.", "Approach: Fit regression models two the data, and plot the predicted values over the current time-series", "Key concepts: Regression model, scatterplot, graph formatting", "Overall, the projects represent a great way to build familiarity with many common data analysis tasks and packages, and serve as a very good introduction to the field.", "Upon completion, you will receive a certificate which will enable you to build some confidence in your skills before moving on to further learning and project building.", "Access my free Data Science resource checklist here", "Your home for data science.
