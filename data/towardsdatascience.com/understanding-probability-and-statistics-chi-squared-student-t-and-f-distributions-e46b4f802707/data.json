I will attempt to explain the distributions in a simplified manner.", "This section will introduce the readers to the Student-T distribution", "Student-T is one of the most important statistical distributions to understand. It is also known as T distribution.", "Student-t distribution is heavily used in the world of statistics. In particular, where the sample size is small and/or the population standard deviation is unknown. Plus, it\u2019s important for the distribution to have a bell-shaped curve. Student-t distribution can help us obtain meaningful statistical information out from the sample. Furthermore, it is used in statistical inference.", "Student-T distribution is used when we do not have a large sample set, ~30 observations or when the standard deviation of the population is not available", "Student T is considered to be one of the biggest breakthrough distributions in statistics. It can be used to infer meaning out of smaller samples when the standard deviation of the population is unknown. This can be applied to a large number of world problems.", "The student t distribution is an approximation of normal distribution", "If we plot Student T distribution, it would look very much like a bell-shaped curve. Therefore the student-t distribution resembles a normal distribution. Furthermore, the properties of t-distribution are closer to the normal distribution. As an instance, the mean of the distribution is 0.", "The most important point to note is that the student-t distribution has fatter tails than the normal distribution. This means that there is a higher dispersion in variables.", "The most important component is the degrees of freedom which is always 1 minus the number of samples.", "Let\u2019s consider that we gather N independent observations from a normally distributed population. We can convert the distribution to the student-t distribution by applying the formula:", "What we need to do is to get the population and sample mean along with the standard deviation of the sample. In the equation above, the population is normally distributed, has a mean M and standard deviation S with n-1 degrees of freedom (df) where n is the size of the sample.", "The bigger the sample, the closer the Student T distribution will converge towards the normal distribution. The median of T-distribution is 0.", "As the degrees of freedom increases, the distribution converges towards the normal distribution. This is according to the central limit theorem.", "This sketch shows the probability distribution curve of the normal distribution and the Student-t distribution:", "Student-t is symmetric around 0. It has a lower peak than the normal distribution and has fatter tails. This means that there is a higher dispersion in the sample.", "Now the keynote to take is that if we assume that our variable has a Student t distribution then it means that the probability of us obtaining a value away from the mean is higher than it would be if we were using a sample generated using the normal distribution.", "The section will introduce the chi-squared distribution. It is pronounced as Kai-Squared distribution.", "The word squared is important as it means squaring the normal distribution. I will explain its significance in this article too.", "Chi-Squared is a continuous probability distribution. It is also used heavily in the statistical inference. We utilise chi-squared distribution when we are interested in confidence intervals and their standard deviation.", "Just like student-t distribution, the chi-squared distribution is also closely related to the standard normal distribution.", "Let\u2019s consider that we gather data for N (a number > 1) independent random variables that have a standard normal distribution. Each of the random variables has a \u03c3 standard deviation.", "If we square the distributions and sum them then the squared-sum of the distributions will have the Chi-squared distribution with N degrees of freedom.", "As we squared the normal distribution, Chi-squared distribution is always greater than 0 because all of the negative values are squared.", "It\u2019s important to note that the mean of the distribution is equal to the degrees of freedom.", "Each random variable is considered to have a 1 degree of freedom.", "As we increase the degrees of freedom, the distribution will start resembling the standard normal distribution. However, as we square the distribution values, the Chi-Squared distribution is always shifted towards the right-hand side of the y-axis as the negatives will not be present in the distribution. Subsequently, the right skewness is decreased as we add more random variables. This is again due to the central limit theorem.", "The variance and mean also increases as the degrees of freedom are increased.", "This sketch shows how Chi-Squared distribution looks:", "The area under the curve is always equal to 1.", "This section will outline the basics of F-distribution.", "F distribution is one of the most important statistical distributions to understand too. It is very closely related to the Chi-Squared distribution hence I have explained it after Chi-Squared distribution. It\u2019s also important to note that F distribution has two different types of degrees of freedom. The first degree of freedom in the numerator and the second type is the denominator degree of freedom.", "Let\u2019s assume that there are two independent random variables. The first random variable A has dA degrees of freedom and the second random variable B has a dB degree of freedom. Let\u2019s also consider that both of the random variables had chi-squared distribution. Remember, chi-squared distribution is when the random variable has a normal distribution and its values are squared.", "The ratio of the distribution, over their degrees of freedom, will have an F-distribution with degrees of freedom dA (numerator) and dB (denominator).", "F-distribution is used when we want to assess the variation in variances of two samples. If we look at the plot of F-distribution, as the degrees of freedom increase, the chart closely resembles the Chi-squared distribution.", "Additionally, the distributions are right-skewed. When we increase the degrees of freedom on the numerator, the right-skewness is decreased. Mean of the F distribution = dB/dB-1.", "We can note that the curve of the distribution depends on the degrees of freedom. It is positively skewed indicating that the mean is greater than the median.", "It is important to understand statistics and probability. If you are new to the subject and the distributions then read this article:", "This article explained the three important statistical distributions:", "Your home for data science.
