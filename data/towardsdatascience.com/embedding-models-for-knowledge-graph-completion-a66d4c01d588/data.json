In this article, we define KG as a graph where each node is an element of an entity space E and each edge is an element of a relation space R. The detailed definitions of E and R are domain-specific: for instance, in social networks, E is a set of people and R is a set of different types of relationship (relative, friend, partner, stranger). In general, E and R could contain respectively every existing entity (or concept, event, situation, etc.) and every type of relation among previous entities. Furthermore, each entity could have a variable number of attributes or properties. Given the generic definition of KG, it is often used as a synonym of knowledge base (KB) or ontology. The term ontology has many conceptualizations and implications both philosophical and technical that are not analyzed in this discussion, in fact: the definition of KG presented above is only a simplification preparatory to the paragraphs below.", "KG can be applied to a wide range of tasks in different areas of interest (both academic and industrial):", "In recent years, both academic and commercial worlds developed huge knowledge graphs: WordNet, DBpedia, Freebase, YAGO, Wikidata, Google Knowledge Graph, Facebook Graph Search, etc. Despite the very large number of entities, these graphs still have many missing or wrong edges, therefore, knowledge graph completion (KGC) is an active field of research.", "The definition of KG given above allows us to specify an edge of KG with a triplet of elements (h, r, t) \u2208 E \u00d7 R \u00d7 E where the head (h) and the tail (t) entities are elements of E and r, which is directed, is a type of relation of R. Notice that the order is important because not every relation is bidirectional. Formally, we define KGC as the task that tries to predict any missing element of the triplet (h, r, t). In particular, we talk about:", "Technically, KGC is very similar to link prediction in social network analysis: both of them try to complete an incomplete network. In addition, KGC is challenging for the following reasons:", "In order to tackle KGC, different approaches were developed in past years: for instance, entity resolution (ER), probabilistic soft logic (PSL) and knowledge graph embedding (KGE). The first one tries to group entities referring to the same underlying entity while the second approach uses probabilistic inference. Even though they are extremely interesting topics, we focus only on KGE in this article.", "The idea behind the embedding is widely used in mathematics: if we need to study properties of elements of an unknown space, we find a function that maps each element of the unknown space into a known space by preserving some relationships.", "In a KGE model we suppose the existence of two functions f_E, f_R and two natural numbers k and l such that f_E : E \u2192 \u211d^k and f_R : R \u2192 \u211d^l are embedding functions that map entities and relations into \u211d^k or \u211d^l. We will detail the construction of f_E and f_R later. Let (v_h, v_r, v_t)\u2208\u211d^k \u00d7 \u211d^l \u00d7 \u211d^k be the images of (f_E(h), f_R(r), f_E(t)). Over the embedded space \u211d^k \u00d7 \u211d^l \u00d7 \u211d^k a score function f_s: \u211d^k \u00d7 \u211d^l \u00d7 \u211d^k \u2192 \u211d is defined to measure the implausibility of a triplet (h, r, t). Hence, given a correct triplet (h, r, t) and a implausible triplet (h\u2019, r\u2019, t\u2019), it should happen that f_s(v_h, v_h, v_t) < f_s(v_{h\u2019}, v_{r\u2019}, v_{t\u2019}). In order to lighten the notation, we use directly f(h, r, t) to indicate the composition f_s(f_E(h), f_R(r), f_E(t)). In real world, we can define a priori k, l, f_s but not f_E and f_R. They are estimated by some optimization algorithms (for instance: stochastic gradient descent, L-BFGS, adaptive subgradient and adaptive learning rate method) that minimize a loss function defined by using f:", "where \u03b3 is the margin hyperparameter, P is the set of correct triplets, and", "the set of implausible or manually corrupted triplets. At this point, we can determine f_E and f_R as", "Within the KGC setting explained above, many embedding models are proposed by researchers. For instance, in TransE model (2013), embedded entities and relations are supposed to coexist in the same space (i.e. k = l) and the score function is defined as", "This implies that given a coherent triplet (h, r, t), v_t should be the nearest neighbor of v_h + v_r. The last implication is not suitable for 1-N, N-1 and N-N relations. For this reason, the TransH model is proposed in 2014. As in the previous model, embedded entities and relations still coexist in the same space but the score function is defined differently:", "where v_{h\\perp} and v_{t\\perp} are respectively projections of v_h and v_t on the hyperplane containing v_r. Thus, given w_r a normal vector to the hyperplane of v_r such that ||w_r||_2 = 1, the score function can be written as", "Taking advantage of the projections, it is possible to model different roles that each entity plays in different relations and, therefore, to overcome the issues of TransE model. Further generalizations are included in TransR model and CTransR model published in 2015 where embedded entities and relations are not elements of the same space anymore: actually, for each relation r\u2208 R, there exist a projection matrix M_r such that embedded entities are projected into its specific relation space. Hence, the score function of TransR is defined as", "This score function is slightly different in CTransR where also different aspects of the same relation are modeled by using the idea of piecewise linear regression. For the completeness of this introduction, we only mention some other KGE models without discussing them (although, the list is far from complete): structured embedding, neural tensor network, semantic matching energy model, latent factor model, TransD.", "Your home for data science.
