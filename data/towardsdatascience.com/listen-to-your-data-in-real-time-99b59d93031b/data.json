Whether it\u2019s the price of a company stock going up and down or the number of customer\u2019s sales in the quarter. We are used to identifying the pattern through the X and Y-axis in the graph.", "What about other ways to present data besides images? Data sonification or auditory display is the term used for transforming data into sound. Probably the first time it became a research field was in 1992. In that year, the book \u2018Auditory Display\u2019 was released. It was the resulting proceedings of the International Conference of Auditory Display (ICAD).", "Although the definition of sonification looks simple at first, it can also be blurred with other elements that reproduce sound. Not everything that emits sound is considered data sonification. For example, Music. Is music an example of data sonification? As an analogy, music can be compared to sonifying application response times as much as a graph of the stock market can be compared with a painting. Data sonification is all about visualizing the data underneath it; the sound must clearly allow the correct interpretation. Whereas music and painting are more subjective, there are more layers of interpretation, focusing more on the viewer or listener on how he or she can be inspired.", "Thomas Herman, 2008 proposes the below more elaborated definition:", "A technique that uses data as input, and generates sound signals (eventually in response to optional additional excitation or triggering) may be called sonification, if and only if", "The service could be used by a support team needing to monitor the infrastructure or network in real-time. The service basically accesses/reads the log files of another application (that needs monitoring), converts certain values and events into sound notes and streams them to the browser / WS caller.", "The log file content used in this sample is more for demonstration purposes. It contains only response times in milliseconds and whether an Exception or Timeout occurred. It would contain many other things in the real world, but in the end, one could parse it to get the required data.", "In terms of logic on how each value and event is converted to a sound, it is rather quite simple. Maybe, just maybe, because I\u2019m far from being a musician, and I wasn\u2019t quite creative. But I believe it is effective and follows the points described in the definition.", "These are the features in more detail:", "The service uses the following technologies/frameworks:", "Here are the main parts of the code.", "Data sonification is a great alternative to images for visualising data. When I first read about it, I admit, I was wowed by it and jumped to the internet to do more research. I had never heard it before.", "However, as I read and thought more, I began to question its practicality. Is it beneficial? Where does it really justify its implementation?", "For example, in the two cases below, I think that it\u2019s not just a gimmick but a necessity. Cases where I would see myself in need of such technology. To a less extent, the second one:", "2. Highly critical systems/networks. Especially if the support team has other tasks apart from monitoring, the amount of data can be overwhelming. It is not practical to keep looking at a screen analysing the data in real-time. Alerts/alarms are often after the fact, generate false positives, and overflow the email inbox.", "The research field is still young and has a lot to evolve. As it is more studied, we\u2019ll see more situations where it effectively applies.", "Your home for data science.
