These tips though obvious make a difference between a mediocre and an outstanding data professional. The tips discussed here are related to defining the problem, producing a good product, and personal development.", "To produce a good product you must understand what is to be built, why it is needed, with whom you are to do it, when you are to do it and where. This is basically applying the 5 Ws. Here are some questions to start with.", "What: What needs to be done and what is the business impact or justification? What are the requirements? What is your scope?", "Why: Why do you have to do it?", "Who: Who are the stakeholders \u2014 who are your end users, who are the other teams you need to work with?", "When: When must the project be complete? When would existing systems be turned off or data sets become obsolete?", "Where: Where does your product or process need to happen?", "The goal here is to get a clear and complete set of resources, requirements and timeline.", "This would guide \u2018how\u2019 you do the project. Often times you would not be able to implement an ideal solution but instead would have something between your current state and your ideal solution.", "This is research to understand the current state and available resources, and identify subject matter experts. Discovery often leads to a change in the requirements or in the approach and timeline.", "It is easy to forget that the code used to create a data output is part of the data product. To create good code:", "I. Start small and iterate \u2014 Use a small data set to quickly make sure the code runs as expected. Refine as you go. It would not be perfect and that is ok.", "II. Code checks \u2014 Try to think of what could break in your code logic and how can you be proactive about it. For some key elements create fail saves.", "III. Optimize the code \u2014 This could be the difference between 10 minute code versus 4 hour code. This is crucial especially for real time systems where clients expect an immediate response.", "IV. Comment your code \u2014 Your code should make it easy for any person to understand at a high level what is happening in each step.", "V. Establish a baseline to validate your product.", "Try to create processes or models that can be fully automated. Avoid manual inputs.", "Amount of effort and time spent testing depends on whether your changes are reversible or not. If the process once implemented is irreversible then ensure that sufficient time and attention are given to testing resilience, reliability and correctness of the process and product. Some tests that should be executed for every product include:", "Establish metrics and processes to monitor your product and alert when change is necessary.", "This is arguably one of the most important skills when working with data. Communication is crucial as it sets expectations. Communicate -", "a. With stakeholders throughout the process to refine requirements and scope.", "b. With SMEs to ensure the appropriate use of their data sets or products.", "c. With other teams involved so as know other technical specifications ex. If your process were deployed would it impact any other existing features?", "d. With your future self and with other teammates by commenting your code, versioning and documenting as much as possible.", "e. With end users and the business to set correct expectations, create service level agreements, and agree on a change process.", "Recognize that you would not always have a perfect product, nor will you always have the answer. It is often helpful to have someone to bounce ideas off of.", "Last but not the least, check periodically if your coding or problem-solving skills are improving over time. It helps to have a target in mind. For me, I generally look at and try to emulate the coding style of packages that I have found to be most helpful.", "Thanks for reading!
