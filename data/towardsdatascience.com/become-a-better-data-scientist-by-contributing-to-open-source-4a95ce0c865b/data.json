And yet, code is our craft, and at some point in your career you may want or need to learn to write production-level code. Contributing to open source can be a great way to hone your code skills, learn professional best practices, and give back to the wider tech community.", "Great, you say, but where do I start? There\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d way to get involved in open source, and there are plenty of guides to getting started on your own. But another great way to get started is by attending a sprint. Your local tech meetup group or developer conferences are just two examples of the types of groups that might host a sprint.", "The notion of sprinting comes from Agile, where instead of waiting for a product to be finalized, value is delivered to the customer as it becomes available. The idea is to work iteratively, incorporating feedback from the customer throughout the development process. An open source sprint takes this rapid-development mindset and applies it to open source code development. During a sprint:", "My first sprint, last year\u2019s WiMLDS scikit-learn sprint, was my introduction to contributing to open source software. And last week I attended the dateutil (a major pandas dependency for datetime calculations) sprint co-hosted by NYC Python and PyData NYC. In both instances, by attending the sprint I was able to make a pull request to a library that is foundational to modern data science.", "While there is some functional similarity between the two (time-limited coding, rapid problem-solving), a sprint is fundamentally different from a hackathon.", "A hackathon typically is structured to be a competition, with different teams working on different ideas, possibly over the course of one or several days (such as a weekend). Prizes may be awarded. Oftentimes the goal is to code up something completely new. A hackathon is often (but not always) self-contained, resulting in MVP that is not always further developed.", "In a sprint, however, everyone works on different bugs or issues within the same, existing open-source codebase, package, or library. A sprint may be around three hours or a half-day in duration. There are no prizes. The goal is to improve the codebase while also strengthening the community of supporting developers. It is okay and encouraged to continue working on the codebase outside of the sprint.", "The whole point of the sprint is to carve out dedicated time from your schedule to do substantial work there. In that spirit, any preparatory steps can be done at the very beginning of the sprint so long as you bring your computer and have access to the internet. Nonetheless I recommend doing the following steps before the sprint (in order of decreasing importance), in order to make the most of your sprint time.", "First, you should make sure you have Python, an IDE or preferred text editor, and Git installed on the computer you are bringing to the sprint ahead of time. You should have a Github account. Also charge your computer\u2019s battery, in case power outlets are sparse on-site. While it is possible to have a good experience at a sprint without your tools, you may be limited in what you can contribute without them.", "If you have your tools ready and you still have some time to prepare, go ahead and familiarize yourself with the project. Look at the Github repo for the project. Is there a README.md, or a style guide for contributors that you will want to refer to?", "Read the project\u2019s documentation. Does it make sense? Get a sense of what the codebase does. It is okay if you are unsure how you might contribute. Plan on showing up anyway, and plan on pair programming. Pair programming is the key to learning better software development practices.", "When you first arrive on-site, scope out the room and introduce yourself to everyone within earshot. Be friendly; ask people what they are planning to work on. If something sounds good, ask whether they\u2019d like to pair program on it!", "Documentation can be a really great place to start for a first-time contributor. If you read some code documentation for the project, and it doesn\u2019t make sense, look at the code and try to figure out what it does. Then write up your improved explanation of how it works.", "Look at the Known Issues tab in the project\u2019s Github. Someone may have already tagged the issues by difficulty. Is there an issue you think you could solve here?", "IMPORTANT \u2014 Don\u2019t be too ambitious. In fact, the less ambitious you are on your first pull request, the better. Changing a single typo will give you a good sense of the work flow required to interact with and change this codebase, which will prepare you to submit more complex edits during or after the sprint.", "Remember: Work that does not get committed to Github is the same as work that never happened at all. Decide that your goal for the sprint is to have a single pull request (it is okay if you do more). Since you are pair programming, make sure this is also the goal of the person you are working with.", "Version control issues can be messy, and you will want to await instructions from the Project Maintainer on how they want you to make changes to the project. Do they have test code you can run locally to make sure the project works on all of the versions that are supported? Does the project have a system for \u201cclaiming\u201d issues, to prevent two people working on the same issue at the same time? (Oftentimes this is done by leaving a comment on the issue, although some Project Maintainers may prefer to use Kanban boards to stay organized.)", "Fork the project into your own repo. Git clone it to your desktop to work locally. Before making any changes you will want to change your set up so that you work in your own branch (not master). If you know how to do this, great! If not, feel free to brush up on Git basics. Or, just ask someone! The best part about a sprint is that you will be co-located with other developers.", "Now that you have made your changes locally in your own branch and tested the change against any internal multi-version support tools, you are ready to make a pull request!", "Depending on the project\u2019s requirements for participation (active versus one-time contributor), remember to include a revised AUTHORS.md file in your pull request with your name and Github account added.", "Help clean up; this was most likely a volunteer-led event. Pro tip: Sticking around to help clean up empty pizza boxes is not only a great way to show your appreciation but also one last opportunity to chat with the organizers of the event. The best time to network in tech is when you don\u2019t need a job, and the second best time is when you do.", "Make sure you block off time and energy for any post-sprint socializing, which may be ad hoc rather than announced in advance. Don\u2019t be afraid to be the person that suggests heading to a bar afterward. Even if you don\u2019t drink, this can be a great way to reflect on what you did, learn from others in a social environment, become more active in the open-source community, make friends, and, of course, network.", "Your pull request might not get accepted immediately, and you may need to make some changes in order to fit the style expectations or needs of the project. Expect to take care of this within the next day or so, since it may require some back-and-forth with the Project Maintainer and it is easier to merge your changes when they refer to a recent version of the codebase.", "Then, in the coming weeks or months, write a blog post about your experiences (ahem), continue to tackle more ambitious issues since you are becoming increasingly more familiar with this codebase, and bask in the glory of being a real-life Open Source Contributor.", "Lauren Oldja is a data scientist in Brooklyn, NY.", "Your home for data science.
