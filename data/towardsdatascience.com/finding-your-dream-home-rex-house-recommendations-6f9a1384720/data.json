There is a plethora of information about listings online and it takes a long time for a home buyer to sift through to find a home that meets his or her criteria. Often, a lot of unnecessary effort is wasted searching looking for a good house even before beginning the extended process of buying a home.", "Our client, online real estate website and technology platform, REX is mindful of this problem and wants to improve the overall user experience in finding an ideal home. Our project aims to develop an application for their website that serves open-minded house-hunters with personalized matches for discovering their perfect home.", "We divided our projects into four stages. In the beginning, we focused on exploring the initial data samples we received, and identifying the datasets that would be the most helpful for our problem. We performed preliminary exploratory analysis of the data and requested additional datasets based on the result. We proceeded to develop content-based filtering and collaborative filtering models as a baseline. We found that though these models are able to recommend house listings that are very similar to what the user has previously looked at, real house hunters may feel limited by recommendations of houses with the similar quantitative features.", "We followed this by developing more advanced models like Siamese Neural Networks and Random Forests that incorporated further supervision data on users\u2019 web activities and typical REX user browsing journeys to get more sophisticated and diverse recommendation results. In the last stage of the project, we evaluated all of our models recommendations with historical user data and launched a user study to validate their performance further.", "The datasets that we used in our model come from a variety of sources including First American Assessor data, House Market Listing Property data, and samples of REX-specific datasets including, web-events data, and listing data. As the project progressed we chose to narrow our scope to mainly focus on data of listings in LA county as this is a large market for REX.", "The REX listing metadata served as our main source of information about listings \u2014 year built, sqft, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, listing price etc. This LA dataset started with 15k observations and 26 house features.", "The sample of First American Assessor data we worked with includes 200k observations and 162 features, and the House Market Listing Property sample include 42k observations and 83 features. We used these two datasets to combat issues of missingness in the REX listing data. To fill important missing features like listing price and sqft, we attempted to match with these other data sources. The joined sample data also include some interesting features such as pool_spa_types and has_jacuzzi which eventually played important roles in our recommendation models. In the end we were able to work with data on 5.5k unique LA listings.", "We also worked with a large dataset of 4.6 million web events on REX\u2019s site detailing users\u2019 interactions with REX listings. This dataset includes features such as ip address, user action (click, scroll etc), search filters enabled, event timestamps, and information on the listings that the users interacted with. To identify users, we used ip address as a proxy for unique user id.", "In addition, we also downloaded 9.5k listing images for the listings in LA county that we used for training the recommendation models as supplementary sources.", "Besides the housing features from the listings data, we also extracted image features that can represent home styles from listing images as additional features for the recommendation model to boost its performance. Since there are different numbers of images in each listing and these images include various categories, we need to build a model that first categorizes the images for each listing and then outputs a single label for each category.", "To categorize the listing images, we first used the Places365 model to classify the images as type indoor and type outdoor, and then we used the room classification model from REX API to classify the indoor room images into 6 categories (bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living room, dining room, other).", "To output a single label for each image category in any listing, we introduced the image clustering model. We extracted the second last layer features from the Places365 model, computed the first 100 PCA components of these extracted features, and then further reduced the dimension of the features by applying the t-SNE algorithm. We passed the two t-SNE components of all the images as the input data for the clustering model. For each category, we clustered all the images in that category into 3, 4, 5, and 6 groups by k-means clustering. In the end, we selected 4 clusters for our final model as it has the highest silhouette score. Now that we have clustered labels for all the images for each category in any listing, we selected one clustered label as the final feature for that category in this specific listing by majority voting.", "The final output features of this image model for each listing are a vector of 7 labels for the image categories of outdoor, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living room, dining room, and other (each label is either one of the clustered labels, or label -1 which suggests that the specific category of images are missing in this listing). We added these image features to listing metadata to be used in our recommendation models.", "Our goal was to make a model that could predict user behavior and generate personalized recommendations of interesting listings for each user. As we began exploring our data, we realized that REX users tend to exhibit very exploratory behavior \u2014 jumping around to view a variety of listings across locations and budgets.", "To assess the performance of our models, we created a temporal train/test split in our data for each user. We used the first 70% of listings each user viewed between July 2019 to November 2020 as training data, and the latter 30% of listings viewed as test data. Success for our models was defined as being able to accurately predict the held out test set of listings that were actually viewed by each user.", "As we quickly learned, creating such a model that could capture the nuances of house-hunting behavior was not an easy task, that required innovative implementations of a diverse range of models.", "We began by implementing two baseline models that are commonly used in recommendation systems. For both of the models, we used a user-level temporal split to evaluate our method on the held out test set \u2014 given the first 70% of listings a user saw, predict the last 30% of listings they engaged with. However, we soon realized that though these methods were good at identifying similar listings, this didn\u2019t mean they were necessarily good at being able to mimic and capture the exploratory browsing behavior we were hoping to model.", "Recommend other listings similar to listings that the user likes", "We began by building a content-based filtering model using listing data and web-interaction data. For each user, we then aggregated a list of all of the houses that they interacted with online. This group of listings came to represent the overall interest/preference of the user. After that, we compiled a list of candidate homes that matched their website search criteria (filters including preferred property types, preferred baths range, and preferred beds range) that they had not seen yet. We then made a matrix of cosine similarities between each of the user\u2019s preferred/interacted listings and each of the candidate listings, and recommended those with the highest average cosine similarity score.", "Use similarities between users and listings simultaneously to provide recommendations", "We further worked to design a collaborative filtering recommendation system that recommends homes based on a user\u2019s previous preferences and is informed by other users with similar preferences. Unlike content filtering, this model relied exclusively on web event data, and does not take into account listing metadata such as price or sqft.", "In order to generate an explicit collaborative filtering model, we required a score or rating for each user-listing interaction. We were able to generate a proxy for this score by categorizing user actions into 4 levels of intent (where actions like scrolling or clicking were low intent and requesting a tour or using mortgage calculator were higher intent). We then used a used an inverse multiplier based on the frequency of each action level (for example scrolls, which are very common, get a small multiplicative weight, whereas rare actions like schedule a tour get higher weight) to aggregate all of a users engagements with a listing into a final score that was bound between 1 and 6.", "We used these scores to set up a user-item interaction matrix. To perform collaborative filtering we investigated various matrix factorization methods such as SVD and NMF which decompose the scores matrix into reduced forms (3 or 2 matrices respectively) that encode latent information about user-listing relationships. This decomposition is generalized with regularization such that the reconstruction loss is minimized. Using the factorization, expected ratings can be estimated for unseen listings upon reconstruction.", "We further attempted an implicit collaborative filtering approach in hopes of addressing concerns about introducing bias with our self-generated intent scores. This method does not assume a rating or score between a user and a listing and instead uses interaction count as a broad generalization of interest to perform recommendations. Here, the method of alternating least squares (ALS) is used for sparse matrix factorization \u2014 alternating between recomputing user and listing factors to optimize the loss function. However, we felt that this method could easily be swayed by many \u201cweak intent\u201d interactions, and ended up performing worse on our test set evaluation.", "After implementing the two classic recommendation system approaches outlined above, we felt that we were still missing a piece of the puzzle. Given the sparsity of users and high-intent interactions, we were having a hard time being able to predict what listings users want to look at next.", "Since our overall goal was to provide recommendations to individual users that aligned with their unique, and oftentimes exploratory browsing behavior, we needed to incorporate further data on user browse-streams. What kinds of listings were people viewing sequentially? For the next two models, we used data on how these listings \u201cco-occurred\u201d or were \u201cco-clicked\u201d to inform a further sense of similarity between listings beyond their quantitative features. We trained these models to learn the features of listings that tended to be \u201cpositively paired\u201d, or viewed in succession and then used the models to predict what listing each user might want to view next.", "Defining \u201csimilar\u201d houses using listing co-occurrence", "To go beyond feature similarity, we chose to define house similarity collaboratively. Beyond the raw features of a listing (#bed, #bath), we assume that homes viewed sequentially during a session (in a window of 1 page before and 2 pages after) are similar and labeled as positives, while homes never co-occurring in this way are less similar and labeled as negatives. We aggregate these positive pairings across all users click journeys to incorporate collaborative information.", "For example, see the two example user browsing journeys in the figure below. Assume that the anchor house is house 3 (in green). For user 1, houses 2, 4 and 5 are co-clicked the same session as house 3, while for user 2, house 2,4,8 are in the same session as house 3. Since we are aggregating across users to capture a variety of users behavior, we can then claim that given this co-occurring browsing activity, house 3 is \u201csimilar\u201d to houses 2, 4, 5, and 8. We will label these listings positive matches to the anchor, and all other houses that never appeared with 3 as negative, dissimilar matches.", "For the following models, we prepared a dataset of positive pairs of listings (that had co-occurred in at least 1 user\u2019s clickstream). To balance the dataset for every positive listing pair, we sampled a \u201cnegative\u201d listing that never co-occurred with the anchor in question.", "To find a good balance between similarity and diversity, we implemented a deep learning model using a Siamese Neural Network architecture. We referenced the idea from a post by Zillow. This embedding model (see figure below) is a content-based approach validated using collaborative data, and is able to model complex interactions between house features, and effectively handle cold-start items.", "What is a Siamese Neural Network?", "Our Siamese NN works by creating vector embeddings of listings metadata such that embeddings of \u201csimilar\u201d, co-occurring houses have small cosine distance between them and \u201cdissimilar\u201d houses have larger cosine distance. Houses are then recommended to users that are most \u201csimilar\u201d to the ones that they have already viewed and would be likely to occur with one another in a user\u2019s browsing session.", "How do we train the Siamese Neural Network?", "To minimize the distance between an anchor house and a positive house, and maximize the distance between anchor house and negative house, we introduce two loss functions: triplet loss and contrastive loss.", "Triplet Loss: Compares {anchor to positive} and {anchor to negative}, so that the distance between {anchor, positive} embedding is minimized, and the distance between {anchor, negative} embedding is maximized", "Contrastive loss: assesses the quality of embeddings by ensuring that similar, positively co-occurring listings are close in the listing embedding space, and dissimilar listings that never co-occur are farther apart. This effectively teaches the network to tune weights to create embeddings that can make such a distinction from the raw listing metadata.", "Since the Siamese model requires dual inputs, we train the network by passing anchor feature vectors along with examples of homes it has co-occurred with (positive) and homes it has never appeared with (negative). We pass the listing features through several FC layers, resulting in home embeddings.", "Below is a sample of the embedding model which reads listing features and returns an embedding.", "Then, from the triplet loss function (or contrastive loss function), the model learns an embedding space that minimizes cosine distance between \u201csimilar homes\u201d. Below is the code to implement the Siamese neural network with a triplet loss function.", "Another model we implemented was a Random Forest classifier. We approached training the Random Forest in a similar way to how we trained our Siamese NN \u2014 by teaching the ensemble model to learn when two listings are a \u201cpositive\u201d pair \u2014 or had co-occurred together in users\u2019 clickstreams.", "As described above, we used clickstream data to define these listing co-occurrences across all users under the assumption that co-occurring listings are similar in some way, and better capture exploratory user behavior.", "To train the Random Forest, we concatenated the listing metadata of each (pos/neg) pair into one vector, and generated a corresponding response variable y_true as 1 for positive and 0 for negative pairings. We then fed this data to the ensemble, training it to learn what kinds of listings tended to co-occur positively and negatively. In doing so the forest eventually learned how to predict whether two listings should be a positive co-occurring pair, and thus be recommended to a user to continue their browsing session.", "After training the Siamese NN and Random Forest models on the listing co-occurrence data \u2014 teaching the models some idea of what makes two homes a logical match to browse sequentially, we needed to shift the problem space to a user level to make recommendations.", "To do this, we created \u201cuser vectors\u201d to represent each user in an abstracted way as an aggregate of the listings they saw. We did this by taking the mean of the first 70% of listings each user saw according to weblog data. Since this new form matched the input of our two custom models, we were then able to pair each of these \u201cuser vectors\u201d against all of the other listing vectors not involved in the aggregate to predict which listing is a \u201clogical match\u201d according to our model for each user.", "We specifically tested this by investigating whether the listings that the model deemed were most probable for a user matched with the test set \u2014 the latter 30% of listings that they actually saw.", "To evaluate all of our models, we introduced two metrics: precision @ k, and recall @ k. The three steps for model evaluation using precision/recall @ k are as follows:", "tp is true positive, fn is false negative, fp is false positive.", "How do we interpret the two metrics?", "How do models perform under the two metrics? Using the two metrics (see table below), we find that, Random Forest and Siamese model perform at least 2x better than Content Filtering, and we decided to use these two as our final models", "How to read the number? e.g. In the row for RF, we have 25% as the recall@10 score. We can interpret it as: If we use recommend 10 listings (out of 500+ listings), it covers 25% of the true user visitings", "If you are interested, fill out our survey HERE before reading the following section", "We designed a user study to test how real users would choose between the recommendations provided by the models we have developed.", "Our study participants are first asked to choose three out of the six houses presented that they would be interested in learning more about \u2014 based on the listing information and images we provide.", "We then ask them to select an additional house of interest from four options. Unknown to the participants, each option in the second set of house listings corresponds to a recommendation given by one of the models we developed. For each possible combinations of the three listings the participant selected in the first question, we created hypothetical vectors of \u201cusers\u201d who had engaged with those listings with average intent. Using each of these \u201cusers\u201d, we generate top recommendations from each of our 4 models to present in the second question.", "Currently, we have 65 survey results from primarily students and REX employees. From the graph below, we can see that the user test results aligned with our test set evaluation. Users were most frequently interested in learning more about listings recommended by our Random Forest, followed by the Siamese Network. Though we cannot make definitive conclusions yet, the current results are promising and serve as good evidence for convincing REX\u2019s product team to continue this work.", "We started the project with the aim to develop a recommendation system that recommends similar listings to the user. In the end, we found that instead of merely recommending the most similar listings, it is more effective to tackle the more nuanced problem of modeling exploratory user browsing behavior to encourage house hunters to engage with a variety of interesting listings on REX\u2019s site. We achieved this by supplementing traditional listing metadata with collaborative information on click journey co-occurrences and implementing novel techniques involving Siamese Neural Networks and Random Forests. Our models were able to accurately predict user browsing behavior to a degree of precision, and our user study has shown initial success of our recommendations for a general audience. These results will be listed as evidence to convince REX to continue this project. We hope that integrating our model into REX current system can improve users\u2019 experience, and lead to more engaging and targeted browsing sessions when hunting for their dream home.", "Your home for data science.
