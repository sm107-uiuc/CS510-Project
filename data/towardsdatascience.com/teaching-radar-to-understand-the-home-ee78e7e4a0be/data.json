This has created massive value for businesses and their customers as well as some concerns about privacy and control of personal information.", "Radar-based recognition and localization of people and things in the home environment has certain advantages over computer vision, including increased user privacy, low power consumption, zero-light operation and more sensor flexible placement. It does suffer some drawbacks as compared to vision systems. For example, radar generally does not have the resolution of most camera-based systems and therefore may be challenged to distinguish objects that have very similar characteristics. Also, although the cost of radar is rapidly declining as automotive and industrial applications grow, it is still generally more expensive than cameras which have long ridden the coattails of mobile phone unit volumes. These factors have slowed its adoption for consumer applications. But more importantly, there are very few radar data sets that can be used to train or fine-tune machine learning models. This is in stark contrast to the ubiquity of computer vision data sets and models.", "In this article, you will learn how to accurately detect people, pets and objects using low-power millimeter-wave radar and will see how self-supervised learning, leveraging conventional camera-based object detection, can be used to generate radar-based detection models. Self-supervised learning is autonomous supervised learning. It is a representation learning approach that obviates the need for humans to label data [1].", "The steps to gather data using self-supervised learning, train and use a radar-based object detection model are as follows.", "Vayyar\u2019s radar chip in the Walabot reference design is a great choice to develop these solutions given its flexibility and wide availability. An object detection model running on Google\u2019s Coral Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is another great choice since it can perform inferences many times faster than the radar can scan for targets.", "You can find additional details regarding the software and hardware used in this project at radar-ml.", "A photo of the training setup created for this project is shown below. The Walabot radar is mounted up front and horizontally with a camera located at its top center. The white box contains the Google Coral Edge TPU with the camera connected to it over USB and the black box contains a Raspberry Pi 4 with the radar connected to it over another USB.", "The TPU runs a real-time object detection server over grpc that a client on the Raspberry Pi communicates with. The object detection server code can be found here. The Raspberry Pi handles the processing required to determine if a detected radar target is the same as an object detected by the TPU to establish ground truth. The Pi and the TPU communicate over a dedicated Ethernet link to minimize latency which is critical to accurately determining if a radar target is the same as a detected object. The Pi also runs predictions on novel radar targets using a trained model and is used to fit the model from radar target data with ground truth.", "The figure below shows the radar (XR, YR, YZ), camera (XC, YC, ZC), image (x, y) and pixel (u, v) coordinate systems. The radar is used as the frame of reference. The camera should be placed on the top middle of the radar unit which you can mount either horizontally or vertically (the USB connector is used as a reference, see the Walabot documentation). This ensures that the camera\u2019s optical z-axis is aligned with the radar\u2019s z-axis and fixed offsets between the camera axis\u2019 and the radar axis\u2019 can be determined (these are known as the camera extrinsic parameters). Additionally, you should make sure that the camera\u2019s angle of view is closely matched to the radar\u2019s Arena which is defined in the Python module common.py.", "It's important for you to understand these relationships to convert a 2-D point from the pixel system (what is actually read from the camera) into the radar\u2019s frame of reference. A point in the camera system is shown in blue as P(X, Y, Z) and the corresponding point in the radar system is shown in green as PR(XR, YR, Z). Note that Z is the same in both systems since the radar\u2019s z-axis is aligned with the camera\u2019s optical z-axis and the image plane is placed as close as possible to radar z = 0. See the next section for how the coordinate conversion is done.", "The camera could be placed anywhere it shares a view of a point with the radar as long as the camera\u2019s extrinsic parameters are known so that its view can be rotated and translated into the radar\u2019s frame of reference. Placing the camera on the top center of the radar unit as it is done here greatly simplifies the conversion of the coordinate systems but having the ability to use arbitrarily placed cameras for self-supervised learning for sensors can be very effective in generating data.", "You must first calibrate the camera to determine its intrinsic parameters (x and y focal and principal points) and to correct distortion. The intrinsic parameters are used to convert from image to radar coordinates. You can use OpenCV to do camera calibration quite easily which was used in this project.", "See references [5], [6] and [7] to understand more about camera and world coordinate systems and camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.", "This section describes how target samples from the radar are collected and how ground truth (i.e, target identification) is established. There may be multiple targets detected by the radar in a single scan so localization is required as part of this process. A key challenge here is accurately translating the 3-D radar image into the 2-D camera image in real-time since people and pets can move rapidly through the scene. Since the radar image is in 3-D, three orthogonal views of the target can be used to generate the data set. Choosing the view(s) to include in the data set and the resolution of each is a trade-off exercise between model complexity, size and accuracy.", "You use the Python module ground_truth_samples.py to ground truth radar samples with camera-based observations gathered from the object detection server. These observations are returned from the server in the form of the centroid coordinates of the detected object\u2019s bounding box and its label. The server has about a 20 millisecond inference latency. This is small in comparison to the 200 millisecond radar scan rate (which is a function of Arena size and resolution). This 1:10 ratio is designed to minimize tracking error between what the radar senses and what the camera is seeing.", "The centroid coordinates are converted into the radar frame of reference by the function shown below and then a distance metric is computed between each radar target and the converted centroid coordinates.", "If the distance is less than a threshold, then a match is declared and the radar target\u2019s return signal and the label is stored as an observation.", "The code snippet below shows a simplified version of the main loop that performs these actions for a single radar scan.", "You can configure ground_truth_samples.py to visualize the ground truth process in real-time to ensure its working correctly. An example visualization is shown in the screenshot below. You can see in the left window that the centroid of the detected object (green dot) in each of the three 2-D projections of the radar 3-D target return signal strength is close to the target center (red dot). The right window shows the view from the camera-based object detector.", "You use the Python module train.py to train an SVM or Logistic Regression model on the radar samples with ground truth. The samples are scaled to the [0, 1] range, the classes balanced and then the model is fitted using a stratified 5-Folds cross-validator. The fitted model is calibrated, evaluated for accuracy, serialized and saved to disk.", "Three orthogonal views of a target\u2019s return signal can be obtained from the radar. You can think of these as 2-D projections of the 3-D target signal on the radar\u2019s X-Y plane, the X-Z plane and the Y-Z plane. Any one of these or any combination of them can be used as an observation. Using all three of them will result in the best accuracy but the data set (~10k float32\u2019s per sample) and resulting SVM model (~10MB for 1.5k training samples) can be large, especially if the radar scan resolution is high. Choosing the optimal combination is a training hyper-parameter which is configurable in train.py.", "Training results from a run using all projections are shown below.", "The training results for using just the X-Y projection are very similar. There is a relatively minor degradation from the all projection case. However, the model training time and model size (about 10MB vs 1.6MB) are far worse. It does not seem to be worth using all views for training, at least for this particular data set.", "The most recently trained model (which uses all projections) and data set can be found here. This model has the labels \u2018person\u2019, \u2018dog\u2019 and \u2018cat\u2019. You can easily map these names to suit your own household. The model has an input vector of 10,011 features made up of 5,457 features from the Y-Z projection plane, 3,872 features from the X-Z plane and 682 features from the X-Y plane. The number of features in each plane are a function of the radar Arena size and resolution with the default training Arena yielding these numbers.", "The Python module predict.py is used to illustrate how predictions are made on novel radar samples using the trained model. You can use a radar prediction Arena different from what was used for training as the predict module will automatically scale the observations as required. However, you should make sure the radar Threshold, Filter Type and Profile are similar to what was used for training. Additionally, the observations need to be constructed from the same orthogonal planes as was used during training.", "An example prediction is shown below.", "You can use this module and the trained model to run predictions on your own Walabot radar unit.", "Radar-based perception has some advantages over vision-based methods including increased user privacy and zero-light operation but few suitable data sets to train machine learning models are publicly available. Self-supervised learning can be effectively used to generate these data sets, leveraging conventional computer vision. High radar-based object detection accuracy can be achieved using modest sized data sets and shallow machine learning models such as SVMs which enable inference on low-cost computers. These high accuracy models enable many applications in customer\u2019s homes including occupancy and intrusion detection and can be extended to detect accidents such as falling.", "The steps to gather data using self-supervised learning, train and use a radar-based object detection model are as follows.", "1.
