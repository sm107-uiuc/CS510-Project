As a declarative language, it\u2019s straightforward to write queries and build powerful applications. However, relational databases struggle when working with interconnected and complex data. When working with such data in SQL, challenges arise especially in the modelling and querying of the data.", "Graql is the query language used in Grakn. Just as SQL is the standard query language in relational databases, Graql is Grakn\u2019s query language. Both SQL and Graql are declarative query languages that abstract away lower-level operations. Both are:", "In practical terms, this means the languages become accessible to groups of people who would have otherwise not been able to access them. In this article, while we look at specific common concepts, we focus on comparing and exploring the differences between the two languages.", "In 1970, a paper was published by an Oxford-educated mathematician called Edgar Codd, known as \u201cTed\u201d, and in it, he introduced two languages \u2014 a relational algebra and a relational calculus to express extremely complex queries. When they came out, they were considered to be a strange kind of mathematical notation. To build these ideas out into a database management system, Ted created a research group called System R, based out of the IBM research facilities in San Jose.", "Back then, databases were mainly based on navigational, network and hierarchical models, where we needed to know the physical data layer before we could write a navigational plan to describe our query. Ted, however, saw the inherent complexity in this and wanted to make it easier to write database queries.", "However, as Ted\u2019s ideas were based on mathematical notation and mathematical symbolism, they were difficult to understand and not very accessible to most people, so two System R members addressed this issue by creating a simple query language \u2014 SEQL. As this new language was based exclusively on English words, this became the breakthrough that made it so much easier for people to understand the simplicity of Ted\u2019s ideas.", "By the late 1970s, relational databases had grown in popularity, and the world came to accept just how superior SQL and the relational model were to its predecessors. The story since then is well known \u2014 relational databases have become the standard for building software as the world was ushered into the digital revolution.", "In understanding Graql, it\u2019s useful to look at the underlying ideas that created SQL, as they are conceptually closely related. The essence of both Graql and SQL can be summarised as such:", "In this sense, both SQL and Graql are languages that abstract away lower-level operations. In practical terms, this means the languages become accessible to groups of people who would have otherwise not been able to access them. This means they become enabled to create value, while those who could already use them can now do things much faster. A similar thing can be said about Python, for example, a high level programming language that has enabled millions of programmers to build software without having to worry about lower-level operations that are abstracted away.", "First, let\u2019s look at how data modelling compares between SQL and Graql. We use the Entity Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram) as it\u2019s the most common modelling tool in use. A basic model is composed of entity types and the relationships that can exist between them. Below is an example ER Diagram. We call this the conceptual model.", "ER Diagram Example. Squares are entities, diamonds are relations and circles are attributes.", "If we are implementing this model in a relational database, we first go through a normalisation process. We begin at First Normal Form (1NF) and by looking for things such as functional dependencies and transitive dependencies, we eventually get to our desired Third Normal Form (3NF).", "After this normalisation process, we get to our logical model in 3NF and implement it in a relational database. We have gone from our conceptual model (ER diagram) to the logical model (3NF), without ever needing to go down to the physical level of the database. This was precisely the breakthrough that the relational model brought us \u2014 abstracting away the physical level. We call this the physical independence of data.", "Now let\u2019s look at how this compares to Graql. We can map any ER Diagram directly to how we implement it in Graql, which means we don\u2019t need to go through a normalisation process. Below we can see how a specific part of the earlier ER Diagram is modelled. We avoid the need to do any normalisation, as Graql enables us to create a direct mapping of the ER Diagram with entities, relations, attributes and roles to how we are implementing it later in code. This is different to SQL, where we need to impose a tabular structure over our model as a logical layer (as described above).", "This means we entirely skip out the normalisation process required in SQL, and we keep working at the conceptual model. In other words, Graql abstracts away both the logical and physical model. In this sense, where SQL gave us the physical independence of data, Graql gives us the logical independence of data.", "Now let\u2019s look at some real data. Anyone who has studied SQL is probably familiar with the Northwind dataset. It contains sales data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious specialty foods export-import company.", "How do we go about defining the products table shown above in Graql and SQL? Below we see the Graql syntax that defines the product entity, and the corresponding relation. This also shows the SQL statements that create the new table and the corresponding attributes.", "In Part 2 (link here), we look at how to read/write data, and how we should model at a higher-level in Graql leveraging the Hypergraph and Automated Reasoning.", "Your home for data science.
