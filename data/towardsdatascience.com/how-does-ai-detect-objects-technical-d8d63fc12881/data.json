Computer vision involves working with digital images and videos to deduce some understanding of contents within these images and videos.", "Object detection is associated with Computer Vision and describes a system that can identify the presence and location of a desired object or body within an image. Do note that there can be singular or multiple occurrences of the object to be detected.", "The output of an object detection process is an image with bounding boxes around the objects of interest and an indication as to the class instance of a single object \u2014 see the image above.", "This article will explore Object Detection and some of the various approaches to implementing object detection using Machine and Deep learning techniques.", "One of the most apparent use cases for Object Detection is within self-driving cars.", "Autonomous vehicles have an embedded system that can perform multi-class object detection in real-time and then perform actions based on the detection results.", "For example, an autonomous vehicle\u2019s system can detect a human-shaped body crossing the road and proceed to engage a program that causes the car to stop several feet before coming in contact with the detected body.", "Other applications of Object Detection are:", "There are machine learning techniques that are used to detect an object within images, and these techniques are manually implemented algorithms, hence they are not learned systems.", "Methods such as Histograms of Oriented Gradients(HOG) introduced around 2005 used a combination HOG/SIFT(Scale Invariant Feature transformation) to identify interest points within images based on normalized local histograms of image gradients.", "The method is based on the intuition that an object of interest has a distinct set of characteristics that can be identified by the local intensity of gradients and edge direction on a per-window basis. The result is to generate a HOG descriptor that is affine invariant and used in a detection chain that introduces an SVM(Support vector machine) to detect objects of interest-based on the HOG descriptors. This technique works relatively well for general detection scenarios, such as pedestrian detection.", "Generating a HOG feature that is affine invariant means that the features used in the descriptors will always present the same descriptors if the features have been moved, scaled or rotated", "Below are quick overviews of more Machine Learning techniques for Object Detection:", "Target objects for detection need to have a unique method to enable identification across images; this novel method is analogous to obtaining a fingerprint of objects in an image.", "SIFT is a computer-vision algorithm that identifies and encapsulates the information on local points of interest(features) within an image to describe the objects within the image bases on the extracted features.", "For the SIFT algorithm to create an adequate description of the object within an image, the point of interest gathered needs to be able to enable detection when there are inconsistencies in an image such as noise, variation in scale, and orientation. An example of areas of an image that meet the requirements mentions for an adequate descriptor is edge information within the image.", "Haar-like features are identifiers within an object that can be utilized for object recognition and detection.", "Characteristics of a section of an image can be captured by placing comparing the pixel intensities of two neighboring rectangular regions and finding the difference between the summation. The result of the difference is essentially our descriptor for that particular section of the image.", "In a practical scenario, haar-like features can be used within face detection. There are variances of pixel intensities across the human face, for example, the eyes. The eye region has a darker shade in comparison to neighboring areas.", "When utilizing Deep Learning techniques, there are two main approaches to Object Detection, the first being designing and training a network architecture from scratch, including the structure of layers and the initialization of weight parameter values. The second approach is to utilize the concept of Transfer Learning and leverage a pre-trained network that\u2019s trained on a large dataset before the onset of your dedicated training on the custom datasets.", "Transfer Learning is the method of reusing knowledge gained from solving a problem and applying the knowledge gained to an associated but separate problem", "The second approach eliminates the lengthy time disadvantages accompanied by the first-mentioned approach, which is that the time taken to train a network from scratch is far more significant and will require more effort when compared to adopting an already-trained network.", "Below are some quick overview of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) models for Object Detection", "RCNN is a deep learning method for solving object detection and segmentation. The technique was introduced in 2014 and presented the concept of region-based convolutional neural networks or RCNN for short.", "RCNN utilizes a selective search algorithm to propose region of interest in an image and, after that, uses a convolutional neural network to detect the presence of the object of interest within the proposed region.", "RCNN utilizes CNN for feature extraction and binary SVM for classification of objects. Although RCNNs does consist of a manual technique to propose region of interest, therefore it isn\u2019t truly an end to end learnable solution.", "RCNN can be computationally expensive and takes an average of 40\u201350 seconds to complete predictions on each image. Its successors, Fast-RCNN and Faster-RCNN, tackle some of the performance and efficiency problems prevalent in RCNN. Also, RCNN cannot be used for real-time applications due to the time it takes to conduct and complete predictions on images.", "YOLO is a redefinition of the standard object detection paradigm utilized by alternative object detection techniques. Popular techniques such as RCNN leverage region-based classifiers and are passing images thousands of times through the network to gain a prediction. Also, RCNN is a two-stage process, the first stage generates the regions of the proposal, and the second stage is where the object detection occurs.", "On the other hand, YOLO is a one-step process for object detection. It is also a neural network model that requires just one pass of an image through its network to conduct object detection. An obvious benefit is that YOLO proposes greater efficiency when compared to RCNNs.", "YOLO works by overlaying grids on an image, where each cell within the grid plays two roles:", "Using YOLO for object detection has several benefits, the major one being that it can be used within real-time applications such as the object detection systems embedded in autonomous vehicle systems.", "Below is a video containing more information on YOLO:", "To conclude, we look at the progression and success of object detection techniques, both machine learning, and deep learning approaches.", "The image below depicts visually the increase in mAP score (Jonathan Hui explains mAP scores) of object detection techniques over ten years from 2006\u20132016 when evaluated on the Pascal VOC dataset.", "The period of 2006\u20132011 shows the utilization of traditional machine learning techniques for object detection; we can observe some stagnation in the mAP between 2010\u20132012. This stagnation trend changes with the onset of convnet(convolutional neural networks), we see an increase in mAP score to just above 75% in 2015.", "The link below provides some information to get an overview of where the status of the current state of the art techniques.", "Hopefully, from this article, you have more understanding of Object Detection and techniques that can be utilized to implement object detection in a variety of applications.", "If you enjoyed this article and would like to read some more, give me a follow.", "Your home for data science.
