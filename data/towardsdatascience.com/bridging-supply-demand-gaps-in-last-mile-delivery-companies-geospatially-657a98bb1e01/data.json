And if you are like me, you probably order everything at the oddest hours of the day!", "For an on-demand company (aka \u201cUber for X\u201d), that is primarily a three-sided marketplace, matching demand and supply is at the core of the business and also extremely challenging. Moreover, the real-world introduces far more variation that leads to starker results than in the model.", "When supply-demand gaps exists, we are either losing orders or our riders are idle \u2014 both of which are contributing to losing money. But, what\u2019s causing these gaps to exist? This could happen as a function of demand, supply or both.", "The number of orders that you are losing with time because the riders are not available or they are present in the wrong location.", "When you are losing orders, how does the order velocity look like? Which means are you getting more orders or lesser orders than usual?", "The number of riders that are idle and the amount of time they are spending without being utilized because of the wrong location or lesser demand.", "Note: Being idle is a point in time property. Hence, while analyzing historically, we need to analyze the metric \u201cidle session time\u201d.", "When riders are idle, how does the availability of the total riders look like? Have the number of available riders increased or decreased? While analyzing this historically, we need to analyze the metric \u201ctotal session time\u201d.", "Before even trying to bridge the gaps, we need to understand \u201cwhy\u201d they are happening in the first place. If the orders are getting lost it might be due to the following reasons:", "If the frequency at which you receive orders on that day and that time is lesser than the usual, that means you need to dive into why that\u2019s happening.", "There might be a possibility that orders are coming in but they are not getting allocated to the riders. If this is happening, there might be some problem with the allocation (or matching) algorithm that you are using. In these cases, it is best to raise this concern with the relevant people inside the organization.", "In a three-sided marketplace, sometimes there might be an allocation problem with the store or the restaurant. I myself have experienced quite a number of cases when I couldn\u2019t receive the order because the issue was at the restaurant.", "To delve deeper on how to carry out analyses on static location such as stores or restaurants, check this out:", "Let\u2019s say that the orders are being allocated to the riders but they are not accepting the orders. This might happen because of a number of reasons.", "Often, all of us have experienced riders canceling the orders after they have accepted it \u2014 especially once they get to know about the drop location.", "Cities usually have invisible walls that riders prefer not to cross. Where are these walls? What times of the day are they most prominent in?", "As discussed before, supply-demand matching is not just about what\u2019s happening right now. It\u2019s about the flow. Where is demand going to be next and how does it move in different days and different times?", "Understanding flow for last-mile delivery companies is super important. Which area is the most likely to get demand next? How far is that from where the drivers are currently?", "For example, with one of the last mile delivery companies, studying the flow showed that the delivery partners started moving towards the center of the city and by evening, they started moving out, because most of them lived on the outskirts. But they needed to come inwards because that\u2019s the region in which they receive the maximum amount of orders.", "Locale is a location analytics platform, which means we convert your raw lat-long data across all databases and formats into meaningful insights so that decision-makers can make very precise, data-driven decisions about their ground operations.", "Web analytics tools already help you improve these metrics, using clickstream data. However, with companies that have moving assets on the ground, not looking at things geospatially can be extremely detrimental!", "At Locale, we are creating examples of companies who are improving their unit economics, cost per delivery, utilization by doing geospatial analytics.
