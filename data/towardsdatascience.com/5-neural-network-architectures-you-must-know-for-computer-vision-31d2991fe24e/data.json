The neocognitron introduced 2 types of layers, convolutional layers and downsampling layers.", "Then next key advancement was by Yann LeCun et al. when they used back-propagation to learn the coefficients of the convolutional kernel from images. This made learning automatic and not laboriously handcrafted. According to Wikipedia, this approach became a foundation for modern computer vision.", "Then came \u201cImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\u201d in 2012, by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E. Hinton, which is widely regarded as the most influential paper on convolutional neural networks. They created Alexnet and won the 2012 Imagenet competition with their model.", "I will not dive deep into the mechanism of CNNs but want to give a brief overview of how it works.", "Where regular vanilla neural networks were trained on layers that computed WX + b, Where W is the weight matrix that is learned through backpropagation, convolutional neural networks use weights called filters.", "You can think of a convolutional kernel or filter, like a sliding window over the input matrix. In the above gif, the filter is the orange shaded matrix with red numbers. The input matrix is the green matrix with black numbers. At each stage, the filter is multiplied with the overlapped section of the input matrix element-wise, and the values are summed. This gives the first output. Then the filter is moved one step to the left, and so on as shown in the gif. The loss can be calculated for the output and label with respect to the filter values, and with backpropagation, we can learn the values of the filter.", "Convolutional neural networks are actually just matrix multiplications when you unroll the kernel and input. This is shown in this very good blog post. CNNs are extremely powerful for 2 main reasons.", "Residual networks were introduced by Kaiming He et al. in their massively influential paper, \u201cDeep Residual Learning for Image Recognition\u201d. The paper from the Microsoft research team won the 2015 Imagenet competition.", "ResNets have an extremely simple yet extremely elegant idea. The idea was to add skip connections or shortcut connections, that created a gradient highway. This enabled gradients to flow better during the backward step, and greatly increased convergence, time of training and reduced gradient explosion and vanishing.", "The subtle beauty of Resnets is that the best-case scenario is when the skip connection actively adds to the output and computes useful information, and the worst-case scenario is when it simply ignores the skipped connection and is at worst the same as a network without a skip connection. So skip connections add so much value and have no downside!", "U-Nets were introduced by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox in their paper \u201cU-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation\u201d, which you can read here. This 2015 paper was revolutionary for image segmentation. Image segmentation is the task of labelling each pixel in an image with its category.", "U-Nets have 2 parts, the contracting path (downsampling path) and the expansive path (upsampling path). In a traditional image classification convolutional network, the image is fed into a network which performs convolutions and pooling operations, both of which reduce the height and width of the output but increase the depth of the output. With a loss in height and width, the depth gained adds features to the classification output.", "However, in segmentation tasks, we want the output to be the same shape as the input image and the added features for labelling pixels. So the downsampling of a traditional Conv architecture is supplemented by an upsampling path, to add back the height and width of the image to the output, while maintaining the features. There are many upsampling methods, but the most common one used in most libraries is Transpose convolution upsampling. You can read about this method here.", "YOLO was first introduced by Joseph Redmon, Santosh Divvala, Ross Girshick, Ali Farhadi in their paper \u201cYou Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection\u201d which you can read here. The paper was proposed as a fast, state of the art model for object detection in 2015. Over the years, YOLO has had 4 official versions (where papers were published). The first 3 were by the original authors and the last one was by a different author. I will not discuss the versions of YOLO now, maybe in another post ;-)", "YOLO stands for you only look once. When the paper was released, the popular method for object detection was to reuse classifiers to classify local regions of an image and use a sliding window approach to check if each region of an image has an object. YOLO shifted the paradigm by proposing object detection as a regression problem, where they only use a single network for the entire pipeline and process the whole image at once rather than in regions.", "YOLO divides the input image into an SxS grid. And for each grid predicts if the centre of an object is present within the grid. If the centre of the object is in the grid, the grid will then predict a bounding box with 5 values, x,y,w,h,c. (x,y) are the coordinates of the centre of the object relative to the grid, (w,h) is the width and height of the object relative to the whole image and (c ) is the class of the object.", "\u201cYOLO has 3 main benefits. Loosely Quoted from the original paper [1].", "First, YOLO is extremely fast. Since the paper frames detection as a regression problem, it doesn\u2019t need a complex pipeline.", "Second, YOLO reasons globally about the image when making predictions. Unlike sliding window and region proposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image during training and test time so it implicitly encodes contextual information about classes as well as their appearance.", "Third, YOLO learns generalizable representations of objects. Since YOLO is highly generalizable it is less likely to break down when applied to new domains or unexpected inputs.\u201d", "Generative adversarial networks or GANs for short were introduced by Ian J. Goodfellow, Jean Pouget-Abadie, Mehdi Mirza, Bing Xu, David Warde-Farley, Sherjil Ozair, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio in their paper \u201cGenerative Adversarial Networks\u201d which you can read here.", "GANs are a neural network pair that are trained through an adversarial process. The 2 parts of a GAN are a Generator and a Critic/Discriminator. The role of the generator is to generate high-quality data that is similar to training data, and the role of the critic is to differentiate between the generated data and the real data. The objective function of the generator is to maximise the loss of the critic, and the objective function of the critic is to minimize its loss.", "Think of this process as analogous to a thief and the police. The thieves want to fool the police and keep improving their tools and techniques, and the police want to catch the thieves so they improve too. The generator is like the thief and the critic is like the police.", "There are numerous applications for GANs and many new applications are coming out all the time. But since this article is about computer vision, two extremely interesting applications of GANs are:", "Your home for data science.
