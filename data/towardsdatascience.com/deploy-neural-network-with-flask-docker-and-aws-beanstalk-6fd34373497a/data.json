Some of them you\u2019ll find on my StackOverflow.", "Part I:Why voice sentiment? Due to exponential growth in technology in the past decade, lifestyle has changed and people demand faster and easier to use services. Many companies do renew contracts and get customer agreement legally valid only through a phone call. Not to mention all the marketing, customer success and sales use. And it became quite necessary to predict what your customer sentiment is from a voice input/phone call.", "Now let\u2019s go through the voice sentiment model.Data sets for training the model: contains different speakers, mostly actors, in a controlled environment and do convey the following sentiments, for both female and male: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, surprised. (14 classes \u2014 since it\u2019s always wise to train female separate from male voice).", "To extract and transform the data features(Mel frequency cepstral coefficients: MFCC) from the audio I have used LibROSA. Building the model using Keras: Sequential with Conv1D layers with BatchNormalization, Dropout, and MaxPooling1D. Feel free to have your try on my Kaggle kernel.", "Flask application: requests the data from the user and saves it as a WAV file which is processed and predicted later. A couple of things to keep in mind here:", "Find the Html, CSS, and js for voice recorder at my Github repo. You can modify the recording time in recapp.js, just remember that 1 second=1000 milliseconds: setTimeout(function(){console.log(\"Recording:time up\");stopRecording();},4000);", "Part II: I have first deployed the Flask app with AWS Beanstalk and found that the server error log is not that detailed and clear about errors and so I have found Docker error log to be quite useful.", "Of course, Docker comes with many other all in one tool and functions that makes it somehow easier and more compact for building an environment.", "This will help you with making the right choices when comes about building Docker images and dealing with troubleshooting:", "Part III:Amazon Web Services and Elastic Beanstalk seemed like a good choice.", "I have followed all the instructions for creating a single container docker environment here.", "If you use the AWS console then things are quite easy. If you AWS/EB CLI then make sure you set the path after installing EB CLI:", "You create a new application and environment in beanstalk, uploading the archive/zip of your docker app folder contents. From the console you can modify the capacity, the instances you want to use, environment type(load balancing, autoscaling) and so on.", "Now let\u2019s have a look at troubleshoots:", "All the above code and instructions can be found via my StackOverflow response.", "I hope this helps (and saves you days of hard hard work) and now your app is running smoothly and you enjoy the predictions. The model provided on my Github gives a little bit less than 50% accuracy \u2014 though this can be quite good for a multi-class classification at a first glance.", "Take care and wishing you all a superb 2020,", "A new exciting decade for exponential growth and innovation!!!", "Your home for data science.
