They\u2019ve made arrests as a result of the facial recognition system.", "On the surface value the utilization of the technology to combat crime and aiding effective policing doesn\u2019t sound any alarms, but the accuracy metrics and performance audit results of these systems that are used to conduct arrests paint a more startling picture.", "Dave\u2019s article includes information of a lawsuit that has been taken against the governing bodies using the facial recognition software. The lawsuit is due to the facial recognition system inherent algorithmic racial bias and ineffectiveness \u2014 a subject matter that\u2019s made headlines lately.", "But yet, the main point of Dave\u2019s coverage of the event is to bring to light that NEC technology(provider of the facial recognition tool) is not willing to reveal details of their dataset.", "Even the police, who are using the tool has no idea of how the system is trained. In my opinion, it makes sense to expose the data that is used to train systems that have a direct/indirect effect on the public, especially in public policing.", "Dave article mentions the UK influence across the rest of Europe and the world. It states that their actions and views towards facial recognition could set the precedent of how other countries in Europe move forward with the adoption and utilization of facial recognition technology.", "The latter half of Dave article is brief coverage of articles that tackle complex problems within autonomous vehicle.", "Read this article to gain an awareness of the legal consequences and actions that are taken against companies developing AI systems that are used in public settings.", "One of the most interesting article I read this week. Luca Rossi has written a piece that will send most readers down the path of self and environmental awareness.", "After reading this article, I found my self questioning the impact of my actions and contributions that can lead to the imaginary worlds created within this article.", "Luca\u2019s article starts with statements on the effect of job loss as a result of the cyclic regular occurrence of global revolutions such as agricultural, industrial and technological revolution.", "He then paints a glimmer of hope with the introduction of new roles and jobs as automation renders traditional manual work obsolete. But this glimmer of hope is blocked by his personal opinions.", "Luca states in his article that the non-occurrence of massive job loss due to automation and AI does not guarantee or secure a future with loads of jobs for all. Luca also expresses his concern for a future where automation reigns in all aspect of life and renders us useless; he conveys a concern for the happiness and fulfilment of man.", "Luca includes a lists professions that will be eventually doomed, and as I read down the list, I was relieved not to see any machine learning roles. This relief was quickly decimated as Luca points out explicitly that positions not mentioned are still equally victim to the impending job marker apocalypse as a result of machines and automation. He even provides an example of AI emulating the creativity of man through art to support his opinions further.", "No one is truly safe. Except for Philosophers", "Luca argues that AI can\u2019t replace philosophers, due to the fact the philosophy is the human expression of the ambiguity in the very nature of existence and life, and this is not correlated with \u2018pure intelligence\u2019. This is an opinion that I don\u2019t entirely agree with. I could probably get a good debate going with Luca on this subject matter.", "Regardless of my opposing views on Luca opinions, I still appreciate the structured approach to his presentation of four philosophical topics that are becoming more and more relevant: morality, consciousness, the meaning of life, and alignment problem.", "Luca marries each presented philosophical topics with occurrence in current technology such as self-driving cars, and hypothetical future technologies such as mind transfer and teleportation.", "By creating scenarios based on simple and complex events, Luca showcases the disparity between choices that a human could make and presents the possibility of the same decisions made by an AI system.", "Luca\u2019s article is probably different from the more technical and straight forward articles a lot of machine learning practitioners are used to reading. But I recommend the regular consumption of articles that explores the philosophical aspects of the advancement of technology. One great book I know that does this well is Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies by Nick Bostrom.", "To conclude an interesting article, Luca boldly states that the fate of the world is in the hands of philosophers, a view I find fascinating.", "Want a \u2018stellar\u2019 portfolio that makes you stand out from the rest of the other job candidates, then Harshit Tyagi\u2019s article can be seen as a blueprint to building up a portfolio that achieves this goal.", "I\u2019ll be honest and state that I did not have any portfolio to present to my current employers during the interview stage, but as Harshit very rightly states, having an advanced degree gives you an advantage. So Harshit article is well suited for Data Scientists that do not have an MSc or PhD.", "The first advice presented in the article is self-identification. Harshit advises job seekers to understand their current skillsets and their own limitations. Through this understanding, they will be more aware of what jobs they are best suited for.", "No Data Scientist portfolio is complete without a catalogue of projects. Within the article, there are specific forms of projects readers looking to stand out from the crowd should aspire to complete. Harshit, give a near-perfect explanation of the variety of projects a job seeker can explore, and even includes several examples of portfolios.", "The later steps explore the importance of online presence to assist in boosting a Data Scientist\u2019s reputation. Platforms such as GitHub, LinkedIn, Medium and Twitter are recommended by Harshit\u2019s, along with some personal anecdotes of how he utilizes these platform.", "The article concludes within some information on key items that are to be placed in a resume. Honestly, the article is riddled with great tips and information, and if you are more of a visual learner, you can also check out his YouTube channel for more great content.", "If you are a very visual learner, you will enjoy the article written by Priya Dwivedi that explores the comparison of performance against two widely known object detection algorithms: YOLOv5 and Faster RCNN.", "This is not a breakdown article of how each algorithm approach object detection, so some reader might be disappointed to find that there is no explanation of how the included algorithms works. That been said, Priya has provided a ton of links to resources that provide information on the inner workings of the algorithms.", "The comparison scenarios utilized by Priya to gauge the performance of each algorithm are realistic. Three scenarios are presented in this article and are in the form of videos: a video of cars, basketball match and crowded public scene.", "In the article, Priya provides a side by side video assessment of the result of the object detection algorithms, which is then accompanied with a table of performance and accuracy criteria that each algorithm is evaluated upon.", "I won\u2019t reveal which object detection algorithm comes out on top, read the article to find out.", "The visual nature of this article makes it an easy read for deep learning practitioners of all level.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
