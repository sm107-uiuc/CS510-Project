75th anniversary in January this year, Antonio Guterres \u2014 the UN\u2019s Secretary-General \u2014 gave a grim address best summarised by his description of the world as \u201coff-track\u201d. On Guterres\u2019 list of existential threats were the climate crisis, geopolitical tensions and the abuse of new technologies \u2014 naming one in particular:", "\u201cLethal autonomous weapons \u2014 machines with the power to kill on their own, without human judgment and accountability \u2014 are bringing us into unacceptable moral and political territory.\u201d", "While states might debate whether lethal autonomous weapon systems (or \u2018killer robots\u2019 in the popular imagination) are \u201cunacceptably immoral\u201d, there can be no doubt that Guterres is right on the urgency of the risk: development and use of autonomous weapons are both accelerating, and the stakes \u2014 ethical and political \u2014 are high.", "The world\u2019s military powers have been competing to dominate this new class of intelligent weapons for years, with this AI arms race occurring against a contentious global landscape where an advantage in military AI could make a real difference to the balance of power. This geopolitical game theory driving such advancement in the sophistication of war machines has an unwanted blind spot \u2014 historically, human rights factor little into strategic calculations.", "With Covid-19, the acceleration of automation has taken on greater speed across a variety of different fronts. Military operations have had to be completely re-thought \u2014 physical distancing on a submarine is much harder than physical distancing in a supermarket. Lethal AI already had some mounting advantages over human equivalents, and can now add \u2018immunity from catastrophic viruses\u2019 to that list. For all of these reasons, keeping track of the AI arms race is more vital than ever.", "Almost every month, another innovation in autonomous weapons leaps off the headlines in military news \u2014 the autonomous Chinese Blowfish A3 helicopter drone equipped with machine guns or the Russian army of unmanned \u2018Marker\u2019 ground vehicles armed with mortars and grenade launchers. There is no question that new inventions in the world of military AI abound, but it is far less clear which country boasts the strongest tech.", "Key figures in the United States military have been forthright in warning of China\u2019s might in this area. The US Defense Department\u2019s relatively new Joint Artificial Intelligence Center is building command-and-control AI capability for the first time, explicitly citing the Chinese threat as the reason for the department\u2019s urgency. The Center\u2019s director Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan has been clear about his desire to automate as much of the American military machine as possible:", "\u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to see is a future where our potential adversaries have a fully AI-enabled force and we do not.\u201d", "In the last year, officials as senior as the US Defense Secretary have warned that Chinese technology may, in fact, already be more advanced than America\u2019s. Secretary Mark Esper predicted that China might have \u201cleapfrogged\u201d existing American technology. With the military establishment suitably concerned, spending on lethal autonomous weapons in all branches of the American military seems set to go to another level in 2020 after already increasing in 2019.", "For China\u2019s part, mounting investment in autonomous weapon development is a key plank in its ongoing effort to usurp American military dominance. Almost all large-scale AI programs in China benefit from massive governmental support and a huge trove of data, and its autonomous weapons program is the jewel in Beijing\u2019s AI crown. China\u2019s huge investment in lethal autonomous weapons predates other militaries, and its military theorists are ahead of the rest of the world in building futuristic \u201cintelligentized\u201d models of human-machine operations.", "A further dimension to China\u2019s AI strategy is economic, with Beijing seemingly interested in profiting from its autonomous weapons program as a new export product. Already, China appears to be exporting many of its most high-tech aerial drones to wealthy buyers in the Middle East, explicitly marketing them as capable of advanced autonomous operations like assassinations. Last year, Zeng Yi, a senior executive at Norinco, China\u2019s third-largest defense company, predicted that as early as 2025, \u201cthere will be no people fighting in battlegrounds\u201d.", "As an arms race, autonomous weapons and AI more broadly is much harder to track than something like nuclear weapons with countable objects (eg stockpiles of warheads and launchers). How should we compare China\u2019s development of autonomous aerial drones and hypersonic \u2018smart\u2019 missiles with America\u2019s recent $2.7bn unveiling of huge unmanned ships? What about Russia\u2019s autonomous tanks, deployed for the first time into combat in Syria? The short answer is that short of more extensive deployment of autonomous weapons, we cannot know for certain.", "Elsa B. Kania, an Adjunct Senior Fellow with the Technology and National Security Program at the Centre for a New American Security, agrees that the question of who leads an AI arms race between the great powers is not an easy one:", "There may be no single answer. For instance, potentially, the U.S. military may become more capable in leveraging AI in cyber operations, but the Chinese military could achieve greater advances in hypersonic weapons systems that can operate autonomously, and the Russian military may possess more experience in integrating unmanned systems in urban warfare.", "Given the most advanced autonomous weapons are developed behind closed doors in the world\u2019s most secretive military labs, it is difficult to gauge the objective progress of military AI, let alone which country is closest to deploying sophisticated AI in all aspects of its military. However, there can be no doubt at this stage, with public declarations from American and Chinese officials alike, that this is the finish line: the automation of an entire military.", "For all Guterres\u2019 stirring words about lethal autonomous weapons being an unacceptable global threat, the United Nations have been painfully slow in their response. There are no restrictions on nation-states or companies building, developing and integrating lethal autonomous weapons; and no sign that this will change in 2020.", "To be clear: there is an increasing groundswell of public pressure for autonomous weapons (or \u2018killer robots\u2019) to be regulated. Almost three in every four Europeans would like an international treaty prohibiting lethal autonomous weapons, according to a poll conducted in November by Human Rights Watch. 28 countries are advocating for the United Nations to adopt a similar measure.", "However, a small number of powerful countries are doing an effective job of stalling (if not derailing) progress at the international level. It will be no surprise that these countries \u2014 Russia, China and the United States \u2014 have by far the most advanced military AI. TIME has detailed how Russia has \u201csteamrolled\u201d the process by holding up discussion documents and postponing meetings. China and the United States have been more subtle, but no less obstructionist, in their own efforts to delay even the discussion of a substantive ban.", "Despite this, the UN\u2019s disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu is optimistic that \u201cwithin two years\u201d the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) forum could release a definitive proposal for how lethal autonomous weapon systems could be regulated internationally. The CCW regime has previously been successful in limiting or regulating weapons like landmines or laser weapons that have \u201cpotentially indiscriminate\u201d effects.", "With the potential for lethal autonomous weapons to potentially escape their programmed limitations either accidentally (through a software bug) or on purpose (the software is hacked), it is easy to see how their effects could be indiscriminate, falling within the criteria for CCW restrictions. But a hypothetical fit is only the qualifying mark in a long marathon to regulation. The influential Campaign to Stop Killer Robots is notably guarded about the UN process, warning that \u201cincremental gains achieved to date are not impressive\u201d.", "The lack of regulation or applicable international law leads to the grim conclusion that the AI arms race can only end with a global power developing and deploying \u2018general\u2019 AI into its military, with consequences we can only really speculate at this stage.", "If this truly is an \u201cunacceptable\u201d outcome, a dizzying amount of progress will have to be made on drawing up an agreement to ban or limit lethal autonomous weapons. In the meantime, war machines become ever smarter, and all the more alluring in a post-Covid world.", "If you are interested in the impact of lethal or general AI, you will like my new publication Technocracy. I\u2019ll be regularly writing about how technology is changing society, like my most recent piece about how the Coronavirus is making mass surveillance our new normal.", "Your home for data science.
