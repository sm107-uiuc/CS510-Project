To date, they have developed a slew of internal resources to get employees up to speed on the essentials. This is typically referred to as OJT, for \u201con the job training.\u201d", "OJT only goes so far \u2014 the size of your workforce. Aside from hired workers, companies depend on the education system to routinely supply capable talent to the workforce. This system has performed sufficiently for hundreds of years. However, the tide is turning. The speed of machine learning\u2019s integration into industry workflows has largely outpaced the education system\u2019s ability to provide fully-equipped talent. This is partially due to large systems necessarily moving slowly, but also due to a lack of convergence of dominant algorithms and tools in the field. Education systems are basically faced with a choice between overfitting on current trends versus sticking with classical techniques and allowing for OJT to solve the last-mile problem.", "Amazon has a great idea \u2014 meet halfway.", "Academic institutions will largely lean towards proven classical techniques for education, and that is the correct move. To help the last-mile OJT problem even more than post-hire education, Amazon is now making available course materials from their internal \u201cML University\u201d. By doing this, they will be able to educate many eventual employees even before it is interview time. This helps both sides of the table. Prospective employees can learn much more relevant material ahead of job applications and feel more equipped in job selection and commitment. On the flip side, Amazon and similar companies can then judge talent more directly in interviews than they have been able to. Since so much learning material is publicly available, there is less room for \u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d when an applicant does not have experience in a certain sub-area.", "Just three courses have been released for immediate use: natural language, computer vision, and tabular data. However, more will be rolling out through the end of 2020, with the start of 2021 having all the material public.", "\u201cBy going public with the classes, we are contributing to the scientific community on the topic of machine learning, and making machine learning more democratic,\u201d Werness adds. \u201cThis field isn\u2019t limited to individuals with advanced science degrees, or technical backgrounds. This initiative to bring our courseware online represents a step toward lowering barriers for software developers, students and other builders who want to get started with practical machine learning.\u201d- Amazon Science", "Check out the intro to the \u201cAccelerated Computer Vision\u201d course below. The entire course is available on similar Youtube pages.", "This is great for the democratization of machine learning in the industry. Academic has long been very open and cooperative with ML research. The same can be said for the open-source software movement. Recently, in the past decade or so, we have seen these ideologies extend into the ML industry space. Its continuation will ensure that the economy\u2019s aggregate output will rise, while still fostering healthy competition.", "I\u2019ll add a word of caution, however. The phenomenon referred to as \u201cvendor lock-in\u201d occurs when a service provider produces so much incentive to continue acquiring its own products across its ecosystem that the consumer effectively becomes stuck buying the provider\u2019s goods and services, lest he/she suffer either lackluster integrations or the switching cost of starting over with a new provider. Look no further than a comparison of Apple vs Microsoft vs Google products for examples of vendor lock-in at work.", "The courses at ML University indeed appear at the outset to provide a lot of general applicability across the ML and software space. It is likely that 80\u201390% of all of its material will do so, which is great!", "However, as you go through the courses, remain keen on staying up-to-date on how other providers are accomplishing similar products and services. To be a truly marketable ML practitioner in this evolving workforce, one must stay flexible in showing ML proficiency independent of algorithm, language, framework, and platform provider.", "Aside from here on Medium, keep yourself updated with the LifeWithData blog, the Machine Learning UTD Newsletter, and my Twitter. Through those platforms, I provide more long-form and short-form thoughts, respectively.", "If you\u2019re not a fan of emails and social media, but still want to stay in the loop, consider adding lifewithdata.org/blog and lifewithdata.org/newsletter to a Feedly aggregation setup.", "Your home for data science.
