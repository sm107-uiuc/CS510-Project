Feeling overwhelmed by a barrage of culinary blogs and Food Network clips on YouTube?", "Don\u2019t be! Cooking is all about designing a set of pre-determined steps and following them while taking measurements and deciding on different actions based on evaluation of present conditions.", "In short, it\u2019s an algorithm (albeit one that\u2019s implemented using dead animals and fire instead of R). And you\u2019re great with algorithms!", "Here\u2019s one for your Thanksgiving turkey. Let\u2019s dive in.", "A Thanksgiving turkey has a few dependencies. Make sure you have these in place first. You\u2019ll need an oven, a roasting pan, aluminum foil, a sharp knife and an oven safe meat thermometer. Amazon is your friend, as is the local Safeway. For the pan, a cheapo aluminum one will do fine. Ideally, you want both the pan, and something to raise your turkey a bit off the bottom of it, like a wire rack.", "Next, you need the turkey itself. If you\u2019re reading this the day before Thanksgiving, you might already be too late. Due to the economics of delivering so many dead birds to so many people in such a tight timeframe, most Thanksgiving turkeys come frozen.", "They\u2019re massive birds \u2014 thawing one takes days. So either get one that\u2019s been thawed already (called fresh) or get a frozen one and let it sit in your fridge to come to temperature for a few days.", "Wondering about weight? The average person eats about 1/2 pound of meat in a sitting. But turkeys aren\u2019t 100% efficient \u2014 much of their mass is dedicated to inedible parts, like bone. So take your desired mass of edible meat and double it. For 7\u201310 people, go for a 15\u201320 pound bird.", "Also, remember to get that meat thermometer. Some people think they can judge a turkey\u2019s doneness by appearance. They\u2019re fools, and their guests will get salmonella. Measure, measure, measure!", "On the morning of, plan backwards from your desired serving time. On average, a turkey takes 20 minutes per pound to cook. So multiply your turkey\u2019s weight by 20, divide by 60, and subtract that number from your desired serving time (you do use a 24 hour clock, right?). That\u2019s when you\u2019ll want to begin \u2014 perhaps adding an hour of buffer time.", "Get out your roasting pan, and unwrap your turkey. For some reason, turkey providers put the turkey\u2019s internal bits in a little plastic bag, which they stick inside the turkey and charmingly call \u201cgiblets\u201d instead of \u201ctiny bag of turkey internals.\u201d Pull this out.", "Put your turkey breast side up in the roasting pan, ideally on a little rack. See the image below for the proper orientation. Set your oven to 176 C (no, I\u2019m not going to convert that for you). When it beeps, put the turkey and pan in. Set a timer for 30 minutes.", "Your goal is to get the turkey\u2019s internal temperature from its starting point to at least 71C (fine, I\u2019ll convert this one for safety \u2014 it\u2019s 160 F). There are a few reasons for this.", "The first is that you want to denature the proteins in the turkey\u2019s muscles. Raw meat is unacceptably chewy, since the muscle fibers are intact. Denaturing them makes then pliable and easier to chew. Essentially, you\u2019re using an external heat source to digest the turkey a bit before serving it (you shouldn\u2019t describe it to your guests in this language.)", "Also, 170F is high enough to kill most bacteria. Poultry is filthy--there\u2019s enough salmonella, e coli and other nasties on your raw turkey to make the boldest biohacker nervous. This brings up another point, too. Wash your hands after every time you handle a raw turkey, and wash utensils and surfaces too. Cross contamination will ruin your day.", "Now, you\u2019re entering a While loop. Every 30 minutes, open the oven and check on the turkey. Initially, you just want to make sure it\u2019s not burning. At i == 1 (1 hour), take your meat thermometer and plunge it into a thick part of the turkey\u2019s breast. The temperature should immediately drop. Leave it there, and return the whole thing to the oven.", "Every 30 minutes, check the turkey\u2019s temperature. It should rise over time.", "As your turkey is cooking, you\u2019ll notice that the skin starts to get brown. This is due to the Maillard browning reactions, which release flavorful aromatics from the sugars and amino acids in the turkey\u2019s skin. You want this to happen. Maillards = flavor.", "What you don\u2019t want, though, is to go from Maillards to carbonization (read: burning). Carbon in a raw form is not tasty.", "Once your turkey has reached a nice golden brown color, cover it in aluminum foil.", "Why? There are three ways an oven transfers heat to its contents: convection, radiation and conduction.", "Convection is the transfer of heat from the warm air in your oven to your bird. It\u2019s gentle, and you want this throughout the cooking process.", "Radiation is a bit different; it\u2019s the transfer of heat from the hot metal walls of your oven to the turkey inside. It\u2019s good, but harsher than convection. Let it continue unchecked, and it will burn your bird.", "Covering the turkey in aluminum foil reflects back radiated heat from the oven\u2019s walls, while still allowing warm air in for convection to work its magic. It keeps your turkey cooking, without the risk of carbonizing the skin.", "Oh, and conduction? That\u2019s the direct transfer of heat from a hot metal surface to the turkey itself. Remember that wire rack that you hopefully included? It raises the turkey off the hot roasting pan, nearly cutting conduction out of the process by reducing the surface area that\u2019s in contact with hot metal.", "If you smell burning, juices from your turkey are probably dripping down onto the hit pan and instantly carbonizing. Pour a little water into the pan to lower its surface temperature and prevent this.", "At each check, you should see the turkey\u2019s internal temperature rise. When it reaches at least 160F, your turkey is done!", "Keep in mind that cooking is exponential--internal temperature will rise slowly at first, and then rapidly near the end. You might need to check once every 10 minutes as temperature nears the critical point.", "When you reach 160F, take out the thermometer and stab the turkey in a few other places. The distribution of muscle over a turkey\u2019s body is not uniform \u2014 some parts have more meat than others, and you want to make sure you weren\u2019t measuring from a thin part. If everything is 160F+, you\u2019re good. I like to cook to 170F, just to ensure that the whole thing ends up > 160F.", "Take the turkey out of the oven, transfer it to a platter, and leave the thermometer in. It can now sit while you wait for your guests, usually for an hour or more. Monitor the internal temperature to ensure it doesn\u2019t trend below 140F \u2014 if it does, you risk bacteria re-colonizing it. You can always put it back into the oven at a lower temperature (170F) to keep it warm if you need.", "Now comes the fun part \u2014 carving the bird. You can do this table-side if you\u2019re bold, or carve in advance. Make sure you have a sharp knife and fork.", "Birds are divided into six main quadrants \u2014 two breasts, two legs, and two wings.", "Start with the breasts. They\u2019re at the top of the bird. Your objective here is to cut slices of breast off, until you get down to the breast bone. Put your fork in to hold the bird steady, and cut off slices of skin and meat on one side of the bird. Repeat on the other side.", "Now, you want to remove both legs. Grab the drumstick (the part you\u2019re served at the ren fair) and pull the leg away from the bird a bit. Find the part where it meats the side of the bird, and slice away until the leg is free. There\u2019s a joint in there, and once you dissect down to it and slice through, the leg should come free. Be careful!", "The leg is further divided into two sub portions \u2014 the drumstick and the thigh. Bend the drumstick the wrong way, and then slice through the joint where it connects to the thigh. Ideally, you\u2019ll get two nice separate pieces of meat.", "Finally, find the wings on the front of the bird, and follow the same function that you used for the legs. Your turkey is carved!", "Don\u2019t focus on perfection here \u2014 you\u2019re dismembering a bird, and this is the rawest, most primal aspect of the whole process. If your guests are looking away (or after they leave), you can also pull pieces of meat off directly with you hands, which is often easier than the fancy knife carving.", "Most people ask their guests if they want dark or white meat. The difference is in the amount of fat in the meat, and the amount of myoglobin it contains. Myoglobin contains heme, and is used to transfer oxygen to active muscles. Dark meat is in the legs \u2014 those are the parts the turkey used for standing, so they contain slow twitch muscles, lots of myoglobin (which gives the dark color), and fat.", "The white meat (in a turkey) is in the breast, and is fast-twitch muscle, with little fat and little myoglobin. It connects to the wings \u2014 since turkeys are flightless, they don\u2019t use their wings a lot, and myoglobin isn\u2019t necessary. As an aside, ducks are all dark meat, since they use their wings to fly and thus have myoglobin throughout their muscles.", "Phew, that was a lot of words \u2014 here is is in pseudo-Python if that\u2019s easier.", "Congrats, you\u2019ve cooked your first turkey!", "Let\u2019s all be thankful for our loved ones, the bird, the meal, and the algorithm that got us here.", "Now if you ask really nicely in the responses, I might share an algorithm for gravy, too!", "Your home for data science.
