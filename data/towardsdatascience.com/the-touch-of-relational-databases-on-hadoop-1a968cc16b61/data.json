On the other hand, the role of Relational Databases too cannot be forgotten, when we talk about big data processing or any kind of data processing in general. The reason is Relational Databases are still a very popular data storing mechanism catering towards different OLTP and OLAP operations. If someone is willing to integrate Hadoop technologies into a domain-specific big data processing task, but their data resides in a relational database there should be a link between Hadoop and RDBMS. And, there are many skilled and specialized developers who are competent in SQL and relational databases. Therefore, the Hadoop ecosystem will be incomplete if it does not provide support for relational databases and related technologies. The purpose of this article is to talk about how Hadoop ecosystem is connected to RDBMS related technologies.", "Hive is Hadoop\u2019s way of allowing SQL experts to work with huge amounts of data. It provides an SQL like interface to deal with data residing in HDFS or other data stores. Interaction between the user and Hive can happen via different streams like Hive Web UI, CLI and Hive HD Insight. The underlying query language is known as HiveQL and it is very similar to SQL, making it easy to be used by SQL experts. Even though the syntax is similar to SQL, queries written in HiveQL are converted into MapReduce or Tez jobs so they can run efficiently on distributed datasets. The MapReduce/Tez jobs run on top of HDFS or a similar distributed data store and return a result to the user hiding the underlying complexity. Because Hive stores data in a de-normalized way and the latency that is introduced, it is not recommended to use Hive for OLTP operations, but it is a very good choice for OLAP and warehousing operations done on Hadoop eco system.", "Following features of Hive increase its prominence in the Hadoop ecosystem.", "The above-described features make Hive a very easy to use technology in the Hadoop ecosystem, especially for people with SQL knowledge. Following are sample HiveQL queries which show its similarity to SQL.", "This command creates a table called employee.", "The data can be loaded to the created table like follows. This loads data from a local text file. But data can be loaded from a different source such as HDFS.", "Following is a sample select query.", "We can perform normal SQL operations such as order by, group by, joins and many more.", "Now you should be clear that Hive provides a strong mechanism for developers and analysts familiar with SQL to utilize data in HDFS or another distributed data source in an environment similar to RDBMS.", "In the previous section, we discussed Hive which provides a mechanism to process data that already resides in distributed data systems. But sometimes we may want to keep our data in a relational database like MySQL but process them in a distributed manner. In order to achieve this, there must be a link between our relational database and Hadoop to transfer data in and out. This is obtained via Apache Sqoop.", "Sqoop uses map-only jobs (mappers) to import and export data.", "Data Import: When importing data to HDFS, Sqoop consumes metadata from the relational database and map-only jobs transfer actual data from the DB and store in HDFS directories. The default file contains comma-delimited fields, and the records are separated by new lines. This can be overridden by specifying the record terminator character and the field separator. Sqoop can directly import data to Hive too by issuing create table and load data commands. Importantly Sqoop supports incremental imports, where only those rows that are new will be added to the existing database allowing easy synchronization of data.", "Data Export: Sqoop can transfer data from HDFS to a relational database. The input of the Sqoop file would be the records that are considered as rows in the table. This too is achieved via map-only jobs.", "The purpose of this article was to explain how different technologies of the Hadoop ecosystem can be connected to create a RDBMS based subsystem in a distributed data processing environment. To visualize things, using Sqoop we can pump data to/from our RDBMS of choice (MySQL for example) from/to HDFS and then use Hive to process those data loaded to Hadoop in a distributed manner in an OLAP environment. These capabilities make it easy to integrate Hadoop into real world big data systems. Quite interesting, isn't it?", "Your home for data science.
