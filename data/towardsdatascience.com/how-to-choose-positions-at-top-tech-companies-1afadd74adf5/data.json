The truth is that this is actually very hard to do. The reason for this is that, due to factors like salary and prestige, pretty much everybody in the world wants to work at a company like Google, Facebook or Amazon.", "In retrospect, looking back at the beginning of my own career, I must admit that I got pretty lucky to get to Amazon. Being invited for an interview was a fortunate event of my application being sent to the right place at the right time when there were not many other highly qualified candidates in the mix.", "Before my lucky break, however, I have suffered painful months of over-polishing my CV, writing cover letters and never even hearing back from the companies I applied to. What I did not know at the time was the underlying economical factors that were preventing me from entering the top technological echelons of the world.", "Hence, I decided to write this article for all the people that are also struggling to get their CVs noticed when they apply to companies like Google and Facebook and do not know why.", "It all boils down to the age old principle of supply and demand. The tech companies are in demand of tech talent and you are part of the supply. The more candidates apply to a given position, the harder it is for any of them to get it.", "The problem is that the supply of talent is way too big for the couple of top tech companies out there and, hence, they can be very picky about who they let in.", "The way to fight this is to make use of the 2 general truths about supply and demand in the job market:", "Now, let us take a look at how you can use the above stated 2 rules when you are looking at different roles and different locations to maximise your chances of getting in your favourite tech company.", "As discussed above, the difficulty of getting into any of the FAANG companies is a function of the supply of talent at a given location. This differs drastically from place to place and you can take advantage of this if you do your research.", "For example, getting a software engineering position in California is generally very hard because, for various reasons, everybody wants to work and live in California. In addition to that, you have schools like Stanford and Berkeley pumping thousands of very able candidates into the Californian job market every year.", "In contrast, getting a similar role in Prague, Czech Republic, is much easier. This is because Prague is not on the list of Sexy Places for foreign software engineers and because most of the tech savvy Czechs leave for opportunities abroad in search of higher salaries.", "Hence, if you are in, say, Europe and you dream of working as an engineer in California, you might have greater chances of success by applying to a place like Prague (Amazon and Microsoft have offices there) first and then pursuing an internal transfer to California after a couple of years in the company than by applying directly to Silicon Valley from the outside.", "The cruel rules of supply and demand that we observed in the section for location govern job titles in exactly the same way. Simply, there are roles which are naturally more attractive than others. What happens is that, due to the global nature of our world today, candidates often find themselves competing against thousands other eager beavers for a few hot positions.", "There are 2 approaches one can take in this present state of affairs. The 1st is to simply apply to whatever positions you like the most. The problem with this is that, most probably, a lot of other people like this role as well. Hence this approach is suitable only for people with confidence that they can take on the fierce competition and have solid resumes and experience to back this up.", "If you are not one of these people or you are just starting out fresh out of university, do not despair and continue reading. The 2nd approach is to apply to a less prestigious position which is easier to attain and then work yourself up to your dream job from within the company. For instance, Amazon is heavily focused on developing its workforce and has processes for changing roles.", "For example, let us assume you just finished your Master Degree in Machine Learning and are eager to start your career as a data scientist. Unfortunately for you, Data Scientist is the new sexy job (you probably already knew that\u2026) and thousands of other candidates with similar credentials want a Data Scientist role in one of the top tech companies.", "To bypass the vicious funnel, you can apply to a similar role that is less sexy, say Data Analyst, for which you might be a bit overqualified and, hence, will be easier to get. Once on the job, you just need to find opportunities where you can generate experiences related to your dream role, like building an ML model in addition to generating that nice excel spread sheet that you were originally asked to do. After some time of putting in this extra effort, you should be able to start an internal role change process.", "If you are fresh out of school or you are looking for a domain change, then internships can serve as an easier entry point to the FAANG. In general, the hiring bar for interns is much lower than that for full timers. At the same time, if you do a great job as an intern, you will most likely get a full time offer at the end of your internship.", "For example, if you are struggling to get a full time role as a software engineer, try to apply for a software engineering internship instead. If you get in, be grateful and work your ass off. If you manage to impress your colleagues enough, a return offer will inevitably follow (that is how I got into Amazon).", "The main point for you to take away from this article is that, if you are trying to land a job at one of the top tech companies, you might be forced into making some kind of a trade off between the role that you will be doing and the location where you will be based.", "Maybe, you will need to do with a less sexy job title or with a less interesting place to live. Or, you will need to take a hit on both fronts just to get in. Do not lose heart. It\u2019s ok, everybody needs to start somewhere. Once you are in, you will have plenty of opportunities to grow.", "I hope this article will help you avoid the pitfalls of the global economy, get your dream job at FAANG and kickstart your successful career in tech.
