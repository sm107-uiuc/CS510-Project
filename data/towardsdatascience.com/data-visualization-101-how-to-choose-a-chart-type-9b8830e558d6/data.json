At the beginning of the project, visualizing your data helps you understand it better, find patterns and trends.", "At the end of the project, after you\u2019ve done your analysis and applied different machine learning models, data visualization will help you communicate your results more efficiently.", "Humans are visual creatures by nature; things make sense to us when it\u2019s represented in an easy to understand visualization. It\u2019s way easier to interpret a bar chart than it is to look at massive amounts of numbers in a spreadsheet.", "Efficient data visualization can make or break your project. If you put tons of effort into analyzing and modeling your data, but you ended up using the wrong chart type to present your results, your audience will not grasp the effort you put in or how to use these results.", "There are many chart types, so many, the process of choosing the correct one can be overwhelming and confusing. This article will \u2014 hopefully \u2014 give you a simple and straightforward approach to selecting the best chart type that represents your data perfectly and communicate it most efficiently.", "Before you start looking at chart types, you need to ask yourself 5 critical questions about your data. These questions will help you understand your data better and hence, choose the perfect chart type to represent it.", "Data is just a story told in numbers.", "So, the first thing you need to know about your data is, what story is it trying to deliver? Why was this data collected, and how?", "Is your data collected to find trends? To compare different options? Is it showing some distribution? Or is used to observe the relationship between different value sets?", "Understanding the origin story of your data and knowing what it\u2019s trying to deliver will make choosing a chart type a much easier task for you.", "Once you figured out the story behind your data, next, you need to know who you will be presenting your results for. If you\u2019re analyzing stock market trends and you will present your findings to some businessmen, you might use a different chart type than if you were representing your finding for people getting started with the stock market.", "The whole purpose of using data visualization is to make data communication more efficient.", "For that reason, you need to know your audience so you can choose the best chart type to use when representing your data to them.", "The size of your data will significantly affect the type of chart you will use. Some types of charts are not meant to be used with massive datasets, while others are perfect for big data.", "For example, piecharts work best with a small number of datasets; however, if you\u2019re using a significant amount of datasets, using a scatter plot will make more sense.", "You need to select a chart type that fits the size of your data best and represents it clearly without cluttering.", "There are several types of data, describe, continuous, qualitative, or categorial. You can use the kind of data to eliminate some chart types. For example, if you have continuous data, a bar chart may not be the best choice; you may need to go with a line chart instead.", "Similarly, if you have categorical data, then using a bar chart or a pie chart may be a good idea. You probably will not want to use a line chart with categorical data, because by definition, you can\u2019t have continuous categories. The has to be a discrete finite amount of categories.", "Finally, you need to ask yourself how do the different elements of your data relate. Is your data order based on some factor \u2014 time, size, type? Doesn\u2019t represent a ranking based on some variable? Or a correlation between different variables?", "Is your data a time-series \u2014 data that changes over time? Or is it more of a distribution?", "The relationship between the values within your dataset may decide on what chart type to use a bit more straightforward.", "There are more than 40 types of charts out there; some are more commonly used than others because they are easier to build and interpret. Let\u2019s talk about the top 7 used charts type and when to use each of them.", "Whenever you decide to create some data visualization, use these best practices to make it more straightforward and effective.", "Before you choose what chart type to use, you need to get to know your data better, the story behind it, and your target audience/media. Whenever you try to create a visualization, chose simple colors and fonts.", "Always aim for simple visualization than complex ones. The goal of visualizing data is to make it easier to understand and read. So, avoid overloading and cluttering your graphs. Having multiple simple graphs is always better than one elaborate graph.", "This article is the first of three-part series on visualization 101. The next articles will address tips for effective data visualization and the different visualization libraries in Python and how to choose the best one based on your data and graph type.", "Your home for data science.
