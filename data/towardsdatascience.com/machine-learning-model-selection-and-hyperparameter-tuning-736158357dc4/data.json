Mostly, I would be using statistical models for smoothing out erroneous signals from DNA data and I believe it is a common concern among Data Science enthusiasts to pick a model to explain the behavior of data. I thought it would be useful to share how one might tackle such situations using the libraries that are available off-the-shelf. Furthermore, selecting a model is not enough unless you know the most suitable hyperparameters to progress. Let\u2019s look at a simple scenario to understand how it can be done.", "Prediction requirements can be of several kinds. Mainly we can see two kinds as interpolation and extrapolation. In interpolation, we try to predict the label value of missing variable value. In simple terms, we know the surrounding data points and we try to predict a different data point within the same function domain. In contrast, extrapolation intends to predict a value that is slightly away from the existing data points. An example would be to predict the rainfall of tomorrow, given the rainfall of the two previous days and today.", "The simplest way of simulating such a scenario is to use a known function and check it\u2019s behavior. Let us usey = 5000*sin(x) as an example. If we look at the generating code and the plot, it would look like below.", "Now that we have seen the graph or the trend, let us assume we only have the data points and we are required to develop a regressor that can fit up to x=8.", "Random forest is a popular regression technique. However, Random forest is quite popular towards the problem of overfitting (too much specialized towards the training set). Following is the code and prediction using the Random forest regressor.", "We can clearly see that the model closely imitates the predicted values. This is a good thing. Note that we split the training and test sets to make sure there is no significant overfitting. However, if we look into the future prediction we can see something interesting.", "Oops!. We can see that the value beyond the training limit makes no sense. This is because Random forest has learned to predict only within the training range, or just to interpolate. This is where polynomial regressions come in handy.", "Polynomial regression tries to fit a polynomial function to express the data. However, the degree of the polynomial to fit is a hyperparameter that cannot be learned. Let us have a look at a polynomial fit on our data.", "We can see although my guess about polynomial degree being 3 is not very reasonable. However, I could keep on putting values in and test. But sklearn has a far smarter way of doing this.", "Sklearn library provides us with functionality to define a grid of parameters and to pick the optimum one. Let us see how that can be used to decide on a proper degree for our prediction.", "Here we choose degrees from 2 to 8 for the experiment. This grid search can be used with any other model and you can have as many parameters as possible. In this scenario, we are trying to find the set of parameters that minimizes the neg_mean_squared_error , or pick the point with the minimum mean squared error. However, for larger parameter spaces RandomizedSearhCV is recommended.", "best_params_ will output the best set of parameters as a python dictionary. Simple as that.", "Now if we use the grid_search for our prediction, we can see that we have a better estimate for the potential future X values.", "We can see that the predicted polynomial only holds true for a smaller margin away from the training set. This is because our function sin(x) is a period function for which no perfect polynomial fit exists unless we provide all the possible values which are the real numbers.", "I hope this article helps you to use python\u2019s inbuilt grid search function for hyperparameter tuning. This can also be used for more complex scenarios such as clustering with predefined cluster sizes, varying epsilon value for optimizations, etc.", "If you\u2019re looking for an ML tool with support for parameter tuning, check the following link;", "Your home for data science.
