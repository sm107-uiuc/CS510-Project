Still, I\u2019ve opened the URL and watched the introduction video.", "It was one of those rare times when I was legitimately intrigued.", "From there I\u2019ve quickly responded to Tobias, and he kindly offered me to test out the library and see if I liked it.", "How was it? Well, you\u2019ll have to keep reading to find the answer to that. So let\u2019s get started.", "In a world where such amazing libraries like Numpy and Pandas are free to use, this question may not even pop in your head. However, it should, because not all versions of Bamboolib are free.", "If you don\u2019t mind sharing your work with others, then yeah, it\u2019s free to use, but if that poses a problem then it will set you back at least $10 a month which might be a bummer for the average users. Down below is the full pricing list:", "As the developer of the library stated, Bamboolib is designed to help you learn Pandas, so I don\u2019t see a problem with going with the free option \u2014 most likely you won\u2019t be working on some top-secret project if just starting out.", "This review will, however, be based on the private version of the library, as that\u2019s the one Tobias gave access to me. With that being said, this article is by no means written with the idea of persuading you to buy the license, it only provides my personal opinion.", "Before jumping into the good stuff, you\u2019ll need to install the library first.", "The first and most obvious thing to do is pip install:", "However, there\u2019s a lot more to do if you want this thing fully working. It is designed to be a Jupyter Lab extension (or Jupyter Notebook if you still use those), so we\u2019ll need to set up a couple of things there also.", "In a command line type the following:", "Now you\u2019ll need to find the major version of Jupyter Lab installed on your machine. You can obtain it with the following command:", "Mine is \u201c1.0\u201d, but yours can be anything, so here\u2019s a generic version of the next command you\u2019ll need to execute:", "Note that you need to replace \u201cMAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION\u201d with the version number, which is \u201c1.0\u201d in my case.", "A couple of commands more and you\u2019re ready to rock:", "That\u2019 it. Now you can start Juypter Lab and we can dive into the good stuff.", "Once in Jupyter, you can import Bamboolib and Pandas, and then use Pandas to load in some dataset:", "Here\u2019s how you\u2019d use the library to view the dataset:", "That\u2019s not gonna work the first time you\u2019re using the library. You\u2019ll need to activate it, so make sure to have the license key somewhere near:", "Once you\u2019ve entered the email and license key, you should get the following message indicating that everything went well:", "Great, now you can once again execute the previous cell. Immediately you\u2019ll see an unfamiliar, but friendly-looking interface:", "Now everything is good to go, and we can dive into some basic functionalities. It was a lot of work to get to this point, but trust me, it was worth it!", "One of the most common everyday tasks of any data analyst/scientist is data filtering. Basically you want to keep only a subset of data that\u2019s relevant to you in a given moment.", "To start filtering with Bamboolib, click on the Filter button.", "A side menu like the one below should pop up. I\u2019ve decided to filter by the \u201cAge\u201d column, and keep only the rows where the value of \u201cAge\u201d is less than 18:", "Once you press Execute, you\u2019ll see the actions took place immediately:", "That\u2019s great! But what more can you do?", "Another one of those common everyday tasks is to replace string values with the respective numerical alternative. This dataset is perfect to demonstrate value replacement because we can easily replace string values in the \u201cSex\u201d column with numeric ones.", "To begin, hit the Replace value button and specify the column, the value you want to replace and what you want to replace it with:", "And once the Execute button is hit:", "Fantastic! You can do the same for the \u201cfemale\u201d option, but it\u2019s up to you whether you want to do it or not.", "Yes, you can also perform aggregations! To get started, click on the Aggregate/Group by button and specify what should be done in the side menu.", "I\u2019ve decided to group by \u201cPclass\u201d, because I want to see the total number of survivors per passenger class:", "That will yield the following output:", "Awesome! Let\u2019s explore one more thing before wrapping up.", "Many times when preparing data for machine learning you\u2019ll want to create dummy variables, ergo create a new column per unique value of a given attribute. It\u2019s a good idea to do so because many machine learning algorithms can\u2019t work with text data.", "To implement that logic via Bamboolib, hit the OneHotEncoder button. I\u2019ve decided to create dummy variables from the \u201cEmbarked\u201d attribute because it has 3 distinct values and you can\u2019t state that one is better than the other. Also, make sure to remove the first dummy to avoid collinearity issues (having variable which is a perfect predictor for some other variable):", "Executing will create two new columns in the dataset, just as you would expect:", "That\u2019s nice, I\u2019ve done my transformations, but what\u2019s next?", "It was all fun and games until now, but sooner or later you\u2019ll notice the operations don\u2019t act in place \u2014 ergo the dataset will not get modified if you don\u2019t explicitly specify it.", "That\u2019s not a bug, as it enables you to play around without messing the original dataset. What Bamboolib will do, however, it will generate Python code for achieving the desired transformations.", "To get the code, first, click on the Export button:", "Now specify how do you want it exported \u2014 I\u2019ve selected the first option:", "And it will finally give you the code which you can copy and apply to the dataset:", "Until this point, I showcased briefly the main functionalities of Bamboolib \u2014 by no means was it exhaustive tutorial \u2014 just wanted to show you the idea behind it.", "The question remains, is it worth the money?", "That is if you decide to go with the paid route. You can still use it for free, provided that you don\u2019t mind sharing your work with others. The library by itself is worth checking out for two main reasons:", "Keep in mind \u2014 you won\u2019t get any additional features with the paid version \u2014 the only real benefit is that your work will be private and that there\u2019s an option for commercial use.", "Even if you\u2019re not ready to grab your credit card just yet, it can\u2019t harm you to try out the free version and see if it\u2019s something you can benefit from.", "Loved the article?
