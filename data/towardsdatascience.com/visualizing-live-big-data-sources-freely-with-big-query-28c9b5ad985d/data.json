Most of the times we use small scale dataset which does not test our skills to scale our solutions.", "Imagine MySQL and Excel as your given data sources. Excel is good as spreadsheet analysis, but they allow maximum 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns. MySQL can run queries for datasets above those capacities but slow to join, aggregate, and visualize huge dataset.", "Why not we shard, aggregate and materialize them in parallel?", "A common solution is to engineer data warehouse and ETL pipeline(Extract, Transform, and Load) which develops materialized smaller aggregated dataset as an input stream with numerous processing units.", "This is what MapReduce tools such as Hadoop is trying to accomplish. It speeds up these jobs by sharding the dataset and running manipulations and aggregations with multiple threads. It works for large data, but hard to build a robust pipeline from the ground up.", "What we need to start is a tool to code, recompile, redeploy, and rerun the job without a huge amount of effort to build and maintain; a processing centre with numerous workers that are fail-safe and scalable with minimum wastage.", "I am going to show to you how you can import Google BigQuery public dataset into a dashboard within fewer than 10 minutes.", "We will experiment with the live public dataset (JHU Covid Dataset) which will give you a quick introduction on how to import this dataset into a dashboard (Google Data Studio).", "Feel free to follow this tutorial or access the dashboard directly here where you can copy and try yourself.", "P.S: If you would like a hacky way to develop and deploy your dashboard as a service. I also provide a tutorial for Dash & Plotly. They are python libraries built on top of Matplotlib and Flask which are a useful framework to build web applications.", "Google Big Query is a Fully managed and serverless data warehouse which empowers to focus on analytics rather than managing infrastructure. It allows you to host your data scalably.", "Google BigQuery is an enterprise data warehouse formed with Google Big Table and Google Cloud Platform. Each technology layer is serverless and scalable with all sizes of data. It works well from Excel Spreadsheet to Petabytes of streaming data.", "Big Query is perfect for big data because it manages replicated distributed storage automatically. It can ingest multiple custom storage that you have then queries a large analysis.", "BigQuery is a distributed data storage to set up a data warehouse and data marts for streaming workflow. BigQuery excels at preventing leakage from configurable access rights layer for each data product.", "Conveniently, Google already has live public datasets such as JHU Live Data Connection ready for us to query.", "BigQuery is connected to Google Cloud Platform which possesses thousands of CPUs in a pool to handle requests and jobs.", "When you execute BigQuery, it momentarily gives you the power to deploy each unit to compute a small piece of the data. BigQuery then merges these data together and aggregate.", "In other words, BigQuery uses similar Map Reduce algorithm and provides enormous clusters without much hassle and configurations needed. All for FREE.", "BigQuery makes it available to the general public through the Google Cloud Public Dataset Program.", "Google already pays to host these datasets and provides public accesses to these datasets. You can access 1TB per month worth of query dataset for free which are host medium to large size projects for your portfolio.", "This helps you configure how often to update your live Data directly to your visualization.", "The idea is to shorten the time between user interactions and user impacts on your dashboard or analysis. So that you could optimize computing capacities and also the impacts that your dashboard brings.", "For example, if you are focusing on taxi revenue per day. It might make sense to make it into a daily freshness. But, if you are focusing on understanding taxi supply/demand traffic. It makes sense to update it hourly.", "On the reports page, starts with a template section. Click the Blank Report template. Google Big Query handles different datasets which you can straight analyse and join right away.", "Open the Public Datasets, My First Project, search for jhu (John Hopkins University Covid datasets)", "If you take a look, you will find fields with their respective types. These include categorical, numerical, and ordinal data types with the default aggregation is the sum for all the numbers.", "At the top, you could click on the Data Freshness, and then you can adjust the freshness. Google has done connections to the data for you So that you could straight away configure its freshness.", "Once you\u2019re done. Click Create Report at the right upper corner which will bring you to the Data Studio site. With that, you managed to connect your dashboard to a live large public dataset to explore.", "At the end, you should get the following result you can follow further make into a dashboard.", "In this tutorial, we learnt the 3 biggest strengths of Google BigQuery to get your live dataset:", "With this, you can import live data to dashboard, drag and drop interactive visualizations and stunning styling, and share it to your colleagues and managers with no hassle.", "As always, please reach out to me on LinkedIn for any of your questions.
