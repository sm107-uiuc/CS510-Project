A cheaper and logistically simpler strategy is to analyze sewage. Because COVID-19 and other viruses can be detected in human excrement, wastewater treatment plants offer aggregated information.", "At the moment, wastewater monitoring is slower and less accurate than individual testing: it takes longer to get results, and it\u2019s harder to determine the exact neighborhood where the outbreak occurred.", "But we already have nearly all the knowledge we need to make wastewater monitoring faster and more accurate. We could detect and respond to COVID-19 (and other virus) outbreaks far more efficiently by:", "We recently outlined a five-part solution that could scale up to monitoring COVID-19 across an entire continent \u2014 or even globally. Since we believe many people, countries, and organizations could benefit from these recommendations, here\u2019s a summary of the potential we\u2019ve identified.", "Wastewater systems around the world work similarly. Water is dumped from individual houses into a larger centralized pipe system. The sewage then flows to a central water treatment plant.", "A virusi can often be detected in an infected person\u2019s fecal matter. That\u2019s why looking at the virus concentration detected at a particular water treatment plant allows us to estimate the number of infected people in the area served by the plant.", "But wastewater can take days or weeks to reach a centralized treatment plant, since there are often intermediary cleaning steps along the way. So monitoring wastewater at the plant often means that while we know an outbreak happened, and we know how big it was, we don\u2019t know exactly when or where in the catchment area it occurred (experts refer to this as poor spatial and temporal resolution).", "For this reason, wastewater monitoring is often overlooked as a potential solution to detect viral outbreaks.", "It would take a large-scale, coordinated effort to improve the current technology and processes in wastewater monitoring. But given the value of pinpointing new viral outbreaks, and compared to the cost and effort required to scale up individual testing, it\u2019s clear this work needs to be done.", "Our proposed five-part solution to improve and scale wastewater monitoring includes:", "Some of these components already exist or are already being developed. We look at each of these five recommendations in detail to show where we are and where we could be (in 3\u201324 months\u2019 time).", "Producing a set of guidelines for treatment plants on how to extract samples and optimize their monitoring processes would support ensuring consistent data in all later steps.", "Creating reference samples and protocols for laboratories would ensure that sample preparation and concentration measurements are consistent.", "Manufacturing smaller versions of the monitoring equipment designed to work in large treatment plants would help us pinpoint outbreaks more accurately and cost-effectively.", "A single data platform used across departments, roles, and cities would get everyone on the same page.", "We can use machine learning to make automated predictions of when and where outbreaks will occur.", "If you\u2019re involved in water management or viral outbreak monitoring and want to discuss bringing this technology to your city, we\u2019d love to talk.
