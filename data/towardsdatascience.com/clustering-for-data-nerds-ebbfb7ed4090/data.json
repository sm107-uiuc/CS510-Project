The classical methods for similarity measures are Euclidean and Manhattan distances.", "K-Means clustering is the simplest and the most commonly used clustering method for splitting a dataset into a set of K (predefined) groups.", "Hand posture and gesture recognition aim to identify specific human gestures and use them to convey information. Properly classifying non-verbal communication is essential for a proficient human computer interaction framework. Data clustering can help solving this task.", "Clustering works by exploring video postures recorded from a set of users and partition the data so that it makes sense.", "By separating video frames into clusters, we could recognize that each user has a unique postures set. We could also group postures into clusters, showing that all users perform the same posture in a similar way.", "We might discover outlier clusters identifying back to users who perform a specific task significantly different than the rest. Such findings could help linking those clusters to some disease condition or to highlight some rare physical properties.", "We will cluster data collected from a motion capture camera system, published in this Gardner\u2019s paper. The system was used to record 14 different users performing 5 distinct hand postures with markers attached to a left-handed glove.", "A set of 4 markers on the back of the glove was used to establish a local coordinate system for the hand. They form a rigid pattern on the back of the hand to serve as identification of the hand\u2019s position and orientation. They also create a local coordinate system for the remaining markers, which were attached to the thumb and fingers of the glove.", "A total of 24 features were collected based on observations from the camera system. Two other variables in the dataset were the ID of the user and the posture that the user made.", "The full dataset is available here. All markers were transformed to the local coordinate system of the record containing them. These data has been preprocessed, including transformation to the local coordinate system of the record, removal of outliers, and removal of missing data.", "The dataset postures_clean.csv contains 38,943 rows and 26 columns. Each row corresponds to a single frame as captured by the camera system.", "Class describes the hand posture of the given observation, with the following possible values:", "User represents the ID of the user that contributed the record.", "Below we plot the number of frames recorded for each user and for each class of posture. We can observe that some postures are missing for some users. Furthermore, the number of frames recorded for a given posture varies among users. We also notice that while user ids are from 0 to 14, the user id 3 is missing, leaving us with 14 users.", "We observe that, due to self-occlusion, many original records had missing markers and were removed from the dataset. Since the number of visible markers in a record is always 8, we could conclude that some users\u2019 postures were completely removed. This would explain for example that user 4 and 7 have just a few records and did perform only some of the postures.", "Some postures have a very low total number of frames recorded. For example, class 1 (fist with thumb out) was recorded only for 3 users, with a total of 52 frames. Probably most of the markers were occluded when users form a fist.", "Looking at the data, we notice that the mean values X, Y, Z are approximately drawn from the same distribution. No visible outlier is present. This suggests that the coordinates represent physical places in the real world. We can also observe that the range of values (min and max) are different from X than from Y or Z. If we were to plot the data in a 3D space, it would appear squeezed in space.", "These findings suggest that it might not be a good idea to scale this kind of data. Scaling would project e.g. X0 values for all users on the same coordinate system, loosing the calibrated locality. Therefore we will proceed without scaling the coordinates.", "Euclidean distance perfectly makes sense for the coordinates in our dataset. However its is not very much appropriate to let the Euclidean distance between user with 0 and user with id 14 impact clustering. Similarly, the posture class 1 differs from posture class 5 in the same way as it differs from posture class 2. Therefore we might have to scale the User and Class features, if we include them in the clustering task.", "PCA can be used to derive a 2-dimensional feature set from our 26-dimensional feature set while striving to preserve as much information (variance) as possible.", "We visualize the first two principal components below. Although two components do explain the variance in the data, they are not able to cluster the records.", "In this article we demonstrate how to perform K-Means clustering with R inside a Python notebook. This is made possible thanks to rpy2, a Python interface to the R language.", "The function below performs K-Means clustering on an input dataframe df. cols_features is the list of columns from the dataframe which we want to consider. If empty, all columns are considered. cols_to_scale is the subset of features which require scaling for proper similarity measurement. nb_clusters is the predefined number of clusters we attempt to build. nb_config is the number of times the process is repeated. cluster_col_name is the column name that is used to store the cluster labels in the original dataframe.", "We first cluster the data using the coordinates features only.", "Now, we cluster while using all columns. We are interested in investigating how the User and Class have effect on how clusters are learned. This step does not make much sense for the purpose of our task, but we were curious in looking at whether K-Means is able to pickup the labels. We standardize the User and the Class columns prior to clustering in order to keep consistent distance measurement.", "Below, we visualize the results for K-Means on a random sample of 2,000 observations without replacement using the R function r_factoextra.fviz_cluster.", "The clusters appear very overlapped on a PCA plot. While the first dimension only explains 13% of the variance in the data, the second component explains just 8%. Some centroids are very close to one-another in that space. We might want to merge some clusters together. Using 14 clusters was not a good choice for our exploration.", "Below we perform K-Means clustering for posture identification by setting the number of clusters to 5. The visualization shows a better clusters separation.", "It is important to assess how good is our clustering, in other words, how well separated are the regions.", "The Gini coefficient is a popular method to evaluate the degree of heterogeneity of a collection of clusters. For K total labels, the Gini coefficient for each cluster is given as follows, where p is the proportion of data point with label i in the cluster.", "In our case, the Gini coefficient would measure if any of the users shows up in high proportion in either of the clusters that were created. If one or more of the users show up in high proportion in the cluster in consideration, the sum of squares for that cluster will be closer to 1 and the Gini coefficient will be closer to 0.", "Usually the Gini coefficient is maximal if the classes are perfectly mixed within the cluster. The 2nd and fourth cluster are the purest, with coefficient 0.405 and 0.285 respectively. The 2nd cluster has a strong proportion (0.697) of a specific posture and would most likely be a strong representative of that posture.", "This provides additional evidence for learning clusters for the purpose of posture identification based on the dataset at hand.", "Entropy can also be used to verify clustering quality. It makes use of the probability of a record in the cluster i of being classified as class i.", "Although the Gini coefficient aims to minimize the probability of misclassification, entropy is a way to measure impurity.", "The entropy is 0 if all records of the cluster belong to the same posture, and the entropy is maximal if we have a uniform postures distribution. In other words, the entropy of a well-separated cluster is zero because the probability is 1 and log(1) = 0. Entropy reaches maximum value when all postures in the cluster have equal probability. Below, we can see that the first, third and fifth cluster are the most impure.", "The results suggest that our dataset is more likely to be classified into 5 groups rather than 14. Given the recorded markers\u2019 positions, we have almost no chance to identify the user from whom the records were made. The positions obtained from the same user do not share enough similarities across different hand postures, so that they can be grouped into a distinct cluster.", "Nevertheless users perform the postures in a similar way, so that the distances between positions recorded from different users is minimal, allowing us to group them into clusters of postures with acceptable purity.", "These results make sense but we might want to search for the best number of clusters which would allow us to achieve better separation, and maybe to learn more about our data. Using the elbow method, gap statistic or the silhouette technique we would be able to evaluate the best choice of the number of clusters.", "Your home for data science.
