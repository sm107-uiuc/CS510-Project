I began looking for a job as a Technical Writer after graduating college at the end of 2011 with a B.S. in Scientific and Technical Communication, and to give perspective to those who weren\u2019t around for 2008, my degree program had to drop the internship requirement because students couldn\u2019t find them. Almost no one was hiring! After a while, I settled for a full-time paid internship as a Product Documentation Specialist at a software company. I needed experience, it seemed like a great place to work, and it paid more than my retail job! Plus, I was done in six months, or less if I didn\u2019t like it, so it was a good risk/reward.", "Writing professionally for eight hours a day with a team of people editing and critiquing my work was a fantastic experience and taught me a ton. Of course I did things other than write, like organize visualizations and edit information, attend meetings with business teams, and work with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) across the company, but my large projects were to write customer facing documentation covering software functionality. I dug into requirements outlined by the business analyst, played with the software myself, and then started documenting. If anyone wants to write as a profession, I highly recommend exploring technical writing and product documentation as a career path! It felt rewarding knowing that people across the country were finding my words helpful while I honed my communication skills that translate to other industries and professions.", "Once my internship ended, I decided to stay with the company and moved onto their Support Team since there were no openings on the Documentation Team. The knowledge and skills I acquired during my internship easily translated to my new job. Although no one was editing my work, I was still writing every day, often step-by-step instructions similar to documentation so I still got practice. As time went on, I used my communication skills to create training programs and internal knowledge articles which added a lot of value to the team. Overall, the job was really rewarding and I made decent money, so I stuck with it for a long time.", "Years passed and I eventually saw two paths to get ahead:", "1. Continue focusing on front-end support and look for more opportunities to write and train.", "2. Pivot to focusing on the technical side of software support and learn databases.", "As a life long learner who has always been interested in computers, I went with option two. It also put me on a path to hard-skills I could add to my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Once I learned how to query databases, I was hooked and put blogging on the side to study Structured Query Language (SQL) in my free time. I asked my Technical Support coworkers for complex SQL examples to review, and I designed databases at home to store stock market quotes. I put in a ton of effort and eventually climbed the ladder into Technical Support.", "When I started studying Technical Writing in college, I never thought I\u2019d end up a computer programmer a decade or so later. In fact, one of the reasons I studied writing is because I didn\u2019t like math and numbers. I tried programming when I was young, and in college I enjoyed logic and symbolic logic, but computer science and advanced mathematics just didn\u2019t click with me. Regardless, getting into SQL acted as the catalyst that propelled me into Data Analytics: I was interested in Finance as a hobby, and I studied Usability and Ergonomics as a part of my Technical Writing degree, so I was familiar with some statistics. I got to the point were querying data felt like another form of technical writing since both are all about breaking down complex steps into small, logical parts. My education in technical writing made it easy to transition into Data Analysis.", "It was a tough decision, but I decided to give up my free time, risk my cushy gig in Tech Support, and dedicate myself to professional development by doubling-down on learning analytics. Not only was I using SQL every day at work, but also I enrolled in a data analysis coding bootcamp hosted at my state college. I went back to school! In the six-month program, I explored data using Excel, Python, NoSQL, SQL, R, and JavaScript. It was a ton of work, but it exposed me to a ton of languages and concepts like machine learning.", "Around that same time, the term Data Science was popping up everywhere and was touted as the \u201csexiest job\u201d of the day. I heard of Data Science before the bootcamp, and I dabbled in sci-kit learn while learning Python basics from a few coding books, but I had no real understanding of what the field was all about. I knew I liked science and data, so I figured I should check it out. The bootcamp wasn\u2019t focused on Data Science but, my final project was a wine recommendation website built using TensorFlow that is still active today! The bootcamp was exactly what I needed to build momentum and break into Analytics or Data Science.", "I graduated from the bootcamp with a decent portfolio of projects and a new found confidence in my ability to code. I noticed a Data Engineer position opened up in the Data Science department so I applied. I had extensive domain knowledge after years at the company, and I had credentials to prove I was a fast learner who can handle my way around some SQL and Python. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t enough. I needed to code faster and be more confident in my knowledge of algorithms and computer science concepts. It was a bummer, but the department needed someone who had more experience than me so I accepted the outcome and kept my nose to the grind-stone.", "Not long after my rejection, the department manager reached out to me about a Product Analyst position on the team. I looked into it and it was the perfect job for my skill-set. The position is communication heavy, yet allots me the freedom to code so I can improve my technical skills. I wanted to work in data science, and I wanted to write and code. The job seemed like a match made in heaven!", "As things panned out in my professional life, I continued to study and code in my free time, and eventually came back to writing too; I couldn\u2019t stay away forever. As I got into Data Science I often came across the online publication, Towards Data Science. After reading enough articles, I built up the confidence and began blogging on Medium to document my coding projects and life lessons. My articles have received a lot of positive feedback, and Medium has turned into a great source of side-cash. I highly recommend anyone interested in writing give it a try.", "Of all the topics and sub-fields in data science, I naturally latched on to Natural Language Processing (NLP). The complexities and subtleties of our communication always seemed like such a defining factor in what makes us a distinct and intelligent species, so training a machine to understand language transformed communication from something ambiguous, persuasive, and soulful into a something that felt mechanical, ordered, and predictable. However, the deeper I got into NLP the better I understood it is the scaffolding from which a new type of technical writer will emerge: The Natural Language Analyst.", "A couple of weeks ago, on their AI Blog, Google announced advancements in using natural language to query databases. Researchers used advanced language models (BERT) and machine learning to come up with a way to return query results without using a query language like SQL:", "While the article concludes this technology has a long way to go, it seems reasonable to think that within a decade natural language querying will be common practice. Data analysis and technical writing will have blended like never before, giving way to new opportunities in both fields! It makes sense as there are so many overlapping skills between Analytics and Technical Writing: statistics, critical thinking, visual rhetoric, logic, persuasive story-telling\u2026 just to name a few!", "Working in Data Science as a Product Analyst, I am communicating with stakeholders about team projects, querying databases for business intelligence, writing python apps to share analysis, and exploring machine learning models/pipelines to improve the internal analytics infrastructure. Strong writing skills are a must-have to be successful in this role, so I am thankful for my background in Scientific and Technical Communication. Although I\u2019m neither a \u201cnumbers guy,\u201d nor brilliant Data Scientist, a background in writing allowed me to follow my passions for data and programming, and it landed me a career in Data Science that I enjoy tremendously!", "Product Manager at Kipsu.
