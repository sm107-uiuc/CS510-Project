In this massive in-depth guide, I will walk you through the step-by-step process I took to become a data scientist. Of course, becoming one from scratch takes determination, motivation, and lots of self-discipline. If you think you are up for the challenge, read on.", "The very first question you should ask, why a Data Scientist?", "The hype around the topic of data science is very real but that should not be the only reason you are coming into this field. The fact is, becoming a Data Scientist is no easy feat. A Data Scientist requires a certain knack for looking at data and it involves lots of experimentation, research, critical and analytical thinking. The media often portrait data science as the cool kids next door, working on amazing technology like AI but behind every buzz word are hours of hard work and perseverance.", "If you think you have done your fair share of research and decided that Data Scientist is right for you, here is the good news.", "The best time to get into data science is NOW.", "Data Science has also matured substantially in recent years with its potentials greatly recognized by most industries. Areas like healthcare, finance, agriculture, retail, defense have already seen their operation impacted by AI and there is only more to come. This means that equipping yourself with data science skills is valuable to your employers, no matter the industry.", "Furthermore, learning data science has never been easier! The immense interest in data science has led to an explosion in the amount of data science resources, benefiting both beginners and practitioners in the field. Video lectures, blog articles, and e-books, a wide variation of teaching materials are publicly available for learners. To add on, offline in-person lessons are also in-demand right now and I will introduce them in the next few sections.", "So should you become a Data Scientist? If you believe in the potential of Data Science, are motivated and driven, I will say go for it.", "Even though I generalize everything as Data Scientists, understand that there are multiple roles in Data Science.", "Specifics of each role are beyond the scope of this guide but this blog post summarized it nicely.", "Why is this important? The role you chose decides the skills you need to hone. A Business Analyst concerns themselves with product details and business knowledge while a Machine Learning Specialist focuses on model building. Knowing which role you wish to specialize in helps to better plan your learning journey. One piece of advice is to leverage any prior experience you may have. This way, you can make yourself more desirable to recruiters as you possess domain-specific data analytics skillsets.", "Do some soul-searching at this stage and find the role you really want. Although this guide focuses primarily on Data Scientist, many of it still applies to any other roles.", "This is the time to assess your past qualifications and see where should you start your data science learning journey. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a fresh start, but it\u2019s important to know where.", "Basically, you should try to check off these fundamental skills needed to become a data scientist;", "Many of you will be doubting yourself at this stage and question if your qualification is able to build a career in data science. I can and I will assure you that you definitely can. Apart from the more academic work such as an AI Research Scientist, you certainly do not need a Ph.D. or even a higher degree to excel in data science.", "Once you figure out where to start, it\u2019s time to put that into action. There are typically 3 ways you can go about learning Data Science.", "These are ranked according to the ability to personalize your learning with 1 as the least customizable to 3 the most flexible. There is no one perfect path, just the one most suitable for you.", "Bootcamps are basically intensive on-campus training that ranges from a few weeks to a few months. They aim to cover as much content as possible in short duration so you would expect a very steep learning curve. Time is also a factor as these often require massive time commitment during the course. As such, this option is only recommended for full-time learners who are able to commit to their schedules.", "In addition, this is also the least personalized option on this list. Mainly because most boot camps assume zero knowledge and attempt to teach everything from scratch, so there is no need to customize your experience as everyone starts equal.", "A bonus point of boot camps is the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals. Your fellow learners will be as motivated as you are and everyone has a common goal. Take this time to network with others and build your data science circle.", "Graduate Degrees usually span from 1\u20132 years for a Master\u2019s degree to 3\u20134 years for a Ph.D. These are specialized postgraduate programs with a validated curriculum for the specialization you chose. Some examples are the MIT Master of Business Analytics and Master of Science in Data Science from Columbia University. Furthermore, these programs provide some degree of personalization where you can choose the course you wish to pursue. You will be able to take charge of your learning and decide the specialization you want. However, stating the obvious here, this is also the most expensive option on this list and you have to take that into your consideration.", "Enrolling in a graduate degree program is often a huge commitment, so make sure you have done your research.", "MOOCs have come a long way since it first started. Recognized universities are releasing some of their modules as MOOCs and even major tech companies like Google have come up with their own online courses. Gone are the times where MOOCs were being frowned upon and companies are becoming more receptive to self-learners. Using the right resources and the right learning path, anyone can build their arsenals of data science skills using online courses.", "In addition, there has been a shift from on-campus teaching to online-style delivery. For people who wanted the flexibility of online courses but the credibility of a university, edX or Coursera have partnered with major Universities to provide their Master\u2019s programs on their platforms. This has brought MOOCs to a new height and changed the definition of what constitutes an online course.", "No matter which path you chose, leveling up your data science skills is just the first step of becoming a Data Scientist.", "While courses tell employers you know data science, projects show them your ability as a Data Scientist. Doing projects not only boosts your resume but also helps to build up your technical skills as a Data Scientist.", "Kaggle, the best data science competition platform. Even though Kaggle is known for its competition, working on Kaggle can be a project in itself. Competition datasets are often real data provided by companies with the intention to tap on the strength of the community to solve their business problem. During the competition, you will go through the whole process of data collection -> data processing -> modeling -> evaluation -> and optimization, similar to any real-life data science project.", "If you are new to Kaggle, competitions are available in a few categories. For starters, there are playground or knowledge competitions that test your fundamentals while featured competitions are available for Data Scientists to compete and win prizes. If possible, work on active featured competitions as ranking yourself against the leaderboard is a good experience and a great addition to your resume.", "However, the major drawback is that datasets from Kaggle are pre-cleaned. Basic pre-processing of data was already done by the submitting companies before hosting the competitions in Kaggle, reducing much of your workload. If you have not heard, Data Scientists typically spend upwards of 70% of their time processing data while only 30% is left for modeling.", "I also recommend you to go out there and work on some self-initiated projects. It does not have to be game-changing or life savings. Just novel and innovative will do the trick. If you know the industry you wish to work in, working on projects relevant to the industry can be a very good start. Find freely available datasets or scrap a website, go through the process of experimentation, and experience what it is like to be a Data Scientist. There is no better advice than having your own pet projects that you can proudly present to the world (and recruiters).", "What do you mean by online presence? Do I need to be an influencer to be a Data Scientist?", "Not quite, but close. Having an online presence has become increasingly important in the tech world including Data Science. For self-taught learners like us, an online presence helps to validate our work and qualification in data science. This validation comes in the form of the followers, comments, and peer-reviews you have in the online space. However, this is not any social media followers or engagement, I refer to people who read and find your articles interesting, people who share the same thoughts or issues as you in the field, or even people who get inspired by your ideas and use your projects.", "Yes, the easiest way to build up your online presence is to write your thoughts and share your work.", "Medium is an online publishing platform where writers can write and share their articles at no cost at all. You do not need a domain name or a hosting server to post your content online. Just sign up for an account, build your profile, and write away. Medium has also become the preferred platform for publishing data science articles making it the best choice for you to start (Why do you think you find this article here).", "So what to write? It can be anything or everything. The main goal is to pen down your thoughts, your journey, and appeal to people like you.", "You do not truly belong to the technology sector if you don\u2019t know GitHub. GitHub is a development platform where users upload their open-source codes in the form of a repository (repo) to manage or share their projects. Furthermore, It has great build-in version control functions that benefit both software engineers and data scientists and allow collaboration between professionals. Hence, starting a GitHub account goes a long way to getting noticed in the tech space. Some potential employers might even ask for your GitHub to assess your projects, codes, and technical competency!", "So what are some of the things you can do with GitHub?", "Never underestimate the power of networking. When walking into unknown territory, having offered a helping hand is rarely a bad thing.", "This is where LinkedIn excels as a social platform. LinkedIn allows users to build their professional profiles and connect people with similar backgrounds. You can find people in similar spaces, send them a personalized message, and build meaningful connections all in a single platform.", "Here are 4 tips to help you optimize your LinkedIn profile.", "Firstly, when logged on to LinkedIn, click on \u2018view profile\u2018 to edit your profile.", "A profile picture and a cover image are used to represent yourself on LinkedIn. This is the first thing people see before reading your profile and a good first impression counts.", "Your profile is segregated into sections where each section tells something about you. The most important sections are your experience, education, certifications, and projects. To start, click on the \u2018Add profile section\u2018 and add these sections individually to your profile.", "You can find \u2018Experience\u2018, \u2018Education\u2018 and Certifications under Background while \u2018Projects\u2018 can be found under Accomplishments. Flaunt your achievements, this is your profile and you should be proud of what you have achieved. Nothing is too insignificant, give yourself the credit you deserved. With that said, your profile should remain factual. Honesty is the best policy.", "Next, personalize your intro by pressing the pencil symbol under your cover image. Change your headline to reflect your current status. It can be your current role in the company, current education, or even a general statement about yourself.", "Anything that describes you really. The headline will appear alongside your profile picture so here is also where your first impression goes. Make it count.", "After completing your profile, the last step is to let recruiters know that you are open to opportunities. Head back to your profile page, click on the \u2018Add profile section\u2018 and find \u2018Looking for job opportunities\u2018 under Intro.", "Once set up, it will appear on your profile but only visible to recruiters.", "Now that you are done, pull out your contacts or head to the suggested networks and start connecting. Happy linkeding.", "LinkedIn is hardly the only way to network. In fact, connecting with others in-person leaves a more impactful impression and certainly more meaningful connections. Join your local data science community, attend meet-ups, or attend some data science conferences. Even if you are using LinkedIn, do not miss out on these channels of networking. All are great avenues to meet people, gather ideas, and who knows, you might find your next boss in the mix.", "Finally, you are ready to get a job in Data Science. Or is it?", "There is just one last hurdle \u2014 getting your resume noticed by employers. Recruiters and employers get hundreds of resumes per job opening, so how do you make your resume stand out from the rest and not get filtered to its demise.", "Other than your name, make sure to add your social and online profiles. This is to allow recruiters to find you easily if they want to.", "If you do not have any data science-related experience, we recommend prioritizing your data science projects before experience. This way, it will be kept relevant to the job scope for whoever reads it.", "List down your top 3 projects starting from the most impactful. Try to have some variations in your projects to show a wide range of competencies.", "The Experience section will come next, list your 2\u20133 most relevant and recent working experiences.", "Here is where your blogging experience can come in handy if you do not have any tech experience. It might not seem much but it will definitely show your enthusiasm and motivation in the area of data science.", "As for other experiences, keep them relevant to the employers. Even if your experience is not related to data science, rephrase it to advertise your soft skills such as communication, leadership, or time management. All of which is as important as your technical skills for a data scientist.", "Be strategic and relevant in this section. Although you can pretty much write anything here, keep it to the most important few especially in the \u2018Certification & Course\u2018 section. Unless your certifications are widely recognized, most employers do not care what MOOCs you have taken. Only state those that are popular or from a highly credible university.", "As for technical skills, do not list all skills you think you know. Be strategic. Use the company\u2019s Job Description as a reference and write those that are required for the role you are applying for.", "Try to keep your resume within one page, the most two. Concise is key and personalize each resume to the role you are applying before you hit the send button.", "Now you are ready to be hired as a data scientist, go ahead send your resume and hope for the best. As a self-taught data scientist, my advice to those walking the same path is to persevere. Data science is never easy and so is getting hired to be one. Assess your ability and do not be afraid to start lower.", "Don\u2019t wait, be motivated, get working, and join me in this exciting career of a Data Scientist.", "Passionate about the changing healthcare landscape in Singapore and hope to be at the forefront of these changes."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
