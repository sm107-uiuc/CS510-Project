It is also one of the first problems that you\u2019ll encounter as you enter the realm of deep learning.", "In this article, we will design a neural network that uses the Python library Keras to learn to classify handwritten digits of the MNIST dataset.", "The crazy thing about solving MNIST is that it isn\u2019t resource-intensive at all. You do not need a GPU. The model we build here can be trained quickly on any modern CPU in under a minute.", "The MNIST dataset is a set of 60,000 training images plus 10,000 test images, assembled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the 1980s. These images are encoded as NumPy arrays, and the labels are an array of digits, ranging from 0 to 9. The images and labels have a one-to-one correspondence.", "Assuming that you have already installed Anaconda, we shall briefly discuss installing Keras and other dependencies.", "While Anaconda bundles a lot of good stuff by default, it does not ship with Keras pre-installed. The good folks over at Anaconda Cloud, however, have a customized Keras package available here.", "You could install the same from the conda-forge channel using the command line.", "The MNIST Image Classification Problem is a Multiclass Classification problem. Let us implement the pedagogy, as discussed above.", "The workflow adopted is simple. We\u2019ll feed the training data to the neural network. The network will then learn to associate images and labels. Finally, the network will produce predictions for testing data and the degree of accuracy achieved.", "The MNIST dataset comes preloaded in Keras, in the form of a set of four NumPy arrays. We\u2019ll load the dataset using load_data() function.", "We\u2019ll build the network using densely connected (also called fully connected) sequential neural layers*. Layers are the core building block of a neural network. They are basic tensor operations that implement a progressive \u2018data distillation.\u2019", "A layer takes the output of the layer before it as input.", "Our network consists of two fully connected layers. The second (and last) layer is a 10-way softmax layer, which returns an array of 10 probability scores. Each score is the probability that the current digit image belongs to one of our 10 digit classes.", "Now let\u2019s select an optimizer, a loss function & metrics for evaluation of model performance.", "We\u2019ll pre-process the image data by reshaping it into the shape that the network expects and by scaling it so that all values are in the [0,1] interval.", "We will then categorically encode the labels, using to_categorical function from keras.utils", "Now, we are ready to train our network.", "Keras trains the network via a call to the network\u2019s fit() method. We fit the model to its training data.", "As the network trains, you will see its accuracy increase and loss decrease. The times you see here are training times corresponding to an i7 CPU.", "We have attained a training accuracy of 98.87% This measure tells us that our network correctly classified 98.87% of images in the testing data.", "The MNIST dataset reserves 10,000 images as test_images We will evaluate the performance of our network by testing it on this previously unseen dataset.", "We attain a testing accuracy of 97.75% It is understandably lower compared to training accuracy due to overfitting.", "To visualize our Neural network, we will need a couple of extra dependencies. You can install them using", "We\u2019ll use ann-visualizer to visualize our neural network as a graph. This step is optional; you may choose not to visualize your network. However, looking at the graph is undoubtedly more fun.", "graphviz is a dependency for ann-visualizer", "For more information on Visualizing Neural Networks check out the GitHub Repository of ann-visualizer that you just used.", "Congratulations! You have successfully crossed the threshold of Deep Learning. If this was your first foray into Neural Networks, I hope you enjoyed it.", "I recommend that you work along with the article. You can solve the MNIST image classification problem in under ten minutes. Make sure to stress enough on Pedagogy we discussed earlier. That is the basis of solving and implementing Neural Networks across the board.", "I assume that the reader has a working understanding of technicalities like optimizer, categorical encoding, loss function, and metrics. You can find my practice notes on these concepts here.", "For more, please check out the book Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet.", "Feel free to check out this article\u2019s implementation and more of my work on GitHub.", "Your home for data science.
