Manuel, Lance Dy, Sean ChuaAdvisor: Martin Gomez", "Extraordinary times call for extraordinary attention. In this piece, we provide careful, delicate, and in-depth attention to details on how we can use both classic and innovative data science techniques to help understand the current pandemic, and possibly prepare for future ones.", "As the Philippines transitions from Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) to General Community Quarantine (GCQ), we look at the gaps here and there, and in between \u2014 from multiple visual fronts.", "tldr; We want to quickly understand if we\u2019re screwed. One of the best ways to do this is to look at things from a bird\u2019s eye view. If you want to jump straight into the pretty graphics and analysis, please go ahead and scroll right to it. Else, please enjoy the musings of some high school minds:", "We\u2019ll go out on our limbs and say that you came here because of the section title. What used to be a satirical question has metamorphosed into a grave contemplation on our capacity to mitigate the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Our capability to have an effective and sustainable action plan for the crisis is being questioned, adding more pressure to the already burdened healthcare system. At the time of writing, the COVID-19 disease has managed to infiltrate the bodies of more than 5.6 million people worldwide, of which at least 356,000 individuals have expired. As we know, COVID-19 has, unfortunately, transgressed onto Philippine soil, wreaking havoc all over the archipelago. To date, more than 15,000 cases have been recorded, with 900+ deaths tallied.", "With the chronic underfunding of Philippine healthcare, concerns have been raised on our country\u2019s ability to cope with the hundreds of daily cases. Frankly, there is reason to be apprehensive of the overload of infections, since there seems to be no way around the crisis as of the moment. With all due respect to everyone\u2019s efforts in alleviating the pain that this virus has caused, successfully beating COVID-19 is quite a stretch. If new cases consistently outnumber recoveries in the next few months, then the additional complications it entails will be a tough pill to swallow. Hospitals and quarantine facilities will be jam-packed. This could further increase transmission, lessen recoveries, overwhelm healthcare workers, and cause the number of fatalities to rise drastically.", "While the government has imposed mandatory quarantines to \u201cflatten the epidemiological curve,\u201d hopes to quickly contain the spread of the virus diminished as the number of cases continue to rack up daily. With fluctuating numbers continuously slapping us in the face, the \u201cpatterns of flattening the curve\u201d that the Department of Health has observed only prove two things: 1. That this battle is far from over. 2. That the person assigned to the job needs a new pair of glasses.", "So, let us find out if we are, indeed, royally screwed.", "Plotting each representative population as a point allows us to identify areas which are more densely populated, such as cities and urban areas, in which the virus is more likely to spread.", "How do we know that the visualization above makes sense? Check out the terrain of the Philippines on Google Maps below. Areas with virtually no one are either bodies of water, or mountainous regions.", "So why not just use Google Maps all the way? Because it\u2019s overused, and that we can do things that are even more beautiful.", "Please note that for the succeeding visualizations, we darkened the plots for the population to make the other data more visible. Other data sources are indicated after the title. DOH means the Philippines\u2019 Department of Health, NTF means the National Task Force against COVID-19. Updated date follows.", "Each red circle represents a municipality with confirmed cases, with the area of each circle corresponding to the number of cases.", "This visualization allows us to identify which areas of the country are local hotspots \u2014 a large number of cases can be found in NCR and Cebu City, with the highest concentration in NCR.", "However, it is critical to note that while this is the official data reported by the Philippine government, reality of infections and cases cannot be known until mass testing happens.", "Let\u2019s have a look at the different standard healthcare facilities in the Philippines. First up are hospitals. The DOH classifies hospitals into three levels:", "Level 1 hospitals are equipped to provide basic hospital functions, catering to patients who only need minor care and supervision. L1 hospitals, however, have the capability to isolate patients.", "Level 2 and Level 3 hospitals build upon the provisions of L1 hospitals. L2 and L3 hospitals include several additional facilities, such as more specialized clinical services. Key facilities that L2 and L3 hospitals have in response to COVID-19 include Respiratory Units and Intensive Care Units (ICUs), both of which are critical to the survival of COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms. As such, the DOH has mandated that L2 and L3 hospitals are not allowed to refuse COVID patients and PUIs.", "We represented the hospitals with circles, color-coded according to the hospital\u2019s level, with the area corresponding to the hospital\u2019s bed capacity.", "Evidently, more urbanized areas such as Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao City have higher bed capacities, and more Level 3 hospitals to cater to patients.", "However, the same cannot be said for the provinces of Mindoro, Palawan, Zamboanga Del Norte, Zamboanga Sibugay, and Zamboanga Del Sur. They lack the capacity to handle more serious outbreaks, due to low bed capacities, and a lack of Level 2 and 3 hospitals.", "Plotting the COVID cases alongside the hospitals yields this result:", "Despite the increased capacity of healthcare facilities in more urbanized areas, they still tend to be local hotspots, given their population density. Noting that the bed capacity is scaled appropriately to a single COVID-19 case, due to the large number of hotspots in Metro Manila, it is highly possible for these healthcare systems to fail. Moreover, despite the hospital capacity of Cebu and the Level 2 and 3 hospitals present in the city, the COVID-19 outbreak can quickly overwhelm their healthcare facilities.", "On the other hand, one may be inclined to believe that less densely populated areas are less susceptible to an outbreak. However, these isolated cases, if left unchecked, may spread rapidly, especially without the necessary healthcare facilities to mitigate the spread.", "even more so hospitals to cater to mild cases, local government health units, including Barangay Health Stations and Rural Health units, were established to complement the current capacities of hospitals, and to serve more rural areas.", "Barangay Health Stations are mainly staffed by Barangay Health Workers, who \u201crender primary healthcare services in the community\u201d such as the administration of first aid, collection of vital statistics, assistance in immunization, and other responsibilities.", "Barangay Health Stations are satellite health facilities of the Rural Health Units or RHUs.", "Also known as Municipal Health Centers, or designated as City Health Centers in more urbanized areas, Rural Health Units are staffed by a municipal health officer, public health nurse, midwife, and a sanitary inspector. They provide basic clinical and preventive health services for the municipality/city.", "Infirmaries are health facilities that provide emergency treatment and care to the sick and injured, as well as clinical management for mothers and babies. They offer minimal to intermediate care and management on medicine, non-surgical childbirth, and minor surgeries.", "It is important to point out that Barangay Health Stations, Rural Health Units, and Infirmaries are not equipped to treat COVID-19 cases. Instead, these facilities would most likely be best for emergencies and primary care, reducing the burden of hospitals who have to cater to COVID-19 positive cases.", "These rural health facilities evidently do much to extend the accessibility of immediate care throughout the country. However, these should not be seen as substitutes for more comprehensive primary health facilities.", "These facilities enable mild to moderate coronavirus patients to be treated and isolated. A number of these facilities are located near hospitals to facilitate the patients\u2019 transfer in case their condition worsens. Here is the plot of these quarantine sites, again with the size of the circle as an indication of capacity:", "While quarantine facilities are able to complement hospitals in more urbanized areas, their placement does little to address the needs of isolated cases, leaving areas such as Palawan, Samar, Leyte, and other island provinces vulnerable to an outbreak.", "In the early sections of this article, we said that we can make our work beautiful. We believe that what we\u2019ve produced are both aesthetic and functional, which is the aim of any good visualization. Each color, each element, each size, has been rationalized to achieve understandable visual communication.", "We used Python to code it, worked on it together using Colab from Google Research, took advantage of Colab\u2019s free GPU render capabilities, used classic data science libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Shapely. We also wanted to ensure GIS correctness, and thus threw in GeoPandas, too.", "Simply put, the current state of our healthcare system isn\u2019t too promising. Assuming that the rate of transmission continues at its current pace, it won\u2019t take too long \u2019til hospitals and other healthcare centers become overwhelmed, which would mean that we are, in fact, utterly screwed.", "So, how do we catch up to ensure we don\u2019t get screwed, or at the very least, unscrew ourselves the next time around? Well, there are some things we can do to prepare for the next epidemic:", "So, while we all jam to the Bee Gees\u2019 \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive,\u201d let us do our part to help contain this outbreak by staying indoors, practicing proper hygiene, maintaining physical distancing, and coordinating with donation centers to provide aid to those hit hardest by our country\u2019s ordeal.", "One of the fantastic things today about tech is that it is now very possible to see and analyze real-time data. Below is a live dashboard that reflects data off a direct feed from the Department of Health, freshly processed using BigQuery, and crafted on the fly using Google\u2019s Data Studio.", "Case data is the latest available data. Capacity data is based on data from d-2. Capacity data is based on d-2 data as there is a slight delay in the reporting of capacities from the health facilities. This is to ensure that the dashboard below won\u2019t show No data. Hopefully, in the near future, we\u2019ll see real-time reporting of capacities from the health facilities, especially from the Level 2 and 3 hospitals.", "Here\u2019s the dashboard. For us, when we saw this, we have more questions than answers. How about you?", "We\u2019re all part of a non-profit, purely volunteer group and tech platform called Dashboard Philippines.", "One of the initiatives of Dashboard Philippines is the Hospital Triage system. It displays the latest bed availabilities of the major health facilities in the Philippines. It\u2019s currently being managed and maintained by Joaquin de Castro, Andrew Go Alcantara, and Zander Sy. Joaq is incoming Grade 9, Drew is incoming Grade 12, and Zand is incoming Grade 11, all from Xavier School.", "The data is made possible through the DOH Data Collect project, and pushed through the DOH Data Drop.", "They ensure that if patients need rooms to be able to check-in to, especially those with urgent needs, that they are able to do so.", "Adrian Dar Serapio graduated from Xavier School this 2020. He missed doing a physical closing ceremony due to COVID-19. Adrian has received the school\u2019s highest award, the Xavier Award, multiple times, and is a Jose Rizal Model Student awardee. Servant Leadership is in Adrian\u2019s DNA. An aspiring medical doctor, he\u2019s an incoming freshman at the University of California at Berkeley this fall.", "Conner G.
