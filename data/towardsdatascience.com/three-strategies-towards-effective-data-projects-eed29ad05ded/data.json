There is no doubt in my mind that data science is an efficient tool with impressive performances. However, a successful data project is also about effectiveness: doing the right things as Russell Ackoff would write in \u201cA systemic view of transformational leadership\u201d.", "Successful problem solving requires finding the right solution to the right problem. We fail more often because we solve the wrong problem than because we get the wrong solution to the right problem \u2014 Russell L. Ackoff (1974)", "How do you focus on your projects and make sure they will bring value to the company? Are you strategically thinking about how to bring your project to fruition?", "NB: I will use golf \u2014 a strategic sport \u2014 as an illustrative analogy here.", "Objectives and Key Results (OKR) have been adopted in successful organisations to drive tremendous growth (Intel, Google, \u2026). They were initially introduced by John Doerr to increase focus that produces value.", "The general idea is to set Objectives that motivate you. Imagine you are passionate about golf and next Friday there is a big competition. In the last few years, nobody won it performing well on more than 15 holes out of the 18 on the course. Setting yourself to win it is a good objective \u2014 it is specific, ambitious, and happens at a given time. You then set Key Results that can measure how you are doing on this objective. In this golf example, they could be:", "Checking all the key results are then a good indicator that you could win.", "In another scenario, working for a large bank, picture you are tasked to build a loan risk model with 80% accuracy. Here are some possible key results:", "OKRs can be used to drive focus on anything. I find them useful to define my goals on a project: building a model or an application, when will it be good enough? Aiming for the key results brings clarity. Failing becomes a learning experience that stimulates better OKRs definitions and work. On the other hand, success is then crystal clear, and you should enjoy it.", "Must read on the topic: Measure what matters by John Doerr.", "A drivetrain approach is a comprehensive strategy to data products definition. The following diagram shows its essential steps:", "In a new project we might ask ourselves:", "Setting objectives includes answering questions such as: Does it add value to the business? Is it aligned with the current roadmap? When should it be done? Is it opening new perspectives?", "What elements in the final product are under my control? Can I change the price of the product? The ranking on the recommendation page? \u2026", "Given objectives and levers, what kind of data could I use? What are the compliance issues?", "Simulations should indicate if there is enough information in your data combined with your levers to get to your objectives. Could you drive more sales with fewer risks in the loan model example?", "Every step is also an exit point. If you can\u2019t find a solution alone or collectively, it might be an indication that it is not worth your time and should focus on something else.", "Must read on the topic: Designing great data products by Jeremy Howard, Margit Zwemer and Mike Loukides.", "Decision intelligence is a more general discipline that tackles how to build a strategy given objectives in complex situations. The general process integrates notions such as external causes, multiple causal links, and feedback loops. Teams creating causal diagrams can then rationally decide upon a strategy with a clear perception of the problem at hand. One might understand decision intelligence as an extended merger between OKRs and the drive train approach.", "In the small example above, once you select a club, whether the ball will fly high (and hopefully far) or stay rolling on the ground means the wind is more or less likely to affect. Staying on the ground might be safer, but making only small shots, you will need more of them. Having a good strategy means you will find a reasonable equilibrium to achieve your objectives and goals.", "In the OKR example about the risk loan model, we would make here deeper inquiries. Would having a loan model that makes mistakes on certain types of customers be a hazard on equity? Is it possible that employees in charge of validating loans would only rely on the model, become less critical thinkers and be less likely to adjust their behaviour when delicate cases occur? Causal diagrams enable you to understand the indirect consequences of your decisions. If you consider that getting the right clean data and building a model ready for production is often a task that takes months, is it not worth spending some time on the reasons you are doing it?", "For engineers and scientists, it is not extremely different from specifying a classical digital product with its constraints and target performances but broadening the perspective. What is interesting to me, is the focus on the decision making (\u201cshould I build this product and how?\u201d) putting both business and technical people together to make sure that at the scale of a whole ecosystem, the next move is the right one.", "Must read on the topic: Link by Lorien Pratt", "Strategy is not limited to a top/down practice falling under the umbrella of leaders, managers, product managers, etc. I think it is part of any job to meet halfway and have some strategical thinking under the hood. Maybe these frameworks are sometimes too elaborated, but at its core, they start with a simple question that we can ask ourselves: why should I do this project?", "As a field, growing beyond the AI hype, we cannot stay in an isolated system, extending our level of specialisation without clearly showing its value. Missing middle professionals are likely to be of importance in this task (Paul R. Daugherty \u2014 CTIO at Accenture and Lorien Pratt).
