It seems to be everywhere.", "But what is it? And how might journalists cover it without resorting to the Hollywood picture of general AI: A machine that can do everything from ironing your shirts to enslaving mankind?", "Fortunately, Momin M. Malik data science postdoctoral fellow at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center has some ideas for what critical questions to ask when you encounter a company or a government agency selling something as \u201cPowered by AI\u201d.", "According to Malik, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, and Neural Networks are just some of the names used to describe the same thing that has been worked on since the 50s.", "But the idea of creating an artificial intelligence that can do everything has generally been abandoned everywhere but in Hollywood. There isn\u2019t some sentient artificial being hiding in the computer.", "When you hear AI, ML etc. today it is much narrower. It is just math. The many names distract from the reality, that it\u2019s all just statistical models models that each have their uses.", "Specifically you should ask if it is a Decision Tree?", "If yes, you might be in luck because those can be interpreted by regular people. Other models like \u201cNeural Networks\u201d or \u201cRandom Forests\u201d are too complex for people to wrap their brains around. Decision Trees on the other hand can be simple enough for the data scientist behind it to walk you through its branches.", "Machine Learning is basically based on two sets of data: Training data and test data. You feed the first set of data into the machine to teach it the correlations within the dataset and put it into a model.", "Let\u2019s say you use half the passenger list of Titanic. That list would include the ages, genders, ticket types, and ticket prices of the passengers, and whether or not they died or survived. That\u2019s your training data.", "The data allows you to build a model that can estimate the likelihood of a new passenger\u2019s survival if you know their age, gender, ticket type and price.", "The other part of the passenger list could be used to calculate the accuracy of the model by seeing how often the model predicts the right outcome (live or die). That would be your test data.", "People selling \u201cAI Powered\u201d software might brag about prediction accuracy of close to 100. But numbers like that can be calculated in numerous ways and you can \u201coverfit\u201d a model to a point where it works great on your test data but not so well in the real world.", "A researcher at MIT\u2019s Media Lab, Joy Buolamwini, made an interesting discovery recently that shows just that.", "As she was using a facial recognition model she found that the software would work on her friends and colleagues\u2019 faces but not hers. Not until she put on a white mask did the AI notice her(!).", "She has since documented how many commercial facial recognition algorithms are so bad at recognizing black females, that they might as well just flip a coin on their gender, even though they might work well when tested on mostly white (male) faces.", "The specific accuracy number might not be super important but asking about the test data it is calculated against might reveal holes in the model or inherent biases that usually hit minority groups hardest.", "Another red flag according to Momin M. Malik is if the model is using retroactive data that is only looking at what happened in the past.", "\u201cThe best test of a model is on data that was collected after the model was built. But this type of testing is often not done,\u201d says Momin M. Malik.", "In many cases that can be okay but for obvious reasons The Titanic Model should not be used to predict the change of survival on modern cruise ships.", "In the end, the AI is trying to predict outcomes based on large sets of data. So what you feed it matters. Some can be just noise and imply meaning that isn\u2019t there.", "The hair color of the Titanic passengers or the number of letters in their names should probably not be in the model for survival rates.", "When you throw everything into the model without any theory or thought behind it it\u2019s called \u201cdata dredging\u201d.", "Another more complicated point: Even though men on the deck of Titanic drowned in much higher rates than women, it wasn\u2019t because of their gender. It was because of the rule that assigned women and children to the lifeboats first. But the model can\u2019t tell you that because it\u2019s not in the data.", "\u201cA lot of problems with machine learning are about causality. We have to remember that prediction is only correlation,\u201d is one of Momin M. Malik\u2019s points.", "He presented them at a AmplifAI ThursdAI event at the Harvard Law School. You can e-mail Berkman Klein Fellow Jenn Halen for more information on events. If you want to know more about which things computers are good at and what they are very, very bad at, Momin M. Malik recommends \u2018Artificial Unintelligence\u2019 by Meredith Broussard. It is on my reading list now.", "Latoya Peterson also wrote \u201cWhy Journalists Need To Understand Artificial Intelligence\u201d:", "\u201c\u2026for us to truly inform the public on the full potential of the AI revolution, we need to be working from a stronger knowledge base.\u201d", "Even though journalists like me should get better at asking critical questions of people selling or using AI some people are calling for actual auditing of algorithms. This Harvard Business School article \u201cWhy we need to audit algorithms\u201d puts it well:", "\u201cCompanies have long been required to issue audited financial statements for the benefit of financial markets and other stakeholders. That\u2019s because \u2014 like algorithms \u2014 companies\u2019 internal operations appear as \u201cblack boxes\u201d to those on the outside (\u2026) Should we not subject societally impactful \u201cblack box\u201d algorithms to comparable scrutiny?\u201d", "The Harvard scientists propose asking following questions:", "The Turing Box Project at MIT\u2019s Medialab is another thing to keep an eye on. In 2019 they plan on release software for auditing algorithms.", "If you\u2019ve made it this far, thank you for reading.
