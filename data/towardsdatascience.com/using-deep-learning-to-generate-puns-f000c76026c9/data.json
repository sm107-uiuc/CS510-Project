And while much research is focused on tasks with huge implications (e.g., question-answering, text summarization), we should always remember that there are some fun applications of natural language processing research as well. For example, generating puns.", "Let\u2019s delve into a recent paper by He et al. that proposes a pretty-strong model for pun generation. P.S. if you just want to see some of the puns that the model ended up generating, I\u2019ve included the puns that the authors give at the end of the post.", "The Dataset. First thing\u2019s first. Like any deep learning problem, generating puns obviously requires a not-small dataset. Now, personally I wouldn\u2019t have even thought that a dataset of puns exists. Regardless, the authors found a good collection of puns: the pun dataset from the 2017 SemEval task, which contains 1,099 different puns. Although this is on the small side of datasets, it\u2019s enough to get an acceptably-performing model trained.", "Yesterday I swallowed some food coloring. The doctor says I\u2019m OK, but I feel like I dyed a little inside. (\u201cdyed\u201d vs \u201cdied\u201d)", "How to generate a pun. So for this task, the authors have decided to focus on homophone puns (example given above). In homophone puns, the goal is to replace a pun word (in this case \u201cdied\u201d) with an alternative word (\u201cdyed\u201d) which has the same pronunciation but a different meaning. To generate these puns, the authors proposed 3 main steps:", "Here\u2019s the example walkthrough of these steps that the authors give:", "So in this example, Step 1 would be to find a sentence with the word \u201chair\u201d in it. The model identifies the sentence \u201cthe man stopped to get a hair cut.\u201d Next, the original pun word (\u201chair\u201d) is replaced with a homophone (\u201chare\u201d), yielding the updated sentence \u201cthe man stopped to get a hare cut.\u201d But this doesn\u2019t make sense yet, so in comes step 3. The topic is inserted by changing \u201cman\u201d to \u201cgreyhound\u201d and giving us the completed pun:", "\u201cThe greyhound stopped to get a hare cut.\u201d\u2019", "And the results? To see how punny their model was, the authors called in Mechanical Turk workers. For 150 different pun pairs (one from a human and one from their model), five workers per pun were asked to rate the puns on three aspects:", "Turns out that their model is pretty okay \u2014 the model outperformed humans on the funniness aspect for 10.7% of puns and the grammar aspect on 8% of puns. Considering that generating puns is a pretty hard task, I\u2019m actually quite impressed that a computer can generate even one pun better than a human, much less ten percent. But anyways, let\u2019s see where the model missed points.", "Dang it, the model messed up the pun! So based on the authors\u2019 pie chart of the errors that the model made, it looks like a good chunk of errors that the model was making came from picking a bad pun word or from not being able to pick a relevant topic word to provide context for the pun. Given that these are pretty difficult issues (ask me to come up with a pun on the spot, and I would probably be strugglin\u2019), it makes sense to me that the model would have trouble with them.", "Conclusion. So the authors did a great job presenting a relatively strong model for generating puns. They focused on generating homophone puns by taking a given sentence and replacing two words, one of which was the pun/homophone, and the other was to provide context for the pun. Their results were pretty good, and definitely really encouraging in demonstrating how powerful NLP methods can be.", "Moving forward, I\u2019m sure that researchers will continue finding new and fun applications for their high-performing algorithms!", "Extra fun stuff (list of puns from the paper). [Model] indicates that the authors explicitly mentioned that the pun was generated by the model. [Human] indicates that the authors explicitly mentioned that the pun was generated by a human. Otherwise, I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s a model-generated pun or human-generated pun.", "Yesterday I accidentally swallowed some food coloring.
