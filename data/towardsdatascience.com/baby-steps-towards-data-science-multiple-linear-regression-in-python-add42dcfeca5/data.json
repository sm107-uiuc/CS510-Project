All the necessary explanation is given in the image.", "As the name suggests MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) is linear combination of multiple features/variables that define the average behavior of the dependent variable.", "Consider x1,x2,..xp as the independent variables and Y is the dependent variable. All the beta values correspond to the coefficients for respective independent variables. Beta0 on the other hand is the intercept values which is similar to Simple Linear Regression.", "It is an error that is there in the nature. Remember in my previous article I specified one can never predict the exact future value ? that is due to the fact that this error is present. Error consists of all the data that is not recorded/ used in our model. Such as emotions, feelings etc that can not be easily quantifiable or simply the lack of data/human errors in recording the data.", "But don\u2019t worry about it. Once we use this regression method we only get the average behavior of the Y variable. This average behavior when compared to the actual data, might be greater than, less than or equal to the original predictions of Y. Since we deal with only the average of Y the error terms cancel out each other and we have an estimated regression function in the end with no error term.", "How to decrease error ? Simple, invest more money and find more data.", "Let us consider a firm\u2019s profit as the dependent variable (Y) and it\u2019s spending in RnD (x1), Advertising (x2) and Marketing (x3) be our independent variables.Let\u2019s say after doing all the math we come up with the below regression equation or function [the other name for the mathematical representation of any regression]. Please bear in mind that the below function is hypothetical.", "How are these estimates calculated ?", "There is a mathematical method called OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) method. Using certain matrix transformations you can find the estimated coefficient values. Explaining OLS is not in the scope of this article. You can easily find tutorials online regarding the same, kindly go through them if you really want to know how it works. However, modern programming languages will help you in computing those estimates for you.", "Let us deep dive into python and build a MLR model and try to predict the points scored by basketball players.", "Before you move forward, please download the csv data file from my GitHub Gist.", "Import Data and Define the X and Y variables", "Let us look at our data and understand the variables:", "All the variable names are self explanatory. In this program our task is to predict the average points scored by a player based on his height, weight, Field Goals percent and Free throw percent. Therefore, you can see that I have isolated last column to be our Y variable and all other variables into X as array of features using iloc function in python and some inded slicing.", "Splitting data into training and testing sets", "ScikitLearn is a well known python library extensively used for machine learning. You can check out all it\u2019s awesome APIs for your reference. We are going to use them very often. Follow the below link", "These results are in line with our last print statement. The first column of values are the average goals predicted by our model and the 2nd column shows the actual goals scored by the players.", "I believe you can print these out and do your interpretation based on the example I gave before.", "Well, as you can see that our model didn\u2019t perform as good as expected. There\u2019s just one value i.e., 7.55 that is quite close to the actual value of 7.9. There is a reason I chose this dataset to explain how multiple linear regression works, that is to say that no model is perfect and no one can build a perfect model. You must know the reasons behind why it isn\u2019t performing up to the mark. Our data might have certain issues such as:", "All the above points coincide at one point: ERROR. We might say that our data has a lot of error. We perhaps need more data regarding the players\u2019 fitness, motivation, mood etc during the matches.", "So does that mean we failed to implement Multiple Linear Regression ? Certainly not, because as a Data Scientist, one must understand that having the ability to write code and implementing models isn\u2019t the primary aim. He/she must gain an in-depth knowledge on data. How do you do that ? Just talk to the ones who provided the data and may be also converse with industry experts in the field where the data originated from (basketball in our case) and try to find out if there are any potential errors in the data.", "Building models isn\u2019t that simple unless you understand the data. One must know what their objective is. There\u2019s no perfect model that can predict with 95% accuracy all the time, with different datasets. If anybody claims that their model is the best, that person is a fool.", "Well, my purpose is solved. I\u2019ve shown how to model a Multiple Linear Regression and also showed you what to carefully consider before jumping into regression modeling. One has to change necessary parameters so that the model optimally works for the specific purpose of the business/individual. Try the same approach and code with different data sets, identify the X and Y variables and check the results, you can get tons of datasets online. Same code worked wonderfully for various other datasets, so it isn\u2019t really useless after all. Happy Machine Learning!", "Your home for data science.
