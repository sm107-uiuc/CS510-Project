The central body of German politics is the Bundestag housing over 700 parliament members from six different parties. The Bundestag passes laws, oversees the federal budget and elects the Federal Chancellor. Moreover, the plenary sittings represent the central panel for exchange of political positions and opinions in the German political system.", "But who are those over 700 people that compose the parliament and represent the German people? While the Federal Ministers and a few selected politicians regularly show up in media and press, the majority of the parliament remains practically anonymous to the average citizen.", "This observation appears even more remarkable when taking a closer look at the German election system. For the election of the German parliament, each voter casts two votes. With the first vote, local representatives are directly elected and sent to parliament, while the second vote is cast for a party list.", "To ensure transparency, parliament discussions are broadcast in television and written transcripts are published after each debate. However, only a minority of the voters has the time and resources to closely follow the parliament debates and is largely depending on media coverage. As a result, hardly any voters know what their local representative, who actually has been sent to the parliament to represent them, works on and even less what he or she talks about.", "This data science project aims to further increase transparency on the German parliament and its members by applying techniques from machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). The final results of the project are visualized as an interactive dashboard on Tableau Public:", "Dashboard on Tableau Public (English)(optimized for desktop & link only works in desktop browser)", "Dashboard on Tableau Public (German) (optimized for desktop & link only works in desktop browser)", "The dashboard is publicly available and provides the following use cases:", "In this project the plenary debates of the Bundestag are analyzed in Python to draw conclusions about individual parliament members. For this, the plenary speeches are examined using an NLP technique called topic modeling to identify underlying topics in speeches. Using the topic insights, the politicians are then grouped into political fields by applying unsupervised clustering. Finally, a heuristic is developed to identify peer groups with similar topic profiles.", "The data source for this project are 109 plenary discussion transcripts of the 19th Bundestag from its inaugural sitting on 24th October 2017 until the last sitting before the summer break in 2019 on 24th July 2019.", "The German parliament has published all transcripts from plenary discussions since the foundation of the German Federal Republic in 1949 as XML files on its website. However, only for the 19th Bundestag the XML transcripts include a detailed tagging that allows to clearly separate speeches and the respective speakers.", "The transcripts are scraped and parsed using the Python libraries Selenium and Beautiful Soup to extract information such as date, speaker name, party and the respective speech. The data is then cleaned and enriched with additional information to arrive at a final data set consisting of over 10,000 speeches with roughly 6.5M words from 717 politicians.", "Please note that the 19th Bundestag has officially 709 members. The discrepancy can be explained through the following deviations:", "1. Federal Ministers from the current cabinet who do not hold an official seat in the parliament are included in the data set.", "2. Depending on withdrawal date of certain parliament members, predecessors only, successors only or both can be reflected in the data.", "3. For a few parliament members no speeches are identified for the relevant time period.", "Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an algorithm from linear algebra, which is applied in NLP to extract underlying topics from a set of documents.", "The baseline for a topic model from NMF builds the document-term matrix A. In A each row describes the frequency of terms in a document, i.e. each row represents one document and each column one term (document x term). In NLP, document is the terminology for text and term for word.", "The NMF algorithm decomposes the document-term matrix A into two matrices with only non-negative values in a way that the product of the two reproduces the original matrix with the lowest error. The two resulting matrices are the document-topic matrix H (document x topic) and the topic-term matrix W (topic x term).", "A (document x term) \u2248 H (document x topic) x W (topic x term)", "Intuitively, the document-topic matrix H describes what the topics in a document are, while the topic-term matrix W describes which words are used frequently for a specific topic.", "To produce meaningful results with NMF topic modeling several pre-processing steps are required and are implemented as below:", "The parliament speeches are then converted into a document-term matrix by applying the TF-IDF Vectorizer from sklearn. In contrast to a simple bag of words method, which just counts the occurrence of words in a document, TF-IDF (term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency) reduces the influence of words that occur frequently across all documents. As a result, words with a high informational gain also have a relatively higher weight in a document.", "In fact, NMF topic modeling is a technique for matrix decomposition and does not provide guidance on how many topics exist in the underlying text or what the contextual meaning of a topic is. Hence, these steps need to be implemented manually.", "To identify topics in the plenary speeches, the NMF module from sklearn is applied to the previously created document-term matrix. This produces both the respective document-topic and topic-term matrices. Then, for each topic in the topic-term matrix the words with the highest weights, i.e. the words that are most important for the topic, are manually examined. Based on this analysis each topic is identified and named.", "For example the topic for which the words with the highest weights are \u201cbank\u201d, \u201cloan\u201d, \u201cdeposit insurance\u201d, \u201cbanking union\u201d, \u201cECB\u201d, \u201ctax payer\u201d, \u201crisk\u201d, \u201cfinancial crisis\u201d, etc. (in German these are all single words) is defined as \u201cfinancial system\u201d.", "As the number of topics within a topic model needs to be set manually as an input for the algorithm, this procedure is repeated for a different number of topics to identify the number that produces the most meaningful result in terms of contextual consistency within the topics. For the Bundestag speeches a model with 35 distinct topics is selected.", "After identifying and naming each topic, the document-topic matrix indicates which topics each speech is about. Each speech is a combination of all 35 topics, of which some have higher weights than others.", "To produce insights not only for the speeches but for the individual parliament members the topic information (weight of each topic in a speech) is summarized for each politician. The speeches for a parliament member are aggregated by scaling the sum of the topic weights in a speech to 100% and taking the mean of topics over all speeches.", "This aggregation unfolds with what share each parliament member is covering the 35 identified topics. While this information alone is already insightful, it is still relatively hard to interpret since 35 different topics are difficult to grasp simultaneously. Moreover, only the combination of several topics allows to draw meaningful conclusions about the political field a politician is focused on.", "Therefore, each parliament member is allocated to one specific political field based on the topics that are covered in his or her speeches. For this k-means clustering (unsupervised learning) is applied using the KMeans module from sklearn.", "Intuitively, k-means splits a data set and assigns data points with similar features into one group (cluster). The similarity of features is assessed based on a distance metric (in this case Euclidean distance). The algorithm defines the clusters in a way that the distances of the data points to the respective cluster centroids (mean of features from all data points in one cluster) are minimized.", "By taking the weights of the topics for each parliament member as features, every representative is reflected as a data point in a 35-dimensional space. The features are then used to cluster the politicians. Finally, the shares of the topics for each cluster centroid are manually examined to assign a political field.", "Similar to the topic model, the number of clusters within k-means needs to be chosen manually and is selected by manually examining results for different numbers of clusters. This results in 15 different political field clusters.", "To visualize the results of the cluster analysis, the 35-dimensional space is in a last step reduced to a two-dimensional space by applying t-SNE dimensionality reduction using the TSNE module from sklearn.", "One of the use cases of the dashboard is to display parliament members across different parties with similar topic profiles, i.e. politicians who cover a similar range of topics. For this, a peer group is constructed for each politician that is comprised of the three parliament members from each party with the closest Euclidean distance based on the 35-dimensional topic vector.", "Finally, the results of the analysis are visualized in a Tableau dashboard that can be interactively used to better understand the Bundestag and its politicians.", "At the same time, the dashboard provides an opportunity to validate the results of the analysis:", "Eventually, it is to be hoped that this project can contribute its share to increase transparency of the German political landscape, allow for better informed voter decisions and strengthen trust in the democratic system.", "A GitHub repository of the project can be found here.", "Disclaimer: This document represents the personal views of the author only and is not representative of the work or views of the author\u2019s employer.", "Your home for data science.
