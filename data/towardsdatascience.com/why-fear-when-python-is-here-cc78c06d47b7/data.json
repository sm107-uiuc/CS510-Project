There\u2019s no denying the fact that python is also the most popular programming language of all. And we saw that in GitHub\u2019s annual report in the State of Octoverse, 2019. Python has finally overtaken its long-standing rival, Java and is now the second most popular language on GitHub only behind the leader, JavaScript. This has taken the popularity of Python to a whole new level.", "But, wait, have ever thought about the reasons behind this chart-topping popularity of Python? Why is Python gaining so much hype? Why is Python the choice of language for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence?", "Still wondering? To sum up all the reasons for it in one line, it is so popular these days because - \u201cPython lets you do wonders\u201d", "The features it offers are unmatchable. It lets you do things that are beyond our imaginations and that too quite easily. Yes, you read that right. The best thing about Python is its simplicity. Python offers maximum benefits with a minimum amount of effort. It is one of the most programmer-friendly languages.", "As things get tight, Python lets you steal the spotlight", "In the era of Instagram and Snapchat, a caption is probably more important than the picture itself. We usually spend more time choosing an appropriate caption than we normally spend on selecting what picture to post. The number of likes and comments heavily depends on what caption you\u2019re putting on with the picture you\u2019re uploading. And of course, captions make you cool. Because if you cannot kill them with your picture, kill them with your caption.", "Imagine if you had an assistant for writing some cool captions for every picture you decide to upload on social media. Sounds cool, isn\u2019t it?", "This is what this Python Project is all about. You give it your picture, it in return will give you some cool captions for it. This project is all you need to slay the game of captions. All your worries about the perfect caption will now be eradicated. If you wanna be a top social media player then this project is meant for you. Because -", "\u201cA picture attracts the eye but caption captures the heart.\u201d", "One of the leading causes of death globally is road accidents. We are so used to it that we tend to completely overlook the reasons behind it. One of the major reasons for road accidents is the drowsiness of the driver. People traveling on long routes generally suffer from lack of sleep and more often than not, don\u2019t take this issue too seriously.", "But now its time to take this issue seriously. We need to deal with it as soon as possible.", "This project of drowsiness detection is meant for the same. In this project, you\u2019ll be able to build a drowsiness detection system. This system is crucial for preventing accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving. This system will alert the driver instantly when it detects that the driver\u2019s eyes are closed for a few seconds.", "One of the most fascinating applications of Artificial Intelligence, in recent times, has been the concept of virtual assistants. From Apple\u2019s Siri to Google\u2019s assistant, we are soon going to be bound to virtual assistants for almost everything. A chatbot is an intelligent system that has the capability of communicating and performing certain actions similar to a human being.", "The most common application of chatbot is in customer interaction. Almost every big organization has its own chatbot for communicating with its customers. These chatbots are trained so well that they are capable of solving almost each and every query of the customers. Thus reducing human efforts to a great extent. The other important applications include social media marketing and instant messaging services.", "This project is all about training a chatbot based on data set to which it provides a random response from the list of responses.", "One of the most fascinating applications of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in the history of mankind is the concept of driverless cars. This world would be a different place once those cars come on the road.", "This project about traffic signs recognition is the backbone of this dream concept. In this project, you\u2019ll train a system to recognize the various different traffic signs and then automatically making decisions based on the identified signs. This system is crucial for all autonomous vehicles and self-driven cars as it decides its next move according to the identified sign.", "This might be the most interesting project you\u2019ll ever lay your hands on.", "In the era where older technologies are gradually becoming obsolete and layoffs are commonplace in the IT industry, Python has evolved as a ray of hope for everyone out there. Keeping in the mind that Python has gained the highest popularity in recent times, getting acquainted with Python now would probably be one of the finest decisions of your career.", "And the best way to do so is by laying your hands on some interesting real-time projects.", "Coz it\u2019s now easier to do things which are unreal", "Your home for data science.
