However, they have not met a large interest in software artificial neural networks that use neurons characterized by a single, static and continuous-valued activation. What makes these biologically realistic neurons interesting for computing?", "Spiking neural networks (SNN) have first emerged in computational neuroscience, as an attempt to model the behavior of biological neurons. This has resulted in the Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, describing neuronal activity as integration of received spike voltages and weak dissipation (leakage) to the environment. When its voltage reaches a threshold, the neuron fires a spike on its own. Following further inspiration from the brain, neuronal inputs and outputs can be encoded in the time or rate of the spikes that it receives and emits. This type of information encoding is very robust to errors because a failure to detect a spike or two doesn\u2019t induce a significant error on the average spike rate.", "Even though they have been there for a while, SNN have not met a large interest in the deep learning community. This was initially due to the lack of efficient training algorithms for their supervised learning. Indeed, in order to apply a commonly used learning algorithm such as gradient descent with backpropagation, one needs to define a continuous valued differentiable variable for the neuron output (which spikes are not). Although this can be done by calculating the spike arrival time or its rate, it adds in computational complexity and thus makes them less appealing for implementation in deep neural networks.", "On the other hand, spiking neurons are widely used in neuromorphic computing where SNN have been implemented using electronic and optic systems. Neuromorphic computing consists in building neural networks in hardware, where physical device neurons are connected by physical device synapses. The main motivation for neuromorphic computing is energy efficiency that is provided by a distributed architecture which avoids energy voracious data shuffling between the memory and the CPU. The use of spiking neurons goes in the same direction and has motivated construction of first neuromorphic computers consisting of millions of spiking neurons by IBM (TrueNorth), Intel (Loihi) and Tsinghua Tianjic.", "Spiking neural networks are interesting for a few reasons. First, information can be transmitted using very weak signals as rate encoding is very robust to noise. Second, they bring new learning algorithms for unsupervised learning. Indeed, spiking neurons allow the implementation of bio-inspired local learning rules such as Hebbian learning and Spike-Time-Dependant-Plasticity (STDP). These learning rules resume to enhancing a weight of a synapse if the activities of the two neurons that it connects seem to be correlated and decreasing it otherwise. It thus allows the network to learn in real time and by itself. First demonstrations of unsupervised learning using electronic neuromorphic hardware go back to 2012, obtaining state of the art recognition rates of MNIST database[1]. Recently unsupervised learning has been realized using fully optical neuromorphic platforms, demonstrating recognition of simple patters and thus confirming the interest of spiking neurons [2].", "Finally, thanks to the spatio-temporal information encoding that they use, spiking neural networks open possibilities to exploit the network dynamics for learning. For example synchronization of spike trains allows to decode the network outputs from synchronization patterns. Such dynamical phenomena are present in brain and allow it to compute with a smaller number of neurons. First demonstrations of efficient learning using synchronization have been demonstrated in neuromorphic computing with spintronic neurons [3], thus proving the interest of dynamical neuron models for artificial neural networks.", "Neuromorphic platforms now face the challenge of scaling up. They will have to deal with the device variability, while keeping the devices compact and low energy consuming.", "[1] D.
