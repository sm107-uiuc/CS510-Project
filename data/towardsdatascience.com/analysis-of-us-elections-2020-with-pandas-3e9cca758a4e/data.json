It will serve as a practical pandas guide and also provide more insight into the elections.", "I\u2019m far away from politics so the insights will be solely based on the numbers.", "Let\u2019s start by importing the libraries and reading the dataset into a pandas dataframe.", "For each state and county, the dataset contains the number of votes for all candidates. The last column indicates who won the election in a particular county.", "I wonder how many counties exist in the US. There are many different ways to check it. Here are two common ways:", "Let\u2019s check how many counties won by each candidate. I will show you two different ways to accomplish this task.", "The first way is to use the groupby function and count the number of \u201cTrue\u201d values for each candidate.", "We first select the \u201ccandidate\u201d and \u201cwon\u201d columns along with a random column (e.g. \u201cstate\u201d) and group them by the \u201ccandidate\u201d and \u201cwon\u201d columns. Then, we count the rows that belong to each group.", "The next line filters the rows where the value of won column is True. As you can see in the resulting dataframe, only Donald Trump and Joe Biden won counties.", "We take the \u201ccandidate\u201d and \u201cwon\u201d columns and group by the \u201ccandidate\u201d column. When we apply the sum function, the result is the number of won counties for each candidate (True is 1, False is 0).", "You may have noticed the number of counties we calculated at the beginning (3007) is much less than the total number of counties won by Donald Trump or Joe Biden. They must be equal.", "What comes to mind is that there are counties with the same name in different states. To find out, we can count the number of unique county names in each state and sum them up. The result must be 4633 (3125 + 1508).", "The result is 4633 as we expected.", "We can easily find the number of total votes for candidate by using the groupby and sum functions.", "Let\u2019s find out the difference in the number of votes between Joe Biden and Donald Trump for each state.", "We first need to calculate the total number of votes in each state for both candidates.", "The states dataframe contains the total number of votes in each state for Donald Trump and Joe Biden.", "We apply the groupby function to the states dataframe and use a lambda expression to calculate the difference.", "After calculating the difference, we use the sort values function and indexing to get the top 10 states based on the difference in total votes.", "The biggest difference was observed in California.", "We can filter the elections dataframe using the candidate name and then sort values based on the total votes.", "Here are the top 5 counties that Joe Biden got the most votes.", "Donald Trump lost all 5 counties where he got his most votes. On the other hand, Joe Biden all 5 of them. This is an indication that Joe Biden won relatively in more populated counties.", "In the previous example, we made an educated guess that indicates Joe Biden won in relatively more populated counties.", "Let\u2019s do an example on the smaller counties. We will filter the dataframe based on the total votes of candidates in a county.", "There are many options to filter a dataframe. One of the simpler ones is the query function that allows passing the condition as a string.", "Let\u2019s first find the counties where the total number of votes is less than 100000.", "We can now use the small_counties series to filter the elections dataframe. The isin method can be used to filter the dataframe based on the values in a series or list.", "Donald Trump has won much more counties than Joe Biden where the total number of votes in the county is less than 100000.", "We have covered some useful functions and methods of Pandas. There is, of course, much more you can do with Pandas. It provides numerous functions to enhance and expedite the data analysis and manipulation process.", "One of things I really like about Pandas is that there are almost always more than one way to accomplish a given task. It proves the flexibility of Pandas.", "The best way to comprehend all these functions and methods is through practice. Thus, I suggest to practice as much as you can.", "Thank you for reading.
