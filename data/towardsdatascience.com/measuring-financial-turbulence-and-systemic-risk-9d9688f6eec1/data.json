Mark Kritzman, Yuanzhen Li, Sebastien Page, and Roberto Rigobon support this claim in \u201cPrincipal Components as a Measure of Systemic Risk\u201d (2010).", "Using this analogy, Systemic Risk deals with whether your house is made of straw, sticks, or bricks. Turbulence deals with how hard the big bad wolf is blowing at your house. Therefore Systemic Risk does not necessarily indicate that a financial crisis is imminent, only that global markets are more susceptible to bouts of turbulence.", "The rest of this article will proceed as follows.", "Kritzman and Li (2010) present \u201ca mathematical measure of financial turbulence\u201d based on the Mahalanobis Distance.", "Qualitatively: financial turbulence is a condition where", "If both conditions are satisfied, turbulence will be higher than if only one of the conditions are satisfied.", "Use cases for Financial Turbulence include stress-testing investment portfolios, building turbulence-resistant investment portfolios, and scaling exposure to risk.

In Equation (2) above, the left-hand-side of the equation is called \u201cRaw Turbulence\u201d in my Turbulence Chart. In order to create a smoother, more interpretable turbulence metric, I calculated the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of the \u201cRaw Turbulence\u201d series, and call it \u201cTurbulence\u201d. This means that every data point in the \u201cTurbulence\u201d series is equal to the EWMA across *all* the previous \u201cRaw Turbulence\u201d values, where more recent \u201cRaw Turbulence\u201d values are given a higher weight. The decay factor \u201calpha\u201d is set such that the half-life of each value\u2019s weight is 12 weeks (12 weeks is approximately the length of 1 fiscal quarter).", "Kritzman, Li, Page, and Rigobon (2010) introduce \u201ca measure of implied systemic risk called the absorption ratio\u201d.", "Qualitatively: high systemic risk exists if global asset price movements can be *mostly* explained by a small number of independent factors.", "Quantitatively: the absorption ratio (AR) equals the fraction of the total variance of a set of asset returns explained or \u201cabsorbed\u201d by a fixed number of eigenvectors (of the asset return covariance matrix).", "The main use case for the AR is to indicate market fragility in various ways. More details in Kritzman, et al. (2010).", "This article focuses on using the AR to provide context for interpreting the Turbulence Index.", "My personal modifications to the calculation. First, I calculate the asset return covariance matrix over a 250-week window (250 weeks is approximately 5 years). This window shifts forward for each new data point. Second, instead of using the AR formula above, the \u201cSystemic Risk\u201d series in my Systemic Risk Chart is the Gini coefficient of all the eigenvalues for the asset return covariance matrix. This way, we don\u2019t have to arbitrarily choose the number of eigenvectors in the numerator of the AR formula above.", "Both indicators can theoretically be calculated across any pool of financial assets.

The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis happened last year. Turbulence has spiked to 5.53 (up from 4.85 just a month ago), so now may be a good time to take some money off the table.

Now that Turbulence as dropped below 4.50 again, now is a good time to re-enter the market. Rising Systemic Risk is not a concern since turbulence has been steadily trending downward. Increase stock market exposure to 100%.", "Decision #3: 8/24/2007. Turbulence spikes to 4.07 (up from 3.05 just 5 weeks ago). This, *coupled with several years of accumulating Systemic Risk*, highlights a need for caution. Decrease stock market exposure to 50%.", "Decision #4: 3/28/2008. Turbulence rockets to 5.72, (up from 5.05 just 2 weeks ago). Systemic Risk has also lurched upward recently. Things may turn ugly soon, so decrease stock market exposure to 0%.", "Decision #5: 10/23/2009. With the worst of the Subprime Mortgage Crisis behind us, Turbulence falls below 5.00 and appears to be trending downwards. Increase stock market exposure to 50%.", "Decision #7: 8/19/2011. We are in the throes of the European Debt Crisis. Turbulence jumps to 4.10 (up from 3.33 just 4 weeks before), and Systemic Risk remains elevated.
