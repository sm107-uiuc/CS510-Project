I will prepare various formats of my resumes, and upload them to the job portal in order to test how actually the algorithm behind works. I would always want to build one by myself. Thus, during recent weeks of my free time, I decided to build a resume parser.", "At first, I thought it is fairly simple. Just use some patterns to mine the information but it turns out that I am wrong! Building a resume parser is tough, there are so many kinds of the layout of resumes that you could imagine.", "For instance, some people would put the date in front of the title of the resume, some people do not put the duration of the work experience or some people do not list down the company in the resumes. This makes the resume parser even harder to build, as there are no fix patterns to be captured.", "After one month of work, base on my experience, I would like to share which methods work well and what are the things you should take note before starting to build your own resume parser.", "Before going into the details, here is a short clip of video which shows my end result of the resume parser.", "I scraped multiple websites to retrieve 800 resumes. The resumes are either in PDF or doc format.", "The tool I use is Puppeteer (Javascript) from Google to gather resumes from several websites.", "One of the problems of data collection is to find a good source to obtain resumes. After you are able to discover it, the scraping part will be fine as long as you do not hit the server too frequently.", "After that, I chose some resumes and manually label the data to each field. The labeling job is done so that I could compare the performance of different parsing methods.", "For the rest of the part, the programming I use is Python. There are several packages available to parse PDF formats into text, such as PDF Miner, Apache Tika, pdftotree and etc. Let me give some comparisons between different methods of extracting text.", "One of the cons of using PDF Miner is when you are dealing with resumes which is similar to the format of the Linkedin resume as shown below.", "The way PDF Miner reads in PDF is line by line. Thus, the text from the left and right sections will be combined together if they are found to be on the same line. Therefore, as you could imagine, it will be harder for you to extract information in the subsequent steps.", "On the other hand, pdftree will omit all the \u2018\\n\u2019 characters, so the text extracted will be something like a chunk of text. Thus, it is difficult to separate them into multiple sections.", "Therefore, the tool I use is Apache Tika, which seems to be a better option to parse PDF files, while for docx files, I use docx package to parse.", "Here is the tricky part. There are several ways to tackle it, but I will share with you the best ways I discovered and the baseline method.", "Let\u2019s talk about the baseline method first. The baseline method I use is to first scrape the keywords for each section (The sections here I am referring to experience, education, personal details, and others), then use regex to match them.", "For example, I want to extract the name of the university. Therefore, I first find a website that contains most of the universities and scrapes them down. Then, I use regex to check whether this university name can be found in a particular resume. If found, this piece of information will be extracted out from the resume.", "In this way, I am able to build a baseline method that I will use to compare the performance of my other parsing method.", "On the other hand, here is the best method I discovered.", "Firstly, I will separate the plain text into several main sections. For instance, experience, education, personal details, and others. What I do is to have a set of keywords for each main section\u2019s title, for example, Working Experience, Eduction, Summary, Other Skillsand etc.", "Of course, you could try to build a machine learning model that could do the separation, but I chose just to use the easiest way.", "After that, there will be an individual script to handle each main section separately. Each script will define its own rules that leverage on the scraped data to extract information for each field. The rules in each script are actually quite dirty and complicated. As I would like to keep this article as simple as possible, I would not disclose it at this time. If you are interested to know the details, comment below!", "One of the machine learning methods I use is to differentiate between the company name and job title. The reason that I use the machine learning model here is that I found out there are some obvious patterns to differentiate a company name from a job title, for example, when you see the keywords \u201cPrivate Limited\u201d or \u201cPte Ltd\u201d, you are sure that it is a company name.", "Where do I get the data to train?", "I scraped the data from greenbook to get the names of the company and downloaded the job titles from this Github repo.", "After getting the data, I just trained a very simple Naive Bayesian model which could increase the accuracy of the job title classification by at least 10%.", "In short, my strategy to parse resume parser is by divide and conquer.", "The evaluation method I use is the fuzzy-wuzzy token set ratio. Let\u2019s say", "And the token_set_ratio would be calculated as follow:", "The reason that I am using token_set_ratio is that if the parsed result has more common tokens to the labelled result, it means that the performance of the parser is better.", "If you have other ideas to share on metrics to evaluate performances, feel free to comment below too!", "Thank you so much to read till the end. This project actually consumes a lot of my time. However, if you want to tackle some challenging problems, you can give this project a try! :)", "Low Wei Hong is a Data Scientist at Shopee. His experiences involved more on crawling websites, creating data pipeline and also implementing machine learning models on solving business problems.", "He provides crawling services that can provide you with the accurate and cleaned data which you need.
