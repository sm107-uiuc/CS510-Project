Equality. Data.", "paragraph_index": 30}], "all_paragraphs": ["During its 2020 Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple spent time on one of today\u2019s hottest topics \u2014 privacy. During the past couple of years, Apple has been rolling out various public campaigns aiming to position itself as a company that respects its customer\u2019s privacy. This year\u2019s WWDC had some remarkable issues related to privacy-related features in Apple\u2019s products.", "\u201cWhen Apple was founded, the proposition was, \u2018This is the personal computer. This is your own data.\u2019 \u2026 As the world has evolved, [we] have continued to think \u2026 that the data that you create, the things you do with your computer\u2013those are yours and should be under your control. You should be aware of what\u2019s happening with your data.\u201d \u2014 Craig Federighi, Apple", "First of all, Apple reiterated its position that privacy is a fundamental human right and that it is trying to incorporate user privacy considerations into the product design process from the beginning. Furthermore, privacy for Apple has the following four elements:", "In addition to that, Apple announced some new privacy features that are related specifically to apps that will be introduced in the coming months.", "Such privacy-related updates are definitely valuable improvements to users of Apple devices. Kudos to Apple teams on striving to give individuals more control over their data. It goes without saying that this will contribute to better data literacy and a deeper understanding of how third parties are using personal data. At the same time, such an announcement by Apple should be seen in a broader context where companies directly interacting with their customers online are pressured by increasingly stringent data privacy regulations (GDPR and CCPA).", "Apple\u2019s suggestion to use icons to inform about privacy issues is neither innovative nor new. Some of the first known initiatives to disclose internet privacy settings to individuals were taken by Mozilla. In 2011, Mozilla proposed the \u201cbeta\u201d version of icons that could inform individuals on how online service providers use their data.", "The beta version of Mozilla\u2019s Privacy icons addressed these four main areas of data privacy:", "The second iteration of Mozilla\u2019s privacy icons was also published in 2011. This second version was prepared with the need in the mind of simplifying communication of privacy policies to the users of various apps. This second iteration of icons somewhat resembles Mendeleev\u2019s Periodic Table because they contain mostly letters:", "A closer look into this alternative iteration of Mozilla\u2019s privacy icons reveals a couple of things. First, there are possibly more categories of information that could be displayed about the use of personal data. For instance, this second iteration distinguishes personal and non-personal information as well as many more purposes of use (e.g., use for advertising, geolocation, sharing with third parties and the duration of data retention). Second, this option chooses the use of letters and symbols to communicate privacy policies.", "Both of the approaches laid the foundation for discussions on privacy icons. Fast forward ten years. Some progress has been made, but still, there is no consensus as to how to communicate privacy policies to individual consumers.", "The California Consumer Privacy Act and the GDPR imposed a number of requirements as to how companies have to communicate with consumers. They require that notices have to be sent every time a company\u2019s data collection and processing practices change. These privacy-related notices and the requirement to get consumers\u2019 consent lead to click-fatigue and result in users completely ignoring notices and warnings.", "Historically, the idea of privacy icons can be traced back many decades when governments in various countries started to impose requirements for food product manufacturers to disclose to consumers the ingredients in the food products they bought. In its presentation at the WWDC, Apple\u2019s Chief Software guru Craig Federighi drew parallels between food labels and privacy icons usage to explain what user data apps are going to use.", "The efficiency and effectiveness of food labels have been widely discussed among social science scholars: Do consumers benefit from such labels? Do food labels justify their costs? Can the information provided in food labels actually affect the behavior of consumers?", "In the following paragraphs, let\u2019s try to compare food labels and privacy icons and see what parallels can be drawn between them.", "First, the most striking difference between food labels and privacy icons relates to their origins. Food labels are usually imposed by governments that are trying to alleviate information asymmetry and help individuals make better choices about the food they consume. However, government officials entrusted with the task of creating labels face a number of problems. Namely, it may be extremely difficult to anticipate how people will respond to food labels. Further, even if the impact on human behavior could be determined, it may still be hard to show the actual benefits (in monetary terms) of regulations requiring the use of food labels.", "This problem does not seem to exist in the realm of privacy icons because, at least until now, there is no clear regulatory duty to use \u201cprivacy labels\u201d. Instead, we can see that such initiatives to create privacy icons are \u201cbottom-up\u201d: companies that are providing services to their customers (such as Apple) are taking the lead and pushing to introduce privacy icons that are supposed to help individual consumers better understand their personal data.", "The fact that privacy icons are being developed by market players is quite remarkable.", "Second, the introduction of new regulatory requirements, at least in the US, has to be justified economically. In practice, this means that the enacting government agency has to show that the societal benefits created by a new measure will be greater than costs to implement that measure.", "In the case of privacy icons, there is no need for the government to conduct any economic impact assessment studies; this is done by the companies who are betting on privacy icons. In the case of Apple, the mere fact that privacy icons are being introduced shows that Apple sees value in providing transparency to its users about their personal data.", "It is very natural to assume that people are willing to receive information and that it will bring benefits to consumers. However, recent scholarly studies in the area of food labels show that there are four possible ways people react to information provided to them:", "Such a phenomenon of \u201cinformation avoidance\u201d raises the question of whether it makes sense to have privacy icons at all.", "Furthermore, it is widely understood that consumers suffer not only from the lack of information but also from various behavioral biases. For example, consumers may suffer from present bias (i.e., people tend to overvalue immediate rewards, while putting less worth in long-term consequences) or may be unrealistically optimistic (i.e., a belief that the individual herself is less likely to experience a negative event).", "When we look at privacy icons, there are two more behavioral biases that may become obvious: there is a clear gap between (a) the utility at the time when people are about to agree to a certain privacy-related choice (so-called \u201cdecision utility\u201d) and (b) the utility actually experienced (so-called \u201cexperienced utility\u201d). The problem with privacy icons is that it may not always be possible to provide a concrete and clear sense of experience in the future.", "Swiftly developing new technologies such as machine learning, edge computing, and differential privacy together with new data privacy regulations (mainly, GDPR and CCPA) are paving the way towards a user-centric data ecosystem.", "User-centric data ecosystem is built on the premise that individuals are able to centralize their personal data from various different sources and hold that data in their personal data clouds. Those data clouds are under full user control who can access that data and under what terms.", "Privacy icons are going to play an increasingly important role in a user-centric data environment. However, it is not going to be a task that one single company can achieve. While Apple could be seen as the trend-setter, increasing data literacy among people coming from different cultures and different continents is the task that can be accomplished jointly by multiple stakeholders acting together.", "There are four main considerations that play equally important role in creating a user-friendly data privacy icons and notifications:", "At Prifina, we see leveraging tools like icons to simplify the interface by which we become data literate and understand our choices. We believe this can lead to empowered consumers, where together with developers we can build applications and experiences that lift the individuals up with their data.", "Besides, data privacy icons could become a powerful tool especially if the communities of UX/UI designers, software engineers, lawyers, and consumer rights advocates work together to simplify the user experience and user interface.", "Prifina helps individuals get bespoke value from their personal data and provides tools for developers to build applications on top of user-held data.", "You can follow Prifina on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and join our Slack: \u201cLiberty.
