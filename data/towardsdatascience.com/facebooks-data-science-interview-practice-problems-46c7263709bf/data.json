Enjoy!", "If this is the kind of stuff that you like, be one of the FIRST to subscribe to my new YouTube channel here! While there aren\u2019t any videos yet, I\u2019ll be sharing lots of amazing content like this but in video form. Thanks for your support :)", "This can be answered using the Bayes Theorem. The extended equation for the Bayes Theorem is the following:", "Assume that the probability of picking the unfair coin is denoted as P(A) and the probability of flipping 10 heads in a row is denoted as P(B). Then P(B|A) is equal to 1, P(B\u2223\u00acA) is equal to 0.\u2075\u00b9\u2070, and P(\u00acA) is equal to 0.99.", "More specifically, the question is asking for the most optimal method of finding the threshold floor given two eggs.", "To get a better understanding of the question, let\u2019s assume that you only have one egg. To find the threshold floor, you would simply start at floor one, drop the egg, and go one floor higher at a time until the egg cracks.", "Now imagine that we have unlimited eggs. The most optimal method in finding the threshold floor is through a binary search. First, you would start on the 50th floor. If the egg cracks then you would drop an egg on the 25th floor and if it doesn\u2019t crack then you would drop an egg on the 75th floor, and you would repeat this process until you find the threshold floor.", "With two eggs, the most optimal method in finding the threshold floor is a hybrid of the two solutions above\u2026", "For example, you could drop the first egg every 5 floors until it breaks and then use the second egg to find out which floor in between the increments of 5 the threshold floor is. In the worst-case scenario, this would take 24 drops.", "If you dropped the first egg every 10 floors until it breaks, it would take 19 drops in the worst-case scenario, which is much better than dropping the first egg every 5 floors. But what if you wanted to do better?", "This is where the concept, minimization of maximum regret comes into play. Basically, what this implies is that as you complete more drops at a given increment (how many floors you skip), you want to decrease the increment slowly each time, since there are less possible floors that the threshold floor can be. This means that if your first drop is on floor n then your second drop should be floor n + (n-1) assuming that it doesn\u2019t break. This can be written as the following equation:", "To take it a step further, this can be simplified to:", "Solving for n, you get approximately 14. Therefore, your strategy would be to start at floor 14, then 14+13, then 14+13+12, and so on until it breaks and then use the second egg to find the threshold floor one floor at a time!", "The expected number of odds for both options is 4 out of 100.", "Feel free to let me know if I\u2019m missing something here because this question seems too straight forward!", "You can use hypothesis testing to prove that males are taller on average than females.", "The null hypothesis would state that males and females are the same height on average, while the alternative hypothesis would state that the average height of males is greater than the average height of females.", "Then you would collect a random sample of heights of males and females and use a t-test to determine if you reject the null or not.", "There are a number of possible variables that can cause such a discrepancy that I would check to see:", "Generally, you would want to probe the interviewer for more information but let\u2019s assume that this is the only information that he/she is willing to give.", "Focusing on likes per user, there are two reasons why this would have gone up. The first reason is that the engagement of users has generally increased on average over time \u2014 this makes sense because as time passes, active users are more likely to be loyal users as using the platform becomes a habitual practice. The other reason why likes per user would increase is that the denominator, the total number of users, is decreasing. Assuming that users that stop using the platform are inactive users, aka users with little engagement and fewer likes than average, this would increase the average number of likes per user.", "The explanation above can also be applied to minutes spent on the platform. Active users are becoming more engaged over time, while users with little usage are becoming inactive. Overall the increase in engagement outweighs the users with little engagement.", "To take it a step further, it\u2019s possible that the \u2018users with little engagement\u2019 are bots that Facebook has been able to detect. But over time, Facebook has been able to develop algorithms to spot and remove bots. If were a significant number of bots before, this can potentially be the root cause of this phenomenon.", "The total number of likes in a given year is a function of the total number of users and the average number of likes per user (which I\u2019ll refer to as engagement).", "Some potential reasons for an increase in the total number of users are the following: users acquired due to international expansion and younger age groups signing up for Facebook as they get older.", "Some potential reasons for an increase in engagement are an increase in usage of the app from users that are becoming more and more loyal, new features and functionality, and an improved user experience.", "The metrics that determine a product\u2019s success are dependent on the business model and what the business is trying to achieve through the product. The book Lean analytics lays out a great framework that one can use to determine what metrics to use in a given scenario:", "You can perform an A/B test by splitting the users into two groups: a control group with the normal number of ads and a test group with double the number of ads. Then you would choose the metric to define what a \u201cgood idea\u201d is. For example, we can say that the null hypothesis is that doubling the number of ads will reduce the time spent on Facebook and the alternative hypothesis is that doubling the number of ads won\u2019t have any impact on the time spent on Facebook. However, you can choose a different metric like the number of active users or the churn rate. Then you would conduct the test and determine the statistical significance of the test to reject or not reject the null.", "The odds of rolling a 7 is 1/6. This means that you are expected to pay $30 (5*6) to win $21. Take these two numbers and the expected payout is -$9 (21\u201330).Since the expected payout is negative, you would not want to pay this game.", "If you like my work and want to support me\u2026", "Your home for data science.
