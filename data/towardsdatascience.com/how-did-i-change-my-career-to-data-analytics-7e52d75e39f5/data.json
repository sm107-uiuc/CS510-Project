I would like to share my journey and experience here for those that would like to take the path less chosen.", "As a procurement professional in a FMCG company for the past five years, I decided to change my career in late 2019. My goal was to land in a job within the IT industry, related to data science. I did not expect such changes to happen over night and six to nine months is a good estimate. I was also prepared to handle the financial stress, which meant six to nine months of zero income.", "It seemed an ambitious goal at that time, as well as intimidating. But as all other ambitious goals, it can be broken down into baby steps. Making a plan helps you to always keep a clear goal and next steps on track.", "The first and most important step is to understand the target career and industry. This is to help me identify gaps in experience and skills between my current and the ideal status.", "In the job market, employers usually look for both experience and skills. While experience is gained with time, skills can be learned and mastered in a relatively short amount of time. For data science roles, generic skills required are knowledge of machine learning models, math and statistics as well we programming. I have prior mathematics and statistics knowledge and need to acquire programming skills like Python or SQL.", "Hence I started to search for education or training information that is suitable for me to acquire these skills. Self-study (such as online with MOOC) is an option but I did not go with that. In my opinion, it is low cost but inefficient because self-study requires very high extent of self-discipline in order to be productive. However, vocational training requires full-time attendance and financial stress as mentioned. Part-time training program would be the best of both worlds yet I did not manage to find a suitable one.", "Once I have confirmed my place in the training that I wanted, I quitted my last job as it required full-time attendance.", "I have chosen to follow the Metis program in Singapore. The course is balanced with in-classroom training and project experience. For three months, I was adequately challenged everyday and learning new skills. Towards the end of the training, I started to apply for companies, looking at job offers voraciously, so that I can secure a position as soon as the training ends.", "Unfortunately, the world was hit by COVID-19 just as my training was ending. Jobs in the market were retracted quickly soon after they were advertised. I\u2019ve got calls and interviews, but many positions are eventually cancelled due to the pandemic situation. In view of the crisis, I had to constantly extend the expected timeline of getting employed as well as adjust my expectation of the job scope and salary etc.", "In the past three months, out of over 70 resumes I\u2019ve sent, 12 made it to a first round talk and or technical test. 6 out of them proceeded to a further or final stage. Finally 1 ended with an offer despite the pandemic situation.", "Lastly, I would like to share some suggestions for people looking for career changes.", "Planning starts with clear and specific targets. Get to know your target industry and target position as early as when you started to plan. Be specific about the role(s) and the industry and start to read about them. You can plan for several scenarios.", "Then information gathering would be helpful. The more information you get, the better you can make an informed decision. For example, LinkedIn is a good starting point but it may not present all opportunities on the market. You might want to cross check several job advertisement board so that you do not miss your ideal job. Network and connection is another good source of information which you would need for company culture check and referrals.", "However, life is full of surprises and sometimes black swan events. Always be prepared so that you can embrace life\u2019s uncertainty with courage. Courage is for you to embrace difficulty and constantly adjusting your goals and plans practically.", "I cannot emphasize enough the importance of preparation. It is the main thing that I did in the past six months. It means to learn new skills within a short time. It also means to practice the newfound skills over and over again.", "For new skills, you can stop practicing when you feel that there is nothing more to practice or to learn anymore in a specific field. However, this is usually a state difficult to reach because the more you learn the more you know what you do not know. I\u2019ve only reach this state for SQL practice. I decided to stop practicing when I have gone through the pool of question at least three times and I became comfortable at solving any SQL questions.", "Apart from acquiring new skills, I find it useful to handle the job-hunting journey as developing a strategy for oneself. Imagine that you are a product; how would you sell yourself to potential employers. This strategy would become clear once you have reviewed your own strengths and weaknesses honestly and truthfully.", "Lastly and most importantly, never give up and keep trying. The way forward is not always clear nor bright. It\u2019s ok to feel frustrated at times and it\u2019s ok to lose motivation temporarily. Talk to your friends and family frequently as you would need their support more than ever. It\u2019s ok to take some time off but remember to put it back together the next day and keep going forward.", "Hope this article can help or inspire you a little during this time of hardship. Take care and stay safe!", "Your home for data science.
