After collecting 11,000 tweets containing this hashtag at the time of the event via the Twitter API, I first preprocessed and cleaned the textual data in a Python notebook.", "I then used Google\u2019s langdetect library to filter out non-English tweets and dropped all the retweets from the NLP analysis so that there was no doubling-up. After these steps, I was left with 4,600 unique tweets. Next, I used the Google Cloud Natural Language API to get the sentiment for each tweet.", "Finally, I used the gensim library\u2019s Word2Vec model to get word-embeddings vectors for each word in the entire corpus of tweets in relation to the word \u201cLumiereLDN\u201d. Word2Vec is used to compute the similarity between words from a large corpus of text \u2014 Kavita Ganesan\u2019s article is a great explanation.", "Once I had vectors for each word, I then used the scikitlearn library to perform principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and to plot the most similar words (nearest neighbours) to \u201cLumiereLDN\u201d.", "You can check my Kaggle kernel here for all the analysis for this post.", "In this section, I present the findings of my natural language processing (NLP) analysis. Below, I report on the following three metrics:", "The sentiment for each tweet was calculated using Google\u2019s Cloud NLP API. The bar graph below shows the average sentiment of tweets per day, with -1 being very negative sentiment and +1 being very positive sentiment.", "We see that Lumiere London 2018 started with relatively high sentiment and then dipped on Wednesday 17th January until reaching good sentiment again; I\u2019ll have to inspect the tweets further to understand the dip. Overall, Lumiere had an average sentiment across all days at 0.47.", "The table below shows the top five (green) and bottom five (red) tweets by sentiment. You can clearly see by the tweets on the left that positive language was detected by the Cloud NLP API, similarly, negative tweets on the right.", "Some people expressed that the lights were \u201cnot very classy\u201d while others found them \u201ca powerful celebration of light and sound\u201d and described them as \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cimpressive\u201d. The Cloud NLP API does a good job!", "The bar graphs below show the number of times a word and also a hashtag appears throughout all the tweets, left and right, respectively. Predictably, \u201clumiereldn\u201d appears the most.", "However, these results are not very useful at telling us what people actually thought about the event because the frequency of hashtags is clearly a confounding variable for the frequency of words. In future analysis, I will try to remove the hashtag word from the text frequency analysis.", "Word2Vec is a neural language machine learning model. It takes a large corpus of text, in this case, the text from the 11,000 tweets, as input and produces a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word corresponding to a vector in space \u2014 a word embedding.", "Importantly, it is used to compute and capture the similarity and relationships between words from the 11,000 tweets. Specifically, objects that are closer together in a space mean that they are similar \u2014 known as nearest neighbours. My goal is to find all the words closely associated with \u201cLumiereLDN\u201d.", "Principal Component Analysis is used to reduce the dimensions of the Word2Vec space down to x and y coordinates, the output of which is shown in the scatter plot below. There seems to be some clustering, however, it is quite messy and hard to find the words closely associated with \u201cLumiereLDN\u201d.", "We need to zoom in further.", "Nearest neighbours are the handful of words from the Word2Vec model that are most similar to \u201cLumiereLDN \u201d based on a cosine metric similarity score. The scatter plot below shows the nearest neighbours for \u201cLumiereLDN\u201d.", "Zooming in we find the areas of London \u2014 \u201cvictoria\u201d, \u201cmayfair\u201d, \u201cfitzrovia\u201d, king cross\u201d \u2014 where the artworks were installed, appear close by.", "But importantly, the words \u201camazing\u201d, \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cfun\u201d are also close by. A very positive outcome! It statistically demonstrates that these words most represent how people felt when they tweeted about Lumiere London 2018.", "So there you have it! I\u2019ve presented the findings of my NLP on 11,000 tweets about the Lumiere London 2018 light festival. Although there were some negative tweets and sentiment about Lumiere London, the output from the Word2Vec model shows that people thought positively of the event.", "If you have any thoughts or suggestions, please do leave comments below or on my Kaggle kernel \u2014 an upvote on Kaggle would be really appreciated :)", "There are so many NLP libraries, it is likely that I will revisit this analysis in the future using GloVe, Tensorflow or Bert.", "In my next article (part 3), I\u2019m going to present the findings of my computer vision analysis. Expect to see which artworks appeared the most. Stay tuned.", "Vishal is a Cultural Data Scientist and Research Student at The Bartlett at UCL in London. He is interested in the economic and social impact of culture in cities.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Cultural Data Scientist in London.
