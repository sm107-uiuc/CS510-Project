(Hint: check out here if you don\u2019t)", "This is a number summarizing the life expectancy data all over the world, to be precise 186 countries. This number will tell us more if we put it into the full context.", "The context is comprised of statistical terms, so let\u2019s first understand them:", "Population: The set that contains all data of elements, individuals or measurements from your experimenting space. Our experimenting space is world and population is the life expectancy data from all countries \u2014 population size is denoted by N.", "Sample: It is a randomly selected subset from the population \u2014 sample size is denoted by n.", "Distribution: It describes the data/population/sample range and how data is spread in that range. Distribution of life expectancy in the world as of 2018, is as follows:", "Mean: Average value of all data from your population or sample. For this example, population mean is 73 \u2014 denoted by \u00b5 (Mu) for populations and x\u0304 (x bar) for samples.", "Standard Deviation: Not all countries\u2019 average life expectancy is 73.

Is it normally distributed or is it some other distribution?", "Well, it is not a perfectly normal distribution, since it seems to be pulled to the left side, known as left-skewed distribution.", "Now let\u2019s take some samples from the population. In other words, let\u2019s take 1000 subsets of size 150 from the population and plot the distribution of each sample\u2019s mean (x\u0304).

As the sample size increases, sampling distribution will get narrower and more normal.", "This video explains the theorem unexpectedly interesting way using rabbits and dragon wings \ud83d\ude42", "Coming back to our explanation of the Central Limit Theorem, it allows us to calculate the standard deviation \u2014 known as the standard error \u2014 of the sampling distribution with the following formula:", "Let\u2019s look if this calculation also holds for our population and sampling distribution created:", "As expected it holds! The intuitive explanation of this formula is; as sample size increases, the sampling distribution will become a more accurate representation of the population parameters (mean and standard deviation).", "Of course not! This is explained by another fundamental theorem in statistics: Law of large numbers. As the more samples are drawn from a population and as the sample size increases, the mean of the sampling distribution will get closer to the population mean.", "In any machine learning problem, the given dataset represents a sample from the whole population. Using this sample, we try to catch the main patterns in the data. Then, we try to generalize the patterns in the sample to the population while making the predictions. Central limit theorem helps us to make inferences about the sample and population parameters and construct better machine learning models using them.", "Moreover, the theorem can tell us whether a sample possibly belongs to a population by looking at the sampling distribution. The power of the theorem lies here in too.", "When I typed the first words for this blog post, I intended to write about statistical significance and hypothesis testing but I realized that Central Limit Theorem is at the heart of explaining them.
