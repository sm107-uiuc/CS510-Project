There are a lot of articles out there that include a lot of negativity around being a Data Scientist, as well as some alongside some pro points, but in this article, I want to focus purely on the pros that I have personally experienced. Maybe some of these pros or enjoyments will be something you experience as well. The main topics I will discuss are freedom of the role as a Data Scientist in your everyday work, impact on where you work (the business), and the growth you will be able to obtain as a Data Scientist. Keep reading to find out more about the enjoyments of being a Data Scientist.", "At most of the companies I have worked at, the Data Science team is sectioned off and is sometimes separate from Engineering and Product (the two main departments that a Data Scientist can expect to work with or be apart of). Because the role of Data Science is not just Engineering or not just Product, you find yourself working somewhat alone. To me, this outcome is a pro. When you or even a smaller team are apart of a tightly-knit group, you can focus on a few projects rather than, say, up to 10, like a Software Engineer might experience or a Product Manager. The benefit of freedom in your role is certainly a nice-to-have. You might have fewer meetings, more time to focus on your project, and have the ability to work with a smaller amount of people who know about your project and can collaborate on.", "Here are the main points of why I enjoy freedom as a Data Scientist:", "Next, is the impact I feel in my job. In every company, both mine or our team\u2019s Data Science project has been a significant one resulting in changes felt across the entire company. Sometimes, a Data Science project can turn into the main product of a company \u2014 say Netflix, and their recommendation system, a lot of their business revolves around servicing the consumer recommendations (now they have the added product of their own shows and movies). Although Data Science projects can take quite a long time, they usually result in some impact, which of course gives a sense of accomplishment in your everyday work.", "Here are the reasons why I enjoy impact as a Data Scientist:", "Lastly, is the ability to not only grow considerably at your company, in terms of level or position in role, but also the ability to grow as a person. Sometimes roles can become quite stagnant, but in Data Science there are several different sub-positions that you can move to.", "Some of these positions include, but are not limited to:", "Because the role of Data Scientist covers so many facets of engineering and product like software, coding, programming, product management, business analytic, and business intelligence, you can find your niche and work towards a more specialized role (or stay a generalist and conquer them all).", "In terms of growing as a person, Data Science requires critical thinking, working alone, but also working with stakeholders and higher-level executives that require communication and reasoning skills \u2014 all of which can be applied to outside of Data Science.", "As you can see, there are many benefits of working as a Data Scientist that are quite enjoyable. I discussed the freedom, impact, and growth around the role itself. There are countless other pros as well. Feel free to comment down below to describe and discuss some of the reasons you enjoy being a Data Scientist as well.", "To summarize, the three reasons were:", "Thank you for reading!
