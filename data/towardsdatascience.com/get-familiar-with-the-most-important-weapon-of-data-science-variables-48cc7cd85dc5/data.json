We can not think of modern technology without data. If we have data we are able to get tons of information about any incidence or space. Today\u2019s world has quite a hunger for data. It can be compared with oil for modern technologies.", "But it does not make any sense if you don\u2019t know the data. Firstly, we must be familiar with the data we are exploring. If we don\u2019t know the data well, our system or analysis model building on top of the data will be ended up with a useless analysis or system. For this reason, we need to be familiar with data types and their representation techniques.", "The parameter holds the data is known as a variable in statistics. One dataset may describe the stock market, others may describe the population, employee data, and so on. It varies with the system. The properties with varying values are variables.", "This article will help you in this regard. All the variable types and possible graphical representations of the variables will be shown here. This would be the best article for you if you are interested in it. Let\u2019s get started.", "The data source is vast. We may find different types of data from different data sources. But it is important to know about the characteristics of the data. And variables define the characteristics of data. There are some parameters by which we can easily divide or categorize the variables. Basically there are two types of variables.", "Mainly two variable types are i) categorical and ii) numerical", "i. Categorical: Categorical variables represent types of data which may be divided into groups. It is also known as qualitative variable.", "Examples: Car Brand is a categorical variable that holds categorical data like Audi, Toyota, BMW, etc. Answer is a categorical variable that holds categorical data yes/no.", "ii.Numerical: All the variables representing in number is known as the numerical variable. It is also known as quantitative variable. It can be a)discrete, or b)continuous.", "a) Discrete: In a simple way, all the variables which contain countable data is known as the discrete variable.", "Example: Variable -No of Children, SAT Score, Population etc., all of these variables contain discrete data.", "b)Continuous: The variable which is uncountable is known as the continuous variable. It takes forever to count and the counting process will never end.", "A quick comparison of the variables.", "According to Wikipedia, \u201cLevel of measurement or scale of measure is a classification that describes the nature of the information within the values assigned to variables.\u201d", "Psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens developed the best-known classification with four levels, or scales, of measurement: i. nominal, ii.ordinal, iii. interval, iv. ratio", "The nominal and ordinal scales are used to measure the qualitative/categorical variable. On the other hand, the interval and ratio scales are used to measure the quantitative/ numerical variables.", "i. Nominal: It is a Latin word that means name only. The nominal level represents the categories that can not be put in any order. This level represents only the individual category or name.", "Example: Suppose, a variable represents Car Brand\u2192 Audi, Toyota, BMW, etc. We can not order these names in any manner. So, such types of variables are in the level of nominal measurement.", "ii. Ordinal: It is an ordered level or rank. It indicates the categorical variables that can be put in order. With this scale, we can determine the direction of the difference of a variable, but we can not determine the size of the difference.", "Example: We have a variable named Height represents the height of the people with short, medium, and tall. We can easily order these values tall \u2192 medium \u2192 short. This order provides a good intuition about the direction of difference but it doesn\u2019t provide any clue to identify how much the height differs from each other.", "iii. Interval: A variable that represents an equal interval among the levels and can be represented as a real number is known as an interval scale. It not only classifies and orders the measurements, but it also specifies that the distances between each interval on the scale are equivalent along the scale from low interval to high interval.", "Example: Temperature is a variable where the interval between 10-degree centigrade, and 20-degree, 70-degree centigrade, and 80-degree are the same. Marks of the examination, height, time, etc. can be a good example of an interval scale.", "iv. Ratio: It has all the properties like the interval scale. Additionally, it must satisfy a meaningful zero in the scale. Let\u2019s make it clear.", "Suppose, we are considering the body temperature in \u00b0C and \u00b0F scale. We found that two persons\u2019 body temperature is 10\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C or 10\u00b0F and 20\u00b0F respectively. We can not say that the 2nd person\u2019s body temperature is 2 times higher than the 1st one. Because 0\u00b0C and 0\u00b0F are not the true zero that means it doesn\u2019t mean the absence of temperature. If you want to represent temperature as a ratio scale then we must consider the Kelvin scale as 0 degree Kelvin indicates the absence of temperature.", "Here, we will discuss the Bar chart, Pie Chart, and Pareto Diagram to represent the variables.", "Suppose, we have a dataset of a car selling market and we are going to analyze the Car Brand variable. At first, we calculate the frequency of different Car Brand. It seems something like below.", "Let\u2019s convert it to a dataframe. As we are going to analyze with this demo data for graphical representation. The frequency represents the count of sold cars of each brand. You can do the same with any dataset. Let's convert the image with a pandas dataframe.", "Relative frequency indicates the distribution of individual frequency in percentage.", "We have added a relative frequency column in our main dataset.", "Let\u2019s draw a bar chart with the frequency.", "This represents a bar chart of the frequency.", "We can also represent the distribution of the frequency among different categorical data with Pie Chart.", "The Pareto diagram is a special type of bar chart where the categories are shown in descending order of frequency, and a separate curve shows the cumulative frequency.", "Let\u2019s draw the diagram with python.", "Pareto Diagram for the frequency table.", "So far so good. We are at the very end of the article.", "We can also represent the numerical data with a bar chart, pie chart, and Pareto diagram. If we want to find the frequency of the numerical data, we may found a frequency of 1 for each data. But it is not feasible to represent the data. So, what can I do?", "We can divide the numerical data into different intervals and then count the frequency of the data within the interval. Let\u2019s try to have better intuition with a python dataframe.", "If we want to count the frequency, most of the frequency of the data will be 1.", "Now, if we want to represent the above frequency with bar chart, pie chart it doesn\u2019t provide any information. So, we need to count the frequency within intervals. Suppose, we divide the data into 5 equal intervals.", "It shows the distribution of the frequency below.", "Well, we are able to apply the bar chart, pie chart, and Pareto diagram to represent the numerical variable\u2019s frequency. Try to follow the above techniques to draw the chart and diagram for the numerical variable. It\u2019s your task.", "The denominator variable is very much important for a data science task. At the very beginning of our analysis, we must have a look at it. Most often we forget to take it into account.
