Right > Based on the waist size of a cat, we decide on rough estimate of its weight (Numerical decision). On a side note, that cat needs some serious help dieting!", "> Assessing the risk of a patient getting infected by a disease that elderly are more prone to.

The entire patient data set is fed into the root node.", "2. A question is asked about the patient and the data set is split/partitioned based on whether the answer is true or false.", "3. At each split, the algorithm tries to ensure the patients in the resulting partitions are as homogeneous as possible (i.e. all virus-positive or virus-negative on each of the sub-nodes).

To understand this, let us look at the following 2 examples at the leaf nodes of our decision tree:", "On the left side, each leaf node contains a mixture of individuals with and without Covid-19 i.e. impure. If we were to classify individuals in the the left leaf-node as positive, the probability of being classified correctly is only 50% since it only contains 25/50 covid-positive individuals.", "On the right side, each leaf node of the decision tree are completely homogeneous (50/50 covid-positive and 48/48 covid-negative) i.e. pure. If we were to classify individuals in the the left leaf-node as positive, the probability of being classified correctly is 100% since it only contains covid-positive individuals.", "Therefore, having a purer node increases the chance of being classified correctly and reduces uncertainty in the decision outcome.", "There are a few ways to quantify impurity but we will just touch on two for now:", "Applying the formula to our example, if our first question was \u201cHas Chest Pain\u201d, we get the following output:", "To calculate the total Gini Impurity for \u201cHas Chest Pain\u201d, we take the weighted average of both leaf gini impurities as follows:", "Formula: Starting Gini impurity \u2014 Average Weighted Gini Impurity of question", "The question that has most information gain will be the best question to ask i.e. the higher the better!", "Now that we\u2019ve understood Gini Impurity, we can use it to help us decide\u2026", "To do this, we simply calculate the total Gini Impurity for each candidate question and choose the question with the lowest Gini Impurity:", "To do this, we perform following steps:", "In this case, we will make the node in question the leaf node since splitting results in higher Gini Impurity.", "That\u2019s it for now!
