As the primary input for the production of steel, it provides the foundation upon which the world\u2019s largest metal market trades, and commands one of the largest shares of the global dry bulk trade.", "Iron ore production, unsurprisingly, starts at the mine. As a trader either physical or financial, an understanding of the fundamental supply-demand nature of the iron ore market is essential. Iron ore grade (quality) variance has a notable impact on not only the spot and forward contracts pricing, but also on mill penalty charges for impurities. Imbalances in the fundamental supply/demand relationship can cause dramatic rises in the price of iron ore. Forecasting iron ore output from the largest iron ore exporting countries in order to predict global iron ore supply can be very helpful when speculating on spot, futures and contaminant penalty price movements.", "In this article, we are going to develop a forecast model using TensorFlow Probability\u2019s Structural Time-Series (STS) framework, to forecast the aggregate output of major iron ore mines in Brazil.", "Brazil is the second largest exporter of iron ore globally. Major changes in supply from Brazil can have an affect on the price of iron ore, as noted above. Furthermore, Brazilian iron ore is typically very high-grade and low in impurities. As a result, the relative supply of ore from Brazil can have an affect on the penalty pricing of impurities charged by steel mills. If global supply is dominated by high-contaminant iron ore as a result of a shortage in supply from Brazilian mines, the price penalty of contaminants can rise dramatically. Forecasting the output from Brazil therefore can lend itself to understanding the above dynamics.", "The code used in this article follows similar logic to that outlined in the Structural Time Series modeling in TensorFlow Probability tutorial (Copyright 2019 The TensorFlow Authors).", "When approaching a time series forecast problem, investing time into understanding the complexity of the variable you wish to forecast is paramount. Stationarity, seasonality, distributions and exogenous feature relationships are but a handful of the many considerations to bear in mind before designing any model\u2019s architecture.", "Structural time series models (sometimes referred to as Bayesian Structural Time Series) are expressed as a sum of components such as trend, seasonal patterns, cycles and residuals:", "These individual components are themselves time series defined by a structural assumption. The ability to configure each component in the time series makes TFP\u2019s STS library particularly relevant in the context of our time series forecasting problem, as it enables us to encode domain-specific knowledge, such as trader and mine operator expertise, and known events into our model.", "Mines production outputs typically exhibit systematic behaviour that can be modelled as a structural time series. In the context of our problem, we know that many mines close down for a two-week period in December for scheduled maintenance. This repeatable pattern can be added as a seasonal component to a structural time series model. We also know that Iron ore and other open cast mines exhibit distinct seasonal patterns that correlate strongly with precipitation which, during periods of heavy rainfall, lead to reduced outputs as drainage pumps become overwhelmed.", "What is particularly useful about structural time series models in the context of our problem is that they employ a probabilistic approach to modelling a time series problem, namely, they return a posterior predictive distribution over which we can sample to provide not only a forecast, but also a means of quantifying model uncertainty.", "Another exciting and highly useful feature of STS models is that the resulting model can be decomposed as a collection of it separate components. These components can then be plotted, giving us a valuable insight into their respective affects on the dependent variable (Y-hat), and a deeper understanding of the global time series problem:", "Before we start, it is worth noting that TensorFlow probability has a specific set of dependencies. Moreover TensorFlow is not included as a dependency of the TensorFlow Probability library and will need to be installed separately:", "Alternatively, you can use Google\u2019s Colaboratory (Colab), who kindly provide hosted runtimes in Colab completely free of charge (CPU, GPU and even TPU!) subject to memory limits.", "We start by examining our mine loadings (output) data whose observations are the total weekly output of each mine in millions of metric tonnes, aggregated over all major Brazilian iron ore producers:", "If we examine the observed output time series carefully, we can vaguely see some of the structural components mentioned earlier in the article that we can attempt to encode in an STS model:", "We can verify some of the aforementioned components in the time series by attempting to decompose the time series into its constituent parts. We will use statsmodels time series analysis library to perform the decomposition and choose an \u2018additive\u2019 model as the seasonal component on the basis of the observed behaviour in our time series plot. For reference, additive seasonality is estimated as:", "Passing the \u2018iron_ore_brazil\u2019 Pandas Series to the seasonal_decompose method we imported from statsmodels yields the following plot:", "Upon inspection, we can immediately identify the (mostly) linear trend and the seasonal component. If we look closely at the frequency and amplitude, you can see when the mine output diminishes each year during the winter period.", "It is immediately apparent upon inspection of the residuals, that there are other relationships within this time series that cannot be explained by the seasonal and trend elements alone. The variance in the residuals, however, remains fairly constant and within a defined bound. This is useful information to bear in mind when defining our structural components.", "\u201cAha!\u201d I hear you cry at this point. \u201cWhy decompose the time series if that is the point of the STS model?\u201d. Well, for two reasons:", "Both of these methods are, generally-speaking, quite computationally intensive (particularly in the case of HMC) on high-dimensional problems and are quite sensitive to tuning. Having an informed choice of input parameters when configuring STS components can help save time, resources and increase posterior distribution accuracy.", "Explaining the mathematics behind HMC and VI is beyond the scope of this article, but you can find out more on HMC here and VI here.", "We can now define the various components to our STS model and configure them based on what we know about the data generating process. Let\u2019s start with the seasonal component:", "We define the seasonal inputs to our structural time series model as follows:", "A valuable feature offered by the tfp.sts.Seasonal model is the ability to add \u2018drift\u2019 to the seasonal affect. This parameter allows the effect of each season to evolve or \u2018drift\u2019 from one occurrence to the next following a Gaussian random walk(specifically, samples drawn from a normal distribution defined by a mean and variance plus some drift term). If we were confident of the mean and variance of the prior distribution of the seasonal component, we could configure it ourselves within the model:", "For now, by setting the parameter \u2018allow_drift=True\u2019 we can let the model handle this for us.", "A visual inspection of our iron ore mine outputs shows (with the exception of late 2018/early 2019) a consistent linear trend. We can model this behaviour with a LocalLinearTrend model.", "The local linear trend model represents a time series trend as a combination of some magnitude (level) and slope. Each of these elements evolve through time via a Gaussian random-walk:", "Implementation of the local linear trend component in our problem is quite straightforward:", "An important consideration to bear in mind when choosing how to model the trend component is the choice of model, which is dependent upon the nature of the problem. In the case of our time series problem, the observed trend is relatively stable over time and evolves gradually i.e. it does not display any strong nonlinear behaviour. Our choice of model to represent this trend, therefore, is a reasonable one, however this model can produce forecasts with very high uncertainty over longer forecast periods.", "It is well known that most time series have inherent temporal structure where succeeding observations are dependent on the previous n observations in time i.e. autocorrelation. A wise choice therefore, might be to model the trend using TFP STS\u2019s SemiLocalLinearTrend model. In a semi-local linear trend model, the slopecomponent evolves according to a first-order autoregressive process. The AR process can therefore account for the autocorrelative (of order n) effect in the time series, and typically lead to forecasts with greater certainty over a longer period of time.", "As previously mentioned during our inspection of the seasonal decomposition plot, the residuals in our time series look relatively consistent suggesting that they are potentially stationary, i.e. they maintain a constant variance over time, do not exhibit bias or heteroskedasticity etc. We can therefore represent the residual behaviour in an sts.AutoRegressive model:", "As with the other components, for a fully Bayesian approach one should specify the priors coefficients_prior, level_scale_prior and initial_state_prior. As we have not specified priors, a TensorFlow Distributions (tfd) MultivariateNormalDiag instance is used as a default prior for the coefficients, and a heuristic prior constructed for the level and initial states based on the input time series.", "We can now define our structural time series model using the tfp.sts.Sum class. This class enables us to define the compositional specification of our structural time series model from the components we have defined above:", "We will now fit our model to the observed time series, namely our iron ore output. Unlike traditional time series forecasting architectures such as Linear Regression models, which estimate their coefficients via Maximum Likelihood Estimation, or, on the more powerful end of the scale, an LSTM which learns a function that maps a sequence of past observations as input to an output observation, an STS model learns a distribution, namely, the posterior.", "We are going to fit the model to the data and build a posterior predictive distribution using Variational Inference. Simply put, VI fits a set of approximate posterior distributions for the model parameters we have defined (for each component) and optimises these by minimising a variational loss function known as negative Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):", "The astute among us might have noticed the decorator, @tf.function(). This accepts a function, in this instance our STS model, as an argument and compiles it into a callable TensorFlow graph. An interesting introduction on how TensorFlow works and handles operations through the use of graphs can be found here.", "Now for the fun part. After checking the loss function converges, we can perform a forecast. We draw traces (samples) from the variational posterior and construct a forecast by passing these as an argument to tfp.sts.forecast(). Given our model, the observed time series and our sampled parameters, forecast() returns the predictive distribution over the future observations for the desired number of forecast steps:", "We can then visualise our forecast:", "Upon first glance, we can observe that the model (with the exception of the 2019 force majeure) has performed quite reasonably in forecasting our mine outputs. We can validate the accuracy of our forecast against the observed data points by calculating the Mean Absolute Error. From a business perspective, however, given the scale of the label i.e. in millions of tonnes it makes more sense to calculate and present the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE), as this is more interpretable and meaningful to non-data science individuals:", "At 13.92% MAPE It is clear that our iron ore output model has done a reasonable job of modelling the data generating distribution, particularly when we have not fully tuned the parameters of the model.", "We can further understand our model\u2019s fit and verify the contribution of our individual structural components by decomposing it into their respective time series (again). We usetfp.sts.decompose_by_component to perform this operation which returns acollections.OrderedDict of the individual components posterior distributions, mapped back to its respective observation model:", "After a bit of manipulation, we can plot the output of the decomposed time series to yield the following chart:", "Examination of our decomposed model raises some points for further analysis:", "In this article, we have seen how we can develop a Bayesian Structural Time Series model using TensorFlow Probability\u2019s Structural Time Series library.
