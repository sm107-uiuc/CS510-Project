But after two months, I\u2019m certified! Do I say that this is an easy exam? NO! Absolutely wrong. The scope of this exam is extremely large and nearly most of the AWS services are involved. In this article, I will share how I studied and passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect (SAA-C02).", "I attended various courses, both in-person and online.", "My company organized an instructor-led course in the office and I\u2019ve attended for free (Nice benefit!). It is more understandable when you are listening to the instructor teaching with your mother tongue (My mother tongue is not English).", "The other advantage of attending an instructor-led course is that you can ask questions immediately during the class whenever you have doubts about the material presented. It helps you to learn more in-depth and customize. Also, it is a good learning process when your classmates ask as well. Sometimes you just think we know the stuff but when your classmates ask the questions you never think of, you will find that you actually don\u2019t understand the materials at all! This happened many times during my course and we learned a lot throughout this Q&A process.", "In the course, we need to do six hands-on labs in Qwiklabs. It is very good practice to do hands-on exercises right after you learn the related concepts. It helps you consolidate what you have just learned by making your hands dirty. But if you don\u2019t have a Qwiklabs account, you can always use AWS free-tiers to do your experiments. There are many hands-on exercise guides on the Internet to guide you using services in AWS. I followed many hands-on practices in ACloudGuru course.", "The disadvantage is if you need to pay for this course, it is quite expensive. Another disadvantage is that you cannot replay the lesson, unlike online courses. When I was preparing for the exam, I constantly went back and review the content that I forgot. It is possible if you are taking online courses but not in a classroom lesson. You need to drop your own notes during the class.", "I purchased this course on Udemy for around $13 when there was a discount. You may check the affiliated link below if you want. You can also subscribe ACloudGuru learning portal.", "This course starts with a broad overview of the AWS platform and then deep dive into the individual elements of the AWS platform. You will explore Route53, EC2, S3, CloudFront, Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, RDS, RedShift, DynamoDB, EMR, VPC, etc.", "ACloudGuru was the perfect place to start. They give lectures and hands-on labs that are informative and will keep you engaged.", "They updated this course with new content from around June to July 2020. Since the AWS landscape is continuously changing, it can be challenging to find current resources. There are sections focusing on the new content in SAA-C02, they marked the section with a bracket [SAA-C02]. Pay special attention to these sections as they will occur in the SAA-C02 exam.", "There are section summaries that help you focus on the most critical parts of each lecture. I recommend you review these summaries before the exam day.", "There is a completely free course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. It\u2019s around 10 hours and covers all services necessary to pass the exam. If you don\u2019t want to spend any money on taking the courses, I recommend you to watch this course.", "I recommend all of you to pass these practice exams before attending the real exam. It provides simulated questions that are very similar to the actual exam.", "One of the selling points of this practice exam is that each question contains detailed explanations that will help you gain a deeper understanding of AWS services. It not just explains what the correct answer is, but also explains why other answers are wrong. It is extremely helpful to make you recognize the difference between similar services.", "Another thing is that the exam pattern is really close to the actual exam. It simulates very well. The questions are really similar to the actual exam. I would say I get prepared after doing all these 6 practice exams. You may check the affiliated link above if you want.", "These cheat sheets are extremely useful, they give you a quick overview of the important AWS services that you need to know very well to be able to pass the AWS certification exams. They are concise and easy to read and follow. One of the most helpful parts is the comparison of similar services. Often in the exam, there are two similar answers that seem can solve the problems of the given scenarios. But the minor difference between the services leads to one answer but not the other. Familiar yourself with all the services with the comparison table/chart helps you to pass the exam.", "Although it is recommended to read all the related whitepapers and learn all the concepts and strategies from them, I didn\u2019t read the whitepapers. AWS has just updated the whitepapers of the Well-Architected Framework and the Five Pillars. If you have sufficient time, reading those whitepapers will be a great supplement to your exam preparations and will help you gain a better understanding of the different AWS services.", "You can request an extra 30 minutes if you are non-native English speakers.", "Follow the steps in this reference and request accommodation to receive an additional 30 minutes to complete it.", "Finishing the certification is not the end of the story, in fact, this is just the beginning of my cloud journey. If you are interested, join me on this journey. I didn\u2019t pass the exam with a high score, just barely passed. I still have a lot of things to learn about AWS. The exam motivated me to learn all these latest cloud technologies and the exam result keeps me learning. It is a lifelong learning process!", "I wish you the best of luck! If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to leave a response, and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as possible.", "Your home for data science.
