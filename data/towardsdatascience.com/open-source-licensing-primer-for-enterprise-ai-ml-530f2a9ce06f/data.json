According to Gartner, \u201cmore than 90% of companies rely on Open Source Software\u201d. The below snapshot should give you an idea of the pervasiveness of Open Source Software (OSS) in the Enterprise.", "While OSS started as a cost cutting exercise, it has increasingly become the preferred platform for innovation.", "However, this entails a big change for the (large) enterprise Compliance/legal teams, who in many cases had a strict \u2018No Open Source\u2019 policy so far.", "Common wisdom says that most enterprises go through the following lifecycle stages in their Open Source journey:", "Denial (No OSS allowed in the enterprise)\u2192 Anger (over loss of control upon discovering their first OSS usage)\u2192 Negotiation (with Dev teams to re-establish procurement controls)\u2192 Depression (on realizing that the OSS tipping point has been reached)\u2192 Acceptance (managed OSS usage in the enterprise)", "So we will just assume that you have reached the \u2018Acceptance\u2019 stage, and are now looking for a strategy to effectively manage the growing OSS usage at your enterprise.", "To effectively manage OSS, it is necessary to scope and understand the OSS licensing spectrum.", "It is not easy to define OSS. Different organizations, e.g. the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and Free Software Foundation (FSF) define OSS differently. Although, there exists significant overlap between the definitions of Open Source Software (OSS) and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), there also exists a philosophical disagreement between advocates of the two definitions. For simplicity, we focus on the OSI definition of OSS, which captures the following key characteristics of OSS (link):", "Software must include source codeMust allow (re-)distributionMust allow modifications and derivative worksIntegrity of author\u2019s source codeNon-discrimination against persons and fields of endeavorLicense must be technology neutral", "In short, it is important to understand that OSS does not necessarily mean \u2018free\u2019 software.", "While there may not be a commercial payment needed upfront, the usage of OSS is always regulated by its \u2018License\u2019. OSS licenses primarily regulate the following aspects:", "Modify and re-distribute sourceMake the source code available", "OSI has approved a popular set of licenses based on their OSS Definition \u2014 the complete list can be found here (link). There are primarily two categories among OSS licenses: Permissive and Copyleft.", "Permissive licenses are often used to describe minimally restrictive OSS licenses. That is, they do not require source code to be made available to downstream recipients. The snapshot below shows the key portions of a widely used permissive license \u2014 Apache.", "Copyleft licenses on the other hand require that if derivative works (or software in the same file, or same program) are distributed, the distribution is under the same terms as the original work. This is also referred to as the \u201creciprocal\u201d effect. Licenses that include reciprocity or copyleft clauses include all versions of the GPL, LGPL, AGPL, MPL and CDD. Example of license reciprocity from the GPL version 2.0 is quoted below:", "\u201cYou must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed\u2026under the terms of this License.\u201d", "Given the different types of OSS licenses, license compatibility is a way of understanding what licenses can be used together. Some OSS licenses are compatible with each other. Some are not. This is an important consideration when choosing OSS code, tools, packages and licenses. The adjacent scenarios depict a compatible and incompatible mix of OSS licenses.", "Finally, a word about \u2018Notices\u2019. Notices, such as text in comments in file headers, often provide authorship and licensing information.", "Even permissive licenses may include conditions to preserve copyright statement and attribute original source code to give credit to the author (an attribution) or to make it clear the software includes modifications.", "Copyright notice \u2014 an identifier placed on copies of the work to inform the world of copyright ownership.Attribution notice \u2014 a notice included in the product release that acknowledges the identity of the original authors and/or sponsors of the OSS included in the product.Modification notice \u2014 a notice that you have made modifications to the source code of a file, such as adding your copyright notice at the top of the file.", "We will focus on the steps needed to effectively manage OSS licenses, including setting up of an Open Source Program Office / Open Source Review Board (OSRB). OSPO is the \u201ccentral place where all open source activities are handled for consistent communication inside/outside the company.\u201d \u2014 HP Open Source Governance (link).", "It is an interdisciplinary team involving IT, Legal and Procurement with the following scope:", "There are more than 300 OSS licenses, and growing.", "However, many studies have shown that around 20 licenses account for 80% of the OSS commonly used in enterprises.", "A practical way to address this is to start with a Blacklist / Whitelist classification of the licenses corresponding to the OSS used in your enterprise. This serves as an easy to use reference, and we have seen very good adoption of such classification lists in enterprises.", "The below table shows an example of a license classification list used at a Fortune 500 company (say X).", "*The Open Source Initiative defines distribution (link) as follows:", "\u201c\u2026 to \u2018distribute\u2019 a program means to give someone else a copy of its code \u2014 either its source code, or its binary (executable) code, or both. Merely allowing people to invoke a program on your server, for example via networked API calls, does not constitute distribution of the program as generally understood.\u201d", "Ultimately the meaning of \u2018distribution\u2019 is determined through a combination of applying (i) local copyright laws; and (ii) the terms of the of the applicable OSS license.", "For the purpose of understanding the above table and determining when an OSRB review is required, we regard Distribution as any of:", "Examples: posting a download link to software on a website, embedding firmware in devices, rolling out a mobile app, contributing to a public Open Source Software project, uploading to a public source code repository (e.g. Github), providing Open Source Software to a third party supplier (e.g. an outsourcing partner).", "**We do not regard Distribution as occurring where:", "Code libraries with an Allowed license tend to gain popularity since they are easier to use. Code libraries with a Restricted license (e.g. statically linked LGPL, or any GPL software regardless of linking dynamically or statically) may sometimes be found as a part of SDKs. Such Restricted software should be avoided even for Internal Use (and replaced with an Allowed alternative) if the library must also be copied for your application to work at run-time. A failure to at least clearly identify such usage of Restricted software could create a risk of a license compliance issue if ever in the future the software were Distributed externally (potentially by someone who is not the original developer of the application).", "***The main difference between GPL and LGPL is the latter allows the work to be linked with a non-(L)GPL program, regardless of whether it is free or proprietary software (link). Apps which link to LGPL libraries need not be released under the LGPL, but must allow new versions of the library to be linked with the app; and allow reverse engineering to debug this. If you distribute a library having an LGPL license with your app, you need to include source code for the library. If your app instead requires users to obtain the library on their own (with the option to replace it with an alternative), then you do not need to provide source code for the library (link). Most vendors are normally providing a list of links from which to download all the required dependencies as well as specifying which licenses apply. If any of the licenses can be found in the Restricted list, this should be a red flag for the Product Teams to clear before using such software.", "****The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) is the GPL for the web, which extends beyond X\u2019s definition of Distribution to include \u201cpublic use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.\u201d (link)The OSRB has decided the risk of license compliance issues even from simple usage of unmodified AGPL software outweighs the benefits, and therefore use of AGPL-licensed software is banned at X. Some vendors offer an alternative with a commercial license including paid support.", "Common use cases where the use of a Restricted license may be appropriate:", "If you are unsure whether a particular use case for Open Source Software does or doesn\u2019t involve Distribution, it is always best to contact the OSPO/OSRB for guidance.", "You can use the decision tree below while evaluating a new OSS component based on the above license classification table:", "To conclude, we hope that this gives you a launch pad to start the discussion with your Compliance/Legal teams to fast-track OSS adoption at your enterprises, and move higher up the OSS value chain \u2014 to contribute to OSS projects and become an OSS Community Leader.", "Your home for data science.
