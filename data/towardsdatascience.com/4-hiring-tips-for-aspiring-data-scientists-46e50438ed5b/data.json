So 1 in 3 people visit the site every month. We love real estate.", "From these 7 million unique visits per month, 300 million data points are collected, analysed and experimented with to provide a better experience.", "When Nigel Dalton, Chief Inventor of REA Group, and I were discussing the timeline of REA Group, he said they\u2019re moving away from a search space into a matching space.", "Rather than searching for the perfect property, REA wants to use their data to help match you with the perfect property. In essence, using your past preferences to show you places you\u2019re more likely to be interested in.", "If you\u2019re thinking this is something new, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s happening all over the web. Netflix\u2019s recommendation engine and Facebook\u2019s newsfeed do this. My brothers and I rarely search for YouTube videos anymore because their recommendations are so good.", "Patterns. Patterns are everywhere. The 3-inches at the top of your skull is an expert pattern recogniser. It\u2019s how a 20-year veteran real estate agent can look a home in their local suburb and guesstimate the value within a few decimals. But now our ability to replicate this pattern recognition with machines is catching up, in some instances, surpassing our grey matter.", "There\u2019s no way you or I could take in the 300 million data points and imagine bettering the experience for 7 million people. Maybe I could take in 10 and better it for 1 person and you 20. Then how do you match someone with a property based off of their previous searches? Data science.", "When I was talking with REA\u2019s most Senior Data Scientist I wanted to find out what it took to get on his team.", "For clarity, REA has a data science team of 12 and data plays a part in almost every one of REA\u2019s business decisions. There\u2019s something beautiful about how much impact a relatively small team can have with access to the right tools.", "\u201cWhat do you look for when you\u2019re looking to hire someone new?\u201d", "I\u2019ve condensed our discussion into the following points.", "Skills are a must. There\u2019s no question here.", "Python or R is where you want to be.", "How much Python? How much R?", "There are no exact answers here. Being able to manipulate a dataframe is a great place to start. If you\u2019re unsure what a dataframe is, don\u2019t fret. Find out and learn about them, then keep reading.", "You\u2019ll have no trouble trying to find a data science or machine learning course online and a book or two to go with it. I learned this way and I\u2019m going to continue learning this way. If you\u2019re looking to get started, I recommend anything on Coursera or Udacity. Yes, they\u2019re paid, but you get what you pay for.", "There is no perfect set of skills or perfect course/book. Jump in and give it a try. Once you\u2019ve learned a few things, start thinking about how they could be applied to something you\u2019re interested in. It may take a while to get to this point, it may take a day. Either way, remember, learning a new skill is by definition hard. Expect it to be hard at some points.", "\u201cMost of our problems don\u2019t require the same skills, the foundation is needed but not everything is the same.\u201d", "So you\u2019ve been studying hard and now you\u2019ve got a few skills. Great! Now it might be time to apply for some roles. But you read the job listing and are quickly disheartened by the requirements.", "X years experience in R.X years experience in data visualisations.X years experience in PowerPoint (what?).", "You\u2019ve been learning Python. Damn. That role looked really good.", "Wait! Don\u2019t fear. Every job posting will have something like this on it. It\u2019s the norm.", "Whatever skills you learn, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll ever fit the exact ones listed in the job posting. Apply anyway.", "The beauty of these skills is their adaptability. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ll have to be prepared for. Problems won\u2019t always come in the same neat little package.", "This is where you can demonstrate what you\u2019ve been up to on your learning journey.", "Alright, you\u2019ve been learning some skills and you\u2019ve tried them out on some data. Everything didn\u2019t go as planned.", "Now you\u2019re reading about a role you\u2019d really like but again you\u2019re thrown off by \u201946 years experience with being a data ninja.\u2019", "That\u2019s another way of saying, \u2018we need you to be able to ride a bike on your own so we don\u2019t have to teach you how to ride a bike with training wheels again.\u2019", "Well, guess what? You\u2019ve already ditched your training wheels. You might be a little wobbly, but you\u2019re still riding the bike.", "But throwing analogies like I just did might not cut it in an interview or a cover letter. If they do, virtual high-fives to your employer (and you).", "The internet has given us a menagerie of tools to show how creative we all are. A few came up in our discussion.", "Ever wanted a corner of the internet you can make entirely your own? This is where that can happen.", "When I first launched my blog, I was scared. After a couple of years its become a part of me, I love having my own space to share my ideas and anything else I\u2019ve been working on.", "You can code your own, but we\u2019re also spoiled for choice with places like Medium, GitHub Pages, SquareSpace and WordPress. Write an article about the latest project you\u2019ve been working on. Share an idea about how to find insights into an open source dataset.", "If a post gets 0 views, don\u2019t worry. It all adds to your proof of work. So if someone asks, \u201chave you ever had experience with X?\u201d you can say, \u201cwell not exactly, but I did write an article about how I dealt with Y and how I learned Z from it.\u201d", "You know what I\u2019m talking about. The place where code lives.", "If you\u2019re writing code and ever want it to be seen or shared, GitHub is the place to do it.", "The beautiful thing? You can code a whole data science pipeline, write about your thought process and share a step-by-step tutorial all on GitHub, for free.", "Use your readme.md files to yours and others advantage. Don\u2019t just post code, describe what it does and why it\u2019s important. This is something I can still work on.", "LinkedIn is the new resume. If you spend 8-hours crafting a beautiful resume, you should at least do the same on your LinkedIn profile.", "At a bare minimum, fill out the required fields, write a description about yourself and include a headline.", "A good headline should tell someone what you do or at least intrigue them in under 10 words.", "What would you like someone to think of when they see your profile for the first time?", "Unlike GitHub, you can\u2019t share code directly to LinkedIn but you can share text, photos, videos and even write articles which live on your profile. There\u2019s no secret formula for posting. I got started with a 30-day LinkedIn challenge. Every day for a month, I posted something and it was a great way to start building momentum on the platform.", "The beautiful thing about LinkedIn is there are people like you all over it. Everyone is in some way looking to improve themselves and help others. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to someone in the industry you\u2019d like to get into and ask for their advice. If you message 47 people and only get 2 replies, don\u2019t take it as a bad thing. Everyone has their own life as complex and interesting as yours.", "LinkedIn is one of the first places people go if they\u2019re looking for someone to hire. If you want a role, have yours ready.", "Writing not your thing? Better on camera? Make a video sharing your latest project and share it on LinkedIn.", "Learned a new thing you think would be helpful for others to know? Create a YouTube tutorial for others.", "The internet has given us a plethora of ways to showcase our work. The only way to find the best one for you is to try a few out and see what sticks.", "This goes hand in hand with adaptability. You can\u2019t adapt if you\u2019re not eager to learn.", "Technology is improving every day. What was state of the art last month won\u2019t be state of the art next month.", "\u201cWhat do you look for in interns?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cHow quickly they disregard their old methods for learning something new and better.\u201d", "Have you ever tried to have a conversation with someone who was right no matter what?", "Continual learning means eventually you will be wrong. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being wrong. The only time it becomes wrong is when you don\u2019t accept you\u2019re wrong and move forward. Instead, you\u2019re stuck in an old way of doing things.", "This was hard for me to accept when I started. I thought I could do everything. I thought it should come easy. Wrong.", "Learning something new is hard. Accepting there will always be something new to learn doesn\u2019t make it any easier it means there are no surprises.", "You\u2019ve got the skills, you can adapt like a thermophile, you\u2019re showcasing your work better than most art galleries and you\u2019re more eager to learn than 8-year-old with their first iPad.", "Sweet, but what do you do now?", "Showing your work may lead to opportunities but it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll have to do much of the outreach yourself. The traditional application through a careers page is a good place to start. After here, if you really want to stand out, try writing an article about something to do with the role. Send it along with your application. Or make a website.", "Be creative. You\u2019re more than a one-page resume.", "You\u2019ve made your applications. No one is reading your articles. You haven\u2019t heard back from anyone. It\u2019s been three weeks. All hope is lost.", "It\u2019s time to work. It\u2019s time to figure out where you\u2019ve been going wrong. Take stock of where you\u2019ve come. What\u2019s worked, what hasn\u2019t?", "Perhaps the one thing you\u2019re missing is patience. Finding a role is difficult. You should treat it with as much care as starting a new relationship.", "Not everyone you ask would be happy to go on a date with you, it\u2019s the same with applying for roles.", "As an up and coming data scientist, you\u2019re looking for ways to use your skills to help make sense of the world. You\u2019re starting a new project but you\u2019ve only got a sample size of one. What\u2019s the first thing you do?", "You\u2019ve just read this article. It\u2019s given you a few things to think about. Are they the best?", "I can\u2019t answer that. But I can give you somewhere else to look. I found an article yesterday which contradicts half the things in this one.", "The internet has given us access to an abundance of information, all of which you can remix with your own ideologies into your own unique system.", "The tips I\u2019ve put together here are from the Chief Data Scientist of realestate.com.au. Their goal is to match people interested in property to the best properties and agents. The company you apply to may have different goals and thus different outlooks on how they hire.", "One thing is for sure, finding a role is hard. There\u2019s no set path.", "We didn\u2019t mention it during the discussion but I\u2019m going to finish with a point of my own.", "Whatever role you\u2019re after, go for it. Apply and apply again. And if there is no role for you, create your own.", "You\u2019re more capable than you think.", "If you\u2019re more of a visual learner like me, there\u2019s a video version of this article on my YouTube channel. And a bunch more videos documenting my journey into the world of data.", "Your home for data science.
