Well, do not worry, you can teach a computer to tell the difference between them as a data science practitioner. We can hopefully achieve great accuracy in it or else the degree of radiologist it is.", "Tell me what is CNN in one sentence \u2014 It an artificial neural network that has the ability to pin point or detect patterns in the images.", "Explain what\u2019s going on inside a CNN architecture \u2014 CNN CNN architecture is based on layers of convolution. The convolution layers receive input and transform the data from the image and pass it as input to the next layer. The transformation is known as the operation of convolution. We need to define the number of filters for each convolution layer. These filters detect patterns such as edges, shapes, curves, objects, textures, or even colors. The more sophisticated patterns or objects it detects are more deeply layered. In essence, filters are image kernels that we can define as 3x3 or 4x4, which is a small matrix applied to an image as a whole. We will use Pooling layer together with Convolution layer as well as the goal is to down-sample an input representation (image), decrease its dimensionality by retaining the maximum value (activated features) in the sub regions binding. The number of pixels moving across the input matrix is called Stride. When the stride is 1 we move the filter to 1 pixel at a time. When the stride is 2 then we move the filter to 2 pixels at a time, and so on. Larger filter sizes and strides may be used to reduce the size of a large image to a moderate size.", "Okay, if you hate math, all these complex mathematical operations are performed behind the scenes, all we need to do is define hyper parameters and layers.

The input of (13, 13, 64) is therefore flattened to (13*13*64) = 10816 values.", "The rectified linear activation function or short-term ReLU is a piecewise linear function that outputs the input directly if it is positive, otherwise it outputs zero. The rectified linear activation function overcomes the problem of vanishing gradients, allowing models to learn faster and perform better.", "Padding \u2014 \"SAME\": output size is the same as input size. This requires the filter window to slip outside input map, hence the need to pad.\"VALID\": Filter window stays at valid position inside input map, so output size shrinks by filter_size - 1. No padding occurs.", "Activation function \u2014 Simply put, activation is a function that is added to an artificial neural network to help the network learn complex patterns in the data. When comparing with a neuron-based model in our brains, the activation function is at the end of the day to decide what to do with the next neuron. Since the classification is between 2 classes we are going to use sigmoid activation function for last layer which returns value in the range of 0 to 1. For more than 2 classes we can use softmax activation function.", "EarlyStopping is called to stop the epochs based on some metric(monitor) and conditions (mode, patience)\u00a0. It helps to avoid overfitting the model. Over here we are telling to stop based on val_loss metric, we need it to be minimum. patience says that after a minimum val_loss is achieved then after that in next iterations if the val_loss increases in any the 3 iterations then the the training will stop at that epoch.", "Reduce learning rate when a metric has stopped improving.
