What kind of career path is this and what skill set does a Machine Learning Engineer need to have? Is it possible to define steps to take in order to become a ML Engineer? Can you follow online training and get certified? I figured I\u2019d write up my ideas on the state of the field and how viable it is for those looking to pursue a career in it.", "Let\u2019s get one point out of the way first. Some might look at the job title and expect it to be a Data Scientist who purely focuses on model building \u2014 and that\u2019s it. This is a big no no; if only because most ML Engineering work starts after the initial model is built. While it\u2019s often part of the job, a Machine Learning Engineer does not purely build models. And honestly, that part will only take up 5 to 10% of the job.", "Look at this image of all the components that are involved in the model ecosystem. The black square at the center? That\u2019s the actual ML code.", "So what kind of creature is the Machine Learning Engineer then and where does it fit into the grand scheme of things? I prefer to fall back on a part of Tomasz Dudek\u2019s definition from 2018:", "\u2026A person called a machine learning engineer asserts that all production tasks are working properly in terms of actual execution and scheduling, abuses machine learning libraries to their extremes, often adding new functionalities. (They) ensure that data science code is maintainable, scalable and debuggable, automating and abstracting away different repeatable routines that are present in most machine learning tasks. They bring the best software development practices to the data science team and help them speed up their work\u2026", "\u2014 Tomasz Dudek in \u201cBut what is this \u201cmachine learning engineer\u201d actually doing?\u201d", "Essentially a ML Engineer is then some kind of wizard that brings models to production in a sensible way, is able to improve the Data Scientist\u2019s models and is also partly an architect who lays the road for the Data Science team. This sounds incredibly like some kind of senior engineering role, and yet it doesn\u2019t have to be.", "Most of the other ML Engineers I\u2019ve met fall into one of two categories. The first group is highly educated, with most having a master\u2019s or even a PhD in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science or Software Engineering. Surprisingly many are relatively new grads, with 1\u20133 years of experience under their belt when they became ML Engineers. There\u2019s also a second group that consists of more experienced developers that transitioned into this role from neighboring fields such as Software Engineering or Data Engineering, and of course Data Science.", "This indicates that there is a level of proficiency needed to be a ML Engineer that could come from either of the two directions that make up the role. You could be a great software engineer, or a fantastic machine learning virtuoso. Maybe both! If you are one already, this might be the field for you. If you are not, it might be a viable direction to develop yourself towards.", "But do not make the mistake that Software Engineers or Data Scientists automatically make good ML Engineers. I come from a software background myself and I can vouch that most ML concepts and APIs are absolutely alien to Software Engineers. I remember the intense struggles I had getting to know TensorFlow and Theano years ago. Even though I started coding in my teens I had never seen anything like it. The experience was humbling.", "A beginner-level ML Engineer is not a beginner programmer. This is a journey that is always at least traveled with experience. Is it then impossible to land a ML Engineering job without experience or training?", "Of course not. However, the odds are against you. It is far easier to get into this niche when you have a similar background. There is some light on the horizon, however.", "Remember that back when Data Science started becoming popular we said the same thing about Data Scientists because the people doing Data Science at that time were some of the brightest and most highly-educated people in the world. Since then Data Science has become more accessible and in truth, nowadays you can be a great Data Scientist without needing a PhD. Whether the same will fully apply for ML Engineering I am not sure, but I hope that as our field matures the barriers to entry will become lower.", "The toolbelt of the ML Engineer is not simply the lovechild of an intense affair between a Software Engineer\u2019s IDE and a Data Scientist Jupyter Lab. It has many tools and techniques that are intrinsic to the field. Which brings me the next section\u2026", "Skills lists become outdated soon after being written, and often take on a life of their own. And yet I am here to draft up a non-exhaustive list of skills and topics to study! The tool landscape is so broad that it\u2019s unlikely any ML Engineer will have proficiency with every language, tool and concept out there. Please don\u2019t look upon this as some kind of list of items you need to cross off on your ML Engineering journey like so many online resources will instruct you to. Rather, take note and look at these as themes within the ML Engineering field.", "I\u2019ll try to discuss concepts more than specific tools. That way most of this will remain relevant in a couple of months or years.", "The reason why I would take Python over R or any other language is mainly because of the production aspect. While you can do a lot with R it is often not supported as well as Python is. There\u2019s also the time aspect that plays here: often it is far faster to productionalize code in Python than R.", "So how do you learn about all of these if not on the job? Courses and online training can be great but they won\u2019t teach you how to do apply it in a real-life setting. For things like statistics it doesn\u2019t matter, but for technical subjects knowing \u201cabout\u201d it is only half of the mastery. It doesn\u2019t take more than a quick glance at Reddit\u2019s r/learnprogramming to see that there are many people struggling to make the jump from coding in the protected IDE in an online course to coding their own projects on their own machine.", "My experience is that it might be better to get started on a project on your own to learn a new skill, and supplement your knowledge with online training when you already have some applied knowledge. Instead of all-in-one training programs there are many tutorials online to help you with that, from building your own clock or calculator to a complete web app. Be aware of any course that promises you can go from zero to hero in a couple of weeks or months.", "Certifications are a similar beast. A certification can be particularly valuable if you\u2019re in consulting and want to signal to clients that your skills meet certain standards. Having a certification that corresponds to a client\u2019s tech stack immediately puts you at the front of the pack. However, a certification is worthless without the skills to back this up in the first place. Consider now that you can obtain many certifications without having to code for them and you\u2019ll see where I\u2019m headed. Often, the time spent getting a certification would be better spent just building applications.", "That said, there are some certifications that do carry some merit for ML Engineers, particularly for cloud vendors. Often these require a couple of years of experience deploying applications on their respective platforms, but anyone can pay $100\u2013300 and register for a certification examination. As of 2020, there are three cloud vendors worth mentioning: Azure (Microsoft), GCP (Google), and AWS (Amazon). Here\u2019s a list of certifications they offer that are in the sphere of interest of the ML Engineer.", "Microsoft offers associate-level certification for both Data Scientists and AI Engineers, as well as about a dozen other certifications. Some certifications actually require multiple exams, but this is not (yet?) the case for both the Data Scientist and the AI Engineer cert. The certification topics are a little bit superficial, but the exam should not be underestimated.", "Google is the challenger when it comes to cloud services and the state of their certification reflects that. At the moment the ML Engineer exam is in beta and no certifications have been awarded yet. The exam takes four (!) hours but is an incredibly comprehensive list of what a ML Engineer\u2019s job is all about. Prior to this certification being introduced, some ML topics fell under the Data Engineer certification, so many ML Engineers, myself included, actually took the Data Engineering certification track.", "You could also look at the Google Cloud Architect, Developer or DevOps certification, but these barely touch upon it and might add a little bit of noise on your resume that lines you up for different gigs. I say that as a certified Cloud Architect myself who learned this from experience. On the other hand, it could make your profile a little bit more appealing.", "Amazon has specific paths for both analytic roles and ML roles. Given that the data analytics certification is almost entirely focused on data processing and reporting, I would propose that only the ML Specialty is of interest to the ML Engineers. Their Machine Learning Specialty\u2019s syllabus covers a lot of ML Engineering topics, though it is not as exhaustive as the Google certification.", "At the moment Amazon is the market leader, with around 60% market share. Azure sits at 30% and GCP at 10%. While the overall market is growing a lot, AWS is slowly losing market share to Google and Microsoft. Google might look like an underdog, but they have a pretty strong track record with AI innovations and their ownership of TensorFlow. Speaking of which, there\u2019s also a certificate for TF. If you\u2019re not forced to use one cloud vendor over the other by an employer I would advice to test out all three with trial accounts and deploying a pet project. Figure out which one you like and also look at what kind of companies use these cloud vendors.", "Why do you need cloud tech at all? Well, eventually Data Science work makes it to production and most of the time it is deployed on a cloud platform. You don\u2019t need to rival the skills of a Cloud Engineer but you should know how to implement ML projects in your chosen platform. They don\u2019t often teach how to navigate {vendor} cloud consoles at a formal place like an university.", "There is a downside to learning a cloud platform: literally not a week goes by without a new cloud product being announced on one of these giants. Keeping up to date with cloud offerings is hard. Having a wide range of certifications also brings into question whether you\u2019re actually up to snuff with all of them.", "You might have noticed that, so far, I did not link any courses or tutorials. There are already many resources already out there for that. Furthermore, my main point is that the road to becoming a ML Engineer is traveled by doing projects and getting experience in the field, as it is not an entry-level job.", "When you\u2019ve done all that you should know that there is a world of difference between working at a small company and doing ML than working at FAANG and doing ML. Likewise, there is a lot of variation between working on \u2018product\u2019 companies or at consultancies. Similarly, a bank and a start-up are worlds apart in terms of technology adaption.", "You\u2019re much more likely to be a jack of all trades at small companies , e.g. being asked to do data engineering, visualization and data science-y work as part of your day to day activities. Larger companies are more likely to hire specific staff that focuses on specific parts of the ML chain, and might even have different types of ML Engineers running around. If you\u2019re at a company that does many different projects you might never go deep into any framework, but get to experience many kinds of tools and domains. These are specific considerations to keep in mind when you\u2019re going to look for your first ML job.", "There\u2019s a slightly toxic notion in computer science that good developers hardly ever make mistakes and good code is without bugs. This is complete nonsense and it has led to an epidemic of imposter syndrome. Code is almost never written correct the first time and it is a process that highly depends on the time and money thrown at it. You grow a lot as a engineer in this field, but at the same time the field will grow faster than you. Being a ML Engineer is continuously having to learn new things on the job, and you give up some proficiency in coding by virtue of being in an interdisciplinary field.", "I regularly look back at code written a while ago and find that I made mistakes. Sometimes I rewrite it with the knowledge I have right now, or see if I can update an old model to a new version of an API. Some developers swear by completely tossing out dense code and rewriting it from scratch. Over time you develop a feeling to retroactively detect code smells and this is what engineering is about.", "Don\u2019t be afraid to make mistakes. Failing is natural, particularly with something as new as ML.", "Although this is by no means meant as a complete list, here are some resources that I feel would benefit those who want to break into this field.", "Some people hate them, others love them. Some use them as a way to self-promote themselves to the max while other people share absolutely brilliant ideas. I like meetups for the simple reason they\u2019ll allow you to cherry pick what kind of topics you want to learn about. Do you like Scala? AI in Healthcare? Meetups. More of a fan of Bayesian optimization? There\u2019s probably a meetup for that. Most of the meetups have gone fully online due to Corona and I expect this to continue through to the first half of 2021 at least.", "Protip: They\u2019re great for networking if you\u2019re looking to get an internship, job, or a mentor.", "There are a couple of other careers that should be mentioned to those considering moving into this field.", "A Machine Learning Engineer has a broad range of topics to understand from both Machine Learning and Software Development. Courses and certifications don\u2019t bring you there as of 2020. A formal training or experience in the field is still desirable, but I expect that it will become more accessible over time, similar to how Data Science became more open to newcomers. With that in mind, I feel that the best path for those looking to become ML Engineers without formal training would then be to enter Data Science or Software Engineering, and transfer from there while picking up the elements that make up ML Engineering.", "As the field moves fast I would like to focus on the ML Engineering skillset and tool landscape in a future post by data scraping job postings and doing some magic on that in order to come up with a more statistically sound analysis of what a ML Engineer could know. Wondering whether you should learn TensorFlow over PyTorch? Stay tuned for that :)", "With this post, I added to the growing body of Data Science articles. I hope you found it useful. I wanted to write something accessible to those not currently in the field and I hope my two cents will help you in figuring out whether this niche of ML and Engineering is for you.", "Your home for data science.
