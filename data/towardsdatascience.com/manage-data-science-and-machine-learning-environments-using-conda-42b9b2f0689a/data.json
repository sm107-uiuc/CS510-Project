These dependencies get updated over time and have different versions which can cause code to break if the wrong version is used. If you work with other team members, you also need to maintain the same local development environment on different computers for the code to run successfully. To create reproducible environments for projects, it\u2019s good practice to use an environment manager that keeps track of all the dependencies \u2014 like Conda.", "Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language.", "This article will help you develop a better workflow for managing your environments using Conda. Feel free to skip over any of the sections and jump to the code you need!", "If you don\u2019t already have Anaconda installed, follow the instructions here to install it for your operating system. You should see Anaconda-Navigator in your applications once it\u2019s installed.", "You can either create a brand new Conda environment for when you\u2019re starting a new project or recreate an existing environment from a yaml file.", "To create a new Conda environment, open up your terminal and type the following command:", "You will see the following prompt asking you to proceed. Type y to continue creating the environment.", "If you have an existing file containing project dependencies, you can recreate the environment by running the following:", "In this case, the first line of the yaml file will set the name of the environment. The name of an environment created with the following yaml file will be called datasci-env.", "Once your environment is created, you can activate it using:", "You can distinguish whether an environment is activated or not by looking at the left hand side of your terminal. You should see it change from base to datasci-env like below:", "We can check the version of python in our newly created Conda environment with the following command:", "Note: By default macOS Catalina has python as Python 2, so in order to run anything in Python 3 you must use python3", "This is what you\u2019ll see when running those commands in your terminal:", "This means this conda environment we just created is running version Python 3.7.3. If this is the python version you want, you can skip over the next section and move on to installing dependencies.", "If you need a different version of python for your environment you will need to specify the version at the time of installation. First, let\u2019s deactivate the environment we just created:", "If we want to create a Python 3.5 environment for example, we can run the following command:", "Below I\u2019m confirming that conda installed the proper version of python by activating the environment and running python3 --version.", "You can list all available environments using:", "First, make sure the correct environment is activated (it should appear in parentheses or brackets on the left side of your terminal). Installing dependencies in the wrong place can cause problems if you\u2019re working on multiple projects, so it\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re in the correct environment.", "Now you should be able to install your dependencies using conda install. Let\u2019s try it with some popular data science libraries:", "You\u2019ll receive another prompt asking you to proceed and after typing y you should see all of the packages install successfully.", "If you need to install a specific version of a package, you can just name the version when installing:", "This command above also works to downgrade libraries and packages after you\u2019ve installed them.", "If you want to uninstall a package, you can use the following:", "You can check all packages and versions in your current environment using conda list which will display the following:", "Notes:- If the conda install command doesn\u2019t work for the library you\u2019re trying to install you can try googling how to install that specific one.- Be careful of upgrading your python version when installing dependencies. You can see above that the installation upgraded my python version to 3.8.2.", "Now that we have an environment with a few dependencies installed, we can export them for versioning and reproducibility. Ideally, you\u2019ll be exporting these files to your project directory and pushing them to github to have a proper record of the version history. You can either export a txt or yaml file depending on your needs.", "First make sure you have the conda environment activated and that you\u2019re in the correct project directory in your terminal. To export the dependencies to a txt file, run the following:", "To export the dependencies to a yaml file, run the following:", "After running any of these commands, you should see a new file appear in your project\u2019s directory containing all of the dependencies. You should push this file to github so that your teammates or yourself at a later date can access and recreate the exact project environment.", "If you\u2019re working with a team, you might want to update the environment on your end at some point if others make changes by installing new dependencies. You can update an existing conda environment from a yaml file using:", "If you want to use conda environments inside JupyterLab, you\u2019ll need to create a specific kernel for that environment.", "First install jupyterlab andipykernel inside your environment, then create a new kernel:", "Note: the name of the kernel can be different from the environment but you should keep them the same so you can remember which kernel is linked to which environment.", "Now you should be able to launch JupyterLab from your terminal using the following command:", "And once JupyterLab is launched you can open up a new or existing notebook, click the kernels on the top right corner, and select your new kernel from the dropdown.
