It\u2019s not particularly easy to define Data Science as a whole, or subject, I\u2019ve done it in other articles:", "But here I want to talk about why I proclaimed my self \u201cData Scientist\u201d.", "As you may know, maybe you follow me here or LinkedIn or somewhere else, I call myself a Data Scientist. But Why? How did I become a Data Scientist? Why after studying Physics and Computer Engineering now I\u2019m suddenly a part of this field?", "These are questions that many of you maybe asking about other people or yourself. Why are you a Data Scientist?", "The thing here is that I did not study this in an \u201cformal school\u201d, so why should I have the right to call myself a Data Scientist?", "If you think about it, we are used to follow the path that if you graduate from a specific field like Mathematics, then you have the right to call yourself a Mathematician, but what happens when a new field is developing, and you are a part of that growth, and also there was no specific Bachelor or Graduate degree for becoming a part of this field?", "Well then you have to proclaimed yourself part of the field. And this is what I did.", "This may sound weird for a lot of people, but a self-proclamation is not that crazy. I\u2019m going to give you some examples before explaining my story.", "I\u2019m not going to bore you with a thousand words on Physics or the history of Science, I\u2019m just going to tell you a little story. One or two paragraphs, I promise.", "After the important distinction between Knowledge and Truth by Descartes, we can mark the beginning of science as we know it. But the scientists in the old era did not call themselves \u201cscientists\u201d back them. If you see the Principia by Newton:", "He mentions that he talks about Natural Philosophy. Not Physics. Actually that was the name of Physics back them. And while the concept of science was a thing in Newton\u2019s time, he consider himself more a philosopher than a scientist. The philosopher of nature.", "So, Newton, one of the most important physicists of history, did not study Physics in a formal school, he actually studied math, philosophy and more. But we call him a physicists too. I don\u2019t believe he proclaimed himself a physicist, we did that for him, but in the end is what we think he is.", "One of the things I don\u2019t talk a lot about is my passion for Lacanian Psychoanalysis. I\u2019m not going to give you a full picture of what it is right now, just an example related to the point I\u2019m trying to make.", "Lacan in his Proposition of 9 October 1967 on the Psychoanalyst of the School and in some of his essays, liberated radically the analytical practice of the corset of the institutional authorization and it was the execution of the death to the \u201chierarchy\u201d of the didactic and to the \u201cguarantee\u201d of the genealogy of the divans.", "The amplitude of its effects became evident when the same \u201cLacanians\u201d came to defend themselves from their own institutional orthodoxies, considering it necessary to restrict this approach in this way.", "In this Auters Ecrits he said:", "\u201cCe \u00e0 quoi il a \u00e0 veiller, c\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 s\u2019autoriser de lui-m\u00eame il n\u2019y ait que de l\u2019analyste\u201d", "\u201cOnly the analyst, that is, not anybody, is authorized only by himself\u201d", "This may be a little radical, but he is talking about that the only way to authorize someone to be an analyst is that the authorization comes from himself. This has a lot of implications, but the main point here, is that if you are able to follow a pah and acquire enough knowledge you can proclaim yourself an analyst.", "So as you can see it\u2019s not so insane to proclaim yourself a part of a study field. But we should be careful.", "I don\u2019t mean that if you read a medicine book you can just proclaim yourself a Medical Doctor, or if you know how to calculate the derivative of a function you can call yourself a Mathematician.", "We need to posses some knowledge and capabilities to be able to proclaim ourselves something. Normally we do this by taking a 4\u20135 years education of a field, with tests and a systematic knowledge path, but there a ways to be part of some fields without going to a college.", "And that\u2019s what I did. I studied, a lot, about data science (actually I did not know what was Data Science when I started learning all this things that took me to the field), machine learning, deep learning, programming, and more. From courses, self-study, projects and then I learned a lot from my data-related jobs.", "If you want to know a little more about myself you can read these:", "After getting all that self-education and knowledge then I proclaimed my self a Data Scientist. But why? Why not say I\u2019m doing data stuff?", "I think if we want to make this a serious field we need to have some standards, and a way to call ourselves. After defining data science in other articles, we should define \u201cData Scientist\u201d, and I\u2019ll do that right now:", "A Data Scientist is a person (or system?) in charge of analyzing business/organizations problems and give a structured solution starting by converting this problem into a valid and complete question, then using the scientific method, programming and computational tools develop codes that prepare, clean and analyze data to create models and answer the initial question.", "If you have any comments on my definition please let me know. I say system there too because we don\u2019t know what will happen in the future, maybe we get automated, I don\u2019t know.", "Also, I\u2019m talking about the scientific method because I think we should think of Data Science as a modern Science. I\u2019m more than happy to discuss this with you, just reach me. You can listen and read more about that here:", "Data science is awesome, and if you want to be a part of it you have to work hard and consistently. There\u2019s a lot of stuff to learn, I\u2019m learning everyday and I think I\u2019ll never stop learning.", "If you wan to call yourself a data scientist, do it with responsibility.", "Data Science requires a level of expertise and knowledge on several areas that I\u2019ve highlighted before.", "You\u2019ll need to know math, statistics, statistical learning, machine learning, now maybe deep learning too, programming (in several languages), have some insights about the business you\u2019re working for, be able to follow rigorous methods for extracting, analyzing and exploring data, create learning algorithms and models, be able to explain your results to different audiences and more.", "It sounds hard, but it can be done. Be sure you want that kind of responsibility before entering this area.", "What you\u2019ll do day by day will have tremendous impact in your organization, so you better do it well. You have to be prepared to fail, and fail again. To have an open mind, to be able to criticize yourself and your ideas.", "I\u2019m not going to lie, if you can do this and more, become a Data Scientist, it\u2019s a lot of fun.", "Thanks for reading this. I hope you found something interesting here :) If you have questions just follow me on Twitter:", "Your home for data science.
