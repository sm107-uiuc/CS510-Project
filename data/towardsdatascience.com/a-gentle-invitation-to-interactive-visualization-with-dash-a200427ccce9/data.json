It makes it easy to build an interactive visualization with simple reactive decorators like a dropdown, a slider bar, and markdown text data. We can even update the plots according to the input data with callbacks, and all these functions are available without Javascript or HTML directly. Plotly is a very powerful tool that enables us to make an informative and effective plot in a handy way and Dash can be considered as a stage for showcasing awesome visualization.", "Today I\u2019m going to show you how to create a dashboard with Plotly. And we\u2019ll make a time series line plot and add a dropdown and a slider bar interacting with the plot. There is nice documentation on how to use this library, but I find it could be hard to read the example codes and utilize them at first. So this could be a kind bridge for you to understand how to use Dash with Plotly.", "To build a dashboard, we need to install some packages as follows.", "As I said above, dash-core-components allows us to build not only graphs but also a dropdown and a text box so that we can update the components accordingly. dash-html-components enables us to use HTML & CSS with Python. It helps us to place HTML components such as Div, H1, and H2 on our dashboard.", "If this is your first time using Dash and HTML syntax, it can be a bit complex and hard to read. Therefore I\u2019d recommend you to take the following script as a skeleton guide to Dash. From now on, what we\u2019re going to do is filling this out step by step.", "First things first, we import the libraries. You can add other libraries as you need. And then we initialize Dash by calling the Dash class. This is like putting a blank whiteboard on our table and what we are doing is building up additional applications on that board.", "Now let\u2019s bring some ingredients from the CSV file with pandas. The dataset we\u2019re going to use is the Apple stock price data which is available here.", "I won\u2019t cover the details on Plotly itself, but you can find a nice tutorial for Plotly from this video if it\u2019s necessary. You can also learn how to make a 3D plot or Choropleth Map in the series of the video. Here we\u2019ll make a line plot which shows fluctuations in the stock price.", "Now, it\u2019s time for dash-html-components to come into play. We first put a division and then bring the graph inside it. id is giving a name to this component so that we can call it by its name. You\u2019ll understand what this is for later. And then we make a server to run in step 6. If we set the debug mode equals true, we can easily change and update the app while the server is running.", "Let\u2019s save this script with the name of app.py and import it on the terminal (or anaconda prompt). Note that the working directory should be the same with where you saved the file.", "If there is no typo or syntax error, you\u2019ll see the localhost address. You can copy and paste it or you can just type localhost:8050 on a new web tab.", "We can also have additional components such as putting text data just like HTML. You can find what kind of elements are available here. Let\u2019s put a simple heading and a paragraph on our page.", "On top of the graph, I\u2019m going to put one more division and add a header and a paragraph inside it. We have two major components, html.Div and dcc.Graph. Inside html.Div, there are two additional components, header ( html.H1 ) and a paragraph ( html.P ). We can change the margin of the components or the background color with the style attribute. It should be designated in a dictionary format supporting CSS properties.", "Please pay extra care where the parenthesis starts and ends. It\u2019s important to understand the range of the paragraph for each component. As there are so many parenthesizes and square brackets, it can be confusing at first. And It\u2019s so easy to make a syntax mistake as well.", "Put this code at step 4 in our template and see the result. We can simply check the outcome by pressing F5 if the server isn\u2019t shut down.", "Now I hope you get the idea of what the dash components and the HTML components are. How to put multiple components and how they go along with together.", "Let\u2019s try making a dropdown on our dashboard this time. We\u2019re going to make another plot which changes its y-axis according to the given option. By the documentation of dash components, we can putDropdown as follows.", "As you can see, the options should be in the format of a dictionary. In our case, the options will be the columns only with the continuous variables, from the 2nd column to the 10th. With the list comprehension, we can make the option dictionary in just one line.", "Now instead of the HTML components, we\u2019re going to put the dropdown component at the bottom of the plot. Take a look at the bold font first because others are just for decorating the major two applications.value is the default value of the dropdown.", "And just as what we did before, we can replace this code at step 4 in our template and check the outcome.", "To update the graph according to the choice of the dropdown, we need to make a connection between input data (the dropdown) and output data (the graph). This will be done by adding a callback function in step 5.", "Do you remember what id we gave to each component? plot and opt. Therefore we can call them with their name as shown above. We take the input data from the options by the name of opt and give the output to the line plot by the name of plot.", "So we take the input data and then return the output as we want by creating an update function. What is our input data here? It\u2019s the name of the feature variable selected from the dropdown, and we are to make it as the y-axis of our second line plot. As there is nothing to be changed with the trace_1, we can simply add trace_2 to the data list. Now if we put this code at step 5 and rerun app.py, the result will be is shown below.", "I\u2019d like to briefly talk about a callback before we move on to the next section. Because it\u2019s one of the most frequently used functions while programming any kind of applications. In a nutshell, a callback is a function that is executed later when it gets the real execution command and it\u2019s usually for the purpose of updating. Callback functions don\u2019t work right after they get the command. These people are kind of lazy. They will do their work after the other command lines are executed and we call them back again with the real execution command.", "See how our update_figure() works. This function does his work not right after we import this app but when we give the actual input signal to it by \u201ccalling back.\u201d This is what a callback function is. It\u2019s totally fine you use this without understanding but I hope you get the rough idea here. You can also find more details from this article.", "Lastly, let\u2019s try a range slider. We\u2019ll add a year range slider to the plot, and it\u2019s very similar to dropdowns. Let\u2019s check the documentation of dash components first.", "I think you can easily get the idea by this time. The key point here is how to make a mark dictionary. As the date period starts from (Feb 17 2015) to (Feb 17 2017), I\u2019d like to add 7 marks between the period as follows.", "Now we can simply put the range slider at the dropdown place. I\u2019ll name it as slider this time. min and max are the minimum and the maximum of the slider and value is the default setting of the slider. Again, all the other parts are designing the HTML components with CSS style.", "After making a slider, what will be the next step? Connecting it to the plot! Again we\u2019ll take the input data from the slider and return the output to the plot. But this time, there is a small trick here. Did you notice that the default value of the slider is a list with two values? Please check the code box above again. value = [3, 4] Different from the dropdown component, the range slider takes two values in a list. Therefore when we get the input data from the slider, there will be two values of the starting and ending value (X[0] , X[1])", "Now we\u2019ll filter the data and update the plot with the given period. If you reload the web page again, you\u2019ll see the same result with me.", "I think we covered quite a lot of things so far. From putting a graph to adding a callback. Now why don\u2019t we bring it all together? I\u2019d recommend you to review the script below step by step. You can combine all the components of the graph, the dropdown and the slider at step 4 just like replacing and changing modules.", "Are you ready to see how our first dashboard looks like? \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c BOOM!!", "Great work! Did you enjoy building a dashboard? I hope now you become comfortable reading and understanding other Dash code examples. Dash provides such a nice guide so feel free to explore the sites on your own. You can also check other stuff available in Dash by Plotly.", "So far our application is locally hosted on your machine. To make it available to other people, we need to deploy it on the web. There are two choices you can take, App authorization and deploying it to Heroku. The first one requires us to install the dash-auth package an there are two different types of authentication, HTTP Basic Auth or Plotly OAuth. You can follow this tutorial.", "Another way is by using the hosting platforms such as Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud Platform and so on. Heroku is the easiest way for deploying and you can follow this tutorial. The other platforms are just the same with Heroku.", "Beside dropdown, we can also add other components such as text area or uploading data. I recommend you to explore what kind of dash components are available. You can also add as many HTML components as you want and design your board in a much fancier way with CSS properties. If you need to learn some basics of HTML & CSS, you can find a great tutorial from this video.", "Thank you for reading and I hope you found this post interesting. If there\u2019s anything need to be corrected, please share your insight with us. I\u2019m always open to talk so feel free to leave comments below and share your thoughts. I also share interesting and useful resources on LinkedIn so feel free to follow and reach me out. I\u2019ll be back again with another interesting story next time!", "Your home for data science.
