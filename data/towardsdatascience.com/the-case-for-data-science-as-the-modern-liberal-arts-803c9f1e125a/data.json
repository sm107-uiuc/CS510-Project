Back in a time when our understanding of natural phenomena was limited, it took integrated training across the arts, sciences, and humanities to be able to make sense of the world. As we began to understand more about specific fields, we required more depth of expertise to make advances in that field.", "Modern science has moved back toward benefiting from a liberal arts education. It\u2019s why data science should be considered as the modern liberal arts. The breadth of expertise required of data scientists is often criticized as the kind of training that simply can\u2019t exist. In reality, however, the liberal arts have provided broad integrated education to young minds around the world, and modern data science is the emergence of a new form of liberal arts careers.", "Data science has been widely accepted as one of the hottest jobs of the 21st century. To be good at your job, you\u2019re expected to be an expert in computer science, statistics, data engineering, data visualization, executive presentations, and persuasive writing. The world is flustered at all the expectations, largely because they expect \u201cexpertise\u201d in all of that. What the technical world is coming to terms with is that when you have such breadth of application, you end up not knowing where to apply your skills. Similarly, when you are presented with an abundance of data, you have to systematically cull through it all to make sense of it.", "When I started college at the University of Puget Sound, I walked onto a small liberal arts college without a lick of understanding of what that means. Four years later, I took classes in history, writing, biology, chemistry, math, computer science, and technology & society. I even took a class called \u201cThe Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence\u201d.", "Spoiler alert: it\u2019s called \u201cthe search\u201d because we still haven\u2019t found it.", "The fundamental skills in the liberal arts are the ability to read, synthesize, and write. Damn, talk about a broad skill that you can apply all over the place. But after training on how to hone research, sifting through thousands of pages of material, to then build a cohesive and persuasive argument, I started to get pretty good at it. Eventually, I could craft a narrative about the cultural norms of the Manhattan Project as easily as I could about an organic chemistry synthesis.", "As we move further into the data-driven sciences, the field looks more and more like the liberal arts. In the past, almost all data had to be collected before scientists were able to make a \u201cdata-driven\u201d decision. We did this largely through hypothesis testing as we do in the scientific method. With the modern explosion of data in every part of our lives, we\u2019re moving more and more towards the need to explore data that\u2019s already there.", "At the advent of the printing press, the world started storing massive amounts of data in the form of books and the written word. To make sense of all that, and the natural world around us, the liberal arts taught how to interpret, synthesize, and communicate.", "Every day, we write more about the intersection of data science and effective communication. How do we interpret, synthesize, and effectively communicate all the great stuff we are discovering through our data wrangling, machine learning, and artificial intelligence approach to life?", "I\u2019ll go out on a limb and make a claim. The perfect data science degree would look like an English degree, heavy on writing and reading. It should be paired with a minor in statistics/math/computer science and a second minor in a field to provide domain knowledge (e.g. biology, chemistry, marketing, physics, etc).", "Once a student has mastered the ability to write effectively (code or essays), they then have the ability to tell a story. Effective data science is only as good as our ability to communicate our results. Once you bring the ability to craft and write a story together with domain expertise, you get a potent ability to lead towards data-driven decisions.", "The world needs more data scientists. However, our current definition of who makes a good data scientist is too narrow. Lets bring in the history and English majors, the writers, the crafters, and the people who spend their lives culling through massive sets of data with their own network of neurons. (Not to be confused with neural networks). We spend a lot of time and energy to train engineers to communicate more effectively. Lets spend as much energy training liberal arts majors how to write code and derive algorithms.", "My name is Alexander Titus and I suffer from wanderlust. I\u2019m often lost in thought, lost in the woods, and more often than not lost in both at the same time. My mission in life is to redefine career success to include stints of both personal and professional pursuit. You can find me on LinkedIn and Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
