Every sub-field within computer science \u2014 from data science and AI to designing webpages \u2014 requires an understanding of dealing with dates.", "Because they\u2019re so messy (simple task: try to make a program that finds the date 64 days after date n without any external libraries), with complexities abound \u2014 the length of dates, leap years, sub-objects nested within parent ones \u2014 when dealing with datetime objects, you must know these 6 functions and methods.", "Note: This article discusses datetime in Python.", "Converting strings to dates is common \u2014 to access the properties of a datetime object, the string representing the date must be converted to one. Unfortunately, datasets or other date sources almost never come with datetime objects that can be handily accessed. The best library for converting strings to dates is dateutil, which can automatically infer the location of days, months, and years, which need to be specified with other libraries.", "dateutil can accommodate a wide variety of dates, where each of the commands one each line automatically infers the location of objects and yields the same result (datetime.datetime(2040, 7, 3, 0, 0)):", "If a human can tell the date from a string, then dateutil can. Using this library, you can avoid the annoying date-object mapping that you would need to perform through conventional datetime-converting methods. This is especially helpful when not all dates come in the same format, often the case with real-world data.", "To access the current time, use datetime.datetime.now(). This returns a datetime object returning what time it is in your region, down to the microsecond.", "An alternative is datetime.datetime.today(), which returns the same information but with less precision. This may be more suitable in cases of high traffic where the slight improvement in computation time could prove valuable.", "A timedelta object is returned when you find the difference between two datetime objects. For instance, to return the difference between July 3rd, 1938 to May 30th, 2020, the following code would be run:", "Simply using the minus operator interaction between two datetime objects will create a timedelta object, which in this case is saved to the variable delta.", "The timedelta object has several attributes:", "You can even add timedelta objects to regular datetime objects:", "Calendar is a library built on top of datetime, and provides handy calendar-related functions, helping bypass needing to manually keep track of leap years and the number of days in a month. In order to access iterative functions, a Calendar object must first be created.", "The parameter firstweekday is set to 0, indicating Monday, but can also be set to 6 (Sunday) or any day in between.", "Consider .itermonthdates(), which takes in a month and a year and returns an iterator which contains all the dates in the month, including any before and after it needed to complete a full week.", "Calendar has many other functions to return a wide variety of iterators, as well as other features such as printing out HTML or text calendars, which can be accessed at their documentation page here:", "Arrow is a Python library whose humanize() attribute stands out. This method allows humans to interact with and interpret date objects more seamlessly. First, an Arrow object must be created (datetime objects can be accommodated and converted into Arrow objects).", "Calling time.humanize() will yield a string with a human-readable message describing how long ago time was from right now.", "One can imagine that this feature would be especially helpful to UI-designing developers, who could use it to display messages like \u201cJosh sent this message two minutes ago\u201d or \u201cYou edited this document a year ago\u201d. Arrow can also handle dates in the future.", "Named in honor of Back to the Future, Delorean is primarily used because of its convenient natural language understanding, meaning ease of human navigation with date manipulation. To begin, create a Delorean object, which can accommodate datetime objects:", "If you wanted to get the date of next week, next Friday, last Tuesday, or any number of understandable commands, simply call the appropriate function:", "This can provide easier and more intuitive manipulation of dates, both for you and for those reading your code.", "Hopefully, these libraries and methods can aid you in your quest to manipulate dates and times!", "Your home for data science.
