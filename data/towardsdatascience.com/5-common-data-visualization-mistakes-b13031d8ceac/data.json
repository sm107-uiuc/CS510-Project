It\u2019s the best way to make sense of and communicate data to others. While a powerful tool, it is only as useful as the hands they are in. In visualizing data, as in any other field \u2014 there are rules, best practices, and guidelines. Of course, there are also mistakes.", "I wanted to go over five of the most common mistakes that I\u2019ve experienced and seen. I\u2019ll focus on how these mistakes look in GGplot, but the universality of data visualization means that these lessons are applicable to other tools as well \u2014 Python, Excel, Tableau, etc.", "You want your visualization to make sense as a standalone image. The reason for this is because if your visualization ends up being shared, you want less room for misinterpretation. This means you\u2019ll need to add sufficient context \u2014 at the minimum a descriptive title and good axis labels.", "Because a default graph does not include a title, and your x- and y- axis titles are named after variables, a common mistake is forgetting to update your titles.", "Let\u2019s look at a simple example of a ggplot somebody might make:", "If you saw the visualization above, you might be able to deduce that it\u2019s showing vehicle data by looking at the relationship between miles per gallon (mpg) versus horsepower (hp). Overall, the data is a bit ambiguous and the axis titles are small and hard to read.", "How can we improve this? Let\u2019s use more descriptive titles and increase the font size:", "A rule of thumb when visualizing and displaying data is thinking about how to get a point across in the simplest terms possible. Oftentimes, this means removing irrelevant data that detracts from the main point. Oftentimes, I see people including way too many data labels.", "The example below is an exaggeration, but we typically want to utilize labels to highlight a point. Too many, and it becomes noise. In this case, we only label outliers so that the reader is able to takeaway a key point.", "This mistake goes hand in hand with the previous one.", "If your legend takes up a lot of room, it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re using too many categories. Think of ways to reduce the number of categories so that your legend contains 10 items at most. This might involve grouping categories into an \u201cother\u201d bucket, or coming up with another way of categorizing/displaying categories.", "In the visualization below, it\u2019s impossible to match each dot with its corresponding color \u2014 different categories becomes a waste of space.", "The clear solution here is to just label the categories in the graph directly rather than relying on the reader to match on colors:", "This is the most subjective mistake on the list, but typically you want to shoot for a resolution that allows the reader to digest the data more easily. In RStudio, this is as simple as using the \u201cZoom\u201d button in the image pane and resizing the image until you find a resolution that you like.", "In the example below, I\u2019ve created the same graph with two different resolutions \u2014 the first graph is a bit cramped and harder to read, while the second graph expands the graph vertically to give some more space between the labels and bars.", "Hopefully, this article has helped you with some of your visualization woes. Anyone who is new to data visualization is bound to make mistakes early on, so hopefully, this article has a takeaway or two that you can use for your future graphs!", "If you\u2019re interested in learning more about visualization, I have written another article going over some useful tips that I\u2019ve learned over the years:", "Your home for data science.
