Because of this, it is essential to explain it easily using concrete examples which they can understand. This can be easily achieved in three easy steps; give a definition for AI, provide examples and point them towards fun resources which they can explore.", "First of all, let\u2019s start from the definition. AI can be defined as a computer program which is capable of performing a task which requires intelligence. This task is usually something which a human or an intelligent animal can accomplish, such as learning, planning, problem-solving, etc.", "Second, the most obvious example to showcase AI is in games. Children are experts at playing games, and it is probably the single most popular activity with kids of any age.", "A classic game which is fun and requires no introduction is without doubt Pac-Man. The game takes place in a maze. The player controls Pac-Man whose task is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four coloured ghosts. What\u2019s interesting to note is that the four ghosts have their own personality controlled by the central AI system. Blinky (red) is the leader and consistently follows Pac-Man. Pinky (pink) is a slow ghost which tries to ambush Pac-Man by predicting where he is likely to go. Inky (cyan) is a shy ghost and tends to follow Blinky. Finally, Clyde (orange) is a coward ghost which escapes as soon as Pac-Man is closing by. Pac-Man is a simple game, but the AI\u2019s actions can be seen in practice and easily understood. Similar AI mechanics can be found in most games. In football games such as FIFA, the opposite team is controlled by the AI. In simulation games such as \u201cThe Sims\u201d, most of the other characters are handled by the AI. Practically all games use some AI!", "Finally, after understanding what it is and realising that we all use it regularly, the time has come to have some fun with it too. There are loads of resources online which educators and children can use. The following is a non-exhaustive list of some of the most interesting:", "AI can be so much fun, and the resources to teach it are readily available on the web. Furthermore, in the past months, the Department of AI at the Faculty of ICT within the University of Malta released a book entitled \u201cAI in Education \u2014 A Practical Guide for Teachers and Young People\u201d. The book was distributed freely to all the schools with the support of the Ministry of Education. It contains further examples and fun exercises of how to teach AI concepts to children of any age. The Malta Union Of Teachers too organised a short course on \u201cAI in the Classroom\u201d aimed at helping educators understand AI and subsequently use it in their class. There are loads of resources which one can tap to start using AI in the classroom.", "AI is most probably the most powerful tool ever invented by man. It is dubbed by many as being the new electricity. Because of this, the only way to design the future is to work in AI. That is why we have to teach the younger generation to embrace it and use it as a tool. Only if we do so, can we hope to prepare our younger generation for the challenges of tomorrow!", "Originally published by the \u201cMalta Union of Teachers\u201d.

If you enjoyed the article, please follow me on \ud83d\udc26 Twitter, \ud83d\udd17 LinkedIn, \ud83d\udcf7 Instagram or \ud83d\ude0a Facebook.", "Prof Alexiei Dingli is a Professor of AI at the University of Malta. He has been conducting research and working in the field of AI for more than two decades, assisting different companies to implement AI solutions. His work has been rated World Class by international experts and he won several local and international awards (such as those by the European Space Agency, the World Intellectual Property Organization and the United Nations to name a few). He has published several peer-reviewed publications and forms part of the Malta.AI task-force which was setup by the Maltese government, aimed at making Malta one of the top AI countries in the world.", "Your home for data science.
