I think I now have over 200 of the little guys, mostly obtained from blind bags.", "Oh and I also take photos of them which I share on Instagram!", "Transfer learning is when you use a pre-trained neural network, and use it for a different dataset.", "Since I have a small dataset, I wanted to utilize ImageNet\u2019s pre-trained images as it has many pictures of people and clothing, so it should be easier to determine the features of the minifigures. With the similarities in human features and clothing of the minifigures, I would categorize my dataset to be similar to what is present in ImageNet.", "According to Udacity, if the new dataset is small and similar to the original training data, you have to change the neural network as follows:", "You will see how I have done this later in the code.", "I took photos of my own minifigures to form the dataset. As I only had a limited amount of them (over 200), I took photos of each minifigure from different perspectives to get more photos for the dataset.", "To make sure the CNN doesn\u2019t get exposed to items that aren\u2019t as easily distinguishable between male and female, I made sure to take off any accessories that the minifigures were wearing such as these:", "I also didn\u2019t include the minifigures that weren\u2019t human like these guys:", "In the end, my dataset looked something like this:", "I first loaded in the libraries:", "And checked if Cuda was available so I can utilize Google Colab\u2019s GPU.", "I saved my finished dataset as a zip file into Dropbox, where the contents were split into a Train/Test folder with another Boy/Girl folder inside.", "I then generated a download link so that I could use !wget and !unzip to load the images into Google Colab.", "As the images I took had a large size, I needed to transform them so that the input data could work with what the pre-trained model expected (in my case, VGG16). I also used PyTorch\u2019s ImageFolder class so that I could load the data from the train and test folders I created in the zip file.", "Here you can see how I allocated the photos into a train and test set.", "Create DataLoaders for the train and test datasets:", "Now let\u2019s visualize a batch of training data.", "This will be accomplished by loading in a pre-trained VGG16 model.", "As described earlier, the pre-trained model\u2019s classifier doesn\u2019t work with what we are trying to achieve because it\u2019s last layer outputs 1000 features, and we only want 2 (since we only have two classes of Boy and Girl).", "So we need to remove the last layer and replace it with a linear classifier of our own.", "Now the classifier is what we want!", "Specify the loss function and optimizer.", "Below, you can see the accuracy in determining each gender class from testing the trained model on previously unseen data. In order words, we are predicting the gender of the minifigure using our trained model, and comparing it to the actual gender (target).", "The results seem pretty good! Out of the twenty sample images tested, only one of them predicted the wrong gender. Keep in mind that I only used a small dataset, so the results would likely change if I had a larger one.", "If you are interested in reading my code in more detail, please visit my Github below.", "This was a fun project where I was able to apply what I learned from Udactiy\u2019s deep learning nanodegree. I hope to write about more of my projects as I progress through the course so stay tuned!", "If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave your feedback below.
