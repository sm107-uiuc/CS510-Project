How does it differ from the event last year? Which countries have the fastest growing startup scene? Which industries are the\u00a0hottest\u00a0and\u00a0which\u00a0are\u00a0the\u00a0\u201cshrinking\u201d\u00a0ones?", "To answer these questions, let\u2019s have a look at the startup participant data. Lots of the findings are expected, but some are actually\u00a0surprising.", "(The dataset and Jupyter notebook is available at the end of this article)", "In terms of total startup participants, it is gradually growing \u2014 24 more companies participating compared with 2018. The number of countries participating, 58, is surprisingly the same across two years, given that the country list is not the same.", "Among the top participating countries, India and Malaysia have the most drastic change \u2014 India has 20.8% fewer companies participating (-22), while the Philippines has 117% growth in participants (+27). Hong Kong and Singapore keep on being the top 2 in the region.", "Among all the countries, Singapore contributes the most to the number of new participants (+29, or 3.6% of total participants). RISE this year suffers from the biggest drop in the number of Indian participants (-22, or -2.8% of total).", "There are significantly more companies with scale over USD 1M joining the conference, from 92 companies in 2018 to 135 companies in 2019, which may imply more funded startups are considering RISE as an important platform.", "AI & machine learning being one of the hottest startup industries, of course \u2014 but how hot is it? The number of AI startups participating in the conference grows the most among all industries (+24, 40.7% increase compared with 2018). Enterprise software solution, Fintech, and Travel & hospitality are also so fastest growing sector within the conference.", "On the other hand, eCommerce & retail suffers the largest drop (-24, or -23.3% vs 2018) in the number of participants. If we look further into the breakdown, we can see that above half of the net -24 comes from India. Perhaps more research/survival analysis could be done on the recent eCommerce space in India (not enough promotion? too much competition? or doing too well already?).", "Although AI is the most trending industry in RISE 2019, Singapore and Philippines Fintech is a sector we see the most growth in participants, especially for the Philippines which has 3 times more Fintech companies joining the event. Singapore AI and Hong Kong IoT + AI are also some fastest growing sector in the conference, as expected.", "Other than India, the US also has much fewer eCommerce companies joining the conference. I wonder how much of this could be attributed to the trade war between China and the state.", "There is a surprising loser \u2014 Hong Kong Fintech. Hong Kong has long been known as a financial hub in Asia, and has always been a natural incubator of Fintech companies within the region. And now Singapore is growing by 85.7% while Hong Kong is shrinking by 22.9%.", "Even though the number of Fintech companies joining from Hong Kong (27 companies) is still higher than that from Singapore (26 companies), it is hard to say if it will still be the case for next year. Hong Kong keeps losing its edge in different aspects compared with Singapore in terms of government support, political stability, talents, etc. As a Hong Konger I hope Hong Kong can keep on being a good environment for growing Fintech or business in general, but the truth seems to suggest otherwise.", "The table above shows the number of startups that are \u201cretained\u201d by RISE. Column 2018_retent shows how many companies joined RISE 2017 and then RISE 2018. The same applies to column 2019_retent. We can see that RISE has been doing an increasingly good job in retaining startups in Hong Kong, with more than 20% of the companies joining again this year.", "Enterprise software solutions and Fintech have the most number of companies rejoining the conference this year. It is worth to note that Travel & hospitality has the most drastic increase in retention rate (from 2.3% to 12.1%). Is RISE a particularly effective platform for Travel & hospitality startups to promote themselves and interact with potential investors?", "The dataset contains some other interesting attributes such as \u201celevator pitch\u201d and the availability of the social media profiles of the participating startups, which I wrote an article called Cultural nuances in startup last year. And with the 2-year dataset, it may be interesting to do some survival analysis or study the effect of participating in RISE. I will check my friend who volunteered at the conference to see if there are some interesting angles we can further research.", "Your home for data science.
