By providing good visualization dashboards, they make it easier to:", "Tableau and Microsoft Power BI are the leading products in the data visualization and business intelligence software space. Tableau recently sold to SalesForce for $15.7 Billion. Apparently there\u2019s a lot of value in making it easier for companies to visualize their data. \ud83d\ude01", "Tableau is in demand. My previous analysis on the Most in Demand Skills for Data Scientists showed that Tableau was the eighth most commonly listed technology skill in data scientist job listings.", "Tableau is the easiest technology on this list to quickly become proficient with \u2014 assuming you already know Excel. I suggest you invest a little time with Tableau so you can add it to your tool belt and your resume.", "With Tableau, you can make impressive visualizations quickly. It\u2019s fun and easy to use.\ud83d\ude00", "Without further ado, let\u2019s look at the most important things to know when starting out with Tableau to set you up for success. I\u2019ll demonstrate with a dataset of New Belgium Brewing beer ratings that I scraped from Beer Advocate. \ud83c\udf7a", "2. You import data in the Data Source tab. Drag and drop data sources to join or union them. Tableau has connectors for almost any data source you can think of.", "3. You do most of your work in worksheets. Each worksheet is in a tab at the bottom of the window, like in a spreadsheet program.", "Drag variables from the left side Data bar to Rows and Columns fields at the top of the sheet.", "The view is the main visualization area of the worksheet. You can also drag variables to the view or the Marks card so they show up in the view.", "4. Tableau tries to be helpful. It infers the type of data based on a column\u2019s contents. It provides helpful little symbols next to each variable name to represent numeric, string, geo, boolean, and date data types. Tableau splits your data columns into dimensions and measures.", "Dimensions are qualitative (categorical) variables\u2014they include strings and dates. They are discrete, by default. Discrete variables are colored blue.", "Measures are quantitative (numeric) variables that you can sum and average. They are continuous, by default. Continuous variables are colored green.", "Tableau will assume you want to sum measures any time you use them, by default. You can change the aggregation function with a right click on that variable.", "For more discussion on the differences between discrete and continuous variables for data science, see my article here. For more discussion of variables in Tableau, see the docs.", "5. The Marks card controls many visualization aspects. Drag variables from the left side bar to the Marks card to control color, text, tooltips, and more. Use it after your rows and columns are set.", "6. There are many chart options\u200a\u2014\u200aTableau makes suggestions in the expandable Show Me menu to the right. Suggestions are based on the current variables used in the worksheet.", "Know that if you click on a chart option, Tableau might rearrange the variables in your worksheet.", "7. The formatting can be changed. Right click on whatever you want to change and you\u2019ll see options. Within the right click menu you can format things.", "8. Filtering data is as easy as dragging a variable to the filter area. Right click on the pill and choose Show Filter to create an interactive filter.", "9. You can create a group, set, or calculated field by right clicking on a variable. These options allow you to group data and find more insights.", "10. You can make dashboards in a snap. Just drag and drop finished worksheets onto a new dashboard. Then viewers can sort and filter your charts, but they can\u2019t break your dashboards. \ud83d\ude01", "You can play with the dashboard I created to explore New Belgium beer ratings from beer advocate on Tableau Public here.", "You can clone the Jupyter notebook with the Python code I used to scrape the ratings at GitHub. Notice that I excluded beers with fewer than 300 ratings.", "Tableau is great for creating spiffy dashboards with visualizations quickly. Tableau isn\u2019t great for machine learning. You can get a trends line that will show you an R2. But anything else will take some acrobatics. \ud83e\udd38\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "You can play with Tableau Public for free, but creating data visualization with private data will require Tableau Desktop. And that will cost you $70 a month as of late 2019. Both Tableau products are downloadable programs for MacOS and Windows.", "I suggest you download Tableau Public and play with it. You can muck around by dragging and dropping \u2014 and liberal use of the undo button. \ud83d\ude09 However, it\u2019s nice to know what you\u2019re doing and to be able to make changes quickly. Hopefully this guide has whet your appetite to learn more. I first learned Tableau with Kirill Eremenko\u2019s excellent Udemy course: Tableau 10 A-Z. It\u2019s $9.99 as of this writing.", "If you want to make similar interactive visualizations using Python, I\u2019m a fan of Plotly. I wrote an intro to using Plotly here. Tableau is a lot faster, though.", "I hope you found this guide useful. If you did, please share it on your favorite social media so other folks can find it, too. \ud83d\udc4d", "I write about Python, Docker, data science, and other tech topics. If any of that\u2019s of interest to you, follow me and read more here.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "I write about data science.
