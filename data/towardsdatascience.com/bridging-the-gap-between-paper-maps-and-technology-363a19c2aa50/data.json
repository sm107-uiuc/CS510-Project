For the last few years, I\u2019ve been struggling to find a way to bring the old-school tactile pleasure of unfolding and using a map to the electronic age. There\u2019s a certain satisfaction that comes from drawing on a paper map to plan out a trip, or mark a route, or simply find patterns in the landscape. The concept started with me wanting to help kids learn geography and have a bit of a fun doing it by drawing on a map. I remember as a kid our teacher gave us an outline of a map and asked us to color where in the country resources like iron, cotton etc. were produced. This had a big impact on my ability to think spatially.", "After a few fits and starts, I developed an app that pairs that desire to draw with our recently acquired instinct to zoom and pan (and apply emojis to everything \ud83d\ude02). Mapcaso is a map-based learning platform for kids of all ages. It helps children learn geography by doodling right on the map and explore the world. Adults can have fun too taking quizzes and marking travel plans, hiking trails, or a million other things.", "I began by building a client side SPA app. My choice of framework was VueJS. I really liked its ability to prototype quickly and I knew it had a strong reputation for its developer ecosystem and support compared to other SPA frameworks like Angular and ReactJS. For the map framework I knew I needed a sharp basemap with good detail and a sense of familiarity, which led me to choose Google Maps. I wanted advanced drawing tools and a more flexible map library that allowed adding plugins and additional layer types. I chose to run with LeafletJS. I also built the web app responsive (which would pay off significantly later) and used Google\u2019s Material Design framework and guidelines to make it easy to use for a variety of audiences and devices.", "There are a wide variety of databases that support spatial functionality such as Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL in the relational space. Cassandra, CouchDB and some other NoSQL database options do as well, but I decided to use MongoDB. I also did not want to dedicate a lot of time to hosting and preparing to scale my database infrastructure. mLab appeared as the natural choice: it\u2019s a database-as-a-Service platform for MongoDB. Furthermore, MongoDB plays nicely with GeoJSON: the format I used to store and serve spatial data.", "Out of many server-side programming languages I have used, C# .Net has rigid, strongly typed support which is great when you are writing strong API code that has the potential to be used by various entities. The only thing that I did not like was the fact that .Net applications historically needed to run on Windows servers. But thankfully Microsoft has made fantastic strides in embracing Linux in the last couple of years and came out with .Net Core which supports hosting both on Windows and Linux servers. This made it the best choice to develop Mapcaso\u2019s API. I used Amazon\u2019s S3 service to host static images and other static assets. I also needed task scheduling to manage sending user newsletters, running database maintenance and so forth. I relied on AWS Lambda for this.", "Containerization makes deployments across disparate environments very easy and provides good stability and availability of the application. Docker and Kubernetes are the two popular ones. But Visual Studio had built-in Docker support so I utilized Docker containers. Finally, I deployed my web app and the API in Docker containers and hosted them via Amazon\u2019s ECS. This whole process helped me learn a lot about DevOps and I have great respect for the engineers who work around the clock to keep applications running smoothly.", "I wanted to go mobile after I had my minimum viable product. I was a development team of one: so it made sense to build once and use the same code base to deploy mobile apps. Luckily, I had already developed my web app responsive to work well with desktop, tablets and various mobile screen sizes. I used Cordova which is a wrapper to build mobile apps with HTML, CSS & JS. I wrapped my VueJS client project with Cordova and after some Android and iOS build struggles I was able to build successfully for both platforms. I then signed up for the Google and Apple developer programs and published the Mapcaso app on both their app stores.", "Building and maintaining this app has been a great learning experience for me, and I feel the functionality of this app is poised to be a supplement for traditional education for a wide audience. Especially now, when many children are taking classes remotely and being home schooled, I think Mapcaso can be a fun and free way to creatively engage your kids. While you can keep your content private, you can also give back to the Mapcaso community by creating and sharing doodles and new quiz content on the platform and social media: helping others learn more about your country, state, or our world!", "Let\u2019s not forget that the world is a big, amazing place even during these trying times. We can let our minds wander virtually around the globe and be creative and connect online!", "Get the Free Android app on Google Play Store", "Get the Free iOS app on Apple Store Download", "Your home for data science.
