If you haven\u2019t, go check it out here: https://www.electricbrain.io/blog/why-measuring-accuracy-is-hard-and-very-important-part-1", "In the second article in this series, I discussed the most common and usual scenarios that get in the way of measuring accuracy of models. If you haven\u2019t read the article, give it a look here: https://www.electricbrain.io/blog/why-measuring-accuracy-is-hard-and-important-part-2", "In the third article in this series, I discussed the more difficult and unusual scenarios that come up in measuring accuracy of models. If you haven\u2019t read the article, give it a read here: https://www.electricbrain.io/blog/why-measuring-accuracy-is-hard-and-important-part-3", "Now in the fourth and final installment of this series, I\u2019m going to get to the real meat \u2014 the information we all crave. How do we do it better? With all these problems that can come up in measuring accuracy, how do we avoid pitfalls and measure accuracy better? The unfortunate answer is \u2014 it depends. There is no easy answer and no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem. So instead of just giving you a few tips and suggestions (there will be some of those), I instead want to give you a framework for thinking about how to measure a model. Choosing the metrics to measure your model with is an intellectual exercise. The best route forward may involve several different metrics \u2014 different numbers used for different reasons.", "In general, our process has a few steps:", "Now we will go through each of these steps.", "The first step in measuring your model is to define the purpose of your measurement. It\u2019s easy to just dive in, write a bunch of model code, wrap it in 5-fold cross validation and call it a day. What is harder is to take a step back, look at precisely why you are measuring accuracy, and carefully construct a metric to serve your purpose.", "Metrics can have many distinct purposes, each with its own nuances and issues. I find that these purposes are put into a few broad categories:", "The metric is used for communication with stakeholders:", "The metric is used for internal R&D and research:", "The metric is used for internally by the algorithm itself, to regulate or improve its own behavior:", "Each of these different purposes for measuring your model will entail different strategies for measuring your model. You must choose and design a metric that is appropriate to your situation.", "For example, let\u2019s consider broadly a few of the differences between a metric designed for external stakeholders from one designed for internal R&D.", "As you can see, the requirements for metrics for such differing audiences and purposes are quite different.", "So the first step of our framework is just starting from the purpose of your metric. Don\u2019t just do it in your head \u2014 really get it down on paper, in a document, why exactly you are measuring. You may find that there are multiple reasons you are measuring a model. If you really want to measure better, that may mean you have to invest in maintaining multiple different metrics. This can be a lot of additional work, but the result is that you can be confident in your measurements and focus your effort on your research objectives.", "When going through this process, try to answer the following questions:", "The next step in measuring your model better is to brainstorm a list of potential candidate metrics. Like any good brainstorming session, its best not to come to conclusions too early. Really try to spit-ball and just come up with different ideas for how you can measure a model. You can\u2019t really make a decision if you don\u2019t have multiple possibilities to decide between.", "While brainstorming, you should at least write down / consider all of the well known metrics that serve your purpose. This may require you to do some research, especially if you are applying data-science into a new domain that is not your expertise.", "However, you should also consider the possibility of engineering metrics to serve specific purposes. Often this might involve modifying a well known metric in a way that is specific to your problem. In other ways, it may involve genuinely going out on new territory, creating new equations and original methods of analysis. Some of the ways of constructing a metric include:", "Evaluating a well known metric, but only on specific subsets of your dataset.", "Creating a small dataset specifically for the purposes of measurement.", "Applying certain types of augmentation on the data your metric is measured on:", "Breaking down your metric results based on categories within your data:", "Making your metric \u201charder\u201d or \u201ceasier\u201d if your model is at the very high or low end of typical metrics:", "Consider modifying the metric so that certain things considered a failure are instead counted positively, or vice versa:", "Considering different ways of splitting your data between training, testing, and validation:", "Normalizing the metric in various ways:", "You may only consider your models performance relative to a \u201cbenchmark\u201d model:", "You may consider measuring accuracy using some sort of validation routine. That is, if you have an effective way of validating whether the models output is at least good (although not correct), this may give you an additional way to measure your model on unlabelled data", "Creating your own equation to describe the behavior that you want:", "With all of these considerations, you should be able to come up with at least a few different ways of measuring your model. Again it\u2019s important not to just get caught up on picking some commonly used metric like F1 score and just running with it. If you haven\u2019t really thought through the various options for yourself, then you can just end up shooting yourself in the foot with a metric that confuses stakeholders and does not reflect real-world performance.", "With multiple possible metrics on the table, you now need to consider the Pro\u2019s and Con\u2019s of each of your metrics relative to the purpose of your metric.", "Try to consider each of the properties of your metrics:", "Now, we offer some tips on how to pick apart good metrics from bad ones. These are just our own thoughts and ideas, based on our past experiences with measuring models. You should thoroughly evaluate your own situation to ensure your metrics are fit for purpose:", "Metrics meant for non-technical people need to be simple.", "Metrics that are meant to be used for internal R&D need to be stable and consistent:", "Metrics that are being used to measure the relative performance between two models are different then measuring its absolute performance:", "Metrics used for programmatic purposes, such as hyperparameter optimization, or early stopping are more tolerant of noise, but much less tolerant of poor metric construction.", "Metrics for all purposes need to capture the dimensions along which your algorithm is meant to generalize:", "Again, these are just some tips and things we have noticed about picking good metrics. There is no one answer to the question of how to measure a model. It\u2019s very easy to tweak your measurements just slightly and then get the outcome you desired. If you\u2019re model isn\u2019t performing well enough to meet expectations, you can just tweak you\u2019re measurement of it. But this isn\u2019t a sound scientific practice \u2014 its just self-delusion. Poor use of metrics leads to false expectations and false hopes.", "When I was first becoming sophisticated in my understanding of data science and artificial intelligence, I worked at a startup called Sensibill. Our basic problem was to extract structured data out of images receipts. But none of us had any data extraction expertise \u2014 we were just a bunch of full stack developers who had come together to build the solution. Both the algorithms and the dataset they operated on were being cobbled together as we went.", "One of my first experiences with the problem of measuring accuracy comes from those days. Over the 2 \u00bd years that I spent developing that system, we kept introducing more and more metrics. The managers would get confused when a metric indicated great performance, and their subjective evaluation of performance in the real world was not as good. The response would be to introduce a new metric. This would repeat every 3\u20136 months. We would create specific subsets of our dataset used for testing (a bunch of them). We would create different validation routines on results and measure our accuracy against them. We would have different metrics in different environments (production vs staging vs development). We had rolling average numbers and monthly numbers, recent-100 numbers, and numbers computed on the fly on testing sets. We would have some metrics that reported excellent results, and other ones that seemed to indicate that the model was near total shit. To me, it became metric salad, and none of us really knew how well the system behaved for our end users. We also didn\u2019t have any clear idea of what was making the system better or worse.", "Looking back on those years with more experience, I came to understand that the problem wasn\u2019t that we weren\u2019t trying to measure the accuracy. We certainly devoted a lot of effort to measurement of the system. Nor was it that we didn\u2019t know how to measure our system \u2014 we certainly had a lot of expertise on that, and some of the metrics we did have I would now consider the \u201ccorrect\u201d ones that we should have trusted (although I\u2019d make some improvements).", "The reason it wasn\u2019t working is that we were fundamentally conflating the different purposes for the different metrics. We knew the questions we wanted answered. But we weren\u2019t carefully selecting which of the metrics available to us would give us those answers. Additionally, our metrics weren\u2019t really fit for purpose and always had some sort of flaw versus what we cared about. This problem lead to a breakdown in communication between different teams and departments as people\u2019s expectations did not align with what they were seeing in the application. And this wasn\u2019t always in the negative direction \u2014 certain users experienced unusually good results from the application \u2014 however this only resulted because they uploaded short, easy receipts. It was a biased sample. This mismatch between expectation and reality then lead to more effort being spent developing ever more metrics.", "If you have carefully designed your metric, and considered all the problems associated with it; if you are confident it will actually answer the question you want to answer, then stick with it. Trust it. Work to improve your model using it. Communicate it to people as appropriate. When you add new metrics, consider it thoughtfully and don\u2019t let yourself become overwhelmed by metric salad. Have a few specific, thoughtful metrics that are designed for the requirements you have. Try to upgrade, improve or replace existing metrics, rather then create additional ones. Create temporary metrics to solve specific problems, and then discard them once the problem is solved, or at the very least, confine them to automated tests. Keep your eyes on the prize.", "In this article, we have discussed a process for measuring your model better by going through a thoughtful exercise on what your needs for measuring are. The exercise should not take more than a couple of hours, but exhausting that brain energy and going through the process thoroughly may lead you to better performing models.", "The process starts by considering the reason for measuring. You may in fact find you that you have multiple distinct purposes. At the very least, everyone will experience a dichotomy between the external communication purposes of metrics, and the internal R&D purpose of metrics.", "We then proceed to brainstorm a bunch of candidate metrics. The goal should be to not just presuppose that some commonly used method of measurement is correct for us. We should really try to consider different methods of measurement, and potential modifications that we can make that will serve the purpose of the metric better. Then only after brainstorming multiple candidates options, we evaluate the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of each for our purpose.", "Finally, after going through this process and actually selecting a metric (or multiple metrics) that serve the purposes that you have, you should stick with them. Having a set of metrics that can serve as a reliable benchmark over time is good for everyone \u2014 stakeholders, managers, and researchers all benefit.", "Thank you for reading through this entire series of articles on measuring accuracy.", "Your home for data science.
