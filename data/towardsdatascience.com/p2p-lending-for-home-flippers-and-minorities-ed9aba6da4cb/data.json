What are the characteristics of such borrowers and the different types of P2P loans?", "Lending Club releases quarterly data on loans issued during a particular period. I will be using the most recent loan data for 2018 Q1 to look at the most recent batch of borrowers. Understandably, due to the recency of the data, repayment information is still incomplete. It would be interesting down the road to look at an older data set with more repayment information or at the declined loans data that Lending Club provides.", "A look at the dataframe shape reveals 107,868 loans originated in Q1 of 2018. There are 145 columns with some columns that are completely empty.", "Some empty columns such as id and member_id are understandable as they are personally identifiable information. Many of the variables also relate to detailed loan information. For the purposes of this analysis, we focus on a few demographic variables and basic loan information. More information on the variables are available here.", "Looking at the data types for the variables, they are currently all non-null objects. For variables that should indicate a sense of scale or order, the data should be changed accordingly.", "A look at individual entries reveal that empty data is represented by an empty string object, a Nonetype object, or a string \u2018n/a\u2019. By replacing those with NaN and running missingno, we see a large number of missing fields under \u2018emp_length\u2019.", "Dropping the records with missing data yield 98,424 rows, not a large dilution of the initial number.", "Based on the nature of the individual variables, they have to be converted to the following data types to be useful in any subsequent analysis:", "Integer data type:- loan_amnt (loan amount applied for)- funded_amnt (loan amount funded)- term (number of payments for loan)- open_acc (number of open credit lines)- total_acc (total known credit lines)- pub_rec (no. of derogatory public records)", "Float data type:- int_rate (interest rate on loan)- dti (debt to income ratio)", "Ordered category data type:- grade (loan grade A-G)- emp_length (employment length in years)- annual_inc (annual income)", "Integer and float type transformations are relatively standard, with tricky symbols and spaces removed by a simple regex. Categorical variables can be a little trickier. For this use case, we will need categorical variables that are ordered.", "For example, a loan grade of G represents the lowest quality loan with the highest risk.", "The use of \u2018cat.codes\u2019 transforms each entry into the corresponding integer on an ascending scale. By the same process, we can convert employment length to an ordinal variable as well since the entire \u2018>1 year\u2019 and \u201810+ years\u2019 don\u2019t convey the necessary information.", "As there are too many unique values in annual income, it is more useful to separate them into categories based on the value band that they fall in. I have used pd.qcut in this case to allocate a bin for each range of values.", "\u2018qcut\u2019 will divide the items such that there are an equal number of items in each bin. Note that there is another method called pd.cut. \u2018cut\u2019 allocates items to bins by the values, regardless of the number of items in each bin.", "While my initial inclination was to use cut to get a better perspective of the income ranges, it turns out that there were multiple outliers that skewed the data greatly. As seen from the number of items in each bin, using \u2018cut\u2019 provided a balanced view of the income data.", "Variables such as the type of loan or the state of the borrower remain as they are and we can take a closer look at the unique values for each variable.", "So what do we see at first glance?", "The skewness and kurtosis for loan amounts and interest rates deviate from that of a normal distribution but are quite low. A low skewness value indicates that there isn\u2019t a drastic difference between the weight of the two tails. The values do not lean towards a particular direction. A low kurtosis value indicates a low combined weight of both tails, indicating a weak presence of outliers.", "It is interesting to note the spikes for loan amounts happen in intervals of $5000. Could step-wise pricing strategies be possible given this preference for nice whole numbers?", "Furthermore, there is a noticeable peak for interest rates right under a yield of 10%. This would seem to make sense given that high yielding corporate bonds hover around 7.5% and P2P loans have to justify their risk profile with higher rates.", "The distribution for debt-to-income ratio is remarkably skewed, with very heavy tails. It would be interesting to examine individual outlier cases for how loans were granted to such risky individuals.", "Looking at the types of loans, there were specific home-related loan types that stood out. Given that there was information on the home ownership status of borrowers, I created a new dataframe with home specific loans to look for interesting trends.", "At first glance, there is an overwhelming number of borrowers with mortgages that are taking out loans for home improvement, almost 5X that of home owners and renters. They are also the group with the most number of loans taken out for the purposes of buying a home.", "Do home owners that take out mortgages just really like repainting houses and installing chandeliers? One explanation could be that these home improvements are not for themselves but for increasing property values before they flip it. These fix and flip operations are not new and there are in-depth reports of this phenomenon at Attom. A public dataset for home flipping activity across states would have made for a more insightful look at the borrower composition of this P2P loan.", "Another interesting observation was that of \u2018Moving and relocation\u2019 loans for renters. While the number of such loans are close to negligible for the other groups, home renters would have more need for such loans due to the short term nature of their living arrangements.", "High Value Loan Concentrations in Debt Consolidation", "There seems to be a concentration of high value loans above the median value in the debt consolidation, credit card refinancing, and home improvement categories. Given that debt consolidation is usually meant for individuals with a high level of unsecured loans or too many credit facilities, the high loan amounts make sense.", "Judging by the distribution of the hues, there is a noticeable concentration of a term of 60 months for high value loans. This would fit reliably in the assumption that borrowers would prefer to pay off a large loan in more installments.", "A plot of both the number of loans and the total P2P loan amount show that California has a voracious appetite for this form of credit. It took out around 40% more P2P loans than Texas, the next state on the list. There are a few explanations to this massive gap.", "There are reports such as the one from smartasset that show that richer states generally have a propensity to take on more debt. California has the highest debt-to-income ratio across states that is also evident in our dataset.", "Furthermore, California is one of the most technologically adept states in the US and would likely have had more exposure to alternative financing solutions such as P2P lending platforms. Indeed, the top states for total P2P loans comprise of two of the top existing Fintech ecosystems (CA, NY), and two of the fastest growing Fintech hubs (TX, FL).", "Given this overview of P2P loan numbers across states, why not go one step further?", "There was this great article on HuffPost on the housing sector crisis in America with an interesting observation that African Americans looked towards non-conventional loans due to the racial wealth gap in the midst of rising rents and home prices. They were more likely to be rejected from such loan sources for reasons such as lower credit scores and income levels.", "A few questions popped up in my mind:1. Do they turn to other alternative financing sources like \u2026 say \u2026 P2P loans for home-related loans?2. Do other state-specific factors impact the number of home-related loans?", "Scraping TimeI went to www.census.gov and scraped state level data that ranged from demographic to economic figures.", "Going through the network tab in Google Chrome, I found that most of the data being rendered on the census tables were from another site with a link similar to this : https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/dc,US/PST045217?ajax=true#qf-headnote-c", "Furthermore, each of these pages included another link to the csv file for the data that looked like this : https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/csv/dc,US/PST045217", "It seems that the only difference across the links for different states was the state code in the link. Given that I had all the unique state codes in the \u2018addr_state\u2019 column of my dataset, I wrote a loop to create a different link to each csv for each state. Once all the data was extracted, a dataframe would be created with only variables related to race, housing, and income.", "All the columns with NaN were removed and an additional column \u2018addr_state\u2019 was added based on the state name in the index. This was to enable a merging of dataframes based on state codes.", "I also obtained another dataset from FRED for house price indices by state from 2016\u20132018. With this dataset, I created a new column in a new dataframe for the percentage change in house price index from 2016\u20132018.", "Given that this is only a look at home-related loans, we create a new dataframe based on the loan counts for the relevant P2P loans.", "By merging the dataframes together, a main dataframe for the desired variables were created from three different sources. Home related loans, an aggregation of home buying, improvement, and moving P2P loans is the outcome variable for the model.", "A look at the correlations between the different variables show that housing units and building permits were highly correlated with the outcome variable of home related loans.", "I was particularly tempted to use \u2018total_loans\u2019 as a control variable due to its correlation with both the outcome variable of home related loan numbers and the independent variable of housing units.", "However, there is an endogenous variable bias between total loans and home related loans. Are there more home related loan because there are more loans overall or are there more loans overall because there are more home related loans? Unless a clearer picture emerges regarding the relationship between these two variables, it would not be appropriate to add total loans as the control variable.", "It seems at first glance from the 0.985 R-squared value that most of the variability for home related loans can be explained by the existing variables.", "Only the number of housing units, median rent, and number of building permits are statistically significant, despite coefficient values for housing units and building permits being incredibly low. Housing unit and building permit numbers both indicate housing supply and more loans would be taken out for either mortgaging or improving the homes. Higher rent prices could indicate the need for P2P loans to cover such living costs though such loans could be categorized under other titles like \u2018Other\u2019 or \u2018Debt consolidation\u2019.", "A second regression run on only statistically significant variables returned a similarly high R-squared of 0.971 but leaves housing units as the only statistically significant variable with an infinitesimal coefficient value.", "So \u2026 that was all for nothing?", "Well not exactly. Despite the mismatch in data and questions posed, here are a few takeaways and ideas for improvement:", "Granular breakdown of loan uses \u2014 The current types of home related loans catered mostly to home owners and home buyers. The loans mentioned in the HuffPost article were catered for African Americans and minorities close to the poverty line. Such loans would likely mirror payday loans for rent and other immediate living expenses and could be classified under the \u2018Debt consolidation\u2019 and \u2018Other\u2019 titles. With a more granular analysis on what the loans were used for would provide a more accurate representation of African American usage of alternative financing.", "Low P2P market share \u2014 The tiny coefficient for housing units and permits seen here can be attributed to the tiny portion of the mortgage market that alternative financing sources account for. It is unlikely that P2P lending platforms are notable beneficiaries of housing supply.", "Lack of a reliable proxy for race \u2014 The population of African Americans in each state was not the best proxy for loans from this race group. More individual loan information from P2P or mortgage records on the race of the individuals taking out loans would have improved the model.", "Inclusion of more feature variables \u2014 A select subset of loan variables and state variables were chosen for the purpose of this short article though in reality, a careful re-engineering of variable groups could have led to other useful variables to improve the model with. This inclusion of a multitude of new variables inevitably leads to the curse of dimensionality, but thats a debate for another day.", "Lack of indicators for alternative financing awareness \u2014 Awareness indices or other proxies for the knowledge of such alternative lending sources across races and states would have greatly improved the model as it would have been incredibly descriptive of how lenders think about and use such new funding resources. For example, a state with a higher number of STEM graduates or technology incubators would be more likely to be aware of P2P loan availability.", "Different ways to merge dataframes \u2014 There are other alternative ways of reshaping and merging data from other sources that would have led to different models. For example, one hot encoding could have been used to indicate different states. Another example would be constructing the model from a loan-by-loan basis instead of a state-by-state that it is currently in.", "Time series analysis \u2014 The regression model that was run was only for a snapshot in time. If data points could be collected for each financial quarter for the past 5 years, the result would be more representative.", "Reverse engineering existing mortgage datasets for race \u2014 If there were external mortgage datasets that had similar feature variables as the Lending Club dataset, it might have been possible to create a predictive model to label the Lending Club loans. While certainly not as accurate as actual labels, it might be the next best option given data privacy.", "Thanks for reading and you can find the associated code and other trial models here!", "Your home for data science.
