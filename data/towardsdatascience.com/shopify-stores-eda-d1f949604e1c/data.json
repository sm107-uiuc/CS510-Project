In this document, first I introduce Shopify and it\u2019s data model. Then, I discuss our data collection challenges and methodology, followed by some basic exploratory data analytics (EDA). At the end, I briefly talk about our topic modeling and classification with deep NLP models which is the subject of our next post.", "Shopgram.io presents the result of our analysis. It is an explorer for Shopify stores, which lists 700K shops based on different features including category, Alexa-rank, country, and the number of products. Shopify merchants who want to have a complete look at other related stores can easily find the data they need to get insights. It is beneficial as well for those who want to see if there\u2019s any potential opportunity to start their business.", "Shopify is an online platform where you can easily set up your own online store with no specific technical knowledge. After subscribing to Shopify, you have an admin panel where you can design your store and put your products. According to Shopgram\u2019s report, top websites in different categories are now using Shopify for its unique benefits. Based on Statistica, today, e-commerce has 16% of the global retail sales share and Shopify, as one of the biggest players in e-commerce, has a 20% share among websites using e-commerce technologies, according to BuiltWith.", "From the data perspective, Shopify provides a unifying data structure for all shops\u2019 data, because they are all created by Shopify, although they may use different themes and UIs. Each shop has a title and description and can be viewed as a set of products. A specific product has a title and may have different variants with different images, titles, and prices. Another important concept is the collection. Each shop may have different collections and each product may be a member of many collections (see Fig. 1). Hence, the data model is the same among all shops and it provides great potential for defining data science projects.", "Some statistical reports on Shopify apps and stores are available on the net (see e.g. IndieHackers, ASoft) however, most of them provide general information and the detailed ones like Storeleads are accessible after paid subscription.", "Finding all shops is one of the most challenging tasks. Shop URLs are accessible through many data providers such as Spyse, Nerdydata, CartInsight, Publicwww, Wappalyzer, and BuiltWith in their premium plans however, we need to find them ourselves, because some of them are not complete, and the others have restricted usage terms. As Shopify stores have a unique subdomain of myshopify.com, if we find these subdomains, we have the complete list. Also, Shopify servers have a few IP addresses which serve stores. Hence we could find all stores by finding domains that point to those IP addresses.", "A lot of useful information can be extracted just by processing the HTML homepage of Shopify stores. We could find the title, description, and the names of collections, country, theme, and currency and use them for the first version of Shopgram.io, together with their Alexa-rank which is accessible through Alexa API. We also find most of the shops\u2019 products through the URL {shop-url}/products.json, and will use it in the future.", "In this section, I am going to show some basic EDA which can help us later in choosing ML models. The presented statistics are from 700K shop data that we could reach through our data collection mechanism, and there might be some minor biases in them.", "First, let\u2019s check the popularity of Shopify in different countries. It\u2019s interesting that most of the shops (~88%) are from English speaking countries (see Fig. 2). The currency distribution is also shown in Fig. 3, and the majority of the stores use USD as their currency.", "Another attractive statistics to check is the distribution of Alexa-rank (see Fig. 4). It seems that although there are many Shopify stores, just 17% of them have Alexa-rank less than 10M, with sufficient traffic to get ranked by Alexa, and just 3.4% have Alexa-rank less than 1M. Also among all top 10M websites on the internet, 1.2% are Shopify stores.", "Shop collections information is also important to us, because first, it contains useful information about shop categories, as we used it in our topic modeling, and second, it was easy to gather from the homepage HTML. As depicted in Fig. 5, the number of collections has a heavy-tailed distribution with mean 13.2 and median 5.", "Theme usage statistics may be also interesting for those who are going to choose themes for their shops. Debut and Brooklyn are the most popular themes and near one-third of shops use them. The theme distribution is shown in Fig. 6.", "Also, the number of products can be a reasonable measure of the store size, and Fig. 7 shows it\u2019s distribution. A lot more information can be extracted from product info which will be discussed in future posts.", "Now, let me briefly talk about our first ML project which is classifying shops and specifying their categories, and leave the details to our upcoming post. The main challenge in this project is dealing with unlabeled data in a supervised task. The second challenge is choosing the final class labels to map stores to them. To deal with the later, first, we thought of utilizing Amazon or Ebay hierarchy as class labels, but then we decided to build specific labels for Shopify stores, because of its different context from those two platforms. Hence, we did topic modeling to get more insight into the data. We concatenated shop title, description, and collection names and extracted a feature vector from that by using a state of the art deep NLP model. Then we applied clustering methods and reached nearly 800 important keywords in all shops. Using these keywords, we built a labeled dataset, trained a deep NLP model, and classified shops to different labels. The results of doing these tasks are available in Shopgram.io.", "Your home for data science.
