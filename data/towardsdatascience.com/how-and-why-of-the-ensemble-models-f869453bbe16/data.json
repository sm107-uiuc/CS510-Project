It was kind of a quiz show with multiple choices of answers. If the participants can choose the right option for all questions, he or she can win 10 Million Indin Rupees. The participants had some options to resort to if he is unsure about any question. One such option was taking an audience poll and go by the majority choice.", "The questions could be from Sports, Mythology, Politics, Music, Movies, Culture, Science, etc that is from a variety of subjects. The audience were no experts of any such subject. Interestingly, more often than not the majority opinion will turn out to be the correct answer. This is the central concept behind ensembling.", "Seems like a Magic right, let\u2019s look at the mathematical intuition of the same.", "The idea is presented using the following simple diagram, in the context of ML. Now each person is equivalent to a classifier and like the audience is diverse, the more uncorrelated the classifiers better it is.", "We will train three classifiers on the same set of data. Now in the time of prediction, we will check, what the majority of the classifiers are saying. Assuming that this is a duck vs hen problem. As two of them are saying it to be a duck, the final decision of the ensemble model is that of duck.", "Let\u2019s say, we have a classifier with a classification accuracy of 70%. If we add more classifiers then can it increase?", "Let\u2019s assume that we have 3 people/classifiers to start with. If any time more than two of them are right about the prediction, by majority voting we get the correct result. If the classifiers are independent, then the probability of C1 and C3 being correct and C3 being incorrect is .7 * .7 * 3. Let\u2019s look at a more generalized calculation", "The above diagram lays out all the cases and Case 1 and Case 2 are where our predictions are correct. Now, the revised overall accuracy is 0.3429 + 0.4409 or 78.38%.", "Just think about it if we just add more classifiers the classification accuracy improves from 70% to 78.33%.", "If we increase more classifiers or more people in the crowd, the accuracy goes further up as shown in the below figure.", "When all classifiers have equal say on the final prediction, it is called as hard-voting, like the one shown in Figure 1, whereas if we consider the confidence of a classifier in a particular decision or some other scheme to give different weight to different classifiers it is called as soft voting.", "In the first case, it is hard voting, so only the label is considered, in soft voting we look rather at the prediction probability. We find the class-wise average probability and decide.", "Softvoting is more fine-grained than hard voting.", "The result is shown in the below figure", "This experiment was done on \u2018Sonar\u2019 data and it can be seen that the soft voting and hard voting classifiers are bringing in around 7\u20138% improvement over individual classifiers.", "For further details, you can look at our notebook or the video here.", "In this tutorial, we gave a quick overview of how crowd intelligence embodied in Ensemble works. We discussed soft-voting and hard-voting. There are more popular methods like random forest and Boosting, which will take up some other day.", "Your home for data science.
