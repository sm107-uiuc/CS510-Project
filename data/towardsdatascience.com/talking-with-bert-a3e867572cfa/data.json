For BERT especially, we have seen some incredible uses for this massive pre-trained language model on tasks like text classification, prediction, and question answering. I\u2019ve recently written about how some have researched some of the limitations of BERT when performing certain language tasks. Further, I did some testing on my own with creating a question-answering system to get a feel for how it could be used. It has been great to see and try in practice some of the many capabilities of language models.", "When you get down to it though, these models obviously have a lot of information on the relationship of words and ideas, but it can be hard to really check what it knows. I recently explored an interesting paper called How Can We Know What Language Models Know? that takes a look at how we ask questions to a language model. Like any language, it is not just about what you ask but how you ask it.", "The main goal in the research teams work was around looking at how we extract knowledge from a language model efficiently. When we want to probe a language model for what relational information it may contain, we use prompts, like \u201cA corgi is a species of ___\u201d. Prompts like this can often be created manually. Their experiments tested out creating different prompts and trying them out on BERT to see if performance can be improved by altering prompt phrasing methods.", "Let\u2019s for fun say we created a language model with all the important information from Wookieepedia (you are reading that right, it is a wiki of all things Star Wars, it\u2019s really impressive). Something like the prompt:", "\u201cLuke Skywalker considers ____ his birthplace\u201d", "Is a less efficient way of asking:", "That being the case, we then know if we want to know the origin of someone else, it would be better to structure our prompt like the second. The research team made special note based on their success with two main methods of formulating prompts to improve results:", "As noted in their paper, this approach was a take on the template-based method noted in previous research into question answering systems. This approach is based around the idea that, in a large corpus, text is often structured as subject > specific relationship > object. They mined all sentences from the Wikipedia corpus that used this format to create a set of more flexible prompts, as an example:", "As you could imagine, using more specific relationship wording from a corpus makes it easier for the language model to arrive at a ground-truth answer. Though you can manually come up with a similar prompt, they were not shown to perform as well as this method.", "In the example of my Wookiepedia language model, I could mine the corpus for similar formats, perhaps I find the phrase \u201cFirmus Piett has the rank of Admiral\u201d that I can extrapolate down to (x) has a rank of (y), which might help me formulate more efficient way of checking the rank of other Imperial officers.", "So we have a mined prompt, like our (x) has a rank of (y), but it is obviously just one way of stating the relationship. Paraphrasing is about improving the diversity of words used to express that relationship, but not straying from the prompt. This could be done manually, but the research team used a back-translation method of translating the prompt into a different language and then translating it back. An example from their work was:", "x shares a border with y > x has a common border with y > x adjoins y", "In general, this research points towards a better way of querying a language model beyond manual prompts. Intrinsically, it makes sense that, in a way, speaking a language similar to the model could improve how it comprehends your question. I would be interested to see how something like this would look if you had a language model that was trained purely on transcripts of people\u2019s natural speaking. Would the types of prompts that performed the best be manual or mined? Just some wild thoughts! I highly recommend reading the paper, it is a really interesting look into.", "Your home for data science.
