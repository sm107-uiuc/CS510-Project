Long story short, each sprite takes about one hour to be drawn, and each character takes up to five hundred sprites, on average. In \u201cTowards Machine-Learning Assisted Asset Generation for Games: A Study on Pixel Art Sprite Sheets,\u201d we explore the Pix2Pix architecture to automate the sprite production pipeline, reducing the average time taken per sprite by 15 minutes (~25%). This is our first published work on sprite generation, and we expect to improve it further in the future.", "This paper received the Best Paper Award from the 2019 Brazilian Symposium on Games & Digital Entertainment (SBGames 2019)", "Pixel art is one of the most popular aesthetics in video games. It strives to recreate the look and feel of old Nintendo and Arcade titles. In the \u201990s, pixel-art was the only option on most consoles. Screens had limited resolution, and most devices could not perform advanced techniques in real-time. Today, pixel art is a choice \u2014 a costly one.", "To achieve the look-and-feel of arcade games, artists must embrace the limitations of the time. The original Game Boy had only four greenish colors. Its successor, Game Boy Color, could simultaneously display up to 56 different colors. Later devices, known as the 16-bit generation, allowed up to 256 colors per character, a significant change in aesthetics. In our game, we constrain ourselves to the 256 color limit per character.", "Commonly, a character is a blend of \u201cindex sprites\u201d with a \u201ccolor palette.\u201d When drawing, artists shade each pixel with an \u201cindex\u201d that relates to one of the 256 colors of the palette. In-game, each index sprite is replaced with its associated color, composing the final image. This procedure allows designers to create different \u201cskins\u201d for each character, allowing users to customize their experience and to create \u201cevil\u201d versions for the characters. The following picture depicts an indexed sprite, a color palette, and the rendered mix.", "Limiting artists to 256 colors is not natural. Choosing shades is difficult. To ease this task, the work is divided semantically. In our pipeline, two intermediate sprites are generated: the \u201cshading\u201d and the \u201cregions\u201d sprites. The former uses up to 6 tones, which indicate the \u201clight,\u201d and the latter uses up to 42 tones, which state \u201cregions \u201dof the sprite, such as the arms, the hair, the legs, etc. Multiplying both sprites pixel-wise, we obtain the index sprite, which allows up to 252 colors (6 * 42). The following picture shows an example of the shading, regions, and index sprites. This procedure turns the 256 colors problem into two straight-forward sub-problems with 6 and 42 colors each.", "Finally, each character is designed by a single person, which produces the concept-art for all of its animations. These are presented in a \u201csketch\u201d sprite and are later refined into a \u201cline-art\u201d sprite. The former is used to quickly prototype new animations in-game, and the latter is used to communicate with the other artists how the final sprite should look like. This way, the designer can conceptualize an entire character in a matter of days and out-source the remainder of the work to the drawing team. Here are examples of the sketch and line-art sprites:", "Putting it all together, the designer creates the character by sketching each of its animations and then producing their respective line-arts. In sequence, these line-art sprites are handled to the drawing team, which will draw the respective shading and region sprites. Finally, a script combines both to generate the game-ready index sprites.", "In total, this process takes about one hour. The sketch, line-art, and region sprites production take, on average, ten minutes, while the shading takes the remainder of the hour to be completed. Tracking the exact time spent per drawing is almost impossible. To compute them, we inspected our production logs, interviewed the team, and measured the steps in a controlled manner for a dozen sprites.", "This work hypothesizes that producing the shading and color sprites is doable using modern generative models. To be considered useful, a generated sprite must be good enough that a human artist could perfect it in less time than it would take to do it from scratch.", "In this work, we tackle two image mapping problems: line-art to shading and line-art to regions. Formally, we have to create a generator G(x), that receives inputs from the line-art domain and produces outputs in the shading/region domain. This problem is also known as image translation.", "To guarantee that G(x) is a useful mapping, we shall create a discriminator D(x, y) that looks at x and y and says if y is a quality sprite. In other words, G is our \u201cvirtual artist,\u201d and D is our virtual \u201cquality control.\u201d If we can get G to make D happy, we have a useful mapping.", "In more detail, consider we have several line-art sprites (x) and the already drawn shading and region sprites (y), made by human artists. We know these passed quality control, so D(x, y) will be happy. Our task now is to train G to, given x, produce \u0177 (an imitation of the real y). If the reproduction is good, D will approve \u0177; else, it will reprove it. In the end, we spoiler D if it was right or wrong, and we ask it to give constructive feedback to G.", "The procedure I just described is known as Adversarial Training. Two models \u201ccompete\u201d in the sense that one is trying to beat the other. In our case, G is trying to beat D into thinking that \u0177 is y, and D is trying desperately to tell what is real and what is fake. With time, G will become a successful artist \ud83d\ude04 , and D might be fired from quality control \ud83d\udca9.", "By using Neural Networks to implement G and D, we get what is known as a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network. Breaking the title up, \u201cConditional\u201d because G takes an x as input instead of random noise, \u201cGenerative Adversarial\u201d because it trains against an adversary to be a sound generator, and \u201cNetwork\u201d because it is (surprise!) a neural network.", "Algorithmically, for each line-art x and shading/region sprite y:", "Repeating this procedure to the entire dataset multiple times will eventually converge into a G network that creates realistically looking sprites and a D network that is unable to tell which images are real or fake.", "The Pix2Pix architecture is based on a U-Net Generator and a Patch-based Discriminator. The combined architecture is shown in the following picture. The discriminator is trained to classify each 32x32 patch of \u0177 as real or fake and is trained with the binary cross-entropy loss. In turn, the generator is trained to minimize the L1 loss between y and \u0177 and to maximize the discriminator loss.", "The U-Net model is a fully convolutional neural network based on the encoder-decoder idea. For each encoder layer, a skip-connection is added to the equivalent decoder layer. This allows the network to leverage the \u201coriginal\u201d information from the encoding layers and \u201cprocessed\u201d information through the decoder layers. A comprehensive overview of this architecture and its respective publication is given here.", "The Patch-Based discriminator is a truncated network, outputting its judgment for several image patches instead of a single judgment for the entire image. Thus, the discriminator provides detailed feedback to the generator, pointing which regions look real and which look fake. A complete overview of the inner details of the architecture can be found here.", "In contrast to the original network, we made the following changes:", "From the Trajes Fatais game, we selected the Sarah and Lucy characters as datasets to evaluate the usefulness of the Pix2Pix architecture. The Sarah character has only 87 finished sprites and has 207 ones left to be drawn. It is also a moderately complex character, with several smooth and complex regions. Lucy, on the other hand, is finished, so it has 530 fully drawn sprites, and is considerably easy to draw, having mostly smooth features.", "In a sense, Lucy is our upper-bound. It has all the data we could hope for, and it is an easy character to be drawn. If the algorithm can\u2019t handle Lucy, then it will likely fail for any other character. In contrast, Sarah is our ideal scenario: a moderately complex figure with only a couple dozen sprites ready for training. If it is useful for Sarah, then it may have production value for us.", "As can be seen, the algorithm had pretty good results for the shading problem and issues on region sprites. Namely, the colors are shifted, and there is a bit of noise around the girl. For shading sprites, only minor problems can be detected, such as the shoulder and legs in the second row.", "In this second batch, more issues can be found. In the generated shading column, many artifacts can be seen in shadowed regions, such as on the girl (row one), the platypus back (row 2), and the platypus beak (row 3). For color sprites, a lot of noise is present, rendering these sprites unusable, as fixing noise is hard for humans to do by hand.", "This third batch comes from the 207 sprites that only the line-art is available. Thus, these require a subjective analysis. The rows are composed of sprites similar to the ones used during training, sprites with previously unseen poses, and sprites in radically different poses, respectively.", "While the first row is mostly useful, color sprites deteriorate quickly on the second and third rows. The quality of shading sprites is mostly consistent. However, the third column of shading sprites shows it is not always consistent. The front-facing sprite in the second row should have its face brighter, and the sprite right bellow it has incoherent lighting.", "For now, we can safely assume that shading sprites can be useful, but region sprites are not, as they are too noisy and have color shift issues. Let\u2019s shift our attention to Lucy.", "With five times more data, Lucy sprites show a significant improvement over Sarah\u2019s. Shading sprites are near perfect, with only minor issues in shadowed regions and tolerable differences in the hair. Region sprites, however, are still far from optimal. The color shift issues and the noise are still relevant. This shows that increasing the data set size did not improve on these matters substantially.", "This second batch has sprites we manually selected to be in the validation set, as they are considerably different from most others. Despite this fact, shading sprites are still near identical to their human drawn counterparts. Concerning color images, the quality did not deteriorate much, as was the case for Sarah. However, it is still far from ideal.", "Considering these results, it can be said that increasing the dataset size considerably improves shading, but not regions. Since Lucy is our best-case scenario, it is safe to assume that we need another problem formulation/architecture to solve the region sprites problem.", "To more objectively quantify the quality of the generated content, we computed the MSE, MAE, and SSIM scores for both datasets.", "As can be seen in the table, the gray sprites have a better mean (\u03bc) and variance (\u03c3\u00b2) than color sprites on all three metrics. Also, the difference between the 75% quartile and the max seen values is huge, which indicates a highly skewed distribution.", "Additionally, Lucy\u2019s results are consistently better than Sarah\u2019s, having a much lower variance and significantly less skew.", "The SSIM score ranges from 0 (totally dissimilar) to 1 (identical) and measures the perceived similarity of two images. While MSE and MAE are purely mathematical notions, the SSIM score tries to be more correlated with human perception. In the table, gray sprites have near one score, which indicates that they are near identical to the average observer, which is not the case for color sprites.", "As a third and final evaluation, we asked the design team to comment on the 207 generated sprites for the Sarah character. Their feedback was mostly positive, praising the quality of shading sprites and discarding the color ones. In sum, they made four comments:", "The following figures illustrate points 2, 3, and 4.", "In this work, we evaluated the use of modern generative models to tackle the pixel-art generation problem. Namely, we employed a modified Pix2Pix architecture, achieving moderate success. In more detail, shading sprites were judged useful by the artistic team, and color sprites were discarded as unuseful.", "For the accepted shading sprites, the team stipulated that an average of 20 to 30 minutes would be needed to perfect each one, which is from 10 to 30 minutes less than what it takes to draw one from scratch. A conservative estimate is that each useful sprite would save 10 minutes of labor, which translates to about 15% more productivity.", "Despite having more colors, region sprites do not take as much time as shading sprites for the design team. As explained by the lead artist, regions are more predictable within animations and can be easily copied from one sprite to another. Thus, not having them generated is not a big issue.", "From a technical perspective, this work demonstrates that current models can be effectively used as assistants to creative tasks. Other works have found similar conclusions on the anime domain, which is made of mostly flat and ample surfaces and has fewer restrictions than pixel art. Moreover, the Pix2Pix model was conceptualized for real-world pictures but worked for pixel-art and anime data, which attests to its generality.", "Our current system is based on per-pixel regression, as the Pix2Pix model. However, our problems can be formulated as per-pixel classification, relying on the image segmentation literature. This might improve our results significantly.", "Sometimes, simplifying the problem might make it more tractable. Region sprites have a total of 42 colors, but only about a dozen appear on every sprite and occupy a significant portion of it. Downsizing the problem to a more selective set of shades might ease our generator\u2019s job.", "Pix2Pix is from 2017. Since then, several advancements have been made in the GAN literature, which includes better loss functions, attention mechanisms, and improved formulations. Using more modern techniques might improve the obtained results significantly.", "O. Ronneberger, P. Fischer, and T.
