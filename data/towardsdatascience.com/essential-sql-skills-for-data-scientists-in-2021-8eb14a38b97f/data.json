For social media companies, it generates a new row of data every time a user logs into the app/website. As long as there is no better way of managing million/billion rows of data, SQL is the go-to language for data scientists/engineers to perform data analytics, which is why tech companies (FAANG) heavily test candidates\u2019 query knowledge in DS interviews.", "Other programming languages, like R and Python, have very similar grammars. As a database management language, SQL is unique in a lot of ways and possesses attributes and characteristics that deserve special considerations.", "Given its popularity and dominance, surprisingly, there is a lack of appreciation in the DS community. While talking to my fellow DS community, a friendly suggestion that comes up too often is to make additional efforts to mastering SQL. Here, I\u2019m passing the same suggestion to my fellow readers: learn and master SQL skills if you want to stand out from the crowd.", "As in this post, I will \u2018live-code\u2019 4 LeetCode questions while walking through my thought process. I will focus on the explanations of how different functionalities work together and less so on what each command will do.", "It is not an intro to SQL for total beginners but assumes some level of familiarity with and prior exposure to the language. If it has been a while since your last query, I\u2019d recommend refreshing your query memories (click here) and then come back here.", "In general, my query philosophy is", "to disentangle the sequence of the queries and understand what comes first and what second.", "Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.", "For example, your query should return the following for the above table:", "Note: All emails are in lowercase.", "This question asks for duplicate emails, which translates into the number of emails with more than 1 count. So, we should use HAVING COUNT(Email) to calculate the email number and filter the value bigger than 1.", "Before we do that, we should use GROUP BY to sort out email addresses; an error message will return if we do not group data.", "Friendly Movies Streamed Last Month, LeetCode", "Write an SQL query to report the distinct titles of the kid-friendly movies streamed in June 2020.", "Return the result table in any order.", "The question asks for a movie name that meets specific criteria. There are two tables with one table (Content) containing movie title and both tables containing other selection criteria. We should combine both tables and filter through the rows using the selection criteria.", "We use a WHERE clause to list these three criteria out: content_type, Kids_content, and program_date.", "For the last one, the LEFT(program_date,7) method allows us to obtain the first 7 values from the left and set it equal to \u20182020\u201306.\u2019", "Question: Employees Earning More Than Their Managers (LeetCode)", "The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.", "Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.", "For this question, we are provided with one table, Employee, and we have to make use of it as much as possible. The question asks for the employee name(s) with specific attributes (higher salary than his manager).", "The question contains only one table but asks for two salaries: employee\u2019s and manager\u2019s, which reminds us of using a \u2018self-join\u2019 to compare one column to another one in a single table. My user take of a \u2018self-join\u2019 is when there is limited information (e.g., only one table) and we are comparing one column to another.", "To that end, a self-join would suffice. The rest of the code is self-evident: a LEFT JOIN and a WHERE clause filter through cases that meet the criteria.", "Write an SQL query that reports all the projects that have the most employees.", "This question asks for the project_id that has the most employee number, but it does not specify whether there are only one or multiple projects.", "This is the tricky part of this question!", "Multiple projects may share the same number of maximum employee number, which makes the regular attempt, group by \u2014 order \u2014 limit 1, useless, shown below:", "BTW, the above code will output the correct result if you run the code but return an error message if you submit the code at LeetCode. The main reason is the test case in the submission contains multiple projects with the maximum number.", "Here, the key is to use a subquery to find the maximum number of employees and then set the employee number equal to the max value in the outer query. By doing so, we can identify project_id(s) that fit the description.", "We can also use the with clause to re-write the above subquery.", "At the top, we create a temporary table called Sub_query with two variables: project_id and COUNT(*). In the rest, we filter through the Sub_query for the maximum count.", "The beauty with the WITH() clause is a cleaner query sequence: by creating a temporary table and then filtering through the table according to specific conditions. Quite neat!", "This is part 1 of a dual post on SQL, and please take a look at the second post next:", "While looking back at my learning path of SQL, there are a few things that I have done right. First, learning the basics (e.g., the querying framework, SELECT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY\u2026) early enough in my career. Second, practicing a lot of coding at LeetCode, I mean, a lot. For one time, I completed almost 100 SQL questions within 3 weeks and practiced multiple times for each question.", "It\u2019s always a good idea to start early and practice a ton if you want to be a step earlier than your fellow data scientists.
