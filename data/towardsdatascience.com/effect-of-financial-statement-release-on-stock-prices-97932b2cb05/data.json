As a Data Scientist, I believe in finding patterns in data, which in the field of investment can be quite profitable. In this article, I will explore the pattern of \u201cgood news about the company trigger the stock price growth\u201d and share my observations with you.", "Many of us who look at the charts might have noticed that the release of financial statements have an immediate impact on the stock price. Below is an example borrowed from www.vhinny.com on how KHC stock reacted to the release of the company\u2019s quarterly 10-Q report.", "You can see this pattern of immediate price change (drop or increase) for almost any stock just after the company releases its business performance. Looking at such behaviour, two questions might come across an investor\u2019s mind. First, is there a way to anticipate the direction of the price move before it occurs? Second, once the move has occurred, will the stock continue moving in a predictable direction?", "While some investors may find the first challenge attractive and see an opportunity in anticipating the price move, I\u2019ll take a side of the greats lead by Warren Buffet, arguably the greatest investor of all time, and simply say: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do it\u201d. In order for the stock price to move up immediately when a financial statement is released, not only does it have to outperform the company\u2019s past earnings, it has to outperform analysts expectations of the current earnings. Predicting either of these two events is a challenge that, I beleive, a retail investor cannot address due to the lack of reliable information. Hence, it might be worth to avoid attempting this challenge all together.", "The second challenge of anticipating stock price evolution once the change has occurred is, on the other hand, a challenge an ordinary investor can address with the tools he or she has. In this article, I will explore whether the release of the annual financial statement (10-K) contains actionable signal that investors may use to decide whether there is an opportunity to make profit upon purchase.", "To conduct this study, I\u2019ve used financial data containing dates of 10-K releases from www.vhinny.com and stock prices from www.alphavantage.co. You can find the full reference code to analysis discussed in this article on my GitHub page.", "Objective: In this study, I will investigate whether there is an opportunity to make an investment decision once a financial statement has been released and the market has made its initial move in response to it.", "Clarification: Many financial statements are released during market closure. In the KHC example (see the chart above), markets closed on February 12, 2020 at $30, the financial statement (10-Q) was released in the after hours and markets opened on February 13, pricing KHC down 10% at $27 by the end of day. In this study, the question is not whether the price will drop 10%. It is rather the following. Once the price has dropped 10%, is there evidence that it will go further?", "Dataset: The dataset used in this study consists of 479 companies covered by the S&P 500 index, representing 11 industry sectors evaluated from January 2018 to December 2019 (2 years).", "Methodology: To generate this dataset, I first identified all (company, date) pairs for the financial statements released during the investigated period. For every unique date of a financial statement release, I\u2019ve added (company, date) pairs of companies that did not have their financial statements released on that date. To keep the dataset size manageable, the latter company pairs were created for companies that operate in the same industry sectors as the ones that had their financial statements released. For example, if on February 19, 2020 only company A (Information Technology) and company B (Health Care) released their statements (positive examples), companies from the same two sectors only (Information Technology and Health Care) will be introduced for that date (negative examples). All available (company, date) pairs were inflated to cover the period between \u201cdate\u201d and \u201cdate + 7 days\u201d to provide visibility into the stock price behaviour.", "Illustration: Below I show an example of a company that released its financial statement (filing_date) on 2018\u201301\u201322. The stock price is tracked for the following 7 calendar days (n_calendar), which is generally equivalent to 5 trading days (n_trading). I\u2019ve also included the stock price as of \u2018filing_date\u2019 under the \u2018close\u2019 column, stock price at \u2018date\u2019 in the \u2018close_next_n\u2019 column, and \u2018percent_growth\u2019 which represents percent change between \u2018close\u2019 and \u2018close_next_n\u2019. Column \u2018filing_released\u2019 is a flag indicating whether this company did release a financial statement on the \u2018filing_date\u2019. If \u2018filing_released\u2019 is 0, it means that this company did not release it\u2019s financial statement and is used for comparison to some other company that did.", "Evaluation: I want to evaluate whether the release of a \u201cgood news\u201d financial statement has an actionable impact on the stock price. To do this, I will compare the stock price growth of companies that released their earnings reports (positive examples) with companies that did not release their earnings reports (negative examples). It is important to introduce negative examples and perform comparative analysis instead of looking at the absolute growth numbers to eliminate the effect of market trends. For example, if a company belongs to a \u201cdown-trending\u201d industry, a positive earnings report might stop the stock price from dropping rather than show a positive trend. Looking at the absolute performance, we would conclude that the financial statement for this company had no impact while comparing with other companies in the same industry would show above the average performance.", "This dataset contains 944 samples of companies (2 samples per company, 1 sample each year between 2018 and 2019). Once a financial statement is released, we need some time to evaluate whether it is \u201cgood news\u201d or \u201cbad news\u201d for the company. I use the first day after the financial statement release to decide whether it is a positive or a negative statement. If the price growth on the first day exceeds a certain threshold, I call it a signal and conclude that the statement has a positive impact (a signal to purchase the stock). To illustrate this approach, let\u2019s consider a 1% threshold for price growth during the first day. This gives us 257 samples of companies (as of the filing date) that have passed this threshold. In contrast, we have 24,315 samples of companies that did not release anything on the corresponding filing dates. Next, let\u2019s look at how the price has changed after the first day for our positive and negative examples and see whether they performed differently. The plot below shows the price growth distribution for the positive and negative examples after the first day since the financial statement release.", "On this histogram, the X axis represents the percentage price growth between n_trading=1 exclusive and n_trading=3 inclusive (2 days starting from just after the immediate price growth was captured). Pink bars (Filing Released) represent companies that released their reports; purple bars (Ordinary Day) represent companies that did not release their reports. Y axis shows the percentage of samples inside a corresponding bin on the histogram.", "The samples of \u2018Filing Released\u2019 companies are distributed around -0.001 mean with 0.025 standard deviation and the samples of \u2018Ordinary Day\u2019 companies are distributed around 0.002 mean with 0.026 standard deviation. Computing p-value for these distributions yields 0.072, implying lack of evidence to conclude that these distributions are different. Nevertheless, one can observe that the \u2018Filing Released\u2019 histogram is shifted to the left compared to the \u2018Ordinary Day\u2019 histogram. This, in fact, is contrary to my expectation that positive financial reports produce momentum for the price to follow in the same direction in the near future.", "Now that I\u2019ve established the experiment, let\u2019s see whether a different combination of parameters for the threshold and the shift value produces a different result. I\u2019m going to use thresholds of 0.5%, 1% and 1.5% to select \u2018positive examples\u2019 of companies that released their reports. I will also use the number of days equal to 1, 2, 3 and 4 to evaluate change in the stock price. This gives us 3*4 = 12 possible combinations of parameters. The combination that performed best (the lowest p-value of 0.001) was at the threshold = 1% and shift = 4 days. Below is the distribution for this experiment.", "The samples of \u2018Filing Released\u2019 companies are distributed around -0.006 mean with 0.034 standard deviation and the samples of \u2018Ordinary Day\u2019 companies are distributed around 0.002 mean with 0.038 standard deviation. While this experiment does have a low p-value, implying statistical significance of the difference in the distributions, it gets us further away from validating that earning reports may be used as a positive signal once a financial statement has been released and the market has made its initial move.", "Up until now, the analysis was performed on all companies in the dataset across different industrial sectors. One might argue that different industries might have different price dynamics. Hence, it\u2019s possible that uptrend in some industry in general may out-weight statement-driven movement for our \u2018positive examples\u2019. To investigate this idea, I reduced the scope of each experiment to companies of the same industrial sector only and performed the same tests. Below is an extract from an experiment for the Health Care sector.", "I encourage the reader to refer to the Jupyter Notebook accompanying this article for details. In summary, these tests did not provide convincing evidence supporting the hypothesis that the event of the financial statement release has tangible potential to serve as a signal for an investor to purchase the stock.", "In this study, I aimed to investigate whether the release of the financial statement (10-K) may be used as a signal to purchase a stock. To validate my hypothesis, I\u2019ve conducted experiments that compared performance of companies that released their financial statements with companies that did not.", "These experiments did not show evidence supporting the hypothesis of this study, that is to see whether an investor can observe price change after the earnings report is released and join the trend once its direction and strength become clear.", "I bring my reader\u2019s attention to keeping in mind that this is not an in-depth analysis, but rather a quick proof of concept exploration. Opportunities to dive deeper include investigating various segmentations on company age, market capitalization, funding structure, etc. However, as an investor, I believe there are more promising places to find signal that should be explored first.", "I\u2019m happy to connect with people who share my path, which is the pursuit of financial independence.
