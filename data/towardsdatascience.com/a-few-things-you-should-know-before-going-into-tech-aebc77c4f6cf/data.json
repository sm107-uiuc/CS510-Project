Every year there are new frameworks, programming languages and technologies disrupting the industry in its very core. Tech is surely one of the most interesting and lucrative job scenes to work nowadays.", "While looking for a job in this field, a newcomer should definitely do some research on the actual trends and skills needed in the industry. Whether one is interested in the newest technologies or simply wants a well-paid job in tech, it is important to know what\u2019s hot and what\u2019s not.", "This article offers some interesting insights based on questionnaires conducted by Stackoverflow. Questionnaires date from 2013 and 2018 and contain around 20.000 (clean) observations. To ensure that results are comparable, the data sets focus on the US Market and on full-time job positions only. The questionnaire structure between the years has changed significantly, but after extensive data cleaning, interesting conclusions could still be made. We will go through them in the following passages.", "The two Charts above display the relative popularity* of programming languages in years 2013 and 2018. Due to changes in the structure of Stackoverflow questionnaires between the years, the two plots above are not fully comparable. However, some trends are still obvious.", "Behind the usual \u201cFront End -Back End -Database\u201d toolbox (Java, C, Javascript, SQL) the only language whose relative share has increased over the years was Python. On the other hand, C# and PHP are losing their share and position in the programming language portfolio. This is not surprising, since Pythons\u2019 functionality and libraries have significantly increased over the years. Python is becoming the preferred tool of developers in areas in which it was not used before, such as Front-End development.", "2. Big Data means more Data Admins", "The Plots above show how tech jobs are distributed across different occupations/positions. Over the course of two questionnaires, some job titles have changed, potentially leading to blurry conclusions. However the Database Administrator role stayed unchanged, and its share in tech jumped from 2% to 5% over the course of 5 years. That change is indeed impressive but is also intuitive.", "The latest technologies allow tech companies to store immense volumes of data and use them to obtain valuable insights. Maintaining and structuring the data is becoming ever more important and with it the role of Database Administrators.", "The Stackoverflow questionnaires also inquire about the salary that the respondents earn. I made an attempt to find which features best explain the salary, using the 2018 data. The model used was Random Forest Classification, where the salary was binned into 50K, 100K, 150K, \u2026 bins. Although the classification results were poor (Weighted F1 Score on the Test set was 51%), feature importance results were interesting. What is important, these results matched well with the same results from a few other models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Classification).", "From the feature table above we can see that the factor best in explaining the salary was \u201cYears of Coding\u201d. It appears that the respondents who entered the industry early and gained experience can expect a higher salary.", "There are two more final takeaways.", "From the features table as well as from the bar plot at the very beginning of this article, we notice that it matters in which Operating System the developer is working. Unix Developers can hope for the highest median salary of around 120K $ per year.", "Knowing alternative programming languages seem to be lucrative. Although Java, C, Javascript, etc. are most popular languages, professionals using Hack, Scala and other \u201cspecial purpose\u201d languages can expect to earn significantly more.", "In this article, we went over some of the changing trends in the Tech industry and tried to shed some light on the features which explain the salary in the field. The data used was Stackoverflow annual questionnaire data.", "1- Python is getting more popular while PHP and C# are falling behind", "2- Database Administrators are in demand", "3- Experience is the most important feature leading to high salary. However proficiency in \u201cspecial purpose\u201d programming languages and working in less conventional Operating Systems such as BSD/Unix and MacOs can lead to high earnings as well.", "The full code behind this article can be found here and the questionnaire data is here .", "*The participants of the questionnaire responded in which programming languages they are proficient in (usually more than one). Popularity here is a relative occurrence of one programming language in the total pool of all responses.", "Your home for data science.
