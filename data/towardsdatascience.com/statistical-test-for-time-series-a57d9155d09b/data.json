It determines whether the model is\u2026 | by Irfan Alghani Khalid | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Statistical Test for Time Series", "description": "This article shows you how to conduct a testing on time series data, from checking its stationary to model it using ARIMA."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Recently, I\u2019ve published my article about forecasting using the ARIMA model where the data itself is the CO2 emission from 1970\u20132015. This article suddenly gain attention by many viewers, and this is one of my victorious article on Medium, here is my publication below,", "Several days after the article published, there are some constructive comments come to me. I\u2019ve made a mistake. I\u2019ve already tested the ARIMA model, and it passes the significance test, but it\u2019s not on the stationary.", "As I stated on the model after I differenced the data, the data looks stationary, and it can use for the next step. That\u2019s a mistake, so I have to write this article to clarify it.", "In this article, I will show you why the statistical test, especially the significance test, is necessary before applying the model, and also how does it look like after we make the series stationary based on the significance test.", "Significance test is a step that determines whether you can continue your analysis or not. The test quantifies your evidence against the hypothesis that is valid.", "Suppose that you believe a statement that is being true, and you want to know whether it is worth to analyze further or not.", "If your evidence is likely to the statement, you cannot proceed. However, if it\u2019s unlikely, you can proceed.", "In this section, I will use the data from my previous article, which is the CO2 emission in Indonesia from 1970\u20132015, and I will show you how to test the stationary of the data.", "Before we can find which Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) parameter to choose, we have to test whether the data is stationary or not.", "We can use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) t-statistic test to do this. ADF test is a test to check whether the series has a unit root or not. If it exists, the series has a linear trend. However, if it\u2019s not, we can say that the model is stationary.", "To calculate the p-value, we can use the adf.test function from tseries library on R.", "Given the data, previously we\u2019ve calculated the differencing data from it once, and here is the p-value from ADF test,", "The series still not significant. Therefore, we have to differentiate the series once more, and here is the p-value from the ADF test,", "Now, we have a stationary data, and we can continue our model finding. The series looks like this, so what do you think?", "Right after we got the perfect stationary form of the data, we can identify which Autoregressive and Moving Average parameter that fits the model. To do this, we can identify with the Auto Correlation Function (ACF) and Partial Auto Correlation Function (PACF) plot. You can see the plot below,", "Based on the plot, we know that the ACF and PACF plot has a tail off to zero by time. Because that, we assume that the parameter for the ARIMA model is 1, 2, 1.", "After we identify the parameters, we diagnose the model. We can diagnose the model using sarima function from astsa library on R. For ARIMA(1, 2, 1), here is the result,", "As we can see on the p-value, the AR(1) is not significant. Therefore, we will not use the AR(1) to our model. After we apply once more with ARIMA(0, 2, 1), the result looks like this,", "Because all parameters are significant, we have a good model for the data. The model that we will use is ARIMA(0, 2, 1).", "Right after we got the perfect model, we have to check whether the model surpasses the residual analysis. It is necessary because we can not use the model if the model doesn\u2019t have a normal distribution on its residuals.", "Here shows the plot from residuals by using sarima function,", "As we can see here, the model has a stationary series on its residual and also don\u2019t have any significant autocorrelation with each lag. Additionally, the Ljung-Box Test does not pass the blue line. Therefore, the model meets the requirement for conducting a forecast.", "To make a forecast, we can use sarima.for function from astsa library on R to do this. Here is the forecast will look like,", "I don\u2019t like to say this, but the result is worse than the previous one. In the previous article, the amount of CO2 emission will be around 904.186 kilotons. Now, The amount of CO2 emission will be around 1.024.782 kilotons.", "Take notes, the CO2 emission does not include the forest fire emission. Because of that, we have to consider climate change seriously.", "In conclusion, as you can see on the forecast result, there\u2019s a boundary on it, as the year grows, the boundary is getting bigger. So we cannot say that is the exact number, but at least we know-how is the number growing.", "If the government knows what to do to reduce the amount of CO2 emission, the graph will not happen. However, if no policy exists to stop it, the graph could happen.", "Once again, I have to close this article with this quote.", "\u201cAll models are wrong, but some are useful\u201d \u2014 George Box", "Your home for data science.
