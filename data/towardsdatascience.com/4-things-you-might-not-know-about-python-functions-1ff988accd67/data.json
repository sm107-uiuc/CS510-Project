Despite its protean nature, functions remain an imperative part of the language, and truly understanding this part of the language goes a long way in mastering the language itself. That\u2019s why in this article, I\u2019m going to be going over four of the lesser known aspects of Python functions, which will hopefully give you new insights into Python\u2019s power, regardless of whether you are a Python veteran or complete newbie.", "Introspection, in the programming context, is to examine the code which you have written with more code. The key thing to remember here is that Python functions are essentially objects, which means they have associated attributes and methods which can give you information about the function itself. Most of these attributes are created when you declare the function, but you also have the ability to add new attributes after the fact, just as you would to any other object.", "In fact, a whole wealth of attributes come baked into any function which we define. To see all of these functions, you can simply pass your function into the dir() function (as shown above), and an array of all the available methods and attributes will be returned.", "Some of the interesting attributes are as follows:", "Theres a lot more which you can do with function introspection which I can\u2019t cover in the space of a single article, so definitely open up your IDE and start looking deeper into your functions for yourself!", "Part of the flexibility of Python comes from its nature as a dynamically typed programming language, which in the context of functions means that you can pass in arguments of any type (string, integer, array, boolean), and errors will only arise at run time (e.g if you try to add a string to an array within the function, at which point your program would throw a TypeErrror).", "This is a more flexible approach to programming, because in statically typed languages, such as Java and C++, the types of the function arguments have to be pre-determined, and cannot be changed after the fact. That makes for much more rigid programming and requires more forethought, but it has the benefit of nullifying errors at runtime, and saves the performance cost of error checking during runtime.", "However, some Python programmers opt to use function annotations to help Python behave slightly more like a statically-typed language (although the code remains dynamically-typed), by providing suggested types for all function inputs and outputs. For instance:", "By using annotations, you can still pass incorrect data types into a function, but you are at least given an indication of what the correct types should be, thus reducing the chances of user error. You can also access these annotations by running the help() function on your function, or equivalently, using the Shift + Tab shortcut in Jupyter Notebooks, which returns the docstring, annotations, and other function information.", "Before I explain the value and usage of *args and **kwargs, I need to first explain the notion of packing and unpacking in Python.", "Say we have an array of values, and we want to store each individual value into separate variables. We could achieve this by writing something like so:", "However, this operation becomes trickier when the length of the array is unknown, as we don\u2019t know how many separate variables we need. Moreover, we may want to store the first value as a single variable, but keep the rest of the values inside a new array. This is where the power of unpacking in Python comes in. Using the \u2018*\u2019 symbol, we can essentially store the remaining values within a single array like so:", "The asterisk basically says: \u2018Take any values which haven\u2019t been assigned yet, and store it into a single variable\u2019. This technique works with any iterables, but is particularly useful in the context of packing arguments within a function. It allows us to have an unspecified number of positional and keyword arguments, which we can then index into / iterate over within the function expression. For instance:", "Note that when it comes to function arguments, there is a specific order in which we have to put our arguments:", "What this means is, after we place a *args in our function parameters, the parameters which come afterwards will be automatically treated as keyword arguments. This is best illustrated in another example:", "As you can see, all the positional arguments which come after the first two positional arguments (a and b) but before the first keyword arguments (kw) will be stored in a single tuple, which can be referenced as the variable \u2018args\u2019. The *args parameter essentially exhausts all the remaining positional arguments. Likewise, all the keyword arguments coming after kw will be stored in a dictionary which can be referenced with the variable \u2018kwargs\u2019.", "*Args and **Kwargs are extremely useful in situations where you are uncertain how many arguments a function will take as input, and allows you to be far more flexible when writing functions in Python.", "Lambda functions are Python\u2019s implementation of anonymous functions. If you are unfamiliar with the concept, anonymous functions are essentially the single-use version of normal functions, without a name, and are usually serve the purpose of being passed into higher order functions.", "The syntax for creating a lambda function is as follows:", "The lambda keywords indicates that you are creating an inline function. Then, you provide the parameters to the lambda function, similar to what you would provide in within the brackets of a function definition. Lastly, after the colon, you write the expression itself, which is evaluated when the lambda function is called.", "A good use case for lambda functions is within a map or filter, as it makes for highly Pythonic and compact code. For example, if we want to filter array for values larger than 10:", "This is what I meant by passing a function to a higher order function, as here we are passing the lambda function into the filter() function, which takes an iterable and a function as positional arguments.", "You can actually also create a regular function using a lambda function by simply assigning it to a variable name. That function can now be reused and called just as any other function would.", "I hope you\u2019ve been able to learn something new from this article, and if you have any questions about what I\u2019ve written, feel free to leave a comment below!", "Your home for data science.
