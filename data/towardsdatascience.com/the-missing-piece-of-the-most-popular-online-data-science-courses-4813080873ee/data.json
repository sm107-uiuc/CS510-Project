and AI in the past decade, there have been increasing reports of occasions where AI solutions are not providing the expected results or have unintended consequences.", "There have been numerous reports of bias in AI algorithms that adversely affect certain groups of people in serious ways.", "There are also regulations now, such as GDPR, that call for the right of customers to understand why a company\u2019s model gave a certain outcome for them.", "There is a view among some practitioners that only \u201cgood people\u201d should be working on these algorithms, to avoid problems of bias and other ethical issues. The problem with this argument is that even if we have only \u201cgood people\u201d working on these algorithms (which, in many cases, we do), they still need the tools to look for these biases and understand where issues can arise.", "For example, in a Kaggle survey of data scientists, 66% of those who answered the question, \u201cWhat methods do you prefer for explaining and/or interpreting decisions that are made by ML models?\u201d\u00b9, selected \u201cExamine feature importances\u201d as one of their replies. Even though this was the most popular response, it is known that standard feature importance measures can give misleading results in at least two very popular algorithms, random forest and XGBoost. Only 21% of respondents reported using either of the more advanced techniques SHAP or LIME.", "One way to address this is to educate data scientists, from the beginning, about the possible pitfalls and ethical quandaries that they will almost certainly face once they start working on real-world models. But, how do data scientists learn how to develop state-of-the-art AI algorithms in the first place?", "According to Kaggle\u2019s 2020 \u201cState of Data Science and Machine Learning Survey, 63% of data scientists look to Coursera for ongoing education, while 35% use Udemy and 30% use DataCamp. Besides online learning, 31% take traditional university courses.", "Therefore, I investigated how the most popular online courses are teaching data science, and I propose how we can address what seems to be a major omission in many of these courses that are a gateway for so many into the data science profession.", "As over 60% of data scientists report using Coursera to level-up their data science skills, let\u2019s look at the most popular data science courses there.", "Stanford University\u2019s Andrew Ng has a series of courses on Machine Learning and Deep Learning on Coursera. The \u201coriginal\u201d Machine Learning course, in which so far nearly 4 million people have enrolled, has no mention of explainable AI or biases in machine learning or AI models.", "In Andrew Ng\u2019s Deep Learning specialization, which has so far had over 500,000 people enrolled, the only video related to Responsible AI appears in the 5th, and final, course (which has about half the number of enrollees as the full specialization), with a video called \u2018Debiasing word embeddings\u2019, which discusses a technique to remove biases in language models (for example, when certain professions are more closely associated with one gender over another).", "Interestingly, in another course offered by Andrew Ng, AI for Everyone, which is geared towards a non-technical audience, there is also a lecture video devoted to discrimination and bias in AI.", "Looking towards other online learning resources, Udemy (which 35% of data scientists reported using) has a course called Machine Learning A-Z\u2122: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science, which has had over 700,000 students enrolled. However, it seems to be missing the \u201cE\u201d for explainability, as there are no lectures on explainable AI or uncovering biases in machine learning models.", "Another resource, DataCamp, which 30% of data scientists reported using, has many self-contained mini-courses. A search for ethics or explainable AI brought just one result, a course called \u201cData Science for Business\u201d, which has one short video called \u201cDeep Learning and Explainable AI\u201d. This is a more conceptual course, similar to the \u201cAI for Everyone\u201d Coursera course mentioned above.", "The University of Michigan, which has one of the top Information Systems programs in the U.S., offers a Masters in Applied Data Science. In their curriculum, \u201cData Science Ethics\u201d is part of the syllabus for the introductory course \u201cBeing a Data Scientist\u201d, and there is a dedicated \u201cData Science Ethics\u201d course. After examining their syllabi, they both appear to be non-technical courses. Looking at the syllabi of the more technical courses, such as in NLP or deep learning, there is no mention of ethics or explainable AI.", "Another top school that offers a Masters of Data Science is Harvard University. While the curriculum has no dedicated course in ethics or model explainability, some of the individual courses, such as their \u201cIntroduction to Data Science\u201d and an NLP course, included at least one lecture related to these topics, while other courses, such as their \u201cDeep Learning\u201d and \u201cAdvanced Machine Learning\u201d courses, seem to be lacking.", "In order to round out this section on education and online resources, many people practice their data science skills publicly on Kaggle. Kaggle hosts data science competitions, where cash prizes are given to the top-performing models. Here, this is defined as the models that optimize some metric (essentially, which model gives the most accurate predictions, regardless of the complexity or interpretability of the model).", "There are two angles from which to approach the teaching of Responsible AI. The first is to discuss the ethics involved. For example, if a dataset is known to be biased against a certain population, should something be done about it, and if so, what should be done? The second angle is the technical side. If we agree that such a bias should be addressed, how do we address it? How do we find such biases in the data in the first place?", "A full discussion of ethics is perhaps out of the scope of a standard data science course, but it should be touched upon and relevant resources should be presented so that the student can dive deeper on their own.", "At the very least, there is no reason not to at least have one lecture devoted to the topic of Responsible or Explainable AI in any introductory data science course. Such a lecture, at the very least, should point out where potential pitfalls can arise, how model complexity can potentially affect the explainability or interpretability of a model, and what kinds of biases aspiring data scientists should watch out for when developing their models.", "From the technical side, Explainable AI is certainly a very active research area, and some of the techniques for making models more easily interpretable are so new that many machine learning and AI courses were developed before some of these techniques were even developed. For example, the technique mentioned in the Coursera \u2018Sequence Models\u2019 course is from a 2016 paper, which is recent enough that there are introductory data science courses out there that were created before this.", "However, in a rapidly evolving field like machine learning, courses should be kept as up-to-date as possible. Looking at the Coursera \u2018Machine Learning\u2019 course website, I do not see any mention of what year the course was created or when it was last updated. Such information should be made clear to learners, so that they know they are getting the most up-to-date instruction available in the field.", "In summary, we have reached a point in society where the topic of ethics in AI is being discussed widely. If we are going to actually tackle these issues of biases in AI models and work towards making our models better and more easily interpretable, both aspiring and current data scientists need to learn how to actually develop such models.", "This education should start right from the beginning with introductory data science and machine learning courses.", "[1] I should mention that only 75% of survey respondents actually answered this question, so it is possible there are more data scientists who do not use any of the common, or more advanced, techniques for interpreting their models.", "Your home for data science.
