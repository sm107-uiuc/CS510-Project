If you haven\u2019t coded in Python then I highly recommend spending some time learning the basics and then do your next project in Python.", "Python is one of the most popular programming languages at the moment.", "Have you ever wondered in your Python programming life why Python is called Python and not P, P++ or P#? I have (pun intended).", "The interesting fact is that the programming language Python was implemented by Guido van Rossum.", "Whilst Guido van Rossum was implementing Python, he was also reading the published scripts from Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus.", "If you haven\u2019t heard of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus before, I\u2019ll give a quick overview and maybe we can find the reasons why Python is called Python. Let\u2019s explore!", "Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus is a BBC Comedy TV series from the year 1969+. It is a highly viewed TV series and is rated 8.8 in IMDB.", "Python programming language is highly rated too. According to a recent Stackoverflow survey, Python has overtaken Java in popularity.", "Python is a famous programming language because it is easy to learn and use. Plus there are a large number of libraries available that can be used in your projects today! Some developers even consider it to be a must-know programming language.", "If you read the Python documentation, you will see many examples that are inspired by the Monty Python comedy series:", "You will see mention of spam, eggs, lumberjack, and knights, etc.", "Back to Monty Python, some of the reviewers consider Monty Python to be a must-see comedy series. Why? Well, the show is full of surprises and is complete fun to watch. It is an experimental comedy.", "Python = Inspired By Monty Python", "The comedy series is interesting because it is creative and \u2026well\u2026 random. It talks about everything. It might not be funny for everyone, according to one of the viewers.", "Hey, Python programming language can be used to do any programming task, from DevOps to Data science tasks to Admin work to solving complicated mathematical computations across distributed machines. It is a great language for projects where we want to quickly experiment with a concept and want to bring a product to market fast.", "Having said that, some developers see Python as a prototype programming language only\u00a0(for\u00a0their\u00a0own\u00a0valid\u00a0reasons). Again, not everyone is\u00a0identical,\u00a0right! I really enjoy coding my projects in Python.", "Python programming language is inspired by many languages. Did you know its control and data structures are inspired by ABC. Its identifiers, strings and %-string formats are from C, and its regular expressions are inspired by Perl.", "Now, back to The Monty Python comedy series, it has so many twists that it never gets boring. Thus the show is highly unpredictable, which makes it brilliant.", "A complete landmark in TV history says one of the reviewers.", "Monty Python is an experimental series that covers many topics. It makes the comedy full of unexpected surprises.", "Guido van Rossum wanted to give his programming language a name that was unique, mysterious and short, and what better than naming it Python after Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus.", "Your home for data science.
