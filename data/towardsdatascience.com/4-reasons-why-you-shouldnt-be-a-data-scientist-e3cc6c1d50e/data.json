A\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/terenceshin/", "anchor_text": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/terenceshin/", "paragraph_index": 20}], "all_paragraphs": ["I\u2019m sure most of you have seen HBR\u2019s article, \u201cData Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century,\u201d and they\u2019re not the only ones to have claimed that data science is the holy grail of all jobs.", "A lot of people seem to have this false notion that a data scientist\u2019s job consists only of building these revolutionary, intricate, and impactful machine learning models day and night, and this is simply not true.", "As many of you seek to find a career that suits your interests, or for those who are looking to make a career switch, you might have pondered on the thought of becoming a data scientist. And since you\u2019ve probably only heard about the good parts of data science, I\u2019m going to give you 4 reasons why a data science job might not be for you.", "Data science is an extremely broad term, which means that it means different things for different companies, and so, different companies desire different skillsets. For example, some companies desire machine learning knowledge others desire experimental design and A/B testing, some desire Python programmers and others desire R programmers, etc\u2026 Therefore, the skillset you develop at one company won\u2019t necessarily carry you through your entire career.", "On top of that, data science is a multidisciplinary job. You\u2019re expected to have a certain level of knowledge in programming, statistics, mathematics, business understanding, etc\u2026 which means there you\u2019ll ALWAYS have room to grow in one of these areas.", "Lastly, like everything in tech, data science is constantly evolving. For example, it was only in 2015 that TensorFlow was created, and now, it\u2019s one of the most in-demand skills. As new technologies are created and iterated to be better, you\u2019ll be expected to learn new technologies as well.", "Working on the fun stuff like building machine learning models makes up a small fraction of a data scientist\u2019s job \u2014 I\u2019d argue less than 25% of one\u2019s time.", "A lot of your time will most likely be spent on understanding the data, where it\u2019s coming from and how it\u2019s being manipulated), as well as preparing the data (EDA, data wrangling, feature engineering, etc.). And if you don\u2019t have the data that you need to develop a good model, you\u2019ll have to develop the pipelines to be able to get the data that you need.", "And there\u2019s a simple reason for this. The performance of your model is limited by the quality of data that was used to create it.", "Thus, if the \u201cdirty work\u201d isn\u2019t something that you\u2019re willing to do in order to work on machine learning models, then data science might not be the best route to take.", "As a data scientist, you\u2019re as much of a sales rep as you are a data scientist:", "More often than not, you\u2019ll be working with stakeholders who aren\u2019t as tech-savvy and may not understand the projects that you are working on. Therefore, it\u2019s your job to communicate and educate your co-workers and stakeholders in a manner that is digestible for them.", "As well, you also will be required to break down your data science projects into steps. Business stakeholders care about progress and they want to see how a project is improving over time rather than waiting 5 months for the final result. Thus, you have a responsibility to communicate your progress as well as your outcome(s).", "There isn\u2019t much hand-holding when it comes to data science. It\u2019s your responsibility to get the job done at the end of the day, and if you find yourself getting stuck, you need to be resourceful and find the answer(s) to your problem(s).", "If you need to learn about how XGBoost works or how to build an API, you need to be resourceful and watch YouTube videos, read documentation, or work through a Bootcamp to figure it out.", "As well, you also have to take the initiative to schedule meetings with relevant stakeholders to learn more about the business problem, the desired outcome, and relevant metrics.", "If you\u2019re not the type to be resourceful, take initiative, and persist, then data science might not be for you.", "While this is an opinionated article, I hope that this sheds a bit of light into what data science is. At the end of the day, I still think the pros far outweigh the cons, but I think these are good pointers to think about and consider. As always, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors!", "Not sure what to read next? I\u2019ve picked another article for you:", "Your home for data science.
