You\u2019re in the right place!", "For anyone who doesn\u2019t already know, Google has done the coolest thing ever by providing a free cloud service based on Jupyter Notebooks that supports free GPU. Not only is this a great tool for improving your coding skills, but it also allows absolutely anyone to develop deep learning applications using popular libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.", "Colab provides GPU and it\u2019s totally free. Seriously!", "There are, of course, limits. (Nitty gritty details are available on their faq page, of course.) It supports Python 2.7 and 3.6, but not R or Scala yet. There is a limit to your sessions and size, but you can definitely get around that if you\u2019re creative and don\u2019t mind occasionally re-uploading your files\u2026", "Colab is ideal for everything from improving your Python coding skills to working with deep learning libraries, like PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. You can create notebooks in Colab, upload notebooks, store notebooks, share notebooks, mount your Google Drive and use whatever you\u2019ve got stored in there, import most of your favorite directories, upload your personal Jupyter Notebooks, upload notebooks directly from GitHub, upload Kaggle files, download your notebooks, and do just about everything else that you might want to be able to do.", "Working in Google Colab for the first time has been totally phenomenal and pretty shockingly easy, but it hasn\u2019t been without a couple of small challenges! If you know Jupyter Notebooks at all, you\u2019re pretty much good to go in Google Colab, but there are just a few little differences that can make the difference between flying off to freedom on the wings of free GPU and sitting at your computer, banging your head against the wall\u2026", "This article is for anyone out there who is confused, frustrated, and just wants this thing to work!", "Create a folder for your notebooks", "(Technically speaking, this step isn\u2019t totally necessary if you want to just start working in Colab. However, since Colab is working off of your drive, it\u2019s not a bad idea to specify the folder where you want to work. You can do that by going to your Google Drive and clicking \u201cNew\u201d and then creating a new folder. I only mention this because my Google Drive is embarrassingly littered with what looks like a million scattered Colab notebooks and now I\u2019m going to have to deal with that.)", "If you want, while you\u2019re already in your Google Drive you can create a new Colab notebook. Just click \u201cNew\u201d and drop the menu down to \u201cMore\u201d and then select \u201cColaboratory.\u201d", "Otherwise, you can always go directly to Google Colab.", "You can rename your notebook by clicking on the name of the notebook and changing it or by dropping the \u201cFile\u201d menu down to \u201cRename.\u201d", "Want to use GPU? It\u2019s as simple as going to the \u201cruntime\u201d dropdown menu, selecting \u201cchange runtime type\u201d and selecting GPU in the hardware accelerator drop-down menu!", "You can easily start running code now if you want!

However, if you want to, you can also just go to the left side of the screen and click \u201cupload files\u201d if you don\u2019t feel like running some simple code to grab a local file.", "Google Colab is incredibly easy to use on pretty much every level, especially if you\u2019re at all familiar with Jupyter Notebooks. However, grabbing some large files and getting a couple of specific directories to work did trip me up for a minute or two.", "I covered getting started with Kaggle in Google Colab in a separate article, so if that\u2019s what interests you, please check that out!", "Imports are pretty standard, with a few exceptions.", "For the most part, you can import your libraries by running import like you do in any other notebook.", "PyTorch is different! Before you run any other Torch imports, you\u2019ll want to run", "*** UPDATE! (01/29)*** Colab now supports native PyTorch!!! You shouldn\u2019t need to run the code below, but I\u2019m leaving it up just in case anyone is having any issues!", "Then you can continue with your imports. If you try to simply run import torch you\u2019ll get an error message. I really recommend clicking on the extremely helpful links that pop up. If you do, you\u2019ll get that code right away and you can just click on \u201cINSTALL TORCH\u201d to import it into your notebook. The code will pop up on the left-hand side of your screen, and then hit \u201cINSERT.\u201d", "Not able to simply import something else that you want with an import statement? Try a pip install! Just be aware that Google Colab wants an exclamation point before most commands.", "I did find that Pillow can be sort of buggy, but you can solve that by running", "If you get anything below 5.3, go to the \u201cruntime\u201d dropdown menu, restart the runtime, and run the cell again. You should be good to go!", "It\u2019s easy to create a new notebook by dropping \u201cFile\u201d down to \u201cNew Python 3 Notebook.\u201d If you want to open something specific, drop the \u201cFile\u201d menu down to \u201cOpen Notebook\u2026\u201d", "Then you\u2019ll see a screen that looks like this:", "As you can see, you can open a recent file, files from your Google Drive, GitHub files, and you can upload a notebook right there as well.", "The GitHub option is great! You can easily search by an organization or user to find files. If you don\u2019t see what you\u2019re looking for, try checking the repository drop-down menu!", "Saving your work is simple! You can do a good ol\u2019 \u201ccommand-s\u201d or drop the \u201cFile\u201d menu down to save. You can create a copy of your notebook by dropping \u201cFile\u201d -> \u201cSave a Copy in Drive.\u201d You can also download your workbook by going from \u201cFile\u201d -> \u201cdownload .ipyb\u201d or \u201cdownload .py.\u201d", "That should be enough to at least get you up and running on Colab and taking advantage of that sweet, sweet free GPU!
