This innovation has dramatically shifted how Enterprises leverage their own data, as well as external market data, to try and drive improved business outcomes and competitive standing.", "The more recent \u201cBig Data\u201d Revolution served to further accelerate the pace of Analytics innovations through a perfect storm of 3-related events: (1) web access for smart quants anywhere; (2) easy availability of useful amounts of real data; and (3) cloud-based storage and compute power at ultra low-cost.", "Unfortunately, this Revolution did not benefit the various types of \u201canalytics\u201d (\u201cAI\u201d from here on for clarity) evenly. It brought innovations to Reflexive AI and Interactive AI (as defined below) mostly due to the razor focus of prolific \u201cDigitally Native\u201d research firms such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, eBay, etc.", "These smart, energetic and data-informed Firms were at the right place and time to rapidly move the Revolution forward. They excelled at leveraging the peculiar nature of their data landscapes. They were able to exploit troves of digital, proprietary and centralized data, derived from small numbers of automated and consistent processes; a luxury, and still very much a dream for legacy, brick-and-mortar type firms.", "The consequence of this lop-sided Revolution is that greenfield opportunities remain for driving incremental Enterprise value by expanding the types of AI initiatives. Enterprises can leverage the full complement of AI initiatives, with the investments and priorities for each type informed by claimed estimates, as well as lively discussions, of the value-adds to be anticipated.", "There are four (4) principal AI types, that I refer to as Reflexive, Interactive, Deliberative and Strategic. The first three (3) are transaction-oriented and intuitive, whereas Strategic AI supports a altogether different aspiration. It helps General Managers (\u201cGM\u201d from here on) balance Growth, Profitability and Customer Satisfaction, all whilst staying consistent with firm objectives, philosophies, risk-appetites and other exigencies.", "Enterprise AI Programs over-leverage Reflexive AI (RPA + AI for Back Office automation) and Interactive AI (Chatbots + Q&A Machines enabling self-service) initiatives. They fail to harvest the full value from Deliberative or Strategic AI, even when these are sometimes easier to execute. We shouldn\u2019t expect AI \u201ccoolness\u201d in these solutions, but they can sure be counted upon to improve decision quality and buy-in to deliver better business outcomes.", "Today, Enterprise strategies and policies continue to be driven mostly by \u201cgut feel\u201d and scarily informal processes. Processes in-place enforce accountability loosely, and fail to consistently disseminate learnings about poor decisions and their knock-on effects. Strategic AI is likely to have the largest impact on driving Enterprise Value compared with other types due to its wide-ranging impact on strategic processes.", "The illustration below provides a notional sense of the relative contributions that should be expected from various AI types, Per Dollar invested (the size of the individual boxes reflect the relative value delivered, but I acknowledge that this may not hold for all Enterprises).", "For the rest of this Post, we will focus on Strategic AI. The enabling technology is readily available and a short-term up-front investment is enough to activate Strategic AI initiatives. This initiative will help GMs study various strategy scenarios and the associated financial impacts while deciding on the best strategic gambits in order to drive profitable growth and dominate their Markets.", "In my recent post Machine Intelligence and the Enterprise, I wrote about the challenge of selling GMs on the value of ML-driven insights. I referred to a solution to this problem based on tying together bespoke ML models into a unified and cogent business (\u201cMother of all ML\u201d) view. I am proposing a \u201cGM Workbench\u201d as a Platform to provide such an unified view to analyze and pick winning strategies.", "In this GM Workbench, all models operate simultaneously at the transactional level with results aggregated for Portfolio views of Revenue and Profit. Also, they can track current and various proposed scenarios for easy comparison of the business outcomes. We now return to the examples from my earlier Post to make the ideas presented here more concrete.", "I spoke earlier of RFM models from Marketing, LTM and Demand models from Pricing and Retention models from Operations. If we think about it, we see that each model is driven by some unique variables, as well as other common variables shared with other models.", "In the Financial Services arena for example, Age, Gender, Location and Credit Score variables, inter alia, are common to RFM, LTV, Demand and Retention models. This is useful as it shows us that we can feed inputs from one place for all models. Under the hood, the GM Workbench simultaneously cascades input values for the variables to each model as appropriate.", "We can delve into the analytic value of this approach later. For starters, we should pause and recognize the less obvious but profound benefit of the GM Workbench. It will save GMs the work of having to hunt down and persuade Owners to release their data and associated models to enable routine analyses and insights to inform data-driven strategies and course corrections.", "From an Analytics perspective, the input interface of the GM Workbench is best thought of as reflecting a particular product\u2019s design and associated pricing. Under this metaphor, variable inputs \u201cactivate\u201d particular product features and provide customer risk attributes. These are used, in conjunction with revenue, costs and profit load data, and internal computations to drive LTV and Demand-based Pricing. This pricing in turn, drives RFM and Retention model outputs at the transactional level.", "GMs will, by default, be presented with the Portfolio View of Profit and Growth, which is an aggregate of ML-driven outcomes from the transaction level brought up to the Portfolio and/or Segment levels.", "The \u201cGM Workbench\u201d owes its name to the fact that GMs can use it to try and compare the Financial and Non-Financial impacts of various possible strategic and policy scenarios. More specifically, the Workbench allows GMs to easily execute \u201cWhat-Ifs,\u201d Simulations and Optimization analyses for Portfolios within their remits.", "We expect GMs to create scenarios to study the effect of changing current Customer-mixes, segment-specific growth foci, etc., to arrive at \u201cright for the moment\u201d strategies that will be implemented.", "These type of exercises allows GMs to make the right selections and gambits to reflect their Firms\u2019 philosophies in balancing Profit versus Growth. For example, the illustration above shows that the GM prioritized Growth over Profitability for his Portfolio.", "My team has made great strides to realize the vision for the GM Workbench of the type described above, but we were not alone in this effort. I\u2019d like to thank the Financial Services Domain and Engineering experts from Earnix, an established Optimization Platform seller, and from DataRobot, a popular Auto ML Platform seller, for their extensive help in working out the GM Workbench concept.", "In our work, we looked to DataRobot for ML model-building capability and leveraged Earnix to tie the various models together on a Platform using my Team\u2019s expertise to work out the Implementation blueprints and GSI Service Offerings for Financial Services firms.", "I believe that the time has come for serious investments in building out the Strategic AI solutions like the GM Workbench. Our work with Earnix and DataRobot has shown that we can build the GM Workbench and customize them to individual Client needs over time, so that they can use it to dominate the competition in their Markets.", "I want to close by explicitly laying out the clear motivation for this Post. I am interested in boosting AI work without focusing on any one type over another. Specifically, I am looking for ways to convince firms to underwrite serious AI investments that can potentially deliver outsized Enterprise Value.", "If the promised value, and then some, can be delivered, we can expect to see firms confidently deepen their involvement and investments in all types of AI.", "Your home for data science.
