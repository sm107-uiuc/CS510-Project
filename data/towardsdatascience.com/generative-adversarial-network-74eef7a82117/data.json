It has two main components a generator and a discriminator."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Let us assume Sergio is planning his next big heist and he needs his team to travel to a foreign country. Owing to the nature of his job he has decided to generate fake passports. He doesn\u2019t want to take any chances because he believes that the passport officer can discriminate between original and fake passports. He has decided to use his network of designers and experts to carry out his plans effectively.", "The diagram below represents Sergio\u2019s plan of action in which a fake passport is generated by using the combined skills of the professionals.", "If we were to generalise Sergio\u2019s plan we can say, the diagram is a generator of fake passports. A network of professionals who essentially know the security features of a passports try to recreate a similar one by using their knowledge. In other words given a space the goal is to draw an example which resembles the original space.", "This is precisely what the generator component of a GAN does. It feeds upon the real world examples to observe their features and then create a new example which resembles the original\u00a0examples.", "The following diagram represents the workflow of a passport officer. He checks hundreds of passports daily and Sergio wants his generated passports to be identified as the real ones.", "The passport officer resembles to the second component of GAN called as the discriminator. The job of the discriminator is classification. It identifies the real instances of data from the fake or generated instances of data.", "Under the given circumstances of counterfeiting, Sergio and the passport officer are competing against each other. Sergio wants his generated passports to be categorised as real ones, while the passport officer wants to do a good job of detecting fake passports. This makes them adversaries, hence the name adversarial network.", "Now that we understand about the two components of a GAN let\u2019s see how to train them to obtain a GAN.", "A discriminator is simply a classifier in case of a GAN which labels a given instance as either real or fake. You can use any neural network which suits your problem statement.", "When a discriminator is trained it is fed with examples from real world as positive instances and examples generated from the generator network as negative instances. While training a discriminator the generator is not trained which is to say that its weights are not changed. Simply, the generator\u2019s output is fed to the discriminator as negative instances. If the discriminator then classifies a negative instance as positive or vice-versa it is penalised by the loss function and its weights are updated through backpropagation.", "We have already seen that the job of the generator is to output new data instances. Generator is simply nothing but a neural network. However, neural networks have inputs. In case of generators noise is fed to them as input and eventually it learns to generate perceptible data. For any generated image the generator is penalized if the discriminator classifies it as fake. Only the weights of generator are updated while training it.", "In practice, an iterative approach is used to train a GAN in which you switch between training the generator for one iteration and then training the discriminator for the next iteration.", "Your home for data science.
