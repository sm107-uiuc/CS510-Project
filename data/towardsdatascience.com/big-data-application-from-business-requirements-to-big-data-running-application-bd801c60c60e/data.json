We will cover dealing with big data applications starting from business requirements until the end."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["In this article, I will introduce you to the Big Data terminology. Besides, I will explain when to consider the application you are dealing with from the business requirements as Big Data application. In other words, how to know that we are going to deal with Big Data application starting from the business requirements?", "Big Data has been a while in the market for now, and still attracting people from different domains that are seeking the goals that could be reached only by using such platforms.", "Big Data as it is well known by now, is a term more like a philosophy that can be summarized by its main characteristics which are known to be: Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity, and Value.", "Volume represents the huge volume of the data, in other words, we cannot say that few megabytes or even gigabytes of data can be seen as having the volume that should be treated as Big Data.", "Variety is a term known to be presented when there exist different types and formats of the data such as relational records, JSON files, XML files, unstructured text, media files (images, videos, audios, etc.) which cannot be handled by relational database management system (RDBMS) or by the data warehouse (where the schema is a prerequisite).", "Velocity is how fast the data is arriving at the servers. It plays a major role in existing systems, where everyone is running after getting the insight out of the data in the soonest time. Yes! Speed matters. If we are after detecting some critical information such as a nuclear reactor is misfunctioning which may lead to the death of too many people, disastrous if not handled properly (no one is looking for another Chernobyl disaster).", "Veracity represents the accuracy of the data and how much are these data reliable for the analysis and insights. It is a property of the data that need to be maintained. In order to know the percentage of how much is the data known to be reliable, we should check carefully the accuracy of the data collected and how much is the data cleaned and well-processed.", "Value, as Charles Darwin says, \u201cA man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life\u201d. In this saying, it is clear that we need not waste any time or resources by doing all the processing and not reaching a single objective. Objectives always come first; we need to be careful that we are using this complex infrastructure to get value (insight) out of it.", "Some people were wondering if Big Data is the new replacement of the old traditional reliable RDBMS or the well-known insightful data warehouse. I would like to say to everyone, in my opinion, all are completing each other where every technology playing its own role in the application cycle. Meanwhile, I would like to mention that if you don\u2019t have data with the previous characteristics, try not to build and use Big Data technologies and architectures as it is only increasing the complexity of the system and creating a very high cost which you can avoid.", "Using RDBMS for a simple application is always the best way to do it, as it is reliable and much easier to manage. However, having a Big Data application, it is a new story!", "Gigabytes and terabytes of data every day are ingested to the server cannot be treated anymore with conventional technologies and techniques. It is the new checkpoint; everyone should start forming up their own big data solution that will fit their requirements. As the title says, from business requirements to Big Data running applications. All starts from the business requirements, how can we put all the pieces in the business requirements together and start thinking for the best solution for matching the call. I assure you, that still no standard way to do it. No one can claim that there exist in the literature one solution that fits all the big data application, that is where all the hype started and still going with never stopping.", "For instance, if we need to build a recommendation engine for targeting users on the media websites to gain more engagements and lower the bounce rate. Based on the business requirements, the questions that must be asked by a Big Data Architect are too many.", "How many websites? Just one? Can we have their sources? Is it confidential? Do we need to add just one JavaScript to collect the data and do the trick? The users are registered or don\u2019t matter? Location of the users\u2019 matters? Do these media websites generate keywords or tags? How much data is generated per day? Per month? Per year? What is the different format of the data generated? All unified or not? Can the data be shared with third parties? And so on\u2026", "When we discover the fact that we have many heterogeneous sources of data generating gigabytes daily, we must take that decision and conclude that traditional databases and data warehouses won\u2019t do the trick. Thus, a need for Big data architecture rises to be introduced to a new bunch of big data technologies that need a lot of expertise and training.", "After gathering the requirements, it is time to decide the design of the architecture that we need to proceed with. Lambda architecture is more like a concept in the designing of big data architectures nowadays (however it is not the only one). If we are looking after having both data at rest for training and another speed layer for detection and classification of the coming data records arriving as data streams, this lambda architecture can do the purpose due to its high separation of the different components in which we are replicating the data into different purposes and into different data storage mechanisms. One mechanism that can be a natural fit for storing forever data which is known to be the data at rest data storage and another one for storing batches of the data known as batch views for facilitating the visualization of these data by pushing them into the convenient visualization technology. This architecture is considered the backbone for any big data architect, however, yet, some people found that this might be too complex to deal with. Some applications may only require to have either the speed layer or the batch layer. For example, in some cases, the clustering of users into different categories may result in having only the batch layer and treating the different users depending on their categories (ex. customer segmentation). And other cases, require just the speed layer such as detecting faulty machines based on a certain defined pattern.", "It is more based on the requirements of the application, back to the questions asked previously, the full lambda architecture might be the best fit and that\u2019s due to several reasons:", "In order to build a recommendation engine, it is important to have a batch layer:", "2. We need to train a model (ex. Collaborative filtering) that may run for a few days to get the interests of the stored users", "In order to do the recommendation to the logged-in users/ anonymously reading users, it is important to have a speed layer:", "1. Fetch the identifier of the user", "2. Get the generated articles that might be of interest for this user", "This is just an example that can show you how to carefully analyze the requirements and translate them into practical architecture.", "Selecting the proper technologies is a real pain. Big data ecosystem consists of many tools and technologies that most of them are incubated by the Apache Incubator.", "The first word after arriving this far that we are going to hear, Hadoop! Yes, that yellow elephant, I don\u2019t know why it is yellow, but all I know is that it is the heart of Big Data.", "Stay tuned to the next article where I cover in-depth Big Data tools and technologies\u2026", "Your home for data science.
