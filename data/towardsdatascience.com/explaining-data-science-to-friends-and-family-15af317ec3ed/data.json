You prepare yourself for the question that is almost always asked when you mention your profession. Despite having answered this question many times before you still feel like your audience leaves more confused than informed. As you stand there thinking of different ways you might answer this time around, the person raises the question:", "So what does a Data Scientist do?", "Now what? You still want to keep them interested and not bore them with technical details. You also don\u2019t want to come across as condescending or patronizing with a \u201cI think I\u2019m smarter than you\u201d impression. So what to do? How do you simply explain what a Data Scientist is? Let\u2019s take a step back and first explain what Data Science is.", "If you need to explain the profession of Data Scientist to the everyday person, you may first need to explain what Data Science actually is. Data Science could be simply described as a method of scientifically testing data for insights and conclusions. The methods and techniques used to go about testing that data is vast but probably not necessary for a brief description of the subject.", "Data Science heavily involves coding, usually in the programming language of Python or R, but mostly Python as of late. It\u2019s associated with statistical analysis and modeling. With both of these statistical concepts, conclusions and applications can be made with the right data.", "What is the right data? How is this data achieved? Well, most sources of data come from large databases that a corporation or individual manages. Many businesses nowadays have been utilizing Data Science to analyze their vast amounts of data in order to make strategic decisions or gain insights on their own business.", "Other records of data can be gathered from a process called \u201cweb-scraping\u201d which involves using a programming language, Python in this specific case, to navigate to different websites. Once at each website, data can be acquired from various sections on the webpage.", "When we have all the data we need, then we can proceed with using Data Science to analyze and draw conclusions from that data.", "Okay, now that you know the explanations of the basics of Data Science, let\u2019s try to make it sound more interesting. One thing that you could direct people\u2019s attention to is Artificial Intelligence or AI. As a Data Scientist, one of your primary concerns is working with AI. Most people have heard about AI and are super fascinated with the idea thanks to science fiction media like the Terminator franchise. AI is such a big buzzword today that merely mentioning that you deal with the application of it will surely raise some eyebrows.", "Along with the application of AI, you can delve deeper into the Data Science playbook and bring up Machine Learning. Machine learning is another buzzword that will grab people\u2019s attention quickly since a good number of them have also heard about the concept.", "These buzzwords of AI and Machine Learning may be able to grab people\u2019s attention but a large chunk of your audience may not even know what it actually is. Many people have heard about these terms but then you again run into the dilemma of trying to explain a complex subject in a short conversation.", "You might be able to simplify AI and Machine Learning by just saying that it is the application of computers to automate and advance modern technology. All in all, these concepts should be able to stand on their own as attention grabbing topics that should be enough to fascinate everyone with your profession as a Data Scientist.", "Another question that might arise is how you contribute to a company\u2019s bottom line. We briefly talked about how a Data Scientist deals with a company\u2019s large database. You can bring up how, as a Data Scientist, your primary role with a company is to make actionable insights into the data that a company has collected over the years.", "The data this company collects can range from anything to a customer\u2019s preferences in attire to whether or not they click \u201cNext Episode\u201d on a specific show. This data holds such a large amount of information that needs to be processed and that is where you come in as the Data Scientist in charge.", "You are able to work and manipulate this data into something presentable. You will present it in such a way where you and the company might discover new relationships in the data that may have not been noticeable before. From these relationships, the company can make some strategic decisions to either enhance or diminish these connections in the data. Another thing you might be able to provide value to the company is by developing applications that range from detecting fraudulent transactions to forecasting sale prices.", "In the end, a Data Scientist plays an important role in the company in determining future decisions. Most large companies have so much data collected in recent years that they need Data Scientists to help organize and analyze the data. As more and more data is created and collected, the need for Data Scientists will keep growing as well.", "As you can see, there are numerous ways you can un-complicate the complex subject of Data Science. It may sound intimidating and perplexing but if you break it down to its smaller part it will seem much more manageable to digest. The more conventionally attractive parts of Data Science such as Machine Learning and AI will definitely bring in a crowd. Everyone uses technology daily and will know a little bit about those two terms.", "As long as you don\u2019t come across as condescending, you should be able to explain Data Science and your profession to the everyday person without much trouble. Hopefully, now you won\u2019t struggle so much with describing what you do to family and friends. Perhaps you might even inspire some of them to become Data Scientists!", "Your home for data science.
