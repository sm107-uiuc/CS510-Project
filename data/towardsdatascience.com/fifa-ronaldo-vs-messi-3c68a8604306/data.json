As a long time gamer and having played the game for the last 12 years, there has always been this lingering question as to how the gaming franchise determines the rating of a particular player in the game. Besides that, there has been an endless debate among the gaming community as to why Ronaldo is rated higher than Messi and vice-versa. To put an end to this debate let us build a Machine Learning Model to predict the rating of a player and determine the most important player attributes behind it.", "Rating is an attribute of the player that conveys how well he plays in the game and ranges on a scale of 0 to 100 with the latter being the best.", "The dataset is available in Kaggle and contains detailed attributes of 18,207 real life players registered across various continents such as America, Europe, Asia and Africa in the database along with 90 different attributes of the player.", "The variables in the dataset can be broadly classified into the following", "The aforementioned categories excluding Player details are numeric on a scale of 0 to 100. For instance, if a player (say Messi) has a dribbling score of 98 and a tackling score of 56, it indicates that the player is an attacking player and a not so good defender.", "The first step in building the model is to perform the normality test of the response variable by both graphical (Histogram) and statistical method. The skewness measure turned out to be 0.084 which is close to zero. As a general rule of thumb, if the skewness is between -0.5 to + 0.5, the distribution is approximately symmetric.", "The above histogram represents the count of players (in the y -axis) and the rating of the players along the x-axis. Based on the histogram for the response variable and the skewness measure, it can be seen that the response variable is normally distributed.", "Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning technique capable of performing both regression and classification tasks using multiple decision trees and a statistical technique called bagging.", "For this Model, the dataset was split into test and train in the ratio of 80:20 and the value of mtry (No. of variables tried at each split) was set at 12.", "The number of trees built was set to default (i.e., 500) and the model has an accuracy of 99.05% in predicting the response variable (i.e the rating of a particular player)", "Let us now plot the variable-importance measures and determine the significance of the variables", "The above plot denotes the percentage increase in MSE of the predictions and node impurity as a result of the variables being permuted (higher the Number the more importance). Based on the MSE plot on the left, the three most significant variables are as follows", "Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems that produce a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models. Gradient boosting essentially combines weak learners into a single strong learner in an iterative fashion. As each weak learner is added, a new model is fitted to provide a more accurate estimate of the response variable.", "Let us now see how the gradient boost model compares with Random forest in terms of determining the important variables.", "The above Model is a Gradient Boosted Model which generates 500 trees with a shrinkage parameter of lambda=0.01 which is a sort of learning rate. Next parameter is the interaction depth d which is the total splits we want to do. So here each tree is a small tree with only 4 splits.", "Let us now compute the Test Error as a function of the number of Trees. It can be seen that the Mean square error reduces as the number of trees increases.", "The summary of the Model gives a feature importance plot. In the below list the variable on the top is the most important variable and at last, is the least important variable.", "The most important features, according to the Gradient boosting model besides Player value, are Reactions and Wage", "The most important feature based on both these models is the cost of the player in the transfer market. Besides that, the most common features among the top five in no particular order are \u2014 Age, Release Clause and Reactions.", "It was quite a surprise to see the variable Reaction featured in the list. It should be noted that Reactions is the only player attribute which is impervious to external factors", "Now, at least we know that Electronic Arts\u2019 (EA) does not randomly assign the rating of the player. As far as the Ronaldo Vs Messi debate is concerned, we all can agree that the brand ambassador of the game tends to get a higher rating.", "Generalized linear models, in addition to the tree-based modeling approach we explored earlier, would also be able to elucidate the player ratings given that there exists a strong linear correlation between these variables", "Let's connect on LinkedIn | Find the code on GitHub", "Your home for data science.
