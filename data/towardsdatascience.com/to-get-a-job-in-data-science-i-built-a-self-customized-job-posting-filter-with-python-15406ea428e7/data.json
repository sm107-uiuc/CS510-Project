Sponsored postings that are unmatched keep popping up to annoy you, let along the same jobs recurring when you try different search terms, just to increase the workload further.", "Besides, the spectrum of data science is so wild that it adds another multiplier to the difficulty of searching. With one title \u201cdata scientist\u201d, you can get descriptions that are actually poles apart.", "But have you thought of letting the dream job find you instead? After the pain of endless search, I decided to build a tool using Python to help efficiently manage the job postings and prioritize those match me the most.", "The first thing is to collect sufficient data-related job postings. Here I chose indeed.com and used keywords ranging from \u201cdata scientist\u201d and \u201cmachine learning\u201d to \u201cdata analyst\u201d and \u201cdata visualization\u201d.", "To specify my preference, I used filters to limit job locations and experience levels. Below is a screenshot of how the URL of a result page is like.", "With that, We can construct codes to collect job postings. To continue, make sure you have Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and ChromeDriver downloaded and configured in your machine. (Please put the file \u201cchromedriver\u201d under the same folder you place your Jupyter notebook.)", "First, I created a tool to generate URL links so I won\u2019t need to open a new tab and visit Indeed when I want to change search settings.", "Type in your preference and search terms, and you will get the link used for web-scraping:", "I used Selenium to handle the web-scraping task, because it performs nicely especially when you have to interact with webpages to get information.", "For example, there are 10+ job posting cards on every page, and you need to click each card to navigate to the respective job description. In this case, .click() can bring up the content for us. Also, a popup window will appear on the second result page, so I added a line to press Esc(escape) key in order to close the window.", "I wrote the following codes to retrieve information of interests: job title, location, company, job description, date released, and if it is urgently hiring. I also web-scraped job IDs to generate new URLs that direct me back to certain posting webpages.", "I ran the above codes for different search terms to gather a job posting pool. Then I merged the datasets and dropped duplicates. I got a total of 650+ unique observations from the original 900+ scraped postings. (Can\u2019t imagine how I can go through this large number of job descriptions!)", "After that, I did some text processing with regard to dates and job descriptions:", "Here comes the main dish: building a customized job selector. My approach is as follows:", "The first thing I did was to make a table containing all the skillsets I have. I came up with several categories and fed them with some keywords (and of course you can have your own version depending on what kind of jobs you aim to find). The table will be utilized to do phrase extraction from job descriptions.", "How the keyword table looks like:", "I used the following codes to create word lists for matching.", "For each category, I calculated how many keywords in my list are mentioned in each of the job descriptions. For instance, in the category \u201cMachine Learning\u201d I listed 8 keywords. If 3 of them appeared in a certain job description, then the value for the label \u201cMachine Learning\u201d will be 3.", "After labeling all the job postings with the skillsets, I created some new metrics for further comparison. These metrics are set up according to my profile and job preference.", "I live in San Francisco and I prefer to work in the Bay Area to avoid relocation. So I created a label named relocate and put a \u201c1\u201d if its location is outside the Bay Area.", "If a job is newly released (within the past 5 days), it definitely worth applying because it means my resume would have higher exposure.", "I also care about the programming languages required. If a posting doesn\u2019t specify any languages in R, Python, or any DBMS Languages (such as SQL), it\u2019s probably not a match for me since the job might be too \u201cbusiness\u201d or too \u201chardcore\u201d on the spectrum of data science.", "I built a metric called \u201cbasic_analytics\u201d to flag the most fundamental skills such as data manipulation and data visualization.", "Then using similar methods, I created metrics for advanced analytics skills and specialized skills.", "A way to quantify to what extent a job matches you is to build an overall posting score. The overall score of a posting is defined as the weighted sum of the metrics mentioned above. Again, this is quite flexible and the weights can be adjusted according to your needs.", "I gave advanced analytics skills relatively high weights because I prefer jobs that require knowledge and practice more in machine learning algorithms and modeling.", "Finally, I sorted the postings by their overall scores. The final table and a histogram showing the distribution of scores:", "With this handy tool, I can prioritize the jobs with higher scores and prepare my resume accordingly. It\u2019s much more convenient, time-saving and it makes my job searching process more manageable.", "You can also utilize this script to make your own customized job selector, and bring it to higher levels by adding more features.
