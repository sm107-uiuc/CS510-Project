The technology carries enormous promise, but all the noisy hype makes it daunting or intimidating to filter out where the value actually is, and, how to make use of the existing AI components that are already easily available and accessible.", "While everyone is talking about AI as the next leap forward in business and people\u2019s lives, the natural emotional questions for most business leaders at all levels are the following:", "In this post, I am making an attempt to outline a real strategy for success in AI and data science by separating out the emotions of hype. I will attempt to lay this out in a simple to understand research and development process for a successful AI or data science project. It will be based on the hard lessons learned from many projects.", "Before getting to the business case driven research and development process, I will try to clarify \u201cThe Big Terms\u201d a bit so we are all on the same page. There is lots of buzz around each of these them, but don\u2019t let yourself be intimidated or carried away by those. Especially because those often mean different things to different people, because of heavy hype and overuse.", "You may have noticed me use the terms AI (artificial intelligence) and data science interchangeably above. I did it deliberately. AI as a term seems to be present in lots of hype while talking about data science applications, it is an attention grabber, it has a certain coolness to it, evoking us feel like we live in the brink of a sci-fi world. But technically speaking, \u201cAI\u201d is a rather fuzzy term, with no clear boundaries, a kind of catch-all for every discipline that makes machines to look and behave (somewhat) intelligently.", "This term is the youngest in the family. It refers to anything that involves data analysis and algorithms, especially the science behind them: big data analytics/data mining, machine learning, statistics, mathematics, information and computer science.", "Is it AI or DS then?", "From now on, in this post, I am going to stick more with the term \u201cdata science\u201d for the \u201call-combining\u201d purpose.", "Some wise person (I don\u2019t recall exactly who that was) said once that as long as something is called AI, we\u2019re dealing with \u201cscience fiction\u201d. But as soon, as it\u2019s implemented in real life, it becomes just a \u201ccomputer science\u201d, not AI anymore. This might explain why AI always seems to be about future rather than past or even present, though much of what we already use in our everyday lives would have certainly been considered sci-fi stuff just ten years ago.", "Probably for the same reasons I personally use the AI term when I am in a playful mood with friends, talking about AI singularity, or when in the \u201csalesman mode\u201d \ud83d\ude09 attempting to catch the attention. When I am hacking at home, experimenting, learning, fooling around with Kaggle competitions, or discussing projects and strategies with my team, I talk about and look up for data science.", "This applies to naming the teams as well \u2014 most likely you would have a data science team work on any of your AI or data science business opportunities. Such a team would consist of data scientists (data science PhD-s who can handle the scientific side of the data exploration, research and validation of the business opportunities), and data engineers, who know how to handle big data frameworks, how to implement the research outcomes into operational environments, etc.", "Machine learning almost sounds like artificial intelligence, but in data science community it\u2019s a bit more concrete and technical term, referring to the specific components or processes in AI that are focused on the learning part of a machine\u2019s intelligence. There are many machine learning algorithms, like (deep) neural nets, decision trees, Bayesian, \u2026, etc, and application areas or data that these can be applied to. The data could be anything, ranging from transaction data to images, videos, audio and vibration pattern analysis, even music, natural language processing (NLP), sensory diagnostic data for predictive maintenance use cases, etc. In essence, these algorithms are all based on some sort of statistical procedures.", "This term essentially refers to any data that exists in amounts too large to be handled or analyzed by \u201ctraditional\u201d data handling tools in a single computer, which in turn calls for specific methods for solving problems related to handling heavy loads of data. The heavy load issues could come, for example, from the size of the data storage needed (calling for distributed storage and retrieval systems), or from the need to process information near real-time (call for machine learning methods), etc.", "There are obviously quite a few more closely-related terms you may encounter when working on this topic, including data mining, big data analytics, business intelligence (BI), etc, but for the sake of brevity, I\u2019ll limit myself to those few boldest ones that decorate the hype scenery today.", "2. Setting Up a Data Science Strategy \u2014 the Prerequisite Understanding", "Establishing a data science strategy starts with understanding its basic promise, applicability, and limitations.", "2.1 The Basic Promise of Data Science in business", "In terms of business, data science is useful for two main reasons. It helps you seek out new revenue streams and helps you avoid losing money due to inefficiencies, fraud, or in human error, and it does so by looking at your data and applying data analytics and machine learning tricks on it.", "An example. I worked as a back-end developer on Skype during its early years, back in 2005. As soon as Skype launched it\u2019s first premium feature, SkypeOut calls and skyrocketed its revenues, it also started to lose about 10% of its revenues due to credit card fraud charge-back requests and penalties and was being threatened by the payment provider to be shut down if we didn\u2019t find ways to reduce the fraud. initially, we were developing different kinds of hard-coded fraud checks to block the most obvious fraud patterns, but it was a fight with a windmill \u2014 fraudsters were good enough at adapting their behaviors so that humanly analyzed and hard-coded fraud-pattern checks became irrelevant just days after the program\u2019s deployment. At some point, I started to develop a Na\u00efve Bayesian based machine learning pipeline and ended up with one that was successfully able to detect 90% of the fraudulent transactions in real-time, with false-positive rate kept below 0.1%. In addition, it was able to learn new fraud patterns in near real-time, maintaining its efficiency despite evolving forms of fraud.", "2.2 The Applicability of AI in business", "The good thing about data science is that its main forms of implementation strategy are rather agnostic to the field that you apply them onto. Wherever you have data piling up or streaming around, there is a good chance you have untapped opportunities hidden there for huge positive impacts.", "A top-caliber data science team is usually able to handle any type of data in the same fashion, whether dealing with transactions, images, videos, audio, vibrations, natural language text processing, etc. The applications with a significant business value based on these data could include credit scoring, fraud detection, customer lifetime value prediction, image recognition, predictive maintenance, natural language processing (NLP) chatbots, intrusion detection (in cybersecurity), conversion and churn predictions, to name a few.", "2.3 The Limitations of AI in business", "So far it all looks like an ordinary software project, right? Just some bit of a coolness thrown in with the touch of AI and that\u2019s it? Wrong!", "Here comes the thing that sets data science projects significantly apart from average software projects, that makes it extremely messy and almost certainly your time-and-money-wasting project if you don\u2019t beware its limitations, and, on the other hand, makes it nicely controllable successful contribution to your business strategy, if you take the difference fully into account.", "The significant difference between a data science project and an ordinary software project is rooted in its main limitations:", "1. The nature of probability. In the context of business use cases, machine learning algorithms work through probability, not determination. You will always have the question of accuracy when taking its answers into account. Remember the fraud detection example above \u2014 there will always be some amount of \u201cfalse negative\u201d and \u201cfalse positive\u201d outcomes, but detecting 90% of fraud (which translated to avoiding loss of 9% of revenues) still put the company in a significantly better situation, removing the risk of having its payment provider discontinue service, avoiding significant losses, and, for the greater good, making the day harder for fraudsters \u2014 even at the price of losing some less than 0.1% of the legitimate transactions.", "If your business case has zero tolerance for \u201cfalse\u201d answers, you simply can\u2019t apply these methods. However, if your business case can work with accuracy that\u2019s \u201cgood enough,\u201d then it simply becomes a question of achieving that \u201cgood enough\u201d result.", "For example, in a very extreme case of self-driving cars, where you have cascades of AI components in play, one might ask how it is okay to have errors there!? The answer is that there may be \u201cerrors\u201d (in machine learning terms) in the system\u2019s sensory real-time data analytics, but these can be narrowed down to individual components in combination with the application of certain robustness principles \u2014 which call for never relying on a single data source or sensor \u2014 in such a way that these errors won\u2019t cause danger to anyone\u2019s property or health.", "2. The question of do-ability. Data science\u2019s probabilistic nature leads to another important question: even if your business case is capable of accepting some \u201cfalse\u201d answers in course of actions, is the \u201cgood enough\u201d level of accuracy achievable at all? You could develop the entire framing software that integrates your machine learning algorithm seamlessly into your operational environments, it scales etc, but if the ML algorithm is really unable to make decisions with the accuracy that would make sense for your business case, then all the product development around it would be a waste, if not even counterproductive.", "And that\u2019s a constant reality of data science projects \u2014 the necessary accuracy is not always achievable (at least not on the first try).", "Having laid out the above notes, what follows is actually quite simple and straightforward.", "At the heart of any data science project is the established question you want your system to answer. When you think about your first (or the next) AI application, make sure you know exactly what question you\u2019ll be answering, and be certain it has a clear link to your business impact.", "Step 2: Determine what \u201cgood-enough\u201d accuracy will mean for you", "Once you\u2019ve established your project\u2019s question \u2014 but before starting to pour money, time and other resources into heavy development work \u2014 it is important to determine how good you\u2019ll have to be at answering this question in order for your business case to make sense. In other words, you\u2019d need to quantify for your system some kind of a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) target that makes sense in the business case.", "An example. In case of fraud detection, you want to be sure what is acceptable rate of false positives while implementing an automated transaction blocking when a fraud detection gets triggered. The KPI target could be for example, that for each 10% of detected actual fraud it is acceptable to have 0.01% of false positives, for the automated transaction blocking to make sense. That in practice gives a strong guidance to data scientists, who probably would get quite a reasonable chunk of fraud isolated easily, and then, for another chunk, where the certainty is not so good anymore, some other measure (than simple automated blocking) could be applied.", "Step 3: Data Exploration, Research, and Impact Validation", "Up until this step in the process you don\u2019t spend almost any resources, other than some basic work to identify the question and establish the KPI target that makes sense.", "Now the critical question is: can it really be done? Can your question be answered with a level of quality that will exceed your minimum KPI threshold? This is the business impact validation step. Its aim is to identify all the relevant data sources, explore, manipulate, restructure and tidy up the data, work out the machine learning models, etc. that would be able to create the impact. The outcome of this step includes training, test and validation data sets, which allow you to demonstrably confirm the doability of your product before the actual software product development for it even begins.", "By using the term \u201cdemonstrably,\u201d I\u2019m referring to the repeatability of the process according to scientific standards and qualities \u2014 remember, we are dealing with data scientists (often PhD-grade) at work, with an emphasis on the word scientist. One of the key qualities of the scientific method is repeatability. This means that, technically, the outcome of your research and data exploration includes all of the exact steps, scripts, and data dictionaries showing exactly how the data was obtained, transformed, and divided into training, test and validation datasets, the machine learning model(s) and demonstration instructions.", "As you can imagine, this is the first step where it becomes necessary to invest some initial resources, given that research and data exploration are efforts that need to be performed by specifically skilled people. Still, this is usually kept quite lean and mean compared to the product development project, that follows. The idea here is to avoid investing in product development as long as the project\u2019s do-ability is still up in the air. Investing in product development only makes sense once the research has validated the impact. You would need to be willing to risk investing into those validation cycles, applying reasonable money management methods and per-project stop-loss decision-making strategies to your funds. But, unless you enjoy messy corporate roller coasters, you shouldn\u2019t risk investing in product development before validating your business impact in data speculations.", "When research fails to validate the speculated impact during initial sprint cycles, there could be a couple of reasons why:", "Once your research in Step 3 has been successful, develop the appropriate data product around the results in such a way that it seamlessly integrates into your operational environment, scales, and makes you capable of creating the real impact.", "This stage looks more like a regular software product development. Here you would apply the same principles, starting from the ideation and design sprints (if UI interactions are involved), to validate that the target users are going to grasp the new product and embrace the idea. You would then develop your first MVP (the Minimum Viable Product) to further validate you\u2019re on the right track, but this time with hard evidence from the field, and iteratively continue developing your product and adding impact to your business case.", "As long as the product stays relevant, you\u2019ll typically always have something to improve. In addition to regular software development part of the product, you\u2019ll keep monitoring on the performance of the data science part of the product, occasionally revisiting research cycles to either troubleshoot changes in the data sources or strengthen/optimize the impact of the outcome.", "Hopefully, the process layout above can shed some light on ways on how you can start with bringing a data science on board your company. In real life, as successful products go, there will be more continuous nested development cycles going on one after another, and principles you\u2019ll apply to carry them out will evolve as you learn and familiarize yourself with the subject. Still, the essence for a thriving data science project remains the same: the successful data science product is a product of a research-first project, and the successful data science product pipeline strategy is based on such projects.", "The main driver of the success is essentially maintaining these two principles throughout the process, never forgetting these at any steps:", "If you\u2019re a successful entrepreneur, you probably already know that most of the big things have started from a myriad of experimentation. It is not different in the data science field either. Here are a few hints for recognizing data science opportunities.", "It is generally a good idea to maintain a habit of brainstorming for new, exciting ideas \u2014 no matter what field you may be working. So spend some time regularly thinking about your business as well as the work you put into it, and remember that good product ideas can emerge from the most painful problems.", "The kind of issues that best lend themselves to be resolved with data science methods are, as the name suggests, those where data can be analyzed with scientific rigor. As mentioned above, the data in question could be anything: transactions, images, audio signals, natural language texts, video clips, temperature fluctuations, other environmental sensory data, and so on.", "When coming across a potentially interesting (impactful) idea, start thinking about quantifying its impact (remember KPI target), what kinds of data do you have that can be analyzed, and the ways in which you could validate your speculations.", "Your home for data science.
