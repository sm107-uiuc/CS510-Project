As the data landscape expands every second every day; and data becomes ubiquitous and easier to collect, personal data is massively being mined and stored for being revitalized in the application of location tracking, healthcare, predictive policing, predictive justice, fraud detection, advertising, media, and entertainment. But, at the same time, it gives rise to some new issues in relation to the waves of the big data effects, e.g. data and privacy breaches, etc.", "Such new issues may be exemplified some questions: If you are not doing hazardous work, should your employer ask for your blood group? When you are for a medical service, should the doctor ask for your religion or ethnicity? Can your recruiter ask for details of health conditions if you are not applying for a manual job?", "In addressing issues akin to these questions in the data ocean, it is the data minimization principle that can help you to stand out. Being a core privacy principle and standard procedure, the principle of data minimization in fact arises as a solution to the mitigating risks of data Tsunami. The significance of the principle is thus being enhanced with enthusiasm in the big data world we live in now.", "What is \u2018Big Data\u2019 is not a cardinal context within my discussion. However, in order to have contextual clarification, it can be taken up in a brief dialogue. The term basically \u2018refers to novel ways in which organizations, including government and businesses, combine diverse digital datasets and then use statistics and other data mining techniques to extract from them both hidden information and surprising correlations\u2019 (Rubinstein, 2013).", "Big Data is actually a methodology that involves new analytic techniques based on AI and machine learning techniques, the objective of which is to find \u2018small patterns\u2019 or \u2018hidden correlation\u2019 that reveal new insights or truths. Furthermore, Big Data is now better known for its\u2019 characteristics 4Vs, i.e. volume, veracity, velocity, variety (data fusion), and machine learning.", "To demystify, what\u2019s \u2018big\u2019 in big data isn\u2019t necessarily the size of the databases, it\u2019s the big number of data sources, it is big (mixed data, see Steward, et al. 2019), because the large volume of the real-time data is stored from a variety of sources with random sampling, processed, and produced, in the way of data fusion to create complete-automated-insights.", "Sources of big data are all around us and can roughly be divided into business data, human data, and machine data from the internet of things. Surprisingly, when Big Data is applied in the legal context, it raises serious deep concerns, and sparks serious debate on its biased, opaque, and discriminating effects.", "The data minimization principle is one of the general principles of data protection, which ideally suggests that the amount of data collected should be the minimal amount of data necessary to conduct business.", "The principle primarily posits the practice of limiting the collection and retention of personal data to that which is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish a specified purpose; that is to say, organizations should only collect and retain the minimum amount of data as much as possible.", "For example, if it\u2019s for a medical service, gender may be more relevant than religion or ethnicity. An individual applying for an office job should not be asked for details of health conditions.", "Instead of the \u2018save everything approach\u2019, embracing a data minimization policy in the context of personal data protection is to be prioritized, and unnecessary data is to be discarded while keeping only what\u2019s relevant and necessary. Moreover, that data should be retained only as long as necessary or required by laws or regulations.", "As one of the EU data protection values, data minimization is instantiated in the 2018 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Articles 5, 25, 47, and 89. Amid seven basic data protection principles under EU data protection law, the very principles lie at the heart of the law embodying as the spirit of the regulatory framework [GDPR, Chapter 2, Article 5 (1) \u00a9].", "According to this Regulation, personal data shall be \u2018adequate, relevant, and limited\u2019 to what is \u2018necessary\u2019 in relation to the \u2018purposes\u2019 for which they are processed (data minimization). Information having no value for a particular research question should not be collected by the researcher. The principle lies at the heart of the law and embodies the spirit of the regulatory framework.", "While building an email subscription list, collecting anything more than name and e-mail (e.g. Date of Birth, Religion, etc.), might not be in compliance with GDPR. Details of the blood groups of the employees from hazardous work may be necessary. But, holding by the employer such data of the rest of the workforce is likely to be irrelevant and excessive.", "Under the GDPR, if the personal data that deems incomplete or insufficient in achieving the purpose of the processing is not \u2018adequate\u2019; and considering the context and nature, individuals have the right to complete that data (right to rectification; e.g Article 16, GDPR). Even further processing is however permissible if the new purpose is not incompatible with the old purpose.", "Individuals have also the right to get you to delete any data that is not necessary for your purpose (right to erasure, or right to be forgotten). Hence, in case of a breach of the data minimization principle, Individuals will also have the right to erasure (e.g. Article 17, GDPR). In default, legal actions can be taken by individuals.", "The GDPR also provides for an exception to the data minimization principle which permits the longer retention of personal data for \u2018statistical purposes\u2019. Those data, retention of which is no longer necessary, will be deleted. This obligation gives more teeth to the principle of data minimization.", "The principle of data minimization is also incorporated in the 2018 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and in other regulations such as the 1988 (Australian) Privacy Act. In fact, the first regulatory issue concerns personal data protection and consumer protection; then comes to ensuring the application of consumer law on big data technologies.", "In the European context, infringements of the basic data protection principles may lead to substantial fines, a fine of up to \u20ac20 million, or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher (Article 83(5)(a) of GDPR). The principle is thus more or less stringent, depending on the consequences which may ensue upon data processing jurisdictions.", "Henceforth as the principle mandates, every data which is stored requires to be filtered through a series of objectives. If the data does not fit into any of the intended purposes, then the data should be discarded.", "In Turkey, a bank faced sanctions for violating the principle of data minimization because the bank provided a six-month account statement of its customer to a civil court when the court only asked for the statement of the last three months. An Italian school was fined (pursuant to the principle) for unlawful data processing, that is to say, for having disseminated personal data of pupils (minors) by posting on the entrance door without a sufficient legal basis.", "As the first case under the GDP in 2018 March, the Danish Data Protection Authority fined Taxa, a taxi company, an amount of 1.2 million kroner (US$180,000) for the preservation of the personal data relating to about 9 million individual taxi rides, beyond the lawful two-year retention policy. The authorities should also check out whether the data retention policy is duly made and carefully followed.", "In France, a fine of 250,000 euros has been imposed on an online retailer \u2018Spartoo\u2019 in August for a breach of the data minimization principle, among others, full and permanent recording of telephone calls received by customer service employees was held to be excessive.", "The recording and conservation by the online seller of customer bank details, communicated when orders are placed by telephone, was also \u2018not necessary for the intended purpose\u2019. Even, in the context of the fight against fraud, in addition to requesting for the identity card, the collection of the customers\u2019 health-card-copies, which contain more data than the identity-card, was found to be excessive and irrelevant.", "Although the data minimization approach is alleged to have crippling effects on big data analytics, it has numerous benefits. It basically reduces cost and prevents data breaches from being catastrophic, and subject to charges of criminal negligence. In fact, holding data which is not necessary can bring you more harm than good.", "The risk of data loss and computer hacking is also minimized when only the necessary data is stored up. Hence, data classifications, and having clear and sound data policies on processing, retention, and access by design or by default, and reviewing data on a periodic basis can rescue venture from data explosions.", "The principle also suggests individuals adopt a DIY (do-it-yourself) approach to protect their personal data by the way of data anonymization, when not possible, pseudonymization, or through the use of cryptography, browser plugins that manage cookies, or block tracking, and other tools used to minimize data collection, although there is also the risk of re-identifying anonymous personal data. Henceforth, it is now safe to opine that the principle benefits both the company and the individuals alike.", "\u2018Less data\u2019 to be provided may also result in to be much easier, quicker, and user-friendly in an online transaction. Noticeably, privacy policies have thus expanded rapidly on commercial websites as fair practice including data minimization approach, to notify users about the collection and use of their personal data, even in the absence of any comprehensive law that regulates the substance of privacy policies.", "That\u2019s why; it cannot be gainsaid that the data minimization principle puts a limitation on the adequacy requirement in this context as a basis for legitimate processing of personal data, and also as a necessary and proportionate component in a democratic society.", "Your home for data science.
