You can\u2019t start with the technology and try to figure out where to sell it.\u201d", "I believe A/B testing is based precisely on this idea. Most of the innovative companies have moved on from HiPPO (highest paid person\u2019s opinion) to data-driven decision-making. They are spending a lot on digital experiments to ensure the best customer experience and organizational decision-making.", "Talking about Facebook\u2019s investment in the huge testing framework, in an interview, Mark Zuckerberg said,", "\u201cAt any given point in time, there\u2019s not just one version of Facebook running in the world. There\u2019re probably 10,000 versions running.\u201d", "\u201cOur success at Amazon is a function of how many experiments we do per year, per month, per week, per day.\u201d", "But despite proper budget and effort, some avoidable mistakes creep in during the implementation. This article points out the top 4 mistakes which commonly happen during A/B testing and go unnoticed.", "I\u2019ll include the following as a part of the article\u2019s framework:", "I promise to make it very interesting and easy to understand for you. So, brew a mug of hot coffee and grab your favorite armchair.", "When you test a hypothesis to compare 2 variations, you perform a statistical test at a certain confidence interval. Suppose your organization decides on a 5% confidence interval for a certain experiment. What does this mean?", "This means that there\u2019s a 5% chance that your test results will be due to random chance and that you will find a wrong winner.", "That was easy, right? Let\u2019s go a step further now. Let\u2019s extend this concept to more than 1 test variant.", "The general formula for the probability of getting a false positive is as follows:", "The equation currently looks like this:", "Now, as the number of test variants increases, Type 1 Error increases. The following chart depicts this variation clearly:", "This is called the \u2018Multiple Comparison Problem\u2019.", "Let me build on this with a famous experiment by Google, called \u201841 Shades of Blue Test\u2019.", "In 2009, Google wanted to decide the shade of blue that would generate the maximum clicks on their search results page. So, they carried out \u20181% experiments\u2019 to test 41 different shades of blue, showing 1% of users one blue, another experiment showing 1% another blue, and so on.", "And that was how the blue color you see in the advertising links in Gmail and Google search was chosen. Interestingly, it earned the company an extra $200m a year in revenue.", "That was fascinating, right? Now, let\u2019s come back to the \u2018Multiple Comparison Problem\u2019. How do we deal with it? What would have Google done?", "The number of variations that should be tested depends on the business requirements of your organization, organizational efficiency, and a range of factors like conversions, revenue, traffic, etc. Still, testing too many variations should be generally avoided.", "Statistically, there are multiple techniques to handle this problem. I\u2019ll explain a technique called \u2018Bonferroni Correction\u2019.", "By now, you know that with the increase in the number of testing hypotheses, Type 1 error increases. How does \u2018Bonferroni Correction\u2019 help with this?", "\u2018Bonferroni Correction\u2019 compensates for this increase in error by testing each hypothesis at a significance level of \u03b1/n.", "So, now you know that to maintain a confidence interval of 95% for \u201841 shades of Blue Test\u2019 experiment, Google would have tested each hypothesis at 99.875% confidence interval.", "It is important to be mindful of interaction effects when multiple experiments target the same audience. But what is the interaction effect?", "It is a situation when the simultaneous influence of two variables on the success metric under measurement during the experiment is not additive. Let\u2019s understand this through an example.", "Suppose Amazon is working on its outbound customer communication to improve the conversion rate. The e-Commerce Analytics team is performing an A/B test on an \u2018abandoned cart\u2019 push notification. At the same time, the Marketing Analytics team is also carrying out an A/B test on a \u2018recommendations email\u2019 to be sent out to customers.", "The following figures show the conversion rates obtained during the tests:", "This is strange, right? Both the new features do well in their respective experiments but why does the combined test tank?", "This is due to the interaction effect. Amazon has gone overboard with its outbound customer communication program. The combined effect of the two features that were doing great individually is that it has annoyed customers. And thus, the conversion rate has gone down.", "There\u2019s a two-fold approach that you can take to get rid of the negative effect of the interaction effect on the success metric of the experiment:", "Sometimes, the organizations focus only on the performance of the main KPIs like conversion rate or revenue per visit and miss the segmentation based on customer value. This can lead to flawed experiment results. Let\u2019s see this with an example.", "Suppose Walmart Grocery redesigns its home page, changing the location of the \u2018Search bar\u2019. The team carries out an experiment spanning over 2 weeks but find the conversion rate and revenue per visit to have gone down. So, it concludes that the old design is better.", "Everything looks good, right? But is it? No.", "The team has missed the important fact that loyal customers tend to respond much more unfavorably than new customers. It takes the loyal customers longer to warm up to the new design. Let\u2019s understand this with a more relatable example.", "Suppose you go shopping at your nearest brick-and-mortar Walmart store and find that they have completely rearranged the entire store. You find the electronics section at the usual place of grocery, the clothes section at the usual place of household essentials, and so on. If this is your first visit, you wouldn\u2019t know the difference and you would buy what you came for. But if you are a frequent shopper there, you would be confused, and you may even walk out if you are in a hurry.", "I think you got the point. It\u2019s just that similar online behavior is more likely.", "I think you would agree with me now that there\u2019s an inverse relationship between customer value and positive response to a page design modification, considering the customer value to be not just a function of lifetime revenue but also a function of recency and frequency.", "In other words, the upper quartile (customers having the highest scores in Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values) in an RFM model won\u2019t have a favorable response to the new design.", "Let me quickly demonstrate the customer segmentation by RFM quartiles through a small sample data of 4 customers.", "Thus, understanding the customer mix and segmentation based on customer value is very important. Segment them into new and regular. It\u2019s even better if you form segments based on RFM quartiles (RFM Segmentation).", "After the experiment is complete, you start dissecting the data into segments such as traffic size, new vs. loyal customers, device type, etc. You want to compare them based on your success metrics to dig out useful business insights. This is called post-test segmentation.", "But, you need to be cautious here. Be mindful of the following two problems:", "So, how do you handle this?", "The best way to handle this is to opt for stratified sampling and design targeted tests. Divide the samples into homogeneous brackets so that the variability within those brackets is very less. These brackets or customer segments can be based on attributes like device category, traffic sources, demographics, etc. according to the business needs and budget. Then, conduct the experiment to compare the corresponding brackets of the variations to be tested.", "To give you an example from the industry, Netflix uses stratified sampling to maintain homogeneity across a set of key metrics, of which country and device type (i.e. smart TV, game console, etc.) are the most crucial.", "Although there are many A/B testing mistakes, my effort has been to point out the more sophisticated ones which have a high probability of going uncaught in the industry.", "I hope I was able to deliver on my promise of making the article interesting and easy to understand. And I hope you found it useful.", "To end with Thomas Alva Edison\u2019s spirit of celebrating mistakes and the learnings from them,", "Feel free to have a look at the other articles that I\u2019ve written around data analytics:", "Feel free to provide feedback and follow me for more interesting articles on data analytics.
