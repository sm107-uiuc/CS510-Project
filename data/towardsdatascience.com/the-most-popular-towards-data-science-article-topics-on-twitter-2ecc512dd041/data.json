Below are the steps to easily determine what these topics are using R and the results of the analysis. This article can also serve as an intro to using an API, and doing some basic text processing in R. Feel free to alter this code to do other Twitter analyses and skip to the end if you\u2019re only interested in the results.", "If you don\u2019t have a twitter account, you need to make one. After that head over to Twitter Developer. After signing in with your new account, you can select the Apps Menu, then Create an App. From there fill out the information about the App\u2019s details, for the most part, this can be left blank except for the App\u2019s name and details.", "We will need 3 R packages to do this project \u2014 rtweet, tidyverse, and tidytext. Install these with", "Make sure you load each of these packages in your script with the library() function.", "To get tweets we first need to generate a token. We can do that with the create_token() function from the rtweet package. The arguments can be filled in by looking over the information on the page of your new app on the Twitter Developer site. All of these variables are important for security, so whenever you use an API, make sure to take precaution by keeping these tokens and keys private.", "Now to grab tweets! Use the get_timeline() function to get access to the 3200 most recent tweets of any public user, to get any more than that in one query you will have to pay.", "There are 50 columns of data with 3200 rows stored in the variable \u201ctweets\u201d now. We primarily care about the columns text, favorite_count, and retweet_count, but you can explore what else you have to look at.", "We\u2019d also like to remove some things that are common to this domain, mainly links and twitter handles. We can use the gsub() function to replace occurrences of links and handles with something else, in our case we remove them by replacing them with empty strings. Below we pass the text column from one gsub() function to the next with the pipe operator, removing the urls and handles, ultimately saving them in a new column called clean_text.", "Now we want to remove stop words from our clean_text column. Stop words are words that are not important to understanding the meaning of a passage. These are typically the most common words of a language, but there may be additional words you\u2019d like to remove for a specific domain. In our task we might consider the word \u201cdata\u201d to be trivial since almost every article will mention data.", "Tokenization is the process of splitting of text into sections. This could be by sentence, paragraph, word, or something else. In our case we will be using splitting by word, which will take our table of data and make into a table with one row for each word in each tweet. Below I select the columns of interest and then tokenize the words.", "This leaves us with the table below, where the words \u201cinclude\u201d, \u201ctraining\u201d, and \u201coperations\u201d, were originally all part of the same row in the clean_text column.", "Now we proceed by doing an anti-join with the stop_words data set from the tidytext package. This removes all the words that are part of both the tweets data set and the stop_words data set (essentially this removes the stop words from your data). The code for this is below.", "Using the groub_by() and summarise() functions from the tidyverse, we can get the median number of favorites and retweets for each word in our data set. I choose to use median here to eliminate the effects that some outliers may have on our data.", "We want to see the words that have the most favorites/retweets to inform us about what we should write about. But let\u2019s consider the case where a word is only used once. For example, if there is one really popular article out their about data science applied to the geography of Michigan, we wouldn\u2019t want this to bias us to writing articles about Michigan. To fix this, I filter out all the words that weren\u2019t used in at least 4 tweets with the filter() function, and then sort the results with the arrange() function. Leaving us with our final bit of code.", "So if you are skipping to the end to see what the results are, or don\u2019t want to run this code yourself, here are the results. These are the common words in Towards Data Science, ranked by how many favorites the tweet that contains that word usually gets.", "Note: I did have to remove the word \u201cJames\u201d here since apparently there is an author(s) out there who is very popular with that name. Congratulations, James(es)!", "My advice now would be to write an article titled \u201cA Comprehensive Guide to Creating Beautiful Financial Plots with Matplotlib\u201d or something like that. You can repeat this process now for any other twitter user with a public account.", "Your home for data science.
