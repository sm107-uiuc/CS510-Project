Since there are only 0.03% of the duplicate rows in 50000 entries so we would not drop them as it is not required.", "Now we will convert the first_open column into datetime format as it is of object type. first_open column specifies the Date and time of login on app for the first time.", "Since we have obtained the date and time from the first_open column, we can see the trend of using the app for the first time within the date.", "As we can see from the graph, the usage of the application is highly fluctuating. This can lead to conclusions that reasons could involve directly to the application such as the promotion of the app etc. instead of outside factors since it could not affect that much.", "Now we would see some insights from dayofweek column. We would not focus on first_open_time as there are no insights to find from there.", "Here, in dayofweek the unique values explain the following:", "This graph explains that the minimum usage of the application is on Tuesday and maximum usage is on Thursday.", "Now let's analyze the hour column", "As we can see in this graph the user uses the app less around 9 AM while the maximum is around 3 PM.", "This shows that most 75% of the users are below the age of 37. This implies that the makers and the company should cater to the need and mark those people whose age is under 37 as their target audience.", "The other columns are:- screen_list: it describes the screens that is seen by customers, numscreens: number of screens watched by the user, minigame: If the customer played mini-game which was included within the app then 1 else 0,used_premium_feature: if the user took the premium feature of the application then it is 1 else 0, enrolled: If the user purchased a premium feature then 1 else 0, enrolled_date: the date and time at which the user purchased a premium features.", "We will analyse the above columns now", "Let's see the other columns behaviour on the basis of dayofweek column:", "Let's see the other columns behaviour on the basis of hour column", "With these graphs, we can surely analyze the inactiveness of users during day time as most of the users have to perform other tasks instead of using this app. This can further imply that all the promotional activities that can be performed on the application can be done during the afternoon, as most users are active during this time.", "Let us analyze the usage of the application on the basis of age. Since there are many unique ages in 50000 records we would use the approach of visualizing the other columns on the basis of \u201cAGE GROUP\u201d.", "In these graphs we can analyze that though 75% of our audience lies below the age of 37, the most active age group is between 15\u201335.", "Since we performed the EDA we would be moving on to the feature selection.", "Finding a correlation between various features:", "The above graph shows that hour, age, minigame(negatively correlated), numscreens, minigame(positively correlated) can be considered for model building.", "After all this analysis we would revert back our dataframe so as to find the total time a user took to enroll for the app.", "As we can see in this histogram the details before 50 hours are good as others are the outliers and can affect the model so we would consider the customers have enrolled as 0.", "The screen_list can be a really useful column as it can be used to modeling purpose. But this column is a string. So in order to use this, we need to encode this column which would take a lot of time since it has to process around 50000 strings.", "Before continuing with this, we need another package which is \u201cmlxtend\u201d package.
