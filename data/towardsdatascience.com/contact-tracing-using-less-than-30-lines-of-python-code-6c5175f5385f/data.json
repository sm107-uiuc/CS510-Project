During a pandemic, performing contact tracing correctly can help reduce the number of people to get infected or speed up the process of treating infected people. Doing so can help save many lives.", "Technology can help automate the process of contact tracing, producing more efficient and accurate results than if the procedure was performed manually. One technology that can help this process is Machine Learning. More precisely, clustering. Clustering is a subclass of Machine Learning algorithms used to divide data that share some characteristics in different clusters based on these characteristics.", "There are various types of clustering algorithms, such as K-means, Mean-Shift, Spectral Clustering, BIRCH, DBSCAN, and so much more. These different algorithms can be divided into three categories:", "For contact tracing, we need to use a density-based clustering algorithm. The reason is, diseases are transferred when an infected person comes in contact with others. So, more crowded \u2014 dense \u2014 areas will have more cases than less crowded ones.", "To trace the movement of infected people, scientists often use GPS datasets that contain information about the time and location of a person in any given timeframe. The location data is often represented as longitude and latitude coordinates.", "In order to build a contact tracing algorithm, we need to do three steps:", "We will write a Python code that uses the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to predict who might get infected because they came in contact with an infected person.", "Unfortunately, we can\u2019t obtain real-life data from GPS locations. So, we will build a mock dataset to apply our algorithm on. For this article, I used a Mock Data Generator to generate a JSON dataset containing 100 entries of the locations of 10 users. If you want to try another dataset, make sure the following conditions apply:", "First, let\u2019s import all the libraries that we will use. We will need Pandas and Sklearn to process the data and Pygal to display it.", "Note: in case you don\u2019t have one of these libraries, you can use pip to install each of them from the command line. Moreover, if you're using Jupyter Notebook, you need to add this cell to display Pygal plots:", "Now, we can load our dataset and show the first 5 rows to understand how it is built.", "To understand the data more, we will plot it using the Pygal scatter plot. We can extract the different locations of each user and store that in a dictionary and then use this dictionary to plot the data.", "Awesome. Now that we have our dataset, we can apply the clustering algorithm on it and then use that to predict potential infections. To accomplish that, we will use the DBSCAN algorithm.", "The DBSCAN algorithm views clusters as areas of high density separated by regions of low density. Because of this, clusters found by DBSCAN can be of any shape, as opposed to k-means, which assumes that all clusters are convex shaped.", "Sklearn had a predefined DBSCAN algorithm; all you need to do to use it is know three parameters:", "We can now apply our model to the dataset.", "Applying the model with these parameters leads to 18 clusters. We can display these clusters using this piece of code\u2026", "After the algorithm is done, if there were any data points without a cluster, they will be clustered as noise or cluster -1. Often, you will find that all users in this data set will be part of the -1 cluster in addition to other clusters.", "If we have the name of an infected person, we can use that to get all clusters this person is a part of. From there, we can see other people in these clusters. These people will have a higher probability of getting infected than those who are not.", "Given a name inputName for example, William, we want all clusters that William is a part of.", "After executing this code, the inputNameCluster will become {2, 4, 5, -1}.", "Now, we want other people who belong to this specific set of clusters.", "In both these sections, I am using sets to avoid having extra if-else statements when the inputName is in each cluster's names list.", "Voil\u00e0, the code will return {\u2018Doreen\u2019, \u2018James\u2019, \u2018John\u2019}, which means, those three people are potentially infected because they came into contact with William at some point in time and place.", "I have put the core code into a function that takes a dataframe and a user\u2019s name and perform contact tracing of this user and finally print potentially infected people. The function will first check if the inputName is valid; if not, it will raise an assertion error. On top of that, it's less than 30 lines of code!!", "The full code for the contact tracing function:", "Contact Tracing is one of the ways we can use technology to save people\u2019s lives and provide them treatment as soon as possible. Government and medical personals often have access to GPS locations of some patients. The process we walked through in this article, is fundamentally the same as the one they follow to obtain potential infections. Luckily, thanks to libraries like Sklearn, we can use predefined models on our datasets and obtain results with few lines of code.", "[1] \u201cA Density-Based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters in Large Spatial Databases with Noise\u201d Ester, M., H.
