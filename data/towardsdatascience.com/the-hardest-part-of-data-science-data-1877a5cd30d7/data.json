The ability to make predictions based on historical data now fuels almost every new product, business initiative, and organization at the forefront of their industry.", "These capabilities were introduced with the adoption of predictive models \u2014 algorithms capable of \u201cfitting\u201d (learning) historical data. So, it\u2019s no surprise that a lot of work has been invested in automating, streamlining, and democratizing the processes of selecting and training models.", "From commercial machine learning tools to open-source libraries (like Sklearn, Auto-Sklearn, TPOT, etc.), the work invested in previous years has brought us to a point where we can clearly state:", "Models are starting to be commoditized.", "Every novice who knows how to write a Python script can now train a model. Every business analyst with the right Excel plugin can now train a regression model on their financial data. I, myself, was capable of training a successful model only two months into learning Python.", "Training models, especially complicated ones (e.g. gradient boosted trees), may have been a challenge a decade ago but a lot has happened since then:", "Training a complicated model can now happen with a few lines of code and a short period of computing time.", "Before we go any further, a quick disclaimer: In this article, I\u2019ll focus on classic data science problems that involve tabular and/or semi-structured data. My points will not hold against computer vision/audio use cases.", "It\u2019s not about the algorithms, it\u2019s about the right data to feed them.", "Today, when applying data science to business problems, almost no one is inventing a new algorithm (again, not necessarily true to computer vision/audio and NLP use cases). We\u2019ve been using the same models for more than a decade. Gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) were introduced in the previous century, SVMs in the 1960s, and linear regression\u2026probably around 1000BC.", "Data science is no different than any other profession that has emerged from new technology and influenced society. It continues to evolve and open endless doors to complex questions and challenges, each one more exciting than the last. And yet we continue to use the same models. The winners of Kaggle competitions prove this to be true by using 30-year-old models to top the leaderboard. If 30-year-old models are winning competitions, it stands to reason that these models are not where the \u201cX factor\u201d comes from.", "The truth is, data science has been so focused on trying to generate business value from the newest algorithm, that we\u2019ve missed the most important part: data science is not, and never has been, about models.", "Given that the majority of modeling is commoditized and automated, what is the next challenge in building a robust and accurate prediction system? What actually makes a model successful?", "We\u2019ve all heard the saying \u201cgarbage in, garbage out.\u201d If I try to train a model to predict credit default based on the number of characters in a person\u2019s name, I might be successful at getting the model to work (train and predict) but the model would pretty much be randomly guessing.", "The main question we need to be asking to determine if a data science project will succeed or not is and always will be: Do we have the right data to train a model to solve the problem we\u2019re trying to solve?", "The \u201cright data\u201d can be broken down into multiple sub-questions:", "Speaking of engineering\u2026Stanford Professor Andrew Ng accurately said:", "\u201c\u2026applied machine learning is basically feature engineering.\u201d", "What did Professor Ng mean by \u201cfeature engineering?\u201d", "Due to the buzz in the field, some confusion has arisen around the meaning of different terms. I suggest we break down feature engineering into its two parts:", "I would argue that feature standardization is walking a similar path to the one that models went down. The same way models have become commoditized, feature standardization can be commoditized as well. Just like autoML techniques, you can loop through different models with different standardization techniques until you find the best performing combination. Unlike the search space of possible features to generate, the different combinations of standardization techniques and different models are not as large as we think they are.", "To make my point, here is my pseudo-algorithm to automate the selection of a model with feature standardization techniques:", "Given a list of possible feature standardization methods, like scaling and imputation methods (mean imputation, unit variance scaling, PCA, \u2026)", "And given a list of possible models (linear regression, SVM, XGBoost with 100 decision trees, XGBoost with 1000 decision trees\u2026)", "Generate an experiment with a random preprocessor and a random model.", "After a couple of iterations, choose the best experiment.", "Now obviously it is not as simple as I presented it. The parameter space is large and the number of combinations should be limited \u2014 but it is not rocket science. There are a bunch of tools that do a great job at this (like Auto-Sklearn or TPOT). This will only become easier as computing power becomes cheaper and more available.", "Feature generation, however, is not at the same place.", "Today, mainstream data science takes more of an artistic approach than a scientific one to feature generation. It trusts the human data scientist to think of the right ideas for features, reach the right data sources, understand how to integrate them together, understand the right way to aggregate and transform the data, and generate interactions between the finalized features.", "And so, I\u2019ll be a bit rude and change Professor Ng\u2019s statement into:", "\u201c\u2026applied machine learning is basically feature generation.\u201d", "And the reason that there\u2019s no general guideline to follow when generating features is quite obvious: the number of potentially related data sources (inside and outside of an organization) is too large. There\u2019s an infinite amount of ideas you can think of to generate features.", "All of the tools that are trying to \u201cautomate data science\u201d nowadays are leaving the task of generating high valued features and signals to feed into models (and standardization techniques) to us, humans. Given the fact that we are not as good at exploring search spaces as machines are we\u2019re missing a lot of things.", "There are endless pieces of data that could be relevant for each and every one of the use cases we\u2019re trying to solve and the models we\u2019re trying to build, that it\u2019s infeasible to explore the potential to its fullest.", "When a bank builds a credit default model based only on a person\u2019s historical transaction history are they doing a good job? What if that person just finished a degree with a high probability to find a well-paying job?", "When a retailer plans a promotion calendar based on historical sales and promotional activities are they doing a good job? What if after the holidays people don\u2019t mind paying higher prices?", "At the risk of using one too many buzzwordy phrases in this article, it\u2019s important to remember that data is, in fact, the new oil. And yet, when we look at the current state of data science tools and techniques, we often find that algorithm tools are siloed from data tools. We\u2019ve had a lot of advancements in model-related tasks but there\u2019s an exponentially growing amount of data out there that is largely being ignored.", "I believe that solving the data part of the model building process will unlock endless value to businesses and products around us. Today, this is the main bottleneck across all types of organizations.", "If a large, forward-thinking company will try to scale data science across different functions and use cases it will soon find that there are not enough data scientists who are capable of coding their way through different features and data sources. If a company is looking to acquire relevant data sources to improve existing models, it will probably struggle with the surprisingly large amount of manual work they have to do to test a new source (hypothesising, matching and integration, aggregating and generation of features) just to find out if it actually improves a predictive model. If a company doesn\u2019t hold endless amounts of data, they will need to work harder and harder to find better data and generate high-value features.", "All of these roadblocks can be solved by automating the process of exploring data sources and generating features in the context of building a model.", "Now, to the question we\u2019re all asking as more and more automation creeps into data science: will this replace data scientists? No.", "Data scientists will always be needed to transform the business problem into a \u201cdata problem,\u201d to understand what the right thing to predict is, to define the search space for the problem, to prevent data leakage, and to test the results to ensure they make sense and can be used in production to impact the business.", "It\u2019s time to start focusing on the data part of data science.
