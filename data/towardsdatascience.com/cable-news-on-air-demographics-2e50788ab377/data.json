Apple\u2019s TV series, The Morning Show, also uses the shattering of on air television norms as plot device. According to US Census data, women outnumber men in the United States 50.8% to 49.2%. Seeing women on cable news networks has become normal for some time, however, given the renewed focus this year on racial justice how represented are minorities as on air correspondents across the networks? In this article, I will explore the demographics and gender distributions of network on air talent. I will represent the gender and racial demographics of Fox News, CNN, ABC, CBS, and NBC in pie chart format and use subplots to create a horizontal layout. Also, I will comment on the networks most accurately and inaccurately reflecting the US general population using mean squared error.", "The gender and racial demographics were manually collected from image data on each network\u2019s site. Names that suggested a different racial demographic or on air personalities without a representative image were further investigated using their personal Wikipedia page if available. The US Census data website is used to collect US gender and racial demographics.", "Pie charts were created using Matplotlib for static charts and plotly for dynamic charts. Pandas was used to load the excel file into a dataframe. All scripting was done in a Jupyter notebook and can be found with the dataset at GitHub.", "The network with the most on air correspondents in our data is CBS with 93 on air personalities. This number is inflated with a number of guest journalists that appear on the show 60 Minutes. The next highest correspondent count by network is CNN with 71 on air contributors. The average number of on air contributors is a little more than 61 per network. The data file is comprised of count data by station. To create our pie charts, I normalize the count data into percentages.", "I manually added the US Population counts to the respective dataframe objects using the code below.", "To calculate the difference between a network\u2019s demographics and the US general population, I implemented a function to calculate the mean square error (MSE). The function performs the following steps:", "ABC is dominated by male on air personalities and Fox compares poorly to the real population demographics of the US. Another interesting Fox statistic is that 13 of the 20 women are blondes, representing an astonishing 65%. Natural blondes among white demographics is estimated to occur in only 5% of the population according to researchers. Women in powerful roles have been noted to more likely have blonde hair than the general population.", "To create the dynamic pie charts, I used plotly. Unfortunately, the dynamic chart becomes static in this article, but the functionality remains in the notebook code on GitHub. To create the dynamic chart, I linked plotly to the notebook.", "Then to build the interactive plot:", "The resulting figure is generated below and the user can scroll over to see a more detailed view of each slice. In our example since the dataframe is normalized out of 100% the count data matches the slice size.", "To build the static gender and demographic pie charts, I use matplotlib and subplots to have the two pie charts share a horizontal axis. Our data by network does not include the \u201cOther\u201d category in the demographics due to the amount of diverse identities that make up that category. To begin, let\u2019s define our figure and the two subplots.", "The three positions defined in the subplots define the locations and layout of the subplots.", "I decided to use the horizontal layout to display in this article more easily. To prep out data for creating pie charts I transposed our dataframes and manually assigned colors to the plots.", "Below are the static pie charts of news networks from largest MSE to least in the demographics dataframe with the US population repeated at the bottom.", "This has been a case study of new network\u2019s on air personalities gender and demographics. Some networks are better than others at having the on air personalities match the US population with CBS having the lowest MSE across both gender and demographics. Fox News is the least representative of the national make-up. My name is Cody Glickman and I can be found on LinkedIn. The code and data for this article can be found on GitHub.
