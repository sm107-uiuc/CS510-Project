As it turned out, this was the start of a world-changing event with overwhelming extent.", "After the first wave of the virus has passed over the entire world, I would like to address two questions:", "To answer, we first need to understand what is hidden behind the official numbers of confirmed cases.", "We then apply a machine learning algorithm to the COVID-19 data. This organizes countries into groups with similar epidemiological behavior. Surprisingly, those groups form local clusters on the world map. This unexpected insight helps us to answer the questions above.", "When I first got in touch with the COVID-19 data, I naturally inspected the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. This data is provided for example by the John Hopkins University [1].", "Does this ranking tells us anything meaningful? Clearly, the US has many more infections than Spain, which is a much smaller country. However, this does not imply that the US is more affected than Spain.", "Therefore, the number of infections needs to be normalized to the population of each country. Now, this will allow a fairer comparison independent of the country size.", "Qatar, Bahrain, Panama, Chile, and Kuweit have the highest density of infections. Did you know this?", "But wait a second\u2026 countries have a different testing policy:More COVID-19 testing gives more confirmed cases \u2014 and no testing at all would imply zero cases.So, we need a quantity unrelated to the amount of testing.", "The number of COVID-19 deaths is unbiased by the testing rate.", "We will use the normalized number of deaths for comparing countries! Peru, Belgium, and Andorra are countries that suffered the highest number of deaths (normalized to its population). Have you ever heard about this fact? Furthermore, 7 out of the top 15 countries above belong to the European continent.", "Let us investigate a little bit more what is hidden behind the data.", "Great, we have found a suitable measure to judge how hard countries have suffered under the virus. Now we will analyze the development of this quantity over time and see what else we can learn from.", "By examining the daily deaths curves above, one can extract different epidemiological behavior. For example, the red curve shows Italy suffering many deaths in April. Yet, they managed to stop the spreading of the virus. Italy reached this goal by completely shutting down social life for months.", "Germany, the green curve, has not been hit hard by the first COVID-19 wave. The state reacted fast and slowed down social life right at the beginning. As a result, the number of deaths went back to almost zero.", "On the other side, Brazil and the US are constantly suffering deaths from April till now. They have not managed to get the virus under control yet.", "Can we learn something by taking a look at other countries:", "Okay, this looks a bit messy. There are 188 countries. But how many different characteristic curves can we find?", "To clean the mess and find patterns, we will apply a clustering algorithm. This unsupervised learning technique groups similar data curves together.", "The python package tslearn [2] provides machine learning algorithms for time series. We apply a k-means clustering method to the normalized daily-deaths curves.", "The algorithm groups together countries with comparable behavior. The result is the following three clusters:", "The green cluster (158 countries) shows only little daily deaths close to zero. Those countries are mildly affected by COVID-19.", "On the other side, the red cluster (9 countries) has a huge number of deaths in the first wave (April/May). But, managed to get the situation controlled and the deaths rate went back to almost zero.", "In contrast, the blue cluster contains 16 countries which suffer constantly COVID-19 deaths. It seems the situation is getting worse and worse over time.", "A quick look at the map below shows that the red cluster is located on the European continent. Furthermore, countries from the blue cluster are concentrated in North and South America.", "The red cluster contains Spain, France, UK, Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Netherlands, Ireland, and Andorra. Those countries have experienced a hard time during the first wave of COVID-19. But, by applying restrictions to the daily life, they have slowed down the dying. Now those countries are almost back to normality.", "The US, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Panama have not managed to stop the dying yet. Those countries might take suitable actions as soon as possible.", "We have discussed a suitable metric for the impact of COVID-19 which allows comparing across different countries.", "Focusing on the normalized number of deaths offsets the testing-rate bias. Besides, we would like to note, there remains socioeconomic factors. Such as access to the healthcare system or its quality. We have not considered those effects here.", "A clustering algorithm helped us to group countries into three main characteristic clusters. Countries,", "Hard social restriction helped most European countries to get the virus under control. But, in some Northern and South American countries, people are still dying.
