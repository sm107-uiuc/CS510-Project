But in the real world, 80% won\u2019t cut. In fact, most companies that I\u2019ve worked for expect a minimum accuracy (or whatever metric they\u2019re looking at) of at least 90%.", "Therefore, I\u2019m going to talk about 5 things that you can do to significantly improve your accuracy. I highly recommend that you read all five points thoroughly because there are a lot of details that I\u2019ve included that most beginners don\u2019t know.", "By the end of this, you should understand that there are many more variables than you think that play a role in dictating how well your machine learning model performs.", "With that said, here are 5 things that you can do to improve your machine learning models!", "One of the biggest mistakes I see is how people handle missing values, and it\u2019s not necessarily their fault. A lot of material on the web says that you typically handle missing values through mean imputation, replacing null values with the mean of the given feature, and this usually isn\u2019t the best method.", "For example, imagine we have a table showing age and fitness score and imagine that an eighty-year-old has a missing fitness score. If we took the average fitness score from an age range of 15 to 80, then the eighty-year-old will appear to have a much higher fitness score that he actually should.", "Therefore, the first question you want to ask yourself is why the data is missing to begin with.", "Next, consider other methods in handling missing data, aside from mean/median imputation:", "The second way you can significantly improve your machine learning model is through feature engineering. Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem that one is trying to solve. There\u2019s no specific way to go about this step, which is what makes data science as much of an art as it as a science. That being said, here are some things that you can consider:", "The third area where you can vastly improve the accuracy of your model is feature selection, which is choosing the most relevant/valuable features of your dataset. Too many features can cause your algorithm to overfit and too little features can cause your algorithm to underfit.", "There are two main methods that I like to use that you can use to help you with selecting your features:", "One of the easiest ways to improve your machine learning model is to simply choose a better machine learning algorithm. If you don\u2019t already know what ensemble learning algorithms are, now is the time to learn it!", "Ensemble learning is a method where multiple learning algorithms are used in conjunction. The purpose of doing so is that it allows you to achieve higher predictive performance than if you were to use an individual algorithm by itself.", "Popular ensemble learning algorithms include random forests, XGBoost, gradient boost, and AdaBoost. To explain why ensemble learning algorithms are so powerful, I\u2019ll give an example with random forests:", "Random forests involve creating multiple decision trees using bootstrapped datasets of the original data. The model then selects the mode (the majority) of all of the predictions of each decision tree. What\u2019s the point of this? By relying on a \u201cmajority wins\u201d model, it reduces the risk of error from an individual tree.", "For example, if we created one decision tree, the third one, it would predict 0. But if we relied on the mode of all 4 decision trees, the predicted value would be 1. This is the power of ensemble learning!", "Lastly, something that is not often talked, but is still very important, is adjusting the hyperparameters of your model. This is where it\u2019s essential that you clearly understand the ML model that you\u2019re working with, otherwise it can be difficult to understand what each of the hyperparameters are.", "Take a look at all of the hyperparameters for Random Forests:", "For example, it would probably be a good idea to understand what min_impurity_decrease is, so that when you want your machine learning model to be more forgiving, you can adjust this parameter! ;)", "By reading this article, you should now have a few more ideas when it comes to improving the accuracy of your model from 80% to 90%+. This information will also make your future data science projects go much more smoothly. I wish you the best of luck in your data science endeavors.", "Your home for data science.
