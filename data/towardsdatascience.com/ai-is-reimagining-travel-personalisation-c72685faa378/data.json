Unique customer journeys are dictating customer intent for travel choices. Learn how AI is helping reimagine travel by understanding intent based on unique customer journeys.", "In the last five years, the amount of data in the world has grown exponentially. Domo\u2019s \u2018Data Never Sleeps 5.0 and 6.0\u2019 suggest that 90% of world\u2019s data was created between 2016 and 2017, and the numbers have not slowed down since then. Arguably upwards of 80% of this data is not utilised by companies for decision-making.", "Smartphone applications are now dominating customers\u2019 mindshare; these are notably contributing towards the data explosion. Generation Z, i.e. those born from the mid-1990s to early 2000s, has not seen a world without computers and phones. As these younger consumers are added to the traveler mix, travel companies are now feeling the pressure to reimagine themselves in order to stay relevant amidst changing technology preferences.", "Travel company executives are asking: What are the key ingredients for reimagining personalisation in travel?", "Customer engagement in the travel industry has become increasingly fragmented due to a proliferation of communication channels. Furthermore, customers are now using a mix of traditional channels (emails, websites, and call-centers) and advanced channels (smartphones, chatbots, and social media).", "The classic customer journey (inspiration > shop > book > travel > post-travel) is no longer linear. Today, a customer shuttles between these various stages, jumping forward and circling back again, based on the data they are exposed to. For example: A customer who is extremely interested in a flight + hotel weekend package in Paris offered by a major airline, suddenly drops the idea based on a poor review, and instead selects a comparable package with a travel agency. Let\u2019s take another example: A customer who loves to thoroughly research her trips is dissuaded by persistent emailers that do not offer her the information she seeks.", "It should come as little surprise that Google (based on analysis of its clickstream data) suggests that no two customer journeys are exactly alike; and that the shape of the marketing funnel is changing dynamically with customer intent. The evolution of the customer journey means that travel companies can no longer fit customers into the traditional marketing funnel mold, and instead, must focus on customer intent.", "The unique nature of each customer\u2019s journey means that travel companies can no longer afford to generalize B2C personalisation using a limited number of static personas. Each customer will make decisions differently; therefore, responses from travel companies should consider the unique journey of each customer.", "For many years, travel companies relied primarily on creative email campaigns to differentiate themselves from competitors. With the explosion of travel-related blogs, websites, and videos \u2014 email is no longer the most persuasive medium. If traditional emailers no longer inspire, what does? Today, inspiration is drawn from sources offering instant gratification, such as: extraordinary #nofilter photos on Instagram, the National Geographic\u2019s daily Snapchat story, or a backpacker\u2019s GoPro video on YouTube.", "Furthermore, the travel experience itself has changed. Travelers are now looking for timely-relevant information at their fingertips \u2014 i.e. Timely-relevance is the New Black.", "Booking.com suggests that travelers are more enthusiastic about real-time luggage tracking information than they are about many other advances in travel technology. One third of the surveyed travelers would want someone or something to do the hard work and make travel recommendations for them; and over half would be excited about travel innovations such as digital tour guides. These surveys explain the recent popularity of ready-to-use itineraries from companies such as TripIt and Google Trips. Meanwhile, companies like eDreams Odigeo are developing virtual travel assistants that can answer trip-related questions instantly, thereby enabling the delivery of relevant, timely information.", "Travel companies that can quickly adapt to these new expectations (i.e. serve timely, the most relevant information), can attempt to capture traveler mindshare and stay alive in this rapidly changing landscape.", "For travel companies, the challenge now is to provide the most relevant information, in a timely fashion for each unique customer. This can be a tall order given the data deluge, dynamic customer journeys, and evolving customer expectations.", "Traditional \u2018next best action\u2019 engines for content recommendations are dominated by rule-based frameworks that are built on static customer personas. This is not sufficient!", "Companies need to internalise dynamic customer journeys for each customer. Based on these journeys they need to understand customer intent. After sensing customer intent, they need to serve the most relevant information in a timely manner. All this cam be made possible by AI solutions (I have described an approach in this hyperlinked article).", "AI solutions are extremely valuable, but they also represent a significant investment of time, money, and resources. Building a practical and scalable AI solution requires: a team of data scientists, advanced knowledge of machine learning, the ability to wrangle large un/structured datasets, capacity for real time computing, and resources for generating ad hoc insights.", "Because of these challenges, many executives are also looking outwards to companies that offer AIaaS (AI as a Service). With AIaaS, travel companies can configure custom solutions and test into their ecosystem. These AI solutions can help travel companies uncover hidden patterns of customer intent. The most important patterns are then utilised as triggers \u2014 serving the most relevant information to that particular customer.", "Personalisation in travel is moving away from a static world with broadly bucketed personas. Reimagining personalisation within the context of newly available AI solutions\u2026 we can see a world in which every customer has a unique dynamic persona, and only the most relevant information is served to the customer at the time it is most required.", "Originally posted on blog.operasolutions.com.
