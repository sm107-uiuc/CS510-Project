It has de facto become one of the most visible and most attractive targets for candidates to a dream remote job.", "Although this sounds like a great news both for Vicky and Automattic, for candidates looking for a remote gig it can also be demotivating as it reminds them they will likely compete with some of the most visible and talented professionals on Earth. But do not lose hope, landing a remote job is still possible.", "The following advice are mostly based on my individual experience (I have been working remotely for 4+ years on two different jobs) and conversations with other fellow remote workers. It also includes a story of me getting my current job asking on Discord.", "Let\u2019s not set unrealistic expectations, finding a fully remote, full time data science job isn\u2019t easy. As stated earlier, you will compete with the most qualified professionals on this planet and there aren\u2019t that many openings a year.", "Do not quit your job immediately thinking you will find something in a couple of months because you receive daily job offers for on-site jobs on Linkedin. You should rather set realistic expectations and see this as a long term project with the amount of dedication and disappointment it can convey.", "Hopefully, things will start to get easier as many high profile companies like Twitter, Shopify or Slack announced they will go full or partial remote even after the Covid crisis ends.", "You will read it everywhere: remote work is all about trust, e.g. trusting you will deliver without close supervision. Capitalizing on the relationship you have built with time should be your first approach and there is no better place to start than with your current job.", "If your manager is happy with you and your company has not stated firm anti-remote work policies, you should start this discussion.", "In 2016, my wife got a job opportunity 500 km away and we saw that as an opportunity to live in a smaller and calmer city with our family. The problem was then what to do with my job. She casually mentioned \u201cYou could just ask to work from home\u201d and I felt stupid for not even thinking about it before. Shortly after, I started a conversation with my manager stating, I\u2019d like to start working remotely in a near future and the best thing would be to still do it with them. The stars aligned and one month later, I moved away from Barcelona and started working remotely without the need to look for a new job (but moved to a different team).", "This might not be always possible and, even within a same company, it will depend a lot on who you are talking with. In my case, it might not have been possible with a different manager. But the sure thing is that, if you don\u2019t ask, it will definitely not happen.", "The second best place to find people who already trust you, is your network. There is likely a handful of people you have worked with in the past who appreciated you as a professional, who are now working in different companies and would be happy to work with you again.", "Just contact them. Send them a message on LinkedIn, ask about how they are doing, congratulate them on are recent move if relevant and casually mention that you are looking for new opportunities \u2014 which ideally would allow working remotely full time. As you have a personal connection, they will give you an honest answer or might even reach out to different people (potentially in different companies) to inquire about potential opportunities.", "If you have a Data Scientist title on LinkedIn, you likely receive regular offers via LinkedIn.", "Take profit of these opportunities to connect with the recruiters and ask if the job can be fully remote. In 99% of the cases it will likely not be the case (from my experience, although this might change post-Covid) but, it is also a very low effort approach as you just have to quickly answer a message you received.", "Recruiters will appreciate you answering them back (they\u2019re not all bad!) and might consider you for a different opening they are working on and is remote-friendly.", "Remember that remote positions are highly competitive and companies can receive thousands of application for a single opening. No need to tell you should make sure you send a top-notch application to stand out.", "Although, one might first think that there are no differences between looking for an on-site or remote job, there are ways to improve your remote job search:", "If you are not lucky with your applications, you can still consider going freelance. As freelancers are generally experienced professionals collaborating with companies for a shorter time frame, those are generally more keen on letting freelancers working remotely.", "Freelance life is of course not for everybody and finding a remote freelance gig is not necessarily easier. You can still test the grounds by creating a profile on platforms like UpWork (or more specialized local ones) and see how easy (or hard) it would be to get some decent first gigs.", "Although some people will pretend so, there is no gold standard method to get a job. Some methods that generally work for other people might not work for you and vice versa. Thus, it is recommended to try different approaches and learn from them if you are lucky enough to get some feedback (we can still argue that getting ghosted is a minimum unit of feedback).", "Try to contact directly recruiting managers if you can identify them, send applications for jobs that are not listed (companies might get back to you), apply via the company\u2019s online form if it\u2019s your only option although everybody will tell you this never works (it sometimes does, I got multiple interviews and a job this way), in general, try to find the best way to get in touch with people making the calls.", "As an example, I got my current job\u2026 on Discord! And for a job I was overqualified for.", "I was interested in a young startup which was looking for a data analyst while I was looking for a more senior position, ideally at a head/director level. After some research I realized they didn\u2019t have any data scientist yet and that they could use someone with more seniority. Also, they had a link to their Discord server (they operate in the gaming space) where I could directly contact the CEO and introduce myself as a hands-on Head of Data. A couple of calls later, I was hired.", "This is definitely not an approach that will work every time, like any type of approach. But this shows that if you are persistent enough and spend enough energy understanding the company you target, what they will need and how to get their attention, you will eventually stick out of the crowd.", "As a final word, remember you only control a small portion of the recruiting process. Even if you send your best application and are highly qualified for the position, there are many factors you do not control: your competitors for the role, personality fit with the recruiters, changes of strategy from the company, budget fit for the role, timing,\u2026", "Job hunting is a number game, and this is even more true for remote jobs. You will likely not get a job on your first application, but maybe you will! Just make sure you use a diversity of approaches as those highlighted on this article and do your best on each application to increase your odds of success and land your dream data science remote job.", "Your home for data science.
