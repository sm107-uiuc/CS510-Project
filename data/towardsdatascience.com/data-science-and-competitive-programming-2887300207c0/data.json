Or even both? The article shares my thoughts about it."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Competition is a great way to learn new things, especially those who are a student that has an interest to compete and winning something. Competitive programming has become a popular competition on computer science community until now.", "For me, competitive programming is challenging because you have to solve the problem and solve it using algorithms that exist or implementing your own algorithm.", "While I was a freshman, I still spend my time to compete on it, and also, I got introduced to Data Science. It has been popular for recent years thanks to the amount of data and the machine learning algorithms that exist.", "I just amazed on how fast the development on this field and also the applications that are using data science approach. Because of that, I become interest to data science.", "Then suddenly, I got a dilemma to choose whether I keep on pursuing competitive programming, or I keep on upgrading my data skills. Based on my experience, those things are solving problems.", "But do you ever think to pursue both or to choose one of them?", "You read this article because you probably have the same dilemma that I had before while I\u2019m new to the data science field. Therefore, I want to give you some perspectives on whether competitive programming is useful for your career or not.", "I write this article, especially for those who are a new student in computer science or probably currently start in data science. If you are new to competitive programming, I hope that this will be useful to you.", "I write this based on my experience while exploring many fields in Computer Science.", "The article will divide into sections. First, I will introduce what the competitive programming is. Then, I will show you the differences from Kaggle competitions. And finally, I will give you some perspectives from software engineering and also data science, and emphasize whether it\u2019s worth pursuing or not.", "Competitive programming is a competition where people have to solve problems with a time limit. Regularly, It will give you the input and output examples, and then you implement the problem using any programming language.", "Here is the example of problem from Codeforces,", "As we can see first, the problem statement shows the problem with a story. Then, it shows you the example case. Finally, it shows some note to it.", "With that problem statement, you have to decompose the steps that we have to do, and then, we design and implement the algorithm to solve it. It just shows the several cases, but actually, there is more. Therefore, you have to make sure that your algorithm can solve any cases.", "Overall, Competitive programming will challenge your team on problem-solving and programming skills. Also, because you have to solve problems algorithmically, you have to write the solutions step by step.", "The competition is really different when you compare it with Kaggle, one of the homes of the data science communities.", "On Kaggle, you will get the problem statement and also the dataset. You have to solve the problem using machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome with a minimum error. Besides of solving the problem, you have to analyze the data to get insights, patterns, outliers, and many more.", "Here it shows the house price prediction from Kaggle,", "In the example, you want to solve the regression problem where you have to predict how much the price of the house with given data. Therefore, you have to tune the model so it can predict the values with less error. Also, you have to analyze the dataset to get more insights.", "In competitive programming, you also analyze the algorithm, but it\u2019s different to data science. You will analyze your algorithm performance.", "If you found that your algorithm does not meet some requirements like your algorithm exceeds the time limit, then you have to improve the algorithm. Therefore, you can solve the problem.", "In Data Science, you will also analyze your model, and then you improve the model to have higher performance.", "But what makes it different is because you are also investigating patterns on the data. With that pattern, we hope to get some insights, and probably hypothesis before we continue to create the model.", "Overall, data science competition that exists mostly on analyzing your data and also modelling to achieve higher accuracy. You do not write the algorithm explicitly just like on competitive programming that is from scratch, but you only use the ready-to-use packages for such algorithms.", "Despite that, you have to analyze the dataset and find the pattern to it, and also find insights that could become the hypothesis of your problem. That part is the most challenging part of data science itself.", "So, given that information, should you pursue both at the same time or focus on one of those only?", "Well, I don\u2019t know. You have the authority which one to choose. If you are still confused, let me give you some of my opinions.", "Competitive programming and data science are different from each other. Competitive programming solves problems by implementing some algorithms by yourself. Data science, in other hand, is also solving problems, but it doesn\u2019t involve algorithms implementation to it. Therefore, it\u2019s a different field.", "It still worth pursuing competitive programming if you want to solve a new data science problem that don\u2019t have any implementation of given ML algorithm.", "Also, it\u2019s worth to pursue if you want to become a software engineer because it has lots of algorithm implementation to it.", "But if you are interested only analyzing and modelling your dataset and focus mostly on the analysis, you should not spend your time too much on competitive programming.", "You can improve your data science skillset because there\u2019s a lot of skill that you must learn, such as programming, deep learning, data visualization, statistics, and many more.", "That is my recommendations, and that\u2019s ending of this article.", "Your home for data science.
