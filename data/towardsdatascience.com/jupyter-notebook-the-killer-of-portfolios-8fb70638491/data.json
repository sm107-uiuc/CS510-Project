We all know the notebook as a fantastic tool that makes scientific computing not only far easier, but also much more efficient. This is especially true for machine-learning applications. Research and developments can be thoroughly explained with markdown cells sandwiched between simple, short bursts of code \u2014 what\u2019s not to love?", "Notebooks are great, and a very important part of any aspiring Data Scientist\u2019s portfolio. It\u2019s hard to deny that notebooks aren\u2019t an incredibly important staple in modern Data-Science and machine-learning in the modern era. However, there is a way that you can present yourself as less-likely to obtain a job just from having a portfolio that is primarily comprised of notebooks.", "Part of the problem with restricting your work to notebooks is the reality of most Data Science position isn\u2019t usually sitting in a notebook and constantly fitting and serializing models. Of course, this will always be very specific to the position in question, but in a way \u2014 the reality of Data Science can be rather disappointing, regardless of the size of your machine-learning arsenal. In order to extrapolate data properly to work with in the first place, there is a pretty good chance that you are going to be building a lot of infrastructure. This is especially true of Junior Data Scientist or Intern positions at multi-thousand employee companies.", "To be clear, the low-grade startup falls into the same trap on a completely different front. Even being the sole Data Scientist will put you into this position, as you need data to work with in order to start your work on anything for a smaller startup. This job is likely to be even more difficult than the big corporate Data Scientist position. However, if you\u2019re like me and enjoy flexing your creativity muscles and branching into different disciplines of computing, this environment will likely excite me.", "If most of the job is Pipelining and setting up data infrastructure, then what value do notebooks hold.", "As I stated previously, while notebooks are certainly a great way to create reproducible research, if a hiring manager looks at a Github profile and it only returns repository of Jupyter-Notebooks, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re not going to get the job. This is because you are demonstrating skills that are only part of the job, and not the full thing. I can assume that you can write adequate code in a notebook, but", "The only information that notebooks can properly provide is your ability to perform operations like fitting a model. Another key thing that I look at in the notebook section of portfolios is organization. How reproducible is your code, and how easy did you make it for your peers to observe the code you performed? These are both very important pieces of information about you that can be collected from your notebooks. Although notebooks are a small part of your overall portfolio, they are still important. Fortunately, I have written an article on precisely these topics that you can use to freshen up your notebooks here:", "A great comparison we can make to Notebooks is a terminal session. Let\u2019s pretend for a second that we are dev-ops engineers, and our job is to deploy full-stack web services. The largest part of my dev-ops portfolio certainly isn\u2019t going to be the output of my terminal sessions, though they might be important. Though surely configuration files and code to run back-ends are definitely a big part of a dev-ops engineers portfolio, the most important thing is returning a product. Products are what companies are looking for. If you\u2019re able to ship a product, then it\u2019s likely that you do have all the skills required to repeat that job.", "Similarly, we could compare this to a Full-stack web-developer. No hiring manager is going to take the time to go through your repositories and download all of your files to research your code. There certainly might be a peak into some files to see how many redundant operations you perform in your notebook or application, but it\u2019s important to remember that the most important thing is to deliver something that is functional and can actually be used:", "I have reviewed so many portfolios, and even had colleagues with portfolios that are incredibly centered around Jupyter-Notebook. While these are certainly a big part of a Data-Scientist\u2019s portfolio, the most important thing is to deliver a real result. The problem is that many Data-Scientists don\u2019t want to get comfortable with BASH, which is rather problematic as it often becomes a staple of the job.", "Making a model is great, but if you don\u2019t know how to deploy it or obtain the data for it, then the model is essentially useless. If it can\u2019t be queried and produce a proper return, then the model will never have any real use. Although what\u2019s going on behind the scenes might be a little more advanced than the viewer is lead to believe, if the product is good at its job, then chances are you will be getting the job.", "Although Jupyter Notebooks are a staple of modern scientific computing and are essentially required for a proper Data Scientist\u2019s portfolio, the lack of substance pertaining to many of the primary operations of the job are usually left out from these portions of your portfolio. Jupyter is a great tool to make legible, reproducible code, but certainly falls a bit on its face in certain scenarios.", "I thought I might touch on this subject because there are many Data Scientists that are a little obsessed with notebooks. While notebooks are a great and important part in any scientific computing job, it\u2019s unlikely that notebooks being the staple of your Github account I think it\u2019s very important that Scientists have commits of more than just Jupyter. Notebooks are also relatively straightforward to revise, so touching them up might be a good idea!", "Your home for data science.
