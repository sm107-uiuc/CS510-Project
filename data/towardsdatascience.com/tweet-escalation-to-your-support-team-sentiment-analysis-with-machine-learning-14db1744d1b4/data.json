I thought it would be interesting and useful to implement use case, which would allow reporting tweets sent by people to airline companies where people are asking help. Airlines must be getting lots of such tweets daily, some of them are not relevant at all. My goal was to pick only those tweets which would require escalation and review by a human. This should improve support team results and perhaps help to keep more loyal customers.", "I have implemented Machine Learning model for tweet sentiment analysis inspired by instructions given in this book (Chapter 4) \u2014 Machine Learning for Business. I highly recommend reading this book for anyone who is looking for practical recipes on how to implement Machine Learning in their company.", "Based on the airline (it is not limited to airline only, it can be any Twitter account) account, we fetch 100 latest tweets written to that account. Only those tweets which require escalation and must be handled by human are displayed in the list. Even tweet is classified as the one to be escalated, we can identify by probability score how likely it is to be escalated (see red, yellow and green points).

You can read about BlazingText and how to run it in AWS SageMaker in this book (Chapter 4) \u2014 Machine Learning for Business, all is described step by step and really simple to understand. You don\u2019t need to purchase the book to download source code (get it from source code link).

The original dataset can be viewed here: www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter/home. Along with source code, you can download the processed dataset. Book authors processed original dataset \u2014 they removed all of the tweets except the original tweet and used the responses to generate label the original tweet as escalated or not escalated.

The reason is pretty obvious \u2014 to access Twitter API we need to provide keys mapped to Twitter account, we can\u2019t keep these keys on the client. Once request will come from the client, it will go to Node.js backend POST handler method.
