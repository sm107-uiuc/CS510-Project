His question was linked to a very specific problem at our company, but the implications of the answer is much deeper than that. He asked:", "The current model in production determines whether or not we\u2019ll return a call to a lead based on a given set of features. If the previous model determined that certain features indicate we should never call a lead, then those features are now highly correlated with the outcome since we only called those leads back. If I want to spin up a new model, wont those features be leaked data?", "Put in another way: if we train a model with a given set of features, and we exhibit action based on those features, then those features are now correlated with the outcome and all subsequent models will continue to use them.", "Let\u2019s say our model has leads from Facebook, Google, and Bing. If our first model decides that the probability of conversion is 3%, 5%, and 1% from these given sources, and we have finite amount of callbacks we can make, we will only callback the 5% probability. Now fast forward two months. The second model finds these probabilities are now: 0.5%, 8.5%, and 0%. What happened?", "Because we started only calling Google leads back, we increased our chances of converting these leads, and likewise, because we stopped calling Facebook and Bing leads, these leads never converted because we never called them. This is an example of a real world feedback loop.", "This feedback loop is dangerous for a company, but can be even more dangerous for a society.", "In the example above, the feedback loop means that we are dropping Facebook and Bing leads because of historical conversion rates. These underlying rates could change, meaning that these leads actually could become better in time (for example, if Facebook does a better job funneling leads to the right places). Since we have a model with strong coefficients dragging the weights down, we may never call these leads and will be biased against them even given a change.", "The model in this case, is no longer based on the actual underlying distribution of lead conversion from source, but instead, is based on the behavioral outcome (i.e. calling the sources back) of lead conversion from source.", "The famous case of this feedback loop is with recidivism models. If we train a model to predict if an inmate will end up back in jail based on some features including location, sex, probability of family members going to jail, and crime committed, we might find that our model is particularly biased against a certain ethnicity and sex. Why is this?", "If black men in Baltimore are more likely to go to jail because of the color of their skin and their sex, then the model will pick this up. But why are they more likely to go to jail? Is it because their underlying distribution of committing crimes is higher than a white female in Seattle, or is it because historically (and currently) are justice system is more prejudice against this group and takes action against them at a much higher rate?", "This might not sink in particularly deep for most readers, not because you don\u2019t care about justice, but because you might not be someone in control of recidivism models. So another example I\u2019ll highlight is hiring models.", "Let\u2019s say we add gender into our hiring models. A hiring model here is model to predict if a hire will be a successful candidate for a company. Let\u2019s say we\u2019re building a hiring model for software developers at Google. We find that the vast majority of \u201csuccessful\u201d software developers happen to be male. Then given 1k of candidates, shouldn\u2019t we only pick the male candidates?", "This model might be biased for several reasons, such as, \u201csuccessful\u201d is chosen by some metric that is inherently more male centric, that women have a harder time being \u201csuccessful\u201d in a male dominated world, or a host of other reasons. Despite this, a company could take action based on this gender division and create that division further.", "Perhaps today, most companies are aware of racial and gender inequalities, and actively work against it. But perhaps hidden a few layers deep it is missed in bank loan models, insurance price models, and other models dictating our world.", "Your home for data science.
