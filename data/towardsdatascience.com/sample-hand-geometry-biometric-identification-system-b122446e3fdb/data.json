This example highlights 6 general steps of a data analysis and discusses what kind of elements it would involve.", "The complete code (a Jupyter Notebook) can be found here.", "This report explains an approach to implement a \u201cHand Geometry based entity Identification\u201d system using supervised learning. Training data with labels is provided and the Test data has to be classified and labeled by the designed system. The classification system will be measured by accuracy.", "Accuracy is defined as the % of correct assessment over all the assessments.", "We are provided Training and Test Data \u2014 each consist of 100 samples of 23 2D points depicting the hand-geometry (Figure 2.0). The Training data is labeled (we know who\u2019s hand it is) while the Test data is what we have to identify (who\u2019s hand is this?).", "Training and Test data were loaded into DataFrames and each of the 23 2D points were labelled accordingly in appropriate columns. All classification labels were converted into integer codes for computation and classification purposes later on. All raw data points were confirmed to be non-null and numerical.", "Figure 2.1 below show Hex-bin plots for the training and test data to see a high-level overview of the data points. They show an outline of a hand print as expected.", "The following features were generated for each outline in the datasets:", "Figure 3.1 depicts these geometric features which seem to be intuitive measures to understand hand outlines and placements.", "After removing the original raw data points, this leads to 4049 total features. A correlation analysis was performed to remove highly correlated features (since they would not be discriminative). This lead to a total of 460 features remaining which were used for the next steps.", "Classification for this experiment required feature scaling, feature reduction or selection, and training a classifier.", "Since we are preparing features to discriminate hand outlines for different labels, feature scaling transforms our features into a relative measure compared to the rest of the values for any given feature. Feature scaling is also often used to transform the feature space into the fixed ranges of values in order to reduce standard deviations and consequently reduce the effect of outliers. In this experiment, two popular methods of scaling were compared: Min-Max scaling and Standard scaling.", "Min-Max scaling scales features into a fixed range between [0,1] while Standard scaling transforms a feature space by removing the mean and scaling such that each feature distribution has a unit variance.", "Feature reduction or selection reduces the feature space into a minimal set of highly discriminative features. This helps to train classifiers that generalize better as well as for compute efficiency purposes. Using all features with as when the training set has little examples (only 100) would lead to overfitting and thus not be able to accurately predict samples in the test set. This experiments compares PCA (referred to as PCA) to reduce features and ANOVA F-value scores (referred to as SelectKBest)to select the topN features. Various values for N were tried to find the value that would lead to the highest accuracy.", "Using the scaled and reduced features, a supervised learning task was performed to train a classifier using provided classification labels. Four classifiers \u2014 LinearSVC, SVC, a Gaussian Process Classifier, and a Random Forest Classifier \u2014 were experimented with alongside hyper-parameter tuning for their respective hyper-parameters. Hyper-parameter tuning was done to empirically determine which setting of the classifier led to the best results. These parameters are hard to theoretically derive as their effect is heavily dependent on the kind and form of the training data.", "All combinations of Feature Scaling, Feature Reduction/Selection (with varying values of N), and Classification (with varying hyper-parameter values) were simulated leading to a total of 500 simulations.", "A stratified 5-fold cross validation approach \u2014 so one label from each class was set aside as validation data\u2014 was used to evaluate success for each simulation on Accuracy. This led to selecting the best combination of feature reduction/selection and classifier together that resulted in the best accuracy across the cross-validation sets. Cross-validation was performed to effectively judge the accuracy of the model \u2014 a simple split of training and validation samples could allow a model to get lucky. Putting each of the 5 samples per class in our training set as a validation sample guaranteed that the model accuracy would be judged with all combinations of splits.", "The final distribution of Accuracy over the simulations is depicted in Figure 5.1. As visible, majority of simulations led to an accuracy between [0.8,0.98].", "Figure 5.2 compares Accuracy for the various preprocessing (Feature Scaling + Feature Reduction/Selection) schemes leading to the finding that ANOVA F-value score (SelectKBest) feature selection method generally led to better accuracies in the system. This is somewhat expected as the ANOVA F-value method determines feature discrimination directly by performing statistical test dependant on the class labels while PCA is a \u2018unsupervised\u2019 method of feature reduction and does not deal with feature discrimination for classification directly. This may also be the reason why choice of scaling methods seems to significantly affect PCA but not the ANOVA F-value scores.", "Figure 5.3 compares Accuracy for the various classifiers. SVC and Gaussian Process Classifier generally performed better than others with SVC more consistently scoring high.", "A more detailed view is given by Figure 5.4 which shows the Accuracy spread (across hyper parameter values) for the different preprocessing schemes, classifiers, as well as the the # of feature reduced/selected components. The table in Figure 5.5 shows the max accuracies obtained by the varying configurations once hyper-parameters were tuned.", "The outperformance of SVC compared to LinearSVC indicates that a non-linear decision boundary better discriminates the different classes. Gaussian Process Classifier also performed as well as SVC in the right conditions and had a standard deviation of 0 in its simulation. This shows the sensitivity of SVC over Gaussian Process Classifier \u2014 the regularization hyper-parameter, C , has to be tuned to get the best results while Gaussian Process Classifier implicitly learns the regularization parameter itself regardless of which random state you start with. This shows Gaussian Process Classifier to be more stable generally. Gaussian Process Classifier also implicitly learns the kernel when finding the best decision boundary between classes while SVC kernel has to be defined beforehand (in this experiment it was set to rbf). However, SVC is much faster for training and can do slightly better when the hyper parameter is tuned right.", "From the above data, the best configuration for the system (leading to an average cross validation accuracy of 98%) was selected as the following:", "The feature selection method chose the following top 15 features:", "Figure 6.1 displays the most discriminative features on the hand outline sample image. The red solid lines form triangles, and the solid black lines represent euclidean distance. It seems that automated feature selection has found features that we may intuitively guess to be the most discriminative \u2014 mainly triangles and lengths from finger tips to the edge of the hands or start of fingers, which would largely define the size and spread of the hand.", "Figure 6.2 displays correlation between the selected discriminative features \u2014 indicating they are are not highly correlated and each provide valuable (or at least differing) information.", "The selected classifier, along with preprocessing methods, was then used to predict on the test dataset. Though it is tough to see the results of the test dataset since we have unlabelled samples, we can get an idea of the quality of prediction by reducing the feature space into 2D (using PCA or TSNE) and mapping out the results. (This loses information but is only a rough idea to see the clustering structure of our results). In Figure 6.3, the squares are test classifications \u2014 the visual indicates that the classifier is indeed classifying test samples into a label of which the training samples exhibit a similar feature set as the test feature vector. The clustered-behaviour present in the figure is a good sign that our features are discriminative enough to group together samples of the same label.", "In conclusion, the classification system successfully selected valuable discriminative features leadings to a positive 98% validation score and predicted test sample labels such that they were close to the respective training samples in reduced feature space.", "Your home for data science.
