There is a good chance, if you are reading this article with any purpose and intent, that you have come across this sentiment quite often. And, in fact, I am guessing that there is a better than average chance it is possible that you have personally experienced this sentiment.", "I certainly have. That is the genesis and the foundation of this article. For quite some time, I was genuinely frustrated to the point of distraught, as I truly and honestly believed that someone with my educational background and experience was likely incapable of understanding or working with Machine Learning techniques.", "The short answer is yes. We can argue over what \u201caverage\u201d means in this context, but my own personal experience (which is admittedly quite limited) indicates to me that a background in those disciplines that are assumed to be required (e.g. computer science, calculus and other forms of higher-level math, statistics, programming, etc.), while certainly helpful, is either (i) not required at all or, (ii) if actually required, typically at a significantly more surface level than is initially perceived.", "I can\u2019t tell you how to become a Machine Learning expert for no other reason than I myself am just beginning down this path. But, I do feel comfortable in saying that the path that I have started on to \u201cMachine Learning Beginner\u201d is accessible and should be repeatable across a broad spectrum of individuals with a wide variety of backgrounds.", "As I mentioned above, I have been interested in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and other areas of cutting-edge computing, but honestly and truly felt that my lack of a \u201ctechnical\u201d education background was holding me back.", "To be clear, by society\u2019s bizarre standard of equating a diploma with actual intellectual accomplishment, I am considered very educated. I have an undergraduate degree in Russian Language and Literature from Dartmouth College, a master\u2019s degree in the same from Harvard University, and a law degree from Suffolk University (in Boston, Massachusetts).", "Until 2016, I was practicing as a corporate attorney at a very large, very prominent, international law firm, where I focused very narrowly on private equity transactions. In the middle of 2016, I made a completely age-appropriate decision (at age 45) to abandon a very lucrative career as a partner-track attorney to become a computer programmer, a discipline in which I had no prior formal training and no real substantive knowledge.", "For the sake of transparency, it wasn\u2019t quite that bad. I had always been interested in computers and had, prior to attending law school, worked for a few software companies, but any programming experience I had was (i) extraordinarily minimal, (ii) completely self-taught, and (iii) acquired in 2001\u20132002, which means that the knowledge was, as a practical matter, essentially useless.", "After about a year of self-teaching, I convinced a company to take a chance on me. I used that job to learn C#, improved my JavaScript, continued to learn about web application architecture, etc. Fast forward to today, I work at the Center for Clinical Data Science, but not as a Data Scientist.", "So, this is where I stand as I begin my journey into Data Science in the second half of 2019:", "If you believe you are, or might be, similar to me, I sincerely urge you to continue reading.", "Tutorials and help articles are great at trying to tell you what you should affirmatively be doing, but they traditionally spend significantly less time explaining what not to do. I believe that setting yourself up for success includes making sure to avoid potential traps and failures, and this journey has more than its fair share of those for the unwary.", "You will almost certainly fail in your journey to become a Machine Learning Beginner if:", "I can tell you as a programmer, if not as a Machine Learning practitioner, that learning to program is an exercise in patience. Computers are, in a very important (and yet ironic) sense, extraordinarily dumb machines \u2014 they do only what you tell them and literally nothing more.", "If you do not have the patience to sit in front of a computer and engage in the iterative process of coding, then debugging, and then researching, this is probably not going to be enjoyable for you.", "Regardless of the path you eventually choose to take to acquire your Machine Learning knowledge, it is almost certain that you will be given the advice to \u201ctype in all the code\u201d or \u201cwork along with the exercises\u201d or \u201cgo out and build the thing that we just built, but slightly different\u201d. These are all just variants of the same idea, which is that there is value in just \u201ctinkering\u201d \u2014 experimenting, reading the documentation when something fails, looking at other peoples\u2019 source code, etc. If you are not fundamentally driven and sustained by your own curiosity and a desire to \u201cbuild\u201d, you will almost certainly not keep up with those who are.", "This is, in essence, a re-statement of the initial concern, meaning that this is simply a concern as to whether someone with a non-traditional background can succeed in the world of Machine Learning. If this article accomplishes anything, I hope that it will at least dispel the myth that Machine Learning is completely unapproachable, or otherwise only for the lucky few that happen to have dual PhDs in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics/Statistics.", "I have posited that this is all do-able, not that it is easy. If it was easy, suffice it to say that everyone would be doing it, and if everyone was doing it, educational background could not, by force of logic, be a relevant factor, which means the operative question that this article attempts to address would be moot.", "The point simply is that there will be hard bumps in the road and how you deal with those will likely be more of a determining factor in the outcome of your success. Are you going to start scouring forums, mailings lists, Twitter, Medium, etc. and really pound the pavement until you get a satisfactory answer? Or are you going to be unsettled in the face of unfamiliar material? See \u201cYou lack patience and resolve\u201d above.", "The amount of material that can/could be learned in the process of just becoming a Machine Learning Beginner is simply overwhelming in its volume. To further complicate matters, the body of scholarship and relevant work product is increasing at such a rate that we tend to measure relevance in terms of single months and years as opposed to decades.", "There is no \u201cend\u201d to the development of technology now or in the foreseeable future and to try to identify some point at which you will know \u201ceverything about machine learning\u201d is to worship at the alter of a false god. Take your time, go over the relevant material a second and third time, write more code, build more things, document your learning process, and enjoy and celebrate the individual, smaller accomplishments along the way.", "So, yes, it is quite obviously possible to fail and it is not particularly hard to do. But then again, it is also not particularly hard to avoid most of these issues.", "There are tons of great resources out there that offer a comprehensive introduction to beginning Machine Learning concepts. One well known option is Andrew Ng\u2019s course on Coursera. Another option is offered by fast.ai. There isn\u2019t a right or wrong decision \u2014both have excellent reputations, with each course offering a teaching style that is slightly different than the other.\u00b9", "The salient point here is that you should make every effort to stick to a single course of study. Switching courses when you are presented with something you don\u2019t understand is unlikely to produce meaningful progress in the average case over a statistically significant period of time. The solution is not \u201cjust one more book from Amazon\u201d or \u201ca different, less technical tutorial.\u201d At some point, you simply have to buckle down, grit your teeth, and fight your way up and to the right of the learning curve.", "To be eminently clear, I am not suggesting that you don\u2019t supplement your own study efforts with outside resources or otherwise consult third party materials when you have a problem. I am suggesting that at some point, as you get deeper and deeper, you will run into concepts that are difficult to understand simply because they are, in fact, difficult concepts. Embrace the difficulty as a sign that you are pushing yourself past your comfort zone, which is where (in my experience) all things that are worth discussing in this world happen. Changing courses or books, or video series just isn\u2019t a viable long-term learning strategy and is indicative of a mindset that is looking for a \u201csilver bullet.\u201d As stated above, there are no silver bullets, no shortcuts \u2014 there is just hard work.", "Now is not the time to compare and contrast TensorFlow with PyTorch with MXNet, etc. As a complete beginner, you don\u2019t have sufficient knowledge or understanding of either the problem space of the implementation of any of these frameworks for any such decision to be something other than a regurgitation of another\u2019s thought process.", "Pick a mainstream framework with a large and active development community and stick to that. At this point, focus on learning over-arching concepts and avoid the rabbit hole that is the particulars of a given framework that may or may not be relevant a year from now.", "If you ever were required to study a foreign language, it\u2019s quite possible that you have run into the concept of gendered nouns. To grossly over-simplify, in many languages (of which English is not one), certain nouns are either masculine or feminine. By way of example, take this excerpt from this article (my emphases added).", "There are some nouns that express entities with gender for which there is only one form, which is used regardless of the actual gender of the entity, for example, the word for person; personne; is always feminine, even if the person is male, and the word for teacher; professeur; is always masculine even if the teacher is female.", "The point is that, just as trying to understand the logic of why a person is always feminine regardless of gender is a fruitless exercise (the answer is inevitably \u201cit just is \u2014 accept it as an article of truth and move on\u201d), trying to understand everything about Machine Learning during the first pass is simply not a reasonable expectation. There are certain things that you will simply have to take on faith for the time being.", "That is not to say that you don\u2019t note the question for further research at some later point in time, but trying to learn everything about everything that you don\u2019t understand each time you confront something you don\u2019t understand is merely a clever variation of the \u201cYou are intending to learn all of Machine Learning\u201d discussed above.", "Despite what your better angels may be telling you, your drive to try to delve into the details is not helping you learn. In fact, quite the opposite, as these are rabbit holes that just potentially delay the time until you obtain a solid grasp and foundation on the larger picture that provides the necessary context for more meaningful exploration.", "I don\u2019t have anything particularly interesting (and certainly nothing original) to add about the specifics of any one tool or workflow, other than to say it is important to have a set of tools that you know, are comfortable with, and that are reasonably reliable.", "There are multiple, well-documented solutions on everything from Google Cloud to AWS to Azure to Jupyter Notebooks to plugins for Vim, Emacs, VSCode, et al. Setting up an industry-grade Machine Learning pipeline for a single developer\u2019s use is, as of the latter half of 2019, very affordable and very well-documented.\u00b2", "I don\u2019t believe this gets enough attention. You will be, even in the initial stages of this journey, bombarded with information, some of which you will be able to grasp and some of which you will not. As stated above, given the state of our knowledge, there are certain things that you will have to take on faith for the time being. But you should absolutely noting those concepts that you do not understand so that you can eventually, when you have more context, do the deep dive that is truly required.", "I personally use Coggle, but at the risk of boring you with repetition, it is not really about the tool you pick. Text files, Markdown files, Jupyter Notebooks, OneNote, Evernote, etc. will all work. My personal preference stems from the fact that I prefer \u201cmind map\u201d-style diagrams. As opposed to a hierarchical format (as in an outline, for instance), which I often find do not line up with the mental model of the material in my mind. A mind-map allows me to connect nodes to other nodes in fairly arbitrary patterns, which allows me to document things in a way that is more natural to my brain.", "If you are transitioning to Machine Learning from something other than Software Engineering, this might seem non-intuitive. Put simply (and more than a little tongue-in-cheek), an overwhelming majority of the job could be colloquially described as \u201cgetting your code to compile\u201d, which, by definition, means that the majority of time, your code is in a non-working, failing state.", "Of course, as human beings, we do everything in our power possible to exacerbate that feeling of inadequacy in others and ourselves by making sure that errors are shown in bold text, in bright red, accompanied by iconography that indicates that you are engaged in wrongdoing, etc.", "The reality is that there is an aspect of this work that, like Software Engineering (and I feel comfortable saying this after having observed more than a few Data Scientists at work), represents a somewhat tedious cycle of experimentation, bug-identification and fixing, followed by further experimentation. If you don\u2019t have the tenacity, the drive to build, and a natural curiosity that is capable of powering you through those moments, this might not be the discipline for you.", "Becoming even a Machine Learning Beginner is far from a simple undertaking, but then, nothing worth doing ever is.", "I will leave you with a simple thought experiment \u2014 if (i) Data Science is the fastest growing job in the United States and (ii) only people who have a Data Science background can fill that job, how can (i) be true? How can it possibly be the fastest growing job?", "In other words, for the first (I believe, spurious) assertion to be true, wouldn\u2019t there have to be scores of people just sitting around who, for some reason, just happen to have the perfect skill set required by an industry that didn\u2019t meaningfully exist a decade ago. Does that seem likely?", "Or is it more likely that the more reasonable explanation \u2014 that otherwise capable individuals like yourselves and like me are cross-training and developing new skills in this area precisely because these skills are, in fact, accessible?", "I leave that as an exercise to the curious reader.", "N.B. \u2014 I am not associated and/or affiliated any of the organizations mentioned in this article other than my current employer, the Center for Clinical Data Science. I do not receive any discounts or other benefits from any of the companies mentioned (other than my employer) that are not publicly available to anyone with a valid credit card as of the time of this writing.", "[1] For the sake of complete disclosure, I am working through the fast.ai coursework. After briefly evaluating both the fast.ai coursework and Andrew Ng\u2019s course offering, I decided that the fast.ai approach would personally serve me better. I like the \u201ctop-down\u201d approach in which, very generally speaking, you start by \u201cdoing\u201d and then move to \u201cunderstanding\u201d.", "[2] I personally use Google Cloud Platform and their AI Notebooks service, but I have also used, and was happy with, AWS SageMaker.", "Your home for data science.
