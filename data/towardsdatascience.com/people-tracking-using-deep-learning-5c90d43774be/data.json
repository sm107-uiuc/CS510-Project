It involves the process of tracking an object which could be a person, ball or a car across a series of frames. For people tracking we would start with all possible detections in a frame and give them an ID. In subsequent frames we try to carry forward a person\u2019s ID. If the person has moved away from the frame then that ID is dropped. If a new person appears then they start off with a fresh ID.", "This is a difficult task since people could look similar causing the model to switch IDs, people may get occluded as in when a pedestrian or player gets hidden behind someone else or objects may disappear and reappear in later frames.", "Deep Learning has allowed us to get a phenomenal performance on tracking. See below the results from the deep sort algorithm on a video from the multiple object tracking (MOT dataset) test set.", "Lets first start by reviewing the basics of tracking. Lets assume we have bounding box information for all objects in the frame. In real world applications we need to do bounding box detections in advance so tracker needs to be combined with a detector. But for now lets assume we are only working on tracking. Given bbox information for an ID in frame 1, how do we assign IDs in subsequent frames?", "I love the deep sort algorithm. It is so intuitive. In all of the above math, one fundamental thing that is missing that we humans use all the time in tracking is a visual understanding of that bounding box. We track based on not just distance, velocity but also what that person looks like. Deep sort allows us to add this feature by computing deep features for every bounding box and using the similarity between deep features to also factor into the tracking logic.", "How do we compute deep features?", "This paper uses a model trained on millions of human images and extracts a 128 dim vector for each bounding box which should capture the key features of the box. Using deep features allows this model to track much better in cases where people are occluding or are very close as in the image below.", "Overall our experiments show that deep sort algorithm does work very well but it does have some limitations:", "Tracking is an important problem in Computer Vision with tons of applications. Deep Sort algorithm is quite powerful and fast to run and is a good starting point for many cases. Their repo is very well written and easy to try. I encourage you to pull their code and give it a shot.", "I have my own deep learning consultancy and love to work on interesting problems.
