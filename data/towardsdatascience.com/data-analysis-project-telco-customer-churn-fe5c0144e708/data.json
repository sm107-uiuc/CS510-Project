And, the average LTV of 80% of those who unsubscribed is 750 dollars. On the other hand, the average LTV of the top 20% of unsubscribed is 4750 dollars. And the ratio by the sum of total LTV by each group is 750*4: 4750 = 1: 1.6, which suggests we should focus on serving those 20% customers with high LTV, which brought 60%(1.6/2.6) of our revenue from leaked customers.", "Note: 100% of those who brought high LTV used and are using internet service.", "Note: 81% of those who bring high LTVs tend to used lines. There is no big difference between those who are still paying for the service or those who unsubscribed.", "Note: Those who bring high LTVs, loved to use Fiber optic(75%-90%) and DSL(10\u201320%), and none of them used internet service.

During the process of assessing data and conducting the exploratory data analysis, I have found some limitations:", "Limitation 1: In this dataset, we can only see one type of each variable instead of a real-world situation of changing different options as time passes, i.e., in the real world, people might want to try streaming services, but they might change their minds to use tech supports next month.", "Limitation 2: We cannot consider all these variables as the exact reasons why customers left because they might leave for the better price offered by competitors or the bad economy at a certain time, etc. We cannot see the time they leaked, so it\u2019s hard to infer those external situations.", "Finally, data has a better idea, but you should always doubt any insight and the data to be some degree wrong or have some biases, no matter who provided them to you are experts or people with high credibility.", "Thanks for spending your time reading this article.", "If you\u2019re an employer wanting to find a data analyst intern, here is my LinkedIn or contact me through my email(ychen596@insite.4cd.edu)", "If you\u2019re also working in the data science/business analytics field, feel free to give me any feedback through IG(@jchen_mmm), by email, or by comment below!", "Your home for data science.
