Consuming streaming data at this velocity without any loss of information is always not an easy task and is non-trivial.", "2: Variety (Types): If the data is unstructured(JSON/audio/video format), then it becomes more difficult to analyze such data especially when the data is in flight (will cover in future articles) as compared to when the data in rest!", "3: Volume (DB Size): From Terabytes (TBs) to Petabytes(PBs) to Exabytes (EBs), storing streaming data requires lots of space and again scanning such raw data to query over it also becomes a challenging task.", "Tip: These 3V\u2019s are the key parameters that decide the data category (small, medium or big data) and hence also play a key role in deciding the type of Database storage solution we need to store the data. Confused? See below:", "Let me start by clearing the common myth & confusion after reading the word \u201cserverless\u201d \u2014 serverless does not mean performing computation without servers. Simply means delegating the responsibility for managing the Servers to the Cloud Service Providers (AWS/Google Cloud Platform (GCP)/Microsoft Azure), so that we can always focus on business logic!", "So, why should we use a serverless approach?", "I have already mentioned the 3 main challenges with the streaming data. It requires not only lots of Team effort but constant maintenance. Auto Scaling/Elasticity is also not very trivial. Eventually more cost!", "But, In serverless, it\u2019s the opposite, We require minimal maintenance. Cloud Service Providers will auto-scale for us and eventually way less maintenance & cost!", "Note: In BONUS \u2014 Pro Tips: I will also share, how to configure the delivery streams so it cost as minimum as possible.", "AWS: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the cloud provider we are using. One can use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or MS Azure for respective services.", "Step 1: AWS Kinesis Producer: I am using here AWS Kinesis Agent, as in my example the data is consuming directly onto the file. AWS Kinesis Agent will directly transfer these file Objects to S3 via AWS Kinesis Delivery Streams.", "Kinesis Agent needs to be installed where you are receiving the streaming data or generating the log data.", "Go to agent.json from the above command and place Your IAM credentials, & the location of the server where you are receiving the streaming or generating the log data. Below you can find the agent.json file:", "You can also do the same using AWS Kinesis SDK Library and the code for the same using Python you can find it here:", "Note: I have used JavaScript for Kinesis Producer Library example using npm aws-kinesis-producer", "Step 2: Let\u2019s set up AWS S3 now. We just need to create an AWS S3 Bucket. While you can AWS S3 Bucket, you can choose default S3 Server Side Encryption (S3-SSE) also for Encryption at rest.", "Step 3: Now we are setting up AWS Kinesis Delivery Streams. You can find the options below. Partitioning is a must so that Athena can be able to SCAN the data faster. I am partitioning the data below hours-wise.", "If you want to use AWS Lambda for records transformation in flight, You can do that also. You can find the manual transformation code below:", "Note: Standard records transformation to JSON is also available. You can find it here: https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs", "Step 4: Finally, AWS Athena for querying over our AWS S3 data lake, excited! Below attaching both the query for making a Database in Athena over S3 data and select a query for reading the data.", "If your data is already partitioned inside S3, You can also use existing S3 partition inside Athena, by typing the following ALTER command in Athena console.", "Note: You might be thinking, How AWS Athena crawls & scan the S3 Data? It uses AWS Glue Data Crawler (similar to Extract Transform Load ( ETL) job). It does all the heavy lifting under the hood. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/populate-data-catalog.html", "Mention: Athena also allows to invoking Machine Learning using SQL Queries. RANDOM_CUT_FOREST (for outliers), HOTSPOTS (for finding the dense area) are popular for that. That\u2019s easy too\u2026", "Note: GZIP is known for large compression ratios, but poor decompression speeds and high CPU usage as compared to ZIP format. GZIP usually preferred!", "Thanks for reading. I hope you will find this blog helpful. Please stay tuned for more such upcoming blogs on cutting-edge Big Data, Machine Learning & Deep Learning.
