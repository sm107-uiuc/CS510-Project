Examples include the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of an advertisement, the conversion rate of customers purchasing on your website, the likelihood of readers clapping for your blog, the probability of Trump winning a second term, the 5-year survival rate for women with breast cancer, and so on.", "Because the Beta distribution models a probability, its domain is bounded between 0 and 1.", "To grasp the intuition behind the Beta distribution, let\u2019s first examine its Probability Density Function (PDF):", "Then, the terms in the numerator \u2014 x to the power of something multiplied by 1-x to the power of something\u2014 look familiar.", "Have we seen something like this before?", "The intuition for the beta distribution comes into play when we look at it through the lens of the binomial distribution. Suppose we have a random variable X:", "The difference between the binomial and the beta distribution is that the former models the number of successes (x), while the latter models the probability (p) of success.", "In other words, the probability is a parameter in the binomial distribution. In contrast, in the Beta distribution, the probability is a random variable.", "You can think of \u03b1-1 as the number of successes and \u03b2-1 as the number of failures, just like n and n-x terms in binomial.", "You can choose the \u03b1 and \u03b2 parameters however you think they should be. For example, if you believe the probability of success is very high (e.g., 90%), set \u03b1 to 90 and \u03b2 to 10. Conversely, if you think the probability of failure is higher, set \u03b2 to 90 and \u03b1 to 10.", "As \u03b1 increases (more successful events), the bulk of the probability distribution will shift towards the right. On the other hand, an increase in \u03b2 moves the distribution towards the left (more failures).", "Additionally, the distribution will narrow if both \u03b1 and \u03b2 increase, indicating greater certainty.", "Let\u2019s say the likelihood of someone agreeing to go on a date with you follows a Beta distribution with \u03b1 = 2 and \u03b2 = 8. Using the Beta distribution, what is the probability that your success rate will be greater than 50%? In mathematical terms, we want to find P(X > 0.5).", "Calculating P(X > 0.5) = 1 \u2014 CDF(0.5), we get a probability of 0.01953. Unfortunately, this means that the likelihood of having a success rate greater than 50% is quite low. \ud83d\ude22", "To further explore the Beta distribution, I recommend checking out this beautiful calculator that Dr. Bognar at the University of Iowa made. This calculator allows you to experiment with different values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 and visualize how the shape of the distribution changes.", "When it comes to modeling probability distributions, there are many options to choose from. You might wonder why we should use the Beta distribution over other arbitrary probability distributions.", "If we just want to create a probability distribution that models probability, we can use any arbitrary distribution over the interval (0,1). And creating one should be easy. Just take any function that doesn\u2019t blow up anywhere between 0 and 1 and stays positive, integrate it over this interval (0 to 1), and then simply divide the function by the result of that integration. This will give us a probability distribution that can be used to model probability. This makes sense and sounds easy, but why do we insist on using the beta distribution over the arbitrary probability distribution?", "The Beta distribution is the conjugate prior for the Bernoulli, binomial, negative binomial and geometric distributions (seems like those are the distributions that involve success and failure) in Bayesian inference.", "Using a conjugate prior, such as the Beta distribution, in Bayesian inference gives us significant advantages. One of the main benefits is that computing a posterior using a conjugate prior is very easy. It allows us to avoid the expensive numerical computations typically involved in Bayesian inference. When a conjugate prior is used, the posterior distribution belongs to the same family as the prior distribution, and that greatly simplifies the computations.", "If you don\u2019t know what the Conjugate Prior or Bayesian Inference is, first read:", "As a data scientist or machine learning engineer, your model is never done as long as it\u2019s being used in production. You have to update or retrain your model as more data come in. This is why we use Bayesian Inference.The computation in Bayesian Inference can be exceedingly heavy, or sometimes even intractable. But if we could use the closed-form formula with the conjugate prior, the computation becomes a piece of cake.", "In our dating example, the beta distribution is a conjugate prior to the binomial likelihood. During the modeling phase, if we choose to use the Beta distribution as a prior, we already know that the posterior will also be a Beta distribution. So, after doing more experiments (like asking more people to go on a date with you), you can compute the posterior simply by adding the number of acceptances and rejections to the existing parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 respectively, instead of multiplying the likelihood with the prior distribution.", "To sum up, the beta distribution is a convenient and also interpretable choice to model probabilities. It also simplifies Bayesian inference via its conjugacy with common probability distributions.", "The Beta distribution is a type of probability distribution that can take many different shapes. Depending on the values of its parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2, the probability density function (PDF) of Beta distribution can look like a bell-shape, a U-shape with asymptotic ends, a strictly increasing or decreasing line, or even a straight horizontal line.", "For instance, when \u03b1 = 8 and \u03b2 = 2, the PDF of the Beta distribution produces a bell-shaped curve in blue, in contrast to red. The x-axis represents the probability of success.", "Moreover, when \u03b1 + \u03b2 is large enough and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are approximately equal, the Beta PDF can approximate a normal distribution.", "The beta PDF can be a straight line too!", "When \u03b1 and \u03b2 are smaller than 1, the distribution takes on a U-shape, with the probability of success highest at the extremes.", "You can think of the shape of the beta distribution as reflecting the number of successes and failures it models.", "For example, if you think of \u03b1-1 as the number of successes and \u03b2-1 as the number of failures, Beta(2,2) means that you had 1 success and 1 failure. So it makes sense that the probability of the success peaks at 0.5.", "In this context, Beta(1,1) would mean you got zero head and zero tail. Then, your guess about the probability of success should be the same throughout [0,1] as the horizontal straight line shows.", "Why is it U-shaped? What does it mean to have negative (-0.5) heads and tails?", "I don\u2019t have a good answer for this one yet. I even asked this question on StackExchange, but haven\u2019t gotten a response yet. If you have a good idea about the U-shaped Beta, please let me know!", "Overall, the Beta distribution is a powerful tool for modeling a wide range of phenomena. The alpha and beta parameters control the shape, and larger values lead to a more \u2018smoothed out\u2019 distribution while smaller values lead to more extreme shapes. Its flexibility makes it a valuable tool for mathematicians, scientists, and researchers everywhere.", "Below is the code to produce the beautiful graphs above.", "When I first learned about Beta distribution in school, I derived it from the order statistic. The order statistic isn\u2019t the most widely used application of the Beta distribution, but it helped me think about the distribution deeper and understand it better.", "Let X\u2081, X\u2082, . . . , X\u2099 be independent, identically distributed (iid) random variables with PDF f and CDF F.", "We rearrange them from smallest to largest to obtain the order statistics, where X\u2096 is the k-th smallest value among X\u2081, \u2026, X\u2099.", "(Not familiar with the term \u201cDensity\u201d? Read \u201cPDF is NOT a probability\u201d)", "Notice that we don\u2019t need to choose or permute Xs bigger than x.", "Why Uniform(0,1) though? Because the domain of the Beta distribution is [0,1].", "What should be the value of B(\u03b1,\u03b2) so that the PDF of Beta adds up to 1?", "B(\u03b1,\u03b2) should be the area under the graph of the Beta PDF from 0 to 1.", "This section is for those who are proof-obsessed.", "You might have come across the PDF of Beta written in terms of the Gamma function. The Beta function is the ratio of the product of the Gamma function of each parameter divided by the Gamma function of the sum of the parameters.", "Let\u2019s look at the special case where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are integers and start with what we\u2019ve derived above.", "We can try to get to the base case B(1, *).", "By doing so, we can beautifully prove the Beta function.", "Your home for data science.
