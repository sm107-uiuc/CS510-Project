We are still trying to improve the recognition parts since there is an obvious limitation in numbers (the size of weights increasing at least linearly to the number of pets), other features involving automated face landmarks added with large scale diffeomorphism registration could help to normalize faces, also finding other features could help (i.e behavioral since we have body detection).
