I will also explain the process by which I created this dataset. The code and dataset are made available here. There are a few blog posts around this topic but this one is different in two ways, First, it will provide a clear guide on how to detect the speaker effectively using some best practices without falling in pit-falls and secondly, at the end I will cover some really interesting use cases/applications that can be extended from this work.

I created these spectrograms repeatedly at an interval of 90seconds from the mp3 clip.", "There\u2019s a really good read on Librosa and Music Genre Classification.", "Once we have converted the audio clips to Images, we can train a supervised Convolutional Neural network (CNN), model.", "Developing such an application had some of its own challenges. These challenges are", "While training this application, some things didn\u2019t work well for me, and somethings worked like a charm boosting the model\u2019s performance. In this section, I will call out the best practices to train such models without falling into the pitfall.", "I trained the model using FastAI Library. I used a ResNet architecture to train a CNN model.
