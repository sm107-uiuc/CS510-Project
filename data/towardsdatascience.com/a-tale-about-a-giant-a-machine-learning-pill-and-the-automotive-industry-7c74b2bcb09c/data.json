A giant so big and powerful, that everybody knew the giant. People worked for the Giant, creating great wealth for themselves and others. Then, the Giant received a wondrous Machine Learning pill from a friendly Fairy, promising to make the Giant ever more powerful.", "This is the second part of this trilogy about the impact of Machine Learning on the automotive industry. To better illustrate the complexity and challenges of using Machine Learning at established car manufacturers, the main points are complemented by this story about the Giant and a wondrous pill. The insights are based on my experience in working in the automotive industry and long-standing conversations with automotive experts from around the world. The trilogy is divided into the following parts: importance (I), opportunities (II), and challenges (III) of the automotive industry in implementing the transcendent technology of Machine Learning.", "This second part elaborates on the opportunities that the Machine Learning pill could give the Giant. It promises to grow the Giant even bigger and more powerful. Let\u2019s see how.", "Today, cars are driven by humans to get from A to B. Machine Learning is a key technology in allowing people or goods to be driven autonomously to the target destination. This is called Autonomous Driving (AD).", "AD allows the creation of manifold applications. RoboTaxis spring to mind immediately, which transport people in urban environments. Waymo, a Google subsidiary, is regarded as the front runner in future urban transportation. In 2019, the company started to test its autonomous taxi service in Phoenix, AZ, without a safety driver in the vehicle.", "Yet, AD is much bigger, not only allowing humans to get transported autonomously from A to B but also goods. Volkswagen, a car manufacturer, acknowledges that the logistics industry has the most urgent need for autonomous driving. Hence, it has spun-off the Volkswagen Autonomy GmbH from its commercial vehicles subsidiary. In the logistics business, the three main cost components are the price of the vehicle, gas, and salary. Reducing salary costs will improve the profitability of the logistics industry the most.", "The AD technology also enables other use-cases, like Scania\u2019s autonomous transporters, mining trucks, tractors, or any other working vehicle. John Deere, a heavy-equipment manufacturer, has been working on a semi-autonomous tractor for 20 years already. Where some farming fields need a whole day plow a single line, autonomous tractors promise immense benefits.", "Self-driving vehicles promise to break the magic product triangle for vehicles. The product triangle states that you should aim to create any product in a short amount of time, at a high quality, and at low costs. You can arrange any product along the magic product triangle. The product triangle for vehicles today is as follows.", "Cars can get people or goods from A to B in a short time, at low cost, and at a reasonable quality. AD offers the opportunity to expand each product capability to the conceivable maximum.", "Uber, a ride-hailing company, estimates that self-driving vehicles can reduce the cost per mile form 2.86$ in San Francisco to only .35$. This cost reduction by almost 90% improves the cost capability of the product triangle. AD can potentially improve the quality of any ride by giving back drivers the time to read, sleep, or work in the vehicle. And when trucks can move autonomously, the required break times for truck drivers can also be reduced to the bare minimum. AD expands all product capabilities of moving vehicles, thus offering tremendous opportunities for customer satisfaction and company growth.", "Given the overarching excitement about AD, customers await the arrival of self-driving cars. Major car manufacturers fuel this excitement by announcing ambitious start dates of autonomous ride-hailing services. Tesla, an electric car manufacturer, announced its planned autonomous driving shuttle service by the end of 2019. And it all seems to be so easy, with great toy videos about autonomously driving vehicles all around. Additionally, Udacity, an online learning platform, offers the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree since 2011. Stories of start-ups that are so close to solving AD abound, like the one below.", "Google is working on self-driving cars, and they seem to work. People are so bad at driving cars that computers don\u2019t have to be that good to be much better. \u2014 Marc Andreessen, Venture Capitalist at a16z, NYT 2011", "George Hotz, the famous Silicon Valley entrepreneur and founder of comma ai, came close to offering autopilot features at the end of 2016. George hacked an Acure vehicle, equipped it with a smartphone pointing its camera through the windshield on the road ahead. He then interjected the steering wheel, acceleration, and braking signals to maneuver the car. Find a video to an openpilot release here. Comma.ai set out to sell the AD hardware for 999$, plus a monthly subscription fee. In Part III, you\u2019ll hear how this story unfolded.", "Regardless of the ambitious announcements, many car manufacturers have delayed the timeline for bringing AD to market. Machine Learning is a key enabler in helping the Giant create a transformative new product. Let\u2019s investigate how the Machine learning pill can help the Giant bring about another cornerstone product.", "Let\u2019s assume that someday self-driving capabilities are ubiquitous. What will then distinguish one car from another? An increased focus will shift to the interior user experience.", "Today, the car cockpit is operated manually. Buttons and knobs overwhelm the driver with options to manipulate the car settings. Want to increase car temperature? Turn the A/C on, turn two wheels to the right to increase target temperature, and increase the fan. Four steps, for a single intent. Machine Learning enables the car to anticipate user needs and to fulfill voice-based requests immediately.", "Machine Learning is a key technology in enabling the personal assistant in the car. This assistant could learn the preferred temperature of the driver and adjust the car settings automatically. Users interact with the car through their voice, omitting the buttons and knobs.", "According to Samsung Next, Venture Capitalists are interested in investing in platforms. As Sarah Guo, Venture Capitalist at Greylock Partners, mentioned during the AI Frontiers Conference 2018, the internet platform gave rise to unicorns like Google or Facebook. Mobile as the next platform propelled companies like Lyft or AirBnB to unicorn valuations. Could the self-driving car be the next platform, enabling the rise of unicorn gaming, entertainment, or VR/AR start-ups?", "Machine Learning offers tremendous new product opportunities for automotive companies. Personal Assistants and Autonomous Driving are only a few customer-facing applications made possible with Machine Learning. Many more opportunities exist in the areas of smart production, RPA, and marketing.", "Back to the story. Now the Giant understands how this wondrous Machine Learning pill can make it even bigger and stronger. But the Giant still ponders whether going through these growing pains would be worth it. After all, it\u2019s one of the most powerful Giants in the world and afraid of no one. Then, on the far horizon, the Giant discovers a little Baby Giant. Approaching the Baby Giant, the Giant recognizes that it has been feasting on Machine Learning pills. The Baby Giant cannot walk yet, but it\u2019s clear that once it has grown to full strength, it can smash the Giant easily. Let\u2019s examine the Baby Giant next.", "The following two charts deserve your utmost attention. The chart below shows the company valuations of six mobility companies. Waymo currently tops the valuations at 105B$. Tesla\u2019s stock has been volatile, doubling company value to around 81 B$ in January 2020 in the past 2 months alone. Companies like Waymo, Uber, or Tesla represent the Baby Giant. The Giant is represented by automotive incumbents like VW, BMW, or Daimler.", "Waymo\u2019s valuation exceeds all other company valuations. Before earning a single dollar in revenue, it is already valued higher than BMW and Daimler combined. Waymo\u2019s technology relies heavily on Machine Learning to create the world\u2019s safest driver. Uber\u2019s and Tesla\u2019s valuations are also driven by their efforts in making AD a reality. Uber founder Travis Kalanick called self-driving vehicles the most important technology for Uber\u2019s future. Tesla\u2019s famous autopilot feature relies exclusively on Machine Learning to detect objects and keep the car in the lane.", "In contrast, the chart below shows the number of employees it takes each company to reach their prospective valuation. In 2018, Waymo barely crossed the 1,000 employees mark. On the other extreme, Volkswagen currently employs more than 660,000 employees around the world. You can see that the Baby Giant needs far fewer employees to generate staggering market valuations than the Giant.", "Now, let\u2019s not be unfair. Car manufacturers produce tangible value today. They sell tens of millions of vehicles every year. If the self-driving car technology doesn\u2019t check out, investors will lose a lot of money, but that\u2019s about it. But what if it does check out?", "Scared and anxious, the Giant swallows the bitter-tasting Machine Learning pill.", "This article laid out the transformative opportunities that can be realized through the Machine Learning pill. While the Giant is still hesitant about taking this pill, other Baby Giants who have been feasting on these Machine Learning pill see their powers explode.", "What will happen next, when the Giant swallows the pill, causing severe stress on its body? Continue here (coming Jan 19) to read about the challenges and side effects of implementing Machine Learning across this well-established industry. Reread the trilogy opening here.", "This story was presented at the Data Festival 2019. Find the video of this talk here.
