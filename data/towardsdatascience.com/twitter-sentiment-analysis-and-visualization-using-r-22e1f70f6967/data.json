However, when I started to find efficient ways of extracting data from external sources, I learned about R packages that interact with major platforms such as RFacebook (Facebook), rtweet (Twitter) and Rblpapi (Bloomberg). While it\u2019s possible to accomplish the same tasks in Python, RStudio\u2019s visual interface and plotting tools have earned bonus points.", "If you\u2019re using RStudio, you can quickly connect and pull data that is publicly available. In the case of Twitter, one can pull lists of users, trending topics in different regions, as well as lists of followers. This type of assessment would prove helpful for corporate analysts, as well as people involved in the political realm, or those of us who are simply curious about the reach of certain data science tools. There are countless ways to analyze this type of data (thinking of boxplots, histograms and text mining to name a few!).", "After authenticating to the Twitter API, I wanted to know how to assess and visualize what the social media site\u2019s users are not only saying, but also may be feeling, about a given topic. As part of this endeavor, I picked two random countries (Canada and Scotland) and then pulled 100 tweets from each region. I have documented the steps I took to connect to Twitter\u2019s API, search tweets, perform sentiment analysis using Bing and then plot the findings.", "Step 1: Load the required packages (including rtweet) in RStudio", "Step 2: Authenticate using your credentials to Twitter\u2019s API by creating an access token. Steps on getting Twitter access tokens:", "Step 3: Search tweets on the topic of your choice; narrow the number of tweets as you see fit and decide on whether or not to include retweets. I decided to include 100 tweets each for Canada and Scotland, plus decided not to include retweets, so as to avoid duplicate tweets impacting the evaluation.", "Step 4: Process each set of tweets into tidy text or corpus objects.", "Step 5: Use pre-processing text transformations to clean up the tweets; this includes stemming words. An example of stemming is rolling the words \u201ccomputer\u201d, \u201ccomputational\u201d and \u201ccomputation\u201d to the root \u201ccomput\u201d.", "Additional pre-processing involves converting all words to lower-case, removing links to web pages (http elements), and deleting punctuation as well as stop words. The tidytext package contains a list of over 1,000 stop words in the English language that are not helpful in determining the overall sentiment of a text body; these are words such as \u201cI\u201d, \u201c myself\u201d, \u201c themselves\u201d, \u201cbeing\u201d and \u201chave\u201d. We are using the tidytext package with an anti-join to remove the stop words from the tweets that were extracted in step 3.", "Step 6: Find the top 10 commonly used words in the set of tweets for both countries; this will give an overall picture of what the populations are most concerned about, and the extent to which they are engaged on these topics.", "The output below shows the top 10 words plotted for both Canada and Scotland.", "As you can see, the output for Scotland returned many more than 10 words, since many of these top words occurred the same number of times.", "Step 7: Perform sentiment analysis using the Bing lexicon and get_sentiments function from the tidytext package. There are many libraries, dictionaries and packages available in R to evaluate the emotion prevalent in a text. The tidytext and textdata packages have such word-to-emotion evaluation repositories. Three of the general purpose lexicons are Bing, AFINN and nrc (from the textdata package).", "To take a look at what each package contains, you can run the following commands in R:", "The get_sentiments function returns a tibble, so to take a look at what is included as \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d sentiment, you will need to filter accordingly. Since I wanted a general glimpse, I didn\u2019t need to extract the entire dataset, however depending on your needs, you may want to do so.", "In contrast to Bing, the AFINN lexicon assigns a \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d score to each word in its lexicon; further sentiment analysis will then add up the emotion score to determine overall expression. A score greater than zero indicates positive sentiment, while a score less than zero would mean negative overall emotion. A calculated score of zero indicates neutral sentiment (neither positive or negative).", "To perform sentiment analysis using Bing on Canadian tweets, I ran the following commands, which returns a tibble.", "Then to visually depict the word counts, you can filter and plot the words side-by-side to compare the positive vs negative emotion.", "In the case below, you\u2019ll see that \u201ctrump\u201d is noted as positive. Given that these tweets may be referring to the current US president, you may wish to take a closer look at how the word is actually being used in these tweets.", "You can perform similar analysis for the Scottish tweets; I haven\u2019t included these here to avoid duplication of R code.", "Step 8: Get the sentiment score for each tweet (you can create a function for this similar to what is shown below).", "Apply the function to both sets of tweets:", "Here is an example of the positively assigned sentiment score for the 91st tweet we collected for Canada. The words \u201chelping\u201d and \u201cpleasure\u201d return a score of 2.", "Here we create a tibble that specifies the country, the score and the type:", "Finally, we can look at some characteristics of the sentiment in each group. Here are side-by-side histograms of the two sets of tweet sentiments, and table with some key summary statistics.", "As you can see below, the sentiments in the tweets we gathered are overall neutral with the highest sentiment score count being for \u201c0\u201d.", "Hope the steps above on collecting data from the Twitter API, using tidytext for sentiment analysis, and using ggplot to visualize your findings help you on your data science journey!", "Your home for data science.
