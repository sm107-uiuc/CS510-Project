I would guess at relatively few compared to the number who do. I have been self-teaching some Data Science skills and I wanted to put my skills to the test on some real data.", "I figured that something I was interested it would be a good place to start: I use Twitter a lot, and tweet most days so it made sense in my mind to give it a go. Another key point, I recently found I could export my Tweet data at the click of a button, so that helped with the decision of what to do!", "I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone when I say I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say, if you have more hashtags you\u2019ll get a bigger reach, or if you put media in your tweets people will be more likely to engage. I wanted to find out if this was true, but also using some of the Data Science skills I have started to acquire.", "Now, I\u2019m sure there are more detailed analyses out there, to tell you about your Tweeting performance, here I\u2019m just going to talk you through my thought process and I what I\u2019ve found.", "I didn\u2019t sign up for a developer account for Twitter, the data I used is available to all users. On your computer, head to Twitter and hit \u201cMore\u201d in your left hand panel and then select \u201cAnalytics\u201d.", "Once, you\u2019ve done that a new tab will open. Hit the \u201cTweets\u201d link at the top of the page which will tell you how your tweets have been performing and crucially a button to export your data. I exported my data broken down by \u201cTweets\u201d rather than \u201cDay\u201d as this is what I\u2019m more interested in finding out about.", "A thing to note here: whilst you can view up to 3 months of data on the Twitter Analytics interface, you can only export 28days of it. A shame, but not the end of the world.", "As with the start of all data projects, we need to know what data we\u2019ve got and clean it up so it\u2019s in a fit state for us to use. Starting off, I had a lot of columns of data, many of which I didn\u2019t care about.", "I dropped all the data that only contained null values, and also all the columns related to \u201cPromoted\u201d Tweets. I don\u2019t promote any of my Tweets so this wasn\u2019t relevant for me. I was expecting all these to be null, but the data puts a \u2018-\u2019 there instead, so my initial dropping didn\u2019t affect these columns. After my initial cull and cleaning, I was left with the following columns that I cared about in the format I wanted. Mainly, that meant dropping what I wasn\u2019t interested in, making sure numbers were numbers and dates were dates. The only more complex manipulation I did, was separate out the given \u2018time\u2019 column into its date and time parts.", "A few questions have come to my mind in the past about the reach of my Tweets: is there a time of day/month that means my Tweets will be more successful? I find a quick plot is the easiest way to get a snapshot of what is happening.", "It turns out, plotting the number of impressions each Tweet got over time wasn\u2019t really that helpful. I think that\u2019s because of a combination of things really: I have only tweeted about 80 times in the last month and I have such a small time period of data. A more useful representation of the data might be to look at the number of impressions at each hour of the day:", "Now, this is more interesting \u2014 I can see that I Tweet most frequently between mid-morning and mid-afternoon and very little in the evenings. The Tweets that generally (excluding the one anomaly here) are during this time. This might well be because more people in my target audience are awake and active during this time. I know I have contacts across the globe \u2014 I\u2019m particularly active in the Academic Twitter environment, so in theory there is an audience all day and night! This plot might be more useful for you if you Tweet much more frequently that me, and perhaps across the day a bit more.", "What about the rest of the data?", "Above, I was only looking at two of the columns, but what about the rest? It is too inefficient to compare all the combinations of two columns. Looking back at the data there are lots of things I want to look at and variables that are likely to relate to each other, therefore a correlation matrix seems to lend itself to the situation:", "Before starting to look at the matrix, it\u2019s a good idea to have in your head which your dependent and independent variables are. This will help you see what you can change and influence to create the effect you want.", "Looking at this correlation plot, there is a really high correlation (0.97) between engagements and media engagements. That means people are engaging with the tweets with media more, but is it meaningful engagement i.e. engagement that I care about i.e. likes/replies/follows etc. Looking at the media engagements column, media engagement is positively correlated to all but URL clicks (which is to be expected due to how twitter shows tweets: media is prioritised over url). Media in my tweets are most highly correlated to likes and follows, of the engagement that I most care about.", "URL clicks have low correlation or negative correlation to all of the other attributes in the data. It looks like tweets with url are most likely to be retweeted rather than anything else.", "If I want to get into what my actual tweets are saying, some text analysis will be required. I want to look at the impact of hashtags, and how they impact the \u201csuccess\u201d of my tweets. I also want to see if the sentiment of my tweets has any relationship to their success i.e. are my happier tweets more successful than my unhappy ones?", "To address the first point, I took all the Tweets and counted the number of hashtags in each one. I added this value as a new column and reran my correlation matrix.", "The number of hashtags is most correlated with number of impressions, followed by retweets and hashtag clicks. It makes sense that generally more hashtags mean higher impressions, but as this isn\u2019t a high correlation it suggests not all hashtags are useful for impressions.", "Thinking about the sentiment of my Tweets, I used an inbuilt function to assign the value to the Tweet text. Out for the 80 or so Tweets, just over half of them are positive with the fewest being negative:", "But how does that impact on the impressions and meaningful engagement I get on my Tweets?", "Short answer: not very much. There is a slight negative correlation between all the values and sentiment, except one: replies. The correlation here is so small, however, that with the number of Tweets I sent it\u2019s not likely to make a significant impact on my Tweet success.", "From this initial analysis, I think I\u2019ve found out the following:", "Most importantly, I\u2019ve put my data brain to some good use to apply my knowledge to a real world example, and potentially come up with a more \u201cefficient\u201d Tweeting strategy.", "I can\u2019t say I\u2019m likely to change much about how I Tweet based on this analysis: I\u2019ll be more sure to include media and I\u2019ll be picky about the hashtags I use \u2014 things I try to do anyway.", "No doubt a more in depth analysis might give more information about how I can be more successful. Perhaps I could look into the \u201cmost successful\u201d hashtags? Or I can scrape more data to look at patterns over time. There are, of course, many options to explore. For now, this initial analysis, using some of the skills I have been learning has given me a basic indication of my Twitter performance.", "If you\u2019re interested in how I implemented my analysis, feel free to get in touch/comment and I\u2019m happy to share. I did everything in Python as it\u2019s my preferred language, but there are no doubt other ways to do it.", "Your home for data science.
