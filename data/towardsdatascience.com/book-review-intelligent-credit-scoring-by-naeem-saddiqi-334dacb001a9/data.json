The core idea of a Scorecard is to transform the probabilities of a client paying the loan (creditworthiness of an individual) into a number that could be easily interpreted, guiding business decisions. Although Scorecards are not new, it has been changing a lot with the new Big Data/AI scenario, and especially after the 2008 Financial Crisis.", "What \u201cIntelligent Credit Scoring\u201d offers you is more than just a introduction to the subject. It\u2019s a complete guide on how to work and construct Scorecards written by one of the most influential authors of the field.", "At first glance, when I received Intelligent Credit Scoring I thought it would be one more boring book I would read the introduction, maybe the first couple of chapters and leave it decorating my shelf, and maybe use it for research when needed. But I was totally wrong! Reading it was actually pleasant, and for a 400-page book with technical information with chapters about credit regulation and model monitoring, it went faster than I expect.", "Intelligent Credit Scoring is an accessible book target to a broad audience, from beginners in the industry to experienced professionals. Whether you are a Credit Analyst, a Credit Scoring Manager, or a Data Scientist, the content of this book is going to offer a deeper view on how to create, evaluate, and monitor Scorecards.", "After the introduction (Chapter 1), the author describes the roles of each individual participating in a team responsible for Scorecard development and implementation (Chapter 2). One interesting aspect of Credit Scoring is that it\u2019s usually a work performed by a large team, with a wide variety of professionals.", "The following chapter defines the infrastructure needed to maintain a successful Scorecards and summarizes the process from data gathering to model implementation and monitoring. From Chapters 4 to 14 the author describes with details each stage in the Scorecard development, breaking the process into 7 parts.", "Before jumping into the journey of a Scorecard development you need to answer questions about your business plan and if your company has the available infrastructure and human resources for it. The benefits and drawbacks of developing an internal vs. external Scorecards are also listed to help you make the decision.", "Although we are living in a Big Data era, having lots of data is not enough. More than just volume, you\u2019ll need organized and curated data in order to make your project successful. At this stage, Siddiqi instructs the readers on how to set the default definitions, one key step in the development process. Information about current regulation based on Basel II is really important for the Scorecard industry and is well presented in chapter 7. Currently, the update for Basel II, versions III and IV are already on discussion and implementation and it would be great to have this information on a new edition of the book.", "Just like any Data Science project, in Scorecard development having good quality data is more important than using a better model. That\u2019s why this session of the book is so essential. Creating and filtering features and replacing missing values are part of your process of database creation and should be performed with extreme care and attention. Another important aspect mentioned in this session is splitting your dataset into training and testing, for evaluating the model performance. The potential of alternative data and larger datasets (Big Data) being used in Scorecards is also mentioned in this session, with regulation and technology affecting each other to determine the innovation in the field.", "\u201cIn an era where there is no shortage of information, the bank with the most actionable insights is the winner.\u201d \u2014 Intelligent Credit Scoring (2nd Edition), Naeem Siddiqi", "With your database ready, it\u2019s time to start working on your features. In this part of the book, you\u2019ll learn how to work Weight of Evidence, using it to split your variables into homogeneous categories. Other concepts like Information Value are used in the process of feature selection. The following part describes the use of Logistic Regression for Scorecard Creation, and how to calculate the scores from the resulted model.", "Scorecards are only valuable if it shows a consistent performance reflecting the current customer\u2019s population. That\u2019s why monitoring the models are so important. A few performance metrics and report templates are presented in this session of the book to help you design your own Management System.", "After the creation of a Scorecard, it\u2019s time to put into production. But simply using it to score new customers is not enough. You have to make sure it\u2019s performing well according to the validated dataset. So following metrics like Population Stability Index can help monitor the model performance. Also depending on the business strategy, more than one Scorecard can be used in order to access the customer\u2019s credit risk profile. Different strategies for combining Scorecards and setting cutoffs are presented in this session.", "Finally, the full cycle of Scorecard development ends in a stage where the team uses a set of tools to monitor the model performance. The customer's profile is affected by a variety of external events, so don\u2019t expect your model to maintain the initial performance for a long time. The author presents a series of approaches and strategies to use Scorecards to help you manage your portfolio and make wise business decisions", "As mentioned in the introduction, Intelligent Credit Scoring is an accessible book that targets a wide audience, so even if you are starting on the field it\u2019s going to be of great value for you.", "Another interesting aspect of the book is that the mathematics and statistics behind it are relatively simple. So even if you don\u2019t have a strong background in the field of exact sciences, you can truly understand the logic about the presented concepts.", "And finally, Scorecards are never a product of one individual or a small team. Its development needs feedback from a wide variety of professionals inside the institution in order to reflect the business logic and to show its true value for decision making inside companies and banks.", "One thing the book lacks is code examples for you to implement Scorecards on your own. The examples presented by the author all use the SAS platform which has significant historical importance for Scorecard development. But unless your company works with the SAS environment, you\u2019ll probably need to implement the logic using other languages.", "The good news is that open-source(or for a really cheap price) resources are available to help in your journey to build your own Scorecards. If you are a Data Scientist or Developer working with Python I highly recommend you taking a look at the following resources:", "This library developed by Guillermo Navas Palencia has some powerful tools for performing the binning of variables. Optbinning offers methods for performing visualization of Weight of Evidence, Information Value, and other important metrics for each variable, helping you select the best features for your model. OptBinning has recently incorporated a module for Scorecard development, making the whole process fast and solid. For the Scorecard developers using Python, this is probably a must-see project!", "If you just started working with Scorecards and use Python as your main coding language, I highly recommend you to take this course. The videos explaining the theory behind Credit Scoring have a great didactic and every step is implemented in Python using Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib. So you\u2019ll truly understand the logic behind each method when constructing your Scorecard.", "Your home for data science.
