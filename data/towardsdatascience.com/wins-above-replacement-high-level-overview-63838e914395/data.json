I strictly use this terminology whenever possible because this is only a point estimate gathered from the best of my imperfect ability, and because the amount of value that a player has added is not always the same as how good they are. (In some cases, the two may be vastly different.)", "This article is meant to serve as a high-level overview of the meaning of the metrics, the process, and the results.", "The model is built on six components:", "The process for obtaining values for each of these six components can be broken down into six steps:", "As I went about developing RAPM, I spent much time reading about the NBA, where this is a much more popular and widely-accepted technique for player evaluation. I found that generally, NBA analysts preferred to use \u201cprior-informed RAPM,\u201d which is a version of RAPM that incorporates prior knowledge of each player into the point estimate. The specific technique used for this was explained to me by Daniel Myers, developer of the NBA\u2019s Box Plus-Minus, and is explained in greater detail in my full RAPM write-up.", "I tested calculating prior-informed RAPM and non-prior informed (vanilla) RAPM and found that prior-informed RAPM both provided more intuitive results and was (rather obviously) more repeatable, so I opted to go with it. In order to obtain a properly prior-informed RAPM, I used what is known as a \u201cdaisy chain,\u201d where I calculated RAPM for every single season dating back to 2013\u20132014 and used each subsequent value as the \u201cprior\u201d in next season\u2019s value. I de-weighted the priors on a year-to-year basis in such a manner that I incorporated just enough information to make it a more accurate measure of one-year impact without making it more of a multi-year measure of ability which was not my goal.", "I found that the repeatability for penalty, shooting, and goaltending impact was quite low, so I opted not to incorporate prior information into those regressions, and rather to use vanilla RAPM. For penalty RAPM, I used all non-offsetting penalties and ran the regression using \u201cPIM/60\u201d as a target variable.", "I determined the value of one penalty minute by subtracting the league average even strength scoring rate over the last 3 seasons from the league average power play scoring rate, then subtracting the league average penalty kill scoring rate from the league average even strength scoring rate, and finally adding these two values together to determine how many goals one minute of power play ice time is worth. Teams score less frequently on the penalty kill than they do at even strength, so drawing penalties also helps a team\u2019s defense by reducing the rate at which their opponent scores (and vice versa for taking penalties), and players should therefore be credited with this. I found that the value of one penalty minute was roughly 0.11 goals.", "I also choose to incorporate penalty shots into this regression. Because penalty shots do not provide a fixed number of penalty minutes, I chose to calculate the value of a penalty shot \u2014 roughly 0.31 goals \u2014 and then divide this by the aforementioned value of one penalty minute \u2014 roughly 0.11 goals In essence, I treated a penalty shot as roughly 3 PIM. To make this very simple, a player has contributed one total goal through penalties when they have contributed to their team drawing or not taking four or five penalties. Penalties are by far the least important component of this model, and over the course of the past three seasons, Samuel Girard is the only player whose net penalty impact has contributed at least one win to his team.", "To define replacement level and the number of goals necessary for a win, I used a similar approach that I used to build my expected goal model and only incorporated information from the past three seasons. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, the NHL decreased maximum goalie equipment size at the start of the 2017\u20132018 season and increased penalty frequency. These changes both created a much higher-scoring NHL environment, and I believe any WAR model built for this time frame should be modeled with this new high-scoring environment in mind.", "In order to define replacement level, my goal was to find players who could easily be acquired and landed one consistent standard that I could apply across all forwards, defensemen, and goalies: all players with a cap hit below $850,000 who signed their contracts as UFAs are replacement level. The baseline for replacement level was calculated using the aggregate of their performance. As it turned out, my replacement level player is not all that bad; they\u2019re actually a bit above average defensively, but this is more than offset by their poor offensive play-driving and horrible shooting. If I had to apply this to a real life observation, most of them just practice risk mitigation every time they\u2019re on the ice, and they\u2019re actually quite good at it. Over the course of these 3 seasons, among all skaters who played at least 200 combined minutes at even strength, on the power play, and shorthanded, exactly 0 wins above replacement is 37th percentile. In other words, my best estimate is that 37% of players with a decent sample size provided contributions below replacement level.", "The replacement level which I\u2019ve set for my WAR model is a tad high compared to what I\u2019ve seen from other WAR models. I believe this is because other models use more than just three seasons to define replacement level, and your typical replacement level player is a lot better today than he was ten or even five years ago. While this is totally just a theory of mine, I attribute this to the rise of analytics in the NHL; ten years ago, some teams legitimately didn\u2019t even know about Corsi, and many didn\u2019t care enough to let it impact their decisions. Today, most teams have an analytics department, and even if front offices listen to their stats geeks less than I think they should, they still keep analytics in mind, and players who fall below 45% CF tend to get thrown out of the lineup pretty quickly. It\u2019s also possible that I\u2019ve defined replacement level incorrectly, or that replacement level players are sheltered in a manner that I\u2019ve failed to account for, but I haven\u2019t found anything which confirms this.", "To define the number of goals necessary for a win, I used Christopher Long\u2019s method outlined here and found that over this 3-year sample, roughly 5.33 goals are worth one win.", "Now, for the results. Here are my top-15 skaters in 3-year unweighted Wins Above Replacement:", "And here are my top-15 goaltenders:", "As of right now, the Connors reign supreme on my WAR leaderboard. Full skater results are available on my Tableau account.", "Anecdotally, I feel that the replacement level that I set was a tad too high for goaltenders. If the Anaheim Ducks were forced to replace John Gibson with the first goalie they could pull off waivers, their total number of wins probably would\u2019ve dropped by more than seven. This may be because inside of the small sample size of goaltenders who met my criteria, one or two had fluke strong seasons that were strong enough to sway the results for the entire population. The replacement level for goaltenders is still well below average, but intuitively I think a \u201ctrue\u201d replacement level would be even lower, which would actually make Hellebuyck\u2019s dominance even more impressive.", "Because I calculated every single metric using a player\u2019s entire body of work over the course of the full season, I can\u2019t just split WAR for players who spent the season with two different teams. I\u2019m fine with this, as my goal is individual player estimation, and I can make player estimates with far more confidence when I use the largest sample possible, but this unfortunately makes it more difficult for me to test and validate the descriptive power of my model. With that being said, I haven\u2019t just punted entirely on testing. I have tested WAR over the past three seasons at the team level using only players who spent their entire season with one team, and found that the descriptive power is still very strong, with an R\u00b2 of 0.888 between team WAR and standings points over the past 3 seasons.", "A more simple way of explaining this is by saying that 11% of the variance in team standings can be explained by some combination of the performance of players who switched teams and external factors like strength of schedule and luck, and the other 89% of that variance is explained by true team impact in that season. These assumptions both sound very reasonable to me, and are on par with or better than what I\u2019ve seen from other models.", "Additionally, the mean absolute error between projected standings points per 82 games (based on the WAR trendline) and actual standings points per 82 games is 3.83. In other words, the average team\u2019s results will be pushed around 4 points from their \u201ctrue\u201d impact by factors like luck, strength of schedule, and players who change teams. This, again, feels totally reasonable to me.", "While the model does a very very good job of analyzing quality on the team level, I have to admit it is probably not quite as accurate on the individual skater level. It\u2019s very difficult to isolate hockey performance, and while I did so to the best of my ability and I believe I did well, there is room for improvement. Despite building all of this, there are plenty of conclusions that may be drawn from my WAR own models that I would ultimately disagree with once I incorporate my subjective opinions.", "Just to provide one example of a shortcoming of my model, I feel that forwards who are proficient at making dangerous passes are probably underrated. Some passes lead to very dangerous shots because of factors like pre-shot movement that don\u2019t necessarily show up in expected goal models, and players who consistently create these chances will see their isolated impact on expected goals underrated. On the flip side, strong shoot-first play drivers who create chances for themselves but rarely create dangerous passing plays for their teammates will probably be overrated.", "An example in practice here would be Nathan MacKinnon and Auston Matthews. Mackinnon is a great passer who is probably a bit better than the model suggests, and Matthews is a solid-but-not-elite passer who is probably a bit worse. On the flip side, the shooting impact of MacKinnon\u2019s common linemates like Mikko Rantanen will likely overrate their true proficiency, while the shooting impact of Matthews\u2019 common linemates like Zach Hyman will likely underrate their true shooting impact. I prefer the play-driving + shooting method to a goal-driving method, as on-ice goals are simply too random with too small of a sample size for me to be comfortable using them in this method, but this is something that should be taken into consideration.", "There is plenty of other room for context as well \u2014 this metric is not meant to serve as a be-all end-all , but rather a starting point for discussion and player evaluation. Having said that, I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable sharing it if I did not believe that it was a robust, accurate, and valuable metric that I had worked very hard on. These results do have meaning. If WAR is completely at odds with your previously held beliefs, I would say you should take a second look at those beliefs and figure out what\u2019s missing from where. It might be that something is missing from the models, but it also might not be.", "Your home for data science.
