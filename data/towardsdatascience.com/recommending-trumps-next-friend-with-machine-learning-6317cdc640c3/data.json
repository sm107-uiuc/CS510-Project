Can we recommend friends for famous people? Stay tuned to find out.", "90's-cheesy-american-movie-trailer style introduction aside \u2014 this post will be somewhat of a continuation from my previous one, so I recommend skimming it to get a better understanding. For lazy data scientists, here is a brief summary:", "Now, however, we will venture from the soothing canals of descriptive statistics and sail out onto the dangerous seas of predictive analytics. If you\u2019ve ever been subjected to the consultant-favourite data analytics maturity graph, you\u2019ll know this is no small jump. It\u2019s okay though, we\u2019ll hold hands and make it through alive, I promise.", "We will take our social network of people and organisations on the news, and attempt to predict new links being formed in our data to suggest who might appear together on the news tomorrow.", "Who wouldn\u2019t want to play Mark Zuckerberg? Who wouldn\u2019t want to predict who will appear together on the news?", "Although, as we\u2019ll see, the news is far too wild a beast to predict perfectly, we can gain valuable insight into an organisation\u2019s likelihood of being associated with another organisation or individual, which can tell us, for example, with whom our customers may associate us \u2014 consciously or otherwise.", "Aside from that, the general practice link prediction has a wide range of use\u00a0cases:", "Link prediction is the analytical method of evaluating the likelihood of two nodes forming a connection in a graph. The goal is to predict the next edge(s) forming in a dynamic network by analysing the structure of the graph.", "We\u2019ll take a familiar example. Given a social network of 4 people at time t(i), the aim is to find the structure of the network at some future time t(i+1). Sounds easy, right? Well, it turns out the algorithm we\u2019ll end up using will be quite simple \u2014 the devil, as always, resides in the details. The challenge is formulating the problem appropriately.", "Let\u2019s start at the end and work backwards. Where we want to end up is a data set of potential new links being formed, on which we can train a classifier. We\u2019ll take all the pairs in our graph which aren\u2019t yet connected, and check whether they will have formed a connection at time t(i+1). For our example graph above, this would look something like this:", "I don\u2019t know about you, but this looks suspiciously like a binary classification problem to me. The only problem is that I don\u2019t know of any classifier that could be trained successfully on our Link column above, let alone willingly accept it as an input. No \u2014 we\u2019ll need better features than that. Put your engineering hats on.", "Luckily for us, there are a number of ways to create features for edges in a graph, in preparation for machine learning. Perhaps the crowd favourite in more recent times has been the node2vec (Grover et al., 2016) approach. Similar to word2vec in both name and idea, the algorithm uses random walks on a graph to create vector representations of its nodes. Sounds cool right? Well, too bad, because we won\u2019t be using it.", "Note: I have nothing against node2vec. In fact, I wished for it to work very much. Unfortunately, when trained on my graphs, the prediction results came back pretty awful on the test data set. I suspect I may need longer walks as my graphs are quite large; but training was taking ages already and time is precious. Let me know if you have any suggestions.", "We will stick with a more, uh, traditional approach and generate a few features one by one. Taking inspiration from Liben-Nowell, 2004, we\u2019ll calculate some properties of each of our edges. Take a look at these old boys:", "Preferential Attachment (Yule, 1925)\u200a\u2014\u200athis 95-year-old veteran sounds fancy, but in our graph world it represents the product of the number of neighbours each of a given pair of nodes has. The basic idea is that people with more friends tend to be more likely to make even more\u200a\u2014\u200atherefore two people who both have a lot of friends will have a high preferential attachment score and thus will be likely to form a link with each other.", "Jaccard Coefficient (Jaccard, 1901) \u2014 clocking in at a whopping 119 years of age and barely missing out on the 19th century in the process, we have Monsieur Jaccard\u2019s index. The Jaccard Coefficient will be familiar to many through a range of alternative applications, but in our context it will represent the ratio of common neighbours between two nodes to the number of neighbours the two nodes have in total.", "Adamic/Adar Index (Adamic, Adar, 2003) \u2014 hanging out with the old boys and unable to order a beer at the bar is the Adamic/Adar Index. Similar to the Jaccard Index, this feature adds weights to each common neighbour of a node pair by the inverse log of the number of neighbours the neighbour has.", "Common Neighbours \u2014 is simply the number of common neighbours two nodes have. No nonsense.", "Having collected a nice set of features, we can add them to our table from before:", "This is starting to look like something we may be able to train a machine learning model on (provided the values will have actual variance on real data)!", "But how do we set up our training data set?", "Our goal is, given the state of a social network on a given day, to predict new links being formed in the network. All we need to do is check each yet unconnected pair of nodes on day one, and calculate the features above for each of them. We\u2019ll then look at the same network on day two, and see if any of them have formed new connections. We can therefore label the unconnected pairs which will form a connection the following day as positive, and the rest negative.", "We can repeat this process for multiple consecutive days to get a feel for how the networks evolves over time, and concatenate the results. The diagram below illustrates this idea:", "Finally, we\u2019ll separate the last day\u2019s predictions as a test data set to see how our model would fair on an unseen day.", "We\u2019ll demonstrate the concepts I outlined above with real life data. This time we\u2019ll be working front-to-back.", "In my previous post I have shown how I constructed \u2018social\u2019 links by identifying pairs of entities which appeared in the same news article, on the 26th of March. I repeated the same exercise for the following 6 days, all the way up to the 1st of April. This netted me over 400,000 (non-unique) links, distributed across the week like so:", "I deliberately didn\u2019t visualise the 7th day, as we won\u2019t be creating a graph from that, we\u2019ll only check newly formed links compared to day 6.", "We\u2019ll do a walk through the exercise for the first day for demonstration\u2019s sake.", "Let\u2019s build the training data set by importing the CSV with all the links, filtering on the first day and grouping the same links together, assigning weights to them based on the count. I\u2019ll also be discarding any links which only occurred once to focus on the more prominent ones:", "Next, we\u2019ll build a graph structure from the resultant links, then find the largest connected subgraph \u2014 this is a requirement for calculating our features. We\u2019ll find that over 95% of nodes are connected on all days, anyway.", "The above steps yield us a graph, G, which contains a weighted and undirected network that encapsulates the largest connected sub-graph representing the \u2018social network\u2019 of the news on the 26th of March. Specifically, it contains 8,045 edges between 2,183 nodes.", "Beautiful, isn\u2019t it? Not very useful, though. Let\u2019s see if we can find out which of these pink guys will make friends the next day.", "Similarly to before, we define a data set of links weighted by occurrence, but this time we also filter to links where both entities appeared in the network on the previous day. After that, we will remove all links from the network on the 27th which have already appeared on the 26th and therefore aren\u2019t newly formed edges. Finally, we\u2019ll label the remaining links with a 1, to represent a link that was newly formed:", "With the above steps we have produced a dataframe with 2,183 pairs of entities which have not yet formed a link on the 26th, but will form one on the 27th, and labelled them with a 1. What about those which won\u2019t form a link on the 27th?", "Well, theoretically any unconnected pair in our graph could form a link the next day, for all we know. So we need to find all possible combinations of two nodes in the graph from the 26th, which aren\u2019t already included in the pairs we identified as forming a link on the 27th, and label them 0.", "Let\u2019s pause here for a second and consider something.", "We have 2,382 entities in our graph and we know 2,183 pairs of them will form a new link. How many won\u2019t then? There is an enormous number of possibilities: 2382-choose-2, to be exact. That number is nearly 3 million, which would mean that the ratio of positive to negative samples would be under 1:1000! That\u2019s a very imbalanced data set to train a classifier on. We have a few options to deal with this, but for this exercise I opted for down-sampling my data, because I knew I was likely to have a fair number of rows by the time I finished the whole week.", "Note: this may not be best practice \u2014 I primarily went with down-sampling for demonstrative purposes and to reduce feature engineering and model training times. Something like SMOTE might be more appropriate here.", "We will find all possible combinations of nodes in the network, remove those which have a link on the 26th and those which will form a link on the 27th. We\u2019ll then randomly take a sample of 9x2,183 (nine times the number of newly formed links) from these unconnected pairs, to give us a training ratio of 1:10 \u2014 much better.", "Finally, we concatenate the two dataframes:", "The dataframe edges_to_predict will be home to the list of all new links, labelled with a 1, and a sample of edge pairs which won\u2019t form a link, labelled with a 0.", "We\u2019ll recall that to create features we need to calculate the number of common neighbours, the Jaccard Coefficient, the Adamic/Adar Index and the Preferential Attachment Score for each pair of our training data. The NetworkX library will be our best friend for this. All we need to do is create a bunch of node pairs, that is, a list of tuples to identify the source and target of each:", "Feature calculation is then laughably easy:", "Finally, we have real features and real targets! The dataframe now looks like this:", "We\u2019re ready to train our machine learning model. Off-screen, we have repeated the above process for 5 subsequent days, with a slight modification for the 6th day, our training data: on the 31st of March, I did not down-sample the data, as it won\u2019t be a part of our training set. We need to pretend like we don\u2019t know what links will be formed on the 1st of April, therefore we need to use all the data available.", "We\u2019ve seen in our sample training data that our feature columns assume widely varying ranges of values. To enhance our learning model, we\u2019ll scale them to values with a zero mean and a standard deviation of 1, using scikit-learn:", "As a reminder, we are training a model on a slightly imbalanced data set and testing on a realistic, very imbalanced data set:", "Ratio of positive samples in training set: 0.1.Ratio of positive samples in test set: 0.00092.", "We\u2019re ready to initialise our model: logistic regression.", "Yes, logistic regression. Not what you expected when I touted machine learning in my title, is it? I promise I tried \u2014 I really did. I tested a Random Forest model, a Support Vector Machine, I spent a week tuning Light Gradient Boosting and XGBoost models. I grid-searched a deep neural network. None of them could beat the ROC of logistic regression. So there you have it. I suppose it\u2019s quite fitting for my old-school features.", "The class_weight parameter ensures that the error penalties in the model are proportional to the ratio of positive/negative training samples in our data, making the model more sensitive to getting a positive prediction wrong, and increasing performance overall.", "Let\u2019s see how we did on our test data.", "We have a very respectable ROC AUC score of 0.9312. Let\u2019s plot the confusion matrix.", "This allows us to calculate our precision and recall:", "Not bad \u2014 not great, but not bad. We managed to identify almost 84% of future links. However, we identified so many potential links that less than 1% of our positive predictions actually came true the next day.", "Congratulations for reaching the bottom of yet another lengthy exercise; I hope it was somewhat worth it. Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve done:", "Let\u2019s take a look at whom we can recommend for the President, then:", "This is a sample from our predictions where one of the entities in a link is Trump. These are all links which the model thought would happen on the following day on the news. The column label indicates whether it did actually happen (1) or not (0).", "We have recommended a number of friends for Trump, and he \u2018clicked\u2019 Accept on the following; remember, he didn\u2019t appear on the news with any of them the previous day:", "How good were our results? Well, this depends on the business context, mostly. Imbalanced classification is hard, and the outcome you want from your model drives which performance metric you should focus on. For instance, if this was a fraud detection exercise (another common imbalanced prediction task), we would have done pretty well \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t mind sending a few false-alarm texts to your customers if it means you catch 84% of fraudulent transactions. What\u2019s the goal for us, though?", "Our model is quite good at identifying links which won\u2019t form the next day \u2014 there are many of these. It\u2019s not so good at only identifying links which will happen. If I were a product owner here, I\u2019d probably want to focus on precision, rather than recall; our friend recommendations should be right most of the time, even if we don\u2019t recommend all possible friends to everyone. To do this, we could raise the probability threshold for positive classification. This will come at the cost of recall, but it will make sure that whatever we classify as positive will more likely happen in reality.", "Another thing to consider is how well friend recommendation works in reality, anyway. What percentage of recommended accounts do you actually send an invitation to on Instagram? How many of your recommended products do you buy on Amazon? And Jeff Bezos will have much more and much better data than we do. In that context, I think we did pretty well.", "To sum up \u2014 turns out, predicting the news is hard. But with not much work we managed to set up a pretty good model to achieve just that.", "Did I do something wrong? Could I have done something better? Did I do something well?", "Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me on LinkedIn; I\u2019m always happy to be challenged or just have a chat if you\u2019re interested in my work.", "If you want
