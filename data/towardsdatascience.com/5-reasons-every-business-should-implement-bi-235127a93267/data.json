That\u2019s right, those charts and graphs in dashboards aren\u2019t just pretty images, they\u2019re actually giving you a visual representation of how your business is performing. There\u2019s no burying your head in, and trying to make sense of, a whole bunch of numbers.", "To demonstrate just how beneficial it is to visualise your data, here\u2019s a test I did in a previous video that illustrates this point perfectly.", "In a second I\u2019m going to show you 12 different values, one for each month and you\u2019ve got 3 seconds to tell me which is the highest value. Ready? No cheating!", "So, which month has the highest value? If you did, in fact, manage to spot the highest value then well done, not many people do.", "Now I\u2019m going to show you the same values but this time in a column chart and, again, you\u2019ve got 3 seconds to see if you can spot the highest. Ready?", "I\u2019m guessing you probably did much better that time. If I put both side by side. You can see that, with the column chart, very quickly you can not only spot the highest value but also the lowest and even the distribution of values over the 12 months.", "So, as you can see, visualising your data makes it much easier to read and understand. To spot trends and see where things are going well and where they might need improvement. Helping you to take action and make smarter decisions.", "If you run a small business, especially in times like these, you might think that implementing BI for your business would come at great financial cost and therefore be perhaps a luxury that isn\u2019t worth the investment.", "Well, the first thing to say to that would be that the insights gained from your data (that help you make these smarter business decisions) should help you increase your revenue, by improving performance. Or reduce costs by spotting areas where money might be saved through streamlining, making your business more efficient. So, if you do invest in implementing BI, the idea is that it should pay for itself many times over.", "And my second response would be that there are BI tools on the market today that cost very little or that are even free to use, like Google Data Studio. So the budget question is really no longer an issue. Now, of course, everything will depend on the data you have and the services you use but, generally speaking, you can go pretty far and at least get started with little or no upfront investment.", "As soon as you say the word data to some people, their eyes tend to glaze over. It\u2019s not the most exciting thing (at least to most normal people) to think about and might seem complicated and abstract. But, even if you\u2019re just manually entering sales figures into an Excel spreadsheet, then you\u2019re already working with data. And, as long as it\u2019s correctly structured, you can simply plug it in to a BI tool that helps you turn it into easy to digest charts and graphs. In addition to this, most business software and services nowadays allow you to either export their data or connect to it directly with BI tools.", "What this means that all, or most, of your business\u2019 data is easily accessible. There\u2019s no coding to do, no data mining software needed, no data professionals to hire. Most of the time, your data can either be exported from where it is in excel or csv format or connected via BI tool with just a couple of clicks. Then your only job is to crunch the numbers, analyse and visualise your data to start gaining the benefits of Business Intelligence.", "One of the main reservations anyone who runs a business might have for implementing BI is that it\u2019s too complicated. They know nothing about how to analyse data and build dashboards so they have no business even trying to. Now, I\u2019m a BI professional so I do kind of agree with this. However, a lot of BI tools these days are easy to use and built intentionally for the business user, even for the complete novice, rather than the technical user.", "And the tool\u2019s creators do everything they can to make the learning curve as flat as possible. Things like building the tool to minimise risks of errors or placing things in queries where you shouldn\u2019t, providing video training and guidance within the tool and even giving you pre-built templates that you can simply plug your data directly into and take away the need for you to build dashboards yourself.", "This isn\u2019t to say that there\u2019s no learning curve at all and time will be needed to get up and running but it shouldn\u2019t be a daunting prospect. And it probably won\u2019t take as long as you think. Maybe just a few hours, before you start to get to grips with your chosen tool.", "Talking of time, the fifth and final reason I\u2019ll give in this article for why every business should implement BI is that it is not time-consuming. What I mean is that, once your data is connected to your BI tool and your dashboards are built, you\u2019re not going to need to consistently spend hours of time consulting and reading them to try and make sense of the data. The idea is that your dashboards and reports should be there to help you \u201cmonitor\u201d your business activities. Dashboards by their very definition are meant to be \u201cat-a-glance\u201d. Meaning just that. Most of the time you will only need to glance at them to check how things are performing. Or, rather, whether they\u2019re performing as you\u2019d expect. The visual nature of your charts and graphs, as I demonstrated earlier, will allow you to spot anomalies in the data and take action if required.", "I would recommend taking a more in-depth look at your data on a regular basis, say, weekly or monthly but definitely not daily (at least for most businesses). So, basically, once you\u2019re up and running, BI shouldn\u2019t need to take up a lot of your valuable time.", "If you\u2019re curious to learn more about how to do more with data, why not visit my YouTube channel.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "I\u2019ve been working with data for around 25 years, a BI professional for the past 10.
