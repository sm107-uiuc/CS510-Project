The idea is simple: Words that occur in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings.", "Techniques like Word2vec and Glove do that by converting a word to vector. Thus the corresponding vector of \u201ccat\u201d will be closer to \u201cdog\u201d than \u201ceagle\u201d. But while embedding a sentence, along with words the context of the whole sentence needs to be captured in that vector.

Even after all these text cleaning steps, we couldn\u2019t beat Universal Sentence Embeddings + ClassifierDL :-) This is mainly due to the fact that USE is usually performs better on raw text compared to the cleaned version as it is already trained on raw sentences and when we apply text preprocessing we introduce some noise that was not seen while the USE is being trained and the sentence consistency was compromised while cleaning.", "In order to train the same classifier with BERT , we can replace glove_embeddings stage with bert_embeddings stage in the same pipeline we built above. You can find more information about how we implement and leverage Bert in Spark NLP at this link.", "As discussed thoroughly in one of our previous articles, LightPipelines are Spark NLP specific Pipelines, equivalent to Spark ML Pipeline, but meant to deal with smaller amounts of data.

To use them, we simply plug in a trained (fitted) pipeline and then annotate a plain text. We don\u2019t even need to convert the input text to DataFrame in order to feed it into a pipeline that\u2019s accepting DataFrame as an input in the first place. This feature would be quite useful when it comes to getting a prediction for a few lines of text from a trained ML model.", "LightPipelines are easy to create and also save you from dealing with Spark Datasets.
