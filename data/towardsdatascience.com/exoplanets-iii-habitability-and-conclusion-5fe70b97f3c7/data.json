Both are equally terrifying.", "Although the search for other planets is partly motivated by our efforts to understand their formation and to improve the understanding of our own solar system, the ultimate goal is to find extraterrestrial life. Now that we\u2019ve seen and analysed the actual data compiled by space missions and connected them to actual physics laws, we arrive at the final act of our play: habitability. So far we have only talked about the detection and location of confirmed exoplanets, but we don\u2019t know much about their ability to nurture life i.e. their habitability.", "For a planet to harbour any form of life, it must satisfy certain specific parameters that would make it habitable. Life only exists under certain conditions that are essential to creating the necessary sustainable environment for life to grow and evolve. There is presently no reason to believe that planets satisfying these conditions do not exist in large numbers. Although till now we have not been able to find such planets, it is likely to be only a matter of time.", "One should keep in mind that the assessment of the suitability of a planet for supporting life is largely based on Earth\u2019s characteristics, because it is the one planet in the universe that we know for certain is habitable. Therefore, we can only look for life as we know it. It may well be that life exists under different conditions, but we can only speculate about its existence. This final chapter will cover the major factors required for life (as we know it) to exist on exoplanets such as, distance, mass and atmosphere.", "Before we start defining the different conditionalities for life, let us first take a look at two notable figures in astronomy and their thoughts on the odds of life existing elsewhere.", "Carl Sagan was a famous American astronomer, best known for his research and thoughts on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life. Like many astronomers, he believed that our galaxy is teeming with life, and a large number of extraterrestrial civilisations should theoretically exist. However, due to the lack of evidence of such civilisations, he gave credence to the theory that these tended to self-destruct once they became sufficiently technologically advanced.", "Didier Queloz, co-discoverer of the first extrasolar planet, agrees with Sagan\u2019s belief that life exists elsewhere in the universe, but emphasizes that a chain of consecutive events are needed for life to emerge, and therefore \u2018luck\u2019 is a critical factor. Therefore, the galaxy may not quite be as teeming.", "Sagan and Queloz both strongly believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life, simply due to the odds. Another notable astrophysicist, Frank Drake, came up with a mathematical equation that could, in theory, estimate the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilisations in the Milky Way Galaxy. It states that:", "Drake\u2019s equation is different from any of the previous equations related to the detection of exoplanets, because of the high number of unknown variables it contains. Because of these current uncertainties, there is no definitive \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d answer, but only an estimate. As we learn and understand more of our place in the universe, some of the unknowns slowly become clearer, and the end result more accurate.", "Scientists acknowledge that there are very large uncertainties in Drake\u2019s equation, and often tend to make very crude estimates to make progress. With our current state of knowledge, we know that the first three terms of the equations are closer to 10 than 1, and that all the factors are less than 1. However, remains the biggest unknown. By making some assumptions, we can simplify the equation to arrive at perhaps a more useful version of the Drake Equation:", "This would mean that the number of civilisations with whom we can possibly make contact is approximately equal to their longevity, which is the same conclusion Drake and his colleagues arrived at in 1961. This also implies that unless is very large, will be small. If SETI succeeds in detecting a signal emitted by an alien civilisation, it would mean that on average must be large, as we wouldn\u2019t have otherwise discovered the signal by only looking at a small proportion of the stars in the Milky Way. Because of the finite speed at which the detected alien signal would travel, it would be telling us about their past by the time they reach us, as they are many light years away. But because the alien civilisation\u2019s must be large for us to detect such a signal, this could tell us if our own future is a long one. Another question that emerges is that even if we do find signs of life, how and what would we communicate with them?", "When we look at the Earth from space, we see that almost 75% of it is covered by water, which is a vital natural resource for all living organisms. A plant uses water to derive some of its nutrients from minerals in the soil. These minerals have to be dissolved in water in order to be absorbed by the plant. The vast oceans and other bodies of water provide shelter for various species of sea life. Earth\u2019s atmosphere is regulated by clouds which are made of water molecules. And of course, all animals need to drink water regularly in order to stay alive. Life on Earth is built around water.", "Therefore for a planet to harbour life as we know it, it must contain water. Unlike popular belief, water is not a rare commodity in the universe. On the contrary, it exists in abundance everywhere in the universe. Water has been detected in interstellar clouds within our galaxy, the Milky Way, and in other galaxies as well. One only has to look at the chemical properties of water to understand its banality. A water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a single oxygen atom.", "Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the entire universe, created during the \u2018big bang\u2019. Oxygen is the third most abundant element, created by the nuclear fusion of stars. Together these two form water. All planets in the solar system, with the exception of Uranus and Neptune, have a small quantity of water vapour in their atmosphere, ranging from 0.0004% (Jupiter) to 3.4% (Mercury). One of Saturn\u2019s moons, Enceladus, has a composition of 91% of water vapour and is considered to be one of the most potentially habitable spots in the solar system.", "However, for life to develop, water is required not as vapour or ice, but as a liquid, which is much rarer, as it is dependent on the surface temperature, which in turn is reliant on atmospheric pressure, which is determined by the surface gravity of the planet. All these requirements can only simultaneously be found in the habitable zone. Furthermore, liquid can only exist on a surface, meaning gaseous planets cannot sustain water.", "In essence, the major factors required for harbouring life on any planet seem to depend on its mass, atmosphere, and distance from its parent star. These are elaborated below.", "A planet must have a solid, rocky surface and be at a perfect distance from its star to maintain liquid water on its surface. Too far out, the planet will be too cold to sustain liquid water on its surface, as the surface temperature will fall below its freezing point, causing the oceans to turn to ice. Too close in, the planet would have a temperature that would exceed the boiling point of water and the oceans would turn to vapour. Thus the perfect region for water to be able to exist as liquid is the belt between these two extremes, which is called the habitable zone.", "This region is also known as the Goldilocks Zone, originating from the well known story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, in which the Goldilocks chooses the soup which is neither too hot, nor too cold. Similarly for a planet following this principle, it should exist neither too close, nor too far from its star, but at the right distance.", "Each planetary system\u2019s habitable zone would start at a different distance from its star, as it depends on the mass of the central star. The more massive the star, the more heat it would emit, pushing further away the inner edge of the habitable region, as shown in the figure below.", "So when we search for exoplanets, we look within the habitable zone, as those are the best bets to find Earth-like planets. Currently it is unknown whether the few planets that have been found in the habitable zone are terrestrial or gaseous. The planets that have been authenticated as terrestrial are not located in the Goldilocks Zone. Moreover, simply finding planets in the habitable zone does not guarantee life, as there are several other critical factors that play an important role.", "For a planet located in the habitable zone, the planet\u2019s gravity must be strong enough to hold an atmosphere, which serves as a buffer, helping maintain a steady surface temperature. The surface gravity of the planet can be calculated using the following formula:", "As we can see, the gravity is dependent on the mass and radius of the planet. This is critical. For example, if the Earth was smaller, let\u2019s say around the size of Mars, the force of gravity would be considerably weaker, as both the mass and the radius would be smaller, and therefore it would not be able to keep the water molecules from flying off into space, resulting in a very thin atmosphere. This would reduce the effectiveness of the atmospheric buffer, allowing extreme temperatures to exist, and thus prevent the accumulation of water. This is why liquid water cannot exist on Mars, although it is located at the edge of the habitable zone. The small mass barely allows water to exist in a solid state at the polar ice caps. This is why knowing the mass of an exoplanet is essential in order to assess the status of its habitability.", "This is perhaps the most important element in judging the capability of a planet to sustain life. Without the pressure of an atmosphere, liquid water cannot survive. Let\u2019s take the Moon as an example: it does not possess an atmosphere, not even a thin one like Mars. So if we spill some water on moon, it would either boil away as vapour, or freeze solid to make ice. So in order to harbour life, a planet must have an atmosphere, and one that is thick enough for the planet to maintain a constant temperature, and to exert pressure for water to remain as liquid as well.", "However, the thickness of the atmosphere isn\u2019t the only vital component of the habitability puzzle. Its actual composition has to be correct as well. Let us take Venus as an example. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of its physical characteristics: it is also located in the habitable zone, has a surface gravity of 8.9 [m/s^2], which is 90% of Earth\u2019s gravity, has 82% of Earth\u2019s mass, and 86% of its volume, and the density is nearly identical. An alien astronomer observing our solar system would consider Venus as a good bet for life to exist.", "However, Venus is not habitable for life as we know it, because it is way too hot. Its atmosphere is the densest of the terrestrial planets in the solar system, and exerts 92 times Earth\u2019s pressure on its surface. Its atmosphere is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and is completely devoid of any molecular oxygen. As a result, the mean surface temperature of Venus is around 464\u00b0C, which is the highest in the solar system, and way above the boiling point of water. Unlike Earth, it also lacks a magnetic field, which keeps the solar wind from sweeping away the free Hydrogen, an essential ingredient for water, into interplanetary space. Venus\u2019s surface is therefore dry as a bone and covered by deserts. Even though Venus mirrors Earth in many aspects, it is definitively not habitable.", "So finding exoplanets with the same mass, distance and atmosphere as Earth is only the beginning. As with Venus, these factors are not necessarily enough for life to develop. We must take a closer look at the makeup of the atmosphere, and determine whether the vital elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, but also nitrogen and carbon, are present in the correct quantity and percentage. These lay the basis for the foundation and development of life as we know it. The actual list of ingredients for life is far bigger, and can be detailed endlessly. The correct planetary orbit and rotation, the right geochemistry and the geological mechanisms can all change a planet\u2019s status from being habitable to not habitable. The factors are boundless.", "However, the series of successive phenomena required for life to appear relies on one factor that cannot be controlled or categorized: chance. To our current understanding, it is chance that makes a small body collide with another to form planetesimals that later develop into the terrestrial planets. It is perhaps through the sheer chance of a comet colliding with Earth that water was imported to this planet. In fact, \u201cluck\u201d may be another necessary ingredient for the creation of life itself.", "And what about life as we don\u2019t know it? What if it requires a liquid other than water to emerge and flourish? Maybe it is us who are the different creatures, living in an unusual and extreme environment. Or perhaps Earth is only one of many kinds of habitable worlds. We can speculate endlessly, but the only way to find out for sure is to go out and explore.", "In this paper, I present a distillation of an extensive literature review on exoplanets and explain the methods of detection linking them to fundamental laws of physics. I used publicly available research data on exoplanets, and under the guidance of an astronomy expert, generated a series of graphs using combinations of relevant parameters. I interrogated the graphs and correlated them to the basic laws of physics, such as Kepler\u2019s Third Law of Planetary Motion and Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation. With the graphs as a basis, I interviewed renowned astrophysicist, Professor Didier Queloz, to gain further insight into the current discoveries and scientific thinking on issues such as the recurrent findings of Hot Jupiters. Finally, I identified and explained some of the factors that influence the emergence of life, including non-rational factors such as chance. Based on this review and analysis, I am able to explain why we search for exoplanets and how meaningful this quest actually is.", "We have come a long way since the discovery of the first exoplanet in 1995. The field has grown into a vast scientific domain that goes beyond pure physics and has slowly been delving into realms of astrobiology and chemistry. We have seen that the rate of discovery of exoplanets has been steadily increasing, and planets seem common around their stars in our galaxy. A few have been detected in the habitable zone, but unfortunately don\u2019t seem terrestrial. In fact, the planetary systems discovered do not resemble our own solar system, as many of them contain Hot Jupiters and Super Earths, neither of which exist in our system. This could be due to a selection effect of our limited methods of detection, or possibly the way the universe is.", "Through the detection of exoplanets, we have learnt about the nature of Earth itself and the different life forms it has sustained since nearly four billion years. We have gained a critical understanding of our unique place in the vast cosmos and the actual scientific evidence to prove that we seem to be in an isolated corner of a graph, different from all our other cosmic neighbours. By looking out, we have not only expanded both our physical and conceptual borders, but also understood the uniqueness of what has happened here, on Planet Earth. One has, in the process, better ingrained the value of our own life. We are indeed lucky to be alive, and are special as many faiths have proclaimed since ages. No other scientific field has given us as much substance to answer the questions that have existed since the early philosophers started wondering. This is why we continue to look for exoplanets.", "Despite not having discovered other life, the fact that we are actively asking ourselves questions and searching for answers by undertaking new scientific projects, shows that we are constantly trying to expand our knowledge. Arthur C. Clarke once stated that the two possibilities of us being either alone in the universe, or not, are both equally terrifying. I would say that both are equally awe-inspiring. Because even if we are alone, the fact that we think, ponder, dream and ask these questions might actually be one of the most important and useful elements in the universe. It shows that our quest for knowledge and understanding never gets dull. In fact the more we know, the more remarkable our cosmos seems to be, and more questions seem to open up.", "It is these very unanswered questions that drive our curiosity to push the frontiers of current scientific thought and endeavour. So by opening up evermore questions, perhaps nature itself pushes mankind to constantly strive for answers. If extra-terrestrial beings do exist somewhere in this ocean of seeming emptiness, I thoroughly hope that we share the same thirst for knowledge, because it is the one element that has the power to bring us together. Meanwhile, we can only try to briefly capture the beauty of nature, as it takes its course on a cosmic scale.", "Machine Learning Researcher at Idiap. Data Science graduate from University of Bath.
