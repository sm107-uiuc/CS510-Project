up, down, sideways? what is driving the cycle and what makes you so sure it will repeat itself forever?", "These questions require not only some knowledge about cycles and the math & algorithms to recreate them in the future, but more importantly also knowledge of the subject you are forecasting to gain insights about future behavior and the underlying reasons that drive it.", "For instance, a cycle in biology will sooner or later come to an abrupt stop when the organism dies; a cyclical seasonal trend (think holiday sales) can be disrupted by new technology or like we will see an external factor can also affect a cycle, context here is king, let\u2019s say you encounter the following unlabeled data/chart\u2026", "Without context we can make the reasonable observation that there are cycles and we can forecast the next one quite comfortably, here\u2019s what actually happened along with the missing context\u2026", "With the context restored, actual data and the previous observations, we can now realize that the current cycle is not behaving in a normal or expected way, we can then look for possible causes and gain clarity.", "As an introduction and overview of cycles I hope this serves as a starting point; if you have any comments or want to suggest additions or subtractions, let me know.", "Born Eugenio Noyola Leon (Keno) I am a Designer, Software Developer & Artist currently living in Mexico City, you can find me at www.k3no.com", "Your home for data science.
