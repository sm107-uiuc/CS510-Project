This is especially true now considering that there isn\u2019t as much in-person communication at the time of writing this (Covid time). If you are still trying to get into the data science field, one way you could build up this skill is through blogging.", "Here I will share with you the benefits of blogging to help you with your data science journey. Afterward, I will provide you with blogging advice and some other articles echoing this message.", "As one of my professors told me:", "\u201cThe best way to learn something is to teach it\u201d.", "The real test (in my opinion) to determine if you understand a concept is how easy it is for you to explain it to someone else. Blogging gives the means to practice explaining concepts. If you struggle with the explanation that is ok. This is providing you with the opportunity to reinforce your understanding of that concept at the same time.", "Remember also that you will have to communicate your work at your future career to a varied audience. This will include your coworkers all the way to stake-holders that have very little technical or mathematical knowledge (if any). Blogging can act as a safe platform to practice communicating with those audiences.", "No one on the globe is going to know about your work if it stays on your local machine. If you want people to know about what you are doing you need to but it out into the wild that is the World Wide Web. If you haven\u2019t written a blog post yet don\u2019t worry about if your first one is perfect. The main idea is to start, everything else will come afterward.", "People will take notice of your posts. It may not be immediately but they will. With some of my older blog posts, I got the attention of a publishing company that publishes books and courses on Data Science and other tech fields. The person from the company who found me thought my writing was good enough that he wanted to hire me to make an online course for Tensorflow. But again, if you just keep all your work on a local machine, that the chances of such opportunities will always be zero.", "You will be surprised how much reach an article can have. One of the first blog posts I wrote was on web-scraping. It caught the attention of a microbiologist in India that was trying to replicate my example on a site he chose. After I helped him out with his example, he let me write my next blog post on his example. So I got the benefit of helping someone and getting another experience to write about at the same time.", "Some of the blog posts I wrote a year or so ago still help people today. I still get messages on how my posts either clarified a concept for someone or provided interesting ideas for them. As I am writing this, I just got a message on LinkedIn on how someone found this previous post I wrote interesting!", "The empirical cumulative distribution function is a chart I use a lot for my exploratory data analysis. But if a long period of time goes by when I don\u2019t use it, I would forget the exact code I used to create it. In my post about refactoring code for data science, I used the function I created for the ECDF that I can always reference in the future. Whenever I need to use the ECDF after a long period of time, I always go back to that post to get the code.", "You can do the same with your articles also. It can be anything from a simple function to the code for a whole machine learning pipeline you published. A reference for your audience is a reference for you too.", "Imposter syndrome is the belief that you are not good enough for something, even though your skills say otherwise. Looking back at your posts will remind you of what you are capable of. They will remind you of all the hard work you did on your data science journey. It will remind you that you are good enough even if some people don\u2019t see it that way.", "I haven\u2019t been working in the field very long, but there is a fair amount of writing in data science that I do. Written communication is a skill you will need if you want others with various levels of technical backgrounds to understand your work. Blogging will help you with that skill as you are forced to consider your word choices and writing struggle as you keep that audience in mind. Maybe what I use writing for at my position should be the next blog post? What do you think?", "Now that we have gone over the benefits, let\u2019s quickly talk about how you can get started. Below is a list of tips to help you share your first post with the world.", "I am not the first one to write about how blogging helps you get into data science and its benefits. The first data scientist to give me advice recommended blogging also. If you still aren\u2019t convinced, check out the next few posts. This first one is by David Robinson who has helped me get exposure by offering to share my first couple of posts.", "This post describes the benefits the author obtained for blogging once a week.", "Thanks for reading! You can follow or connect with me on Linkedin and Twitter. Open to DM\u2019s on Twitter.", "So what are you waiting for? Start blogging! and remember\u2026", "Your home for data science.
