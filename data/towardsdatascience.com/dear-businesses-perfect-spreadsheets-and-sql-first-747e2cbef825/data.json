Despite the decades-long hype around data science, it is still difficult for any business to adopt it.", "If you travel back in time in any company\u2019s history, you will first see the birth of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Then departments that support the company\u2019s scalability such as marketing, operations, and product (including engineering) enter the scene. Then support departments that hold the company accountable such as finance and HR come in next. Once you have gained traction, you might finally start thinking if you would have a dedicated analytics team to build sustainable reports for you. A \u201csupport support-department\u201d if you will.", "Countless online courses, blogs, and tutorial videos have surged since Harvard Business Review remarked the role \u201cdata scientist\u201d to be the sexiest job of the 21st century to allow learners to dive headfirst into Data Science 101. So we have created a herd of \u201cdata science\u201d employee candidates. What about the employers? Do the employers know what stage the company is at to hire the appropriate talents that will push the company towards leveraging data science?", "In this article, I will use an anecdote to outline a common scenario in many businesses, and I will address the phases that many companies experience before they are ready for data science. Relevant resources are hyperlinked towards the end of this article if you wish to learn more about making data science relevant to any business.", "We have all been there. When we are dying to know the answer, and we want it now. We have this 6-month worth of sales data, and we just want to know what the collected metrics (customer details like age, residence, the products they chose, the price the paid, how long they have been a customer, etc.) tell us about our business.", "So we open up a new sheet and start keying in the 10 rows that we have, or copy it from someone who has nicely put it in a tabular form already. Or get advanced to import some .csv file into the spreadsheet.", "You probably don\u2019t have to have a graph to tell you that out of the first 10 (and special) customers you have, 3/10 come from Toronto (6/10 come from the East coast). \u201cApple\u201d is your most popular product followed by \u201cOrange\u201d. Your average customer lifetime is 4 months. Out of the 10 customers over 6 months, you have made $540 in total from them.", "There you have it. You don\u2019t need an analytics team because you can\u2019t afford one yet, the data samples are still small, and you and spreadsheets together can do the job.", "The business has grown, and you, the founder, have hired an analyst (Linda) who would aggregate all those sales data for you. First, you taught her how you have done the reports, then you give her a direction or a request, and she has the autonomy to build the report in her own way.", "Except for this one time, you notice the numbers on the report don\u2019t line up at all. You asked Linda to re-do the report, but the numbers still don\u2019t look quite right. You tried to investigate further by asking her to send over the raw data that she used to put together the report, but it was too much. She was copy and pasting one row from this overwhelmingly colorful report, and doing a Vlookup after another Vlookup across at least two sheets to first get the reference file or mapping and then the numbers. Unable to sustain the amount of manual work, Linda resigns after her 2 years of crunching reports.", "Your new hire, Jerry, is welcomed by this \u201cgreat spreadsheet\u201d created by Linda and others. He started out doing exactly what Linda does and was very hardworking even over the weekend. Another half a year has gone by, Jerry pitched to you the need for a data warehouse and requested you to fund it. Amused, you ask Jerry if he\u2019s solved the \u201cgreat spreadsheet\u201d problem which he has been passionately criticizing about.", "He listed out the ground-work he has done to initiate removal of the \u201cgreat spreadsheet\u201d:", "Quite convinced, you carried on to ask Jerry why he needs a data warehouse.", "Jerry explained to you that the data has grown since he joined, be it the number of products, customers, operational cost types, and more. It\u2019s also getting more difficult to do more mapping and Vlookups when spreadsheets lie freely about and data warehouse could have solved it easily by doing joins. He has set up a system that eases the migration to a data warehouse because he still has a whole SQL skillset under his belt that he has not fully utilized yet.", "After you approved Jerry\u2019s data warehouse proposal, you have seen him being busy again pushing data into the data warehouse. You have the honor to be the first few users to log into the data warehouse to see where he\u2019s at for data migration. He has already trained you on some basics on a relational database and SQL, so you understand how to explore tables and run some queries.", "What welcomes you is neatly organized schemas and tables. You could see customer,and dimension tables around the customers like customer_address, customer_orders. Underneath customer_orders, you can see each product_id is associated with each order. What\u2019s even neater is under the supplier schema, you even see a mapping of supplier_product_id to product_id. You\u2019re sure that Finance would be very excited to see this too! Of course, the operations schema is still on its way to be built, but already, you can also see a table planning to map product_id to each cost_type.", "Jerry tells you in the future, he no longer needs to worry about whether his \u201cspreadsheet pipeline\u201d works correctly to feed data into the dashboard. He just needs to hook the dashboard up to the query that gives him everything that the spreadsheet pipeline would give like the following:", "Albeit the spreadsheets still need to be the stopgap solution for data collection and transformation before the Engineering team develops applications that will further streamline the business processes that Jerry has defined, it is only the matter of switching pipelining data from the applications instead of from spreadsheets.", "Jerry also reminds you that there are still many outstanding spreadsheets sitting with individual departments because that\u2019s what everyone feels the most comfortable with to work on an ad-hoc report. He is confident that as long as there is a business need and business requirements are clearly defined, he would be able to turn an ad-hoc report into a regular report by incorporating new data into his data warehouse.", "Still, this anecdote is an idealistic case study on how a business could attempt digital transformation. Often, the \u201cgreat spreadsheet\u201d is a collective effort and every stakeholder may have their interpretation of a report format. The data collection process might simply be non-existent (ex, supplier invoices are still on paper or an unstructured PDF file). Your analyst at the time does not have the required skillset nor the vision to streamline a reporting pipeline. The Engineering team might have a hard time to implement a change that caters to the business need. The real world is complicated, and you may be stuck with the \u201cgreat spreadsheet\u201d for a very long time until there is leadership to steer you away from it.", "Suppose a company more or less follows through the ideal scenario, it would be much more capable of initiating data science. Any business change that leads to a new process means the entire pipeline (data collection, data transformation, data consumption) should be thoughtfully designed and documented. Data integration would just be part of the process to make data available to the data consumers. For example, if Jerry decides to do a price match with the company\u2019s competitor, he will need to determine where and how (often) to get the data & incorporate it into his data warehouse after massaging the identifiers & present this report to relevant stakeholders.", "\u201cData Science for Startups\u201d series written by Ben Weber is one example of an experienced data scientist in gaming and fintech industries turning his journey of setting up data infrastructure in companies into a tool book.", "Weber has a very interesting way of depicting the \u201cevolution of data pipeline\u201d. I would also propose that data itself undergoes an evolution:", "While I agree with Weber that a company should try its best to avoid spreadsheets due to the scalability issue, I believe spreadsheets to businesses is like SQL to databases, a lingua franca that will not go away anytime soon. Besides, unless a report prototype is proven to be useful to the decision-makers, it usually will not have a formalized business process with tool support such as a web app and/or a database. A bit of a catch-22 situation.", "To stop this from being a catch-22 situation and to stop disappointing more talents who wish to focus on more statistical modeling (and less data cleaning), we must start by addressing the bottom of the hierarchy of needs. Most businesses may not necessarily have that many data sources (ex. \u201clogging\u201d, \u201csensors\u201d etc.) other than \u201cgreat spreadsheet\u201d, so there is no shortcut to keeping the spreadsheet system as organized as possible until a more streamlined process has come along.", "Last but not least, a good report usually came from a good question. Other than some descriptive measurements that a report can answer (ex, What are the sales of this month? What kind of customer demographics do we have?), there are prescriptive measurements (ex, How many views does our campaign have this month? How have our products\u2019 prices fluctuated?). Whenever we attempt to measure any business metric, we must ask ourselves what this particular business metric means and if experimenting with it can affect or give rise to additional business metrics. More great examples from the article below by Ethan Knox.", "Only then, we would officially enter the realm of data science.", "If you are reading this, you must\u2019ve at one point heard about the hype around data science. The headliner buzzwords about \u201cinsight-driven businesses\u201d, \u201cpredict your business with machine learning\u201d, and \u201chow AI accelerates the Information Age\u201d. But the latest step-by-step guideline to help onboard businesses to data science is still missing.", "To include businesses in this train of data science hype, what we need to start focusing on is the endeavor to be \u201cdata-ready\u201d first before being \u201cdata-driven\u201d.", "\u201cLegacy system\u201d may as well mean an ocean of spreadsheets, its organization pertinent to the ease of migration to a database. Even after the SQL database is up and running, there is a whole new set of problems such as integration with other data sources to continue the development of new or existing data products.", "Forget about being data-driven for a second, does your company have a solid data infrastructure, and does the data measure the right things?", "I would like to conclude this article with a passage from another recent Harvard Business Review article that highlights the challenge of digital transformation.", "Success requires bringing together and coordinating a far greater range of effort than most leaders appreciate. A poor showing in any one of four inter-related domains \u2014 technology, data, process, or organizational change capability \u2014 can scuttle an otherwise well-conceived transformation. The really important stuff, from creating and communicating a compelling vision, to crafting a plan and adjusting it on the fly, to slogging through the details, is all about people.", "Resources not directly referenced in the article but still relevant:", "Generalists vs. Specialists in Data Science and Analytics", "Excel vs SQL: A Conceptual Comparison", "My previous article has already addressed why and how data engineering will help an organization to be \u201cdata-ready\u201d.", "If you would like to read more deep-dive articles regarding", "Please comment below, and feel free to
