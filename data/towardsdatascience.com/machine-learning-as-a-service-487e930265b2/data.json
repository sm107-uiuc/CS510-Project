It is, for example, relatively easy to process customer reviews on e-commerce sites, because users are required to post a rating alongside the text of the product review.", "Most data, however, is available in an unstructured form. It does not contain a standardized summary saying \u201cThis content expresses a positive, negative, mixed or neutral view.\u201d", "WordPress.com, for example, reports that bloggers using their platform have published more than 87 million posts just in May of 2018.[1] According to YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, more than 400 hours of content are uploaded to the video-sharing site every minute.[2] Meanwhile, the Google Books project has digitized at least 25 million volumes in 400 languages.[3]", "Whenever a user types into a free text field or speaks into a microphone, an inference is required to categorize the sentiment.", "Sentiment analysis is the field that focuses on exactly this task. It is a branch of natural language processing that studies functions designed to map a text document to a representation of a sentiment.", "With the advent of accurate speech and text recognition, the reach of sentiment analysis extends beyond readily accessible digital text data and covers an increasing number of media.", "Sentiment analysis helps us understand the past, predict the future and take appropriate measures in the present.", "Suppose you had access to an analysis of the opinions expressed by your customers, competitors, students or other subjects of interest. What would you do with this knowledge?", "We\u2019ve said that sentiment analysis takes a text document as input and returns a representation of a sentiment as output.", "There is little to say about the input. This is simply the text content of the book/comment/customer survey/email/news article/product review/tweet or other type of document that you would like to analyze.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to the output.", "Binary sentiment analysis, the simplest case, asks the following question: \u201cIs the opinion expressed in the text document positive or negative?\u201d", "Here, the output is either a probability or a score.", "A high probability indicates that the given text is likely to express a positive opinion. For example, an output of 0.9 indicates a 90% probability that the expressed opinion is positive.", "Conversely, a low probability indicates that the given text is likely to be an expression of a negative view. For example, an output of 0.1 indicates a 10% probability that the opinion is positive or, put differently, a 90% probability of a negative opinion.", "Alternatively, the prediction of the sentiment can be expressed as a score. There are no surprises here, either. Positive scores indicate positive sentiments. Negative scores indicate negative sentiments. Greater absolute values indicate a stronger sentiments.", "In multi-class sentiment analysis, the output is a probability distribution over n possible classes or, in other words, a list of n non-negative numbers that add up to 1. To categorize the opinion, you can pick the classes associated with the highest probability.", "Binary sentiment analysis is a special case of multi-class sentiment analysis with n=2.", "A simple extension of binary sentiment analysis is to introduce the class of neutral opinions. In that case, the output is a probability distribution over three classes (n = 3). The three probabilities could be ordered as follows: negative probability, neutral probability and positive probability.", "The prediction for a review that focuses on technical details could, for example, have a distribution similar to this one: [ 0.1, 0.85, 0.05 ].", "Now, suppose that a customer publishes a mixed review, listing both positive and negative aspects of a product. The output of the 3-class sentiment analyzer could resemble the following distribution: [ 0.4, 0.1, 0.5 ].", "One way to deal with this is to include a mixed category. Suppose we order the four categories as follows: negative, neutral, mixed, positive. The output in the mixed product review example might then look something like this: [ 0.15, 0.05, 0.7, 0.1 ].", "To complete this overview, we\u2019ll look at four sentiment analysis services of leading cloud computing platforms.", "To provide a first impression of the performance of theses services, I\u2019ve created a benchmark using data curated by Kotzias et al. (2015).[14]", "Three subsets of reviews from well-known data sets with 1,000 instances each are included in this compilation: Amazon product reviews, movie reviews from the IMDB data set and Yelp restaurant reviews.", "Amazon\u2019s natural language processing solution Comprehend was launched last year and, currently, supports English and Spanish documents.", "Requests are measured in units of 100 characters, with a 3 unit minimum per request.", "Just like the other services listed here, Amazon Comprehend has tiers based on the number of requests per month. Up to 10 million units, the price per 1,000 units is $0.1. For requests above the 50 million mark, the price is set to $0.025.", "Given a credentials provider, a text and a language code, a prediction of the sentiment can be requested as follows:", "The API supports batch requests with up to 25 documents (with, at most, 5,000 characters) and generates a probability distribution over four classes: negative, mixed, neutral and positive.", "Unsurprisingly, Comprehend achieved the best performance on the 1,000 Amazon product reviews. Combined with accuracy rates of close to 90% on the other two data sets, this makes Amazon\u2019s API the runner-up in the benchmark.", "Google\u2019s Cloud Natural Language API supports nine languages and generates two sentiment analysis values: score and magnitude.", "The score of a document\u2019s sentiment indicates the overall emotion of a document.", "The magnitude indicates how much emotional content is present within a document and is often proportional to the length of the document.", "Documents that express few emotions or mixed emotions have a neutral score around 0.0. The magnitude value can be used to disambiguate these two cases. Low-emotion documents have low magnitude values, while mixed emotions are associated with higher magnitude values.", "The pricing model is based on units of 1,000 characters per document. For monthly requests in the range between 5,000 units and a million units, the price per 1,000 units is $1. Between 5,000 and a million units, the price per 1,000 units is $1. The price decreases to $0.25 for requests in the range between 5 million and 20 million units.", "Assuming the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable is set to the path of the JSON file containing the project credentials, the following code performs sentiment analysis for a given text:", "Google\u2019s services makes up for the lack of batching processing with an excellent accuracy of 92.1 %, achieving the best performance in two out of three data sets. Performance-wise, the Cloud Natural Language API is the clear winner of our competition.", "Microsoft\u2019s sentiment analyzer performs binary classification and, consequently, assigns a probability to every document. When a text cannot be analyzed or has no sentiment, the service always returns 0.5 exactly.", "A free tier with 5,000 transactions per month allows you to explore the API without a financial commitment. The entry-level Standard S0 tier is offered at a price of $74.71 per month and comes with 25,000 requests. The most expensive publicly disclosed tier, Standard S4, sets you back $4,999.99 per month and includes 10 million requests.", "The price per 1,000 transactions above the tier limits ranges from $0.50 to $3.", "The API supports 15 European languages and batch requests of up to 1,000 documents.", "Unfortunately, these features are not matched by its performance in our test. With an average accuracy of 81.8% the Text Analytics API trailed Google\u2019s service by more than ten percentage points.", "A beta version of a Java SDK is available, but it was easier to work with Unirest and GSON:", "IBM Watson\u2019s sentiment analyzer supports ten languages and returns a score ranging from -1 to +1.", "The billing unit consists of 10,000 characters. Under the free Lite plan, 30,000 units are available per month. The entry-level tier of the standard plan covers the first 250,000 units per month at a price of $3 per 1,000 units. After 5 million units, the price drops down to $0.20.", "In our test, the Watson API performed significantly better than Microsoft\u2019s Text Analytics API but worse than Amazon Comprehend.", "The Java SDK does not appear to support batch requests.", "Sentiment analysis categorizes opinions expressed in text documents.", "Its growth is fueled by the rise of user-generated content and increasingly accurate text and speech recognition.", "We\u2019ve briefly looked at 10 applications across a broad range of different domains: from the prediction of box office revenues and brand monitoring to the stock market modeling and the identification of basic shapes of emotional trajectories in story arcs.", "Binary classification returns a probability (or a score) indicating either a positive or a negative view. Some sentiment analyzers extend this dichotomy and include the category of mixed and/or neutral sentiments.", "We\u2019ve then compared four sentiment analysis services of leading cloud computing platforms.", "If you are interested in sentiment analysis a service, I suggest you start with Amazon Comprehend or Google Natural Language Understanding API.", "[4] Asur, S. and Huberman, B.A., 2010, August.
