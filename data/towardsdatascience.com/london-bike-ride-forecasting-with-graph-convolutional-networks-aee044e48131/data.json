Like its renowned ancestor, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), learnable convolution operations are key as a vast number of non-linear relations are strung together between known input and predicted output. However, the convolution operations in GCNs are different from those in CNNs.", "I will share a practical end-to-end application of GCN to a problem for which the reader should be able to connect the mathematical entities in the GCN to the real-world precursors. Time-series forecasting of bike sharing in London, UK, is the application that puts flesh on the bones of the GCN I build and present.", "A practical, simple and true introduction is my goal for this exploration. There will have to be omissions, and the advanced reader has no problem finding sophisticated mathematical treatments elsewhere. My implementation uses PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric, and code snippets are shared throughout the text.", "CNNs are described in terms of their dimensions, such as one-dimensional or two-dimensional. This corresponds to a given structure of the problem. Text or speech analysis can be viewed as problems structured along one dimension. Image analysis or object recognition can be viewed as problems structured along two dimensions.", "There are many problems however that are not nearly as regular in their structure \u2014 they may not fit neatly into the Euclidean spaces.", "A graph is a general mathematical structure onto which numerous problems have been mapped and analyzed. Abstract graphs are plentiful in biology, such as the interactome or the metabolic networks. The amusing or scary proliferation of memes on social media relates to dynamics on graphs, which also is true in viral spread and communicable disease.", "Transport is another excellent example. Jumping on a bike at King\u2019s Cross Station and, after some vigorous pedalling, jumping off at Charles Dickens Museum is a transport event in space and time involving two vertices in a graph.", "Urban transport takes place mostly along two dimensions. However, two pairs of vertices in a city of identical distances may experience very different traffic between the respective vertices because what commercial activity, residences or roads that are present at, or between, the vertices. The urban environment is heterogeneous, places and paths are rarely interchangeable. The Euclidean distance (or for that matter the Manhattan distance) is not adequate in models of many transport problems, and hence an urban graph is preferred.", "GCNs can, therefore, be applied to transport problems on urban graphs. These are spatiotemporal problems \u2014 the where-and-when of events and their coupled nature. As will become evident, the graph that defines the structure of the problem is at the heart of GCNs.", "Before the GCN is built and applied, I give a concise descriptive analysis of the London bike sharing dataset, so the concepts are clear and intuitions established. I have done a more detailed data analysis of London bike sharing in the past.", "In the city of London, UK, there is a bike-sharing system of Santander bikes, also known as Boris bikes after the former mayor Boris Johnson who introduced the system in 2010. Transport for London (TfL) records the usage of the bikes in some detail.", "One line in the raw data corresponds to a single transport event: when a bike departed from which bike station, and when said bike arrived at another (or the same) bike station. The raw data contains no information about where the bike is in-between the departure and arrival times.", "Each bike station can be understood to possess two streams of time-dependent data: the number of bike departures and the number of bike arrivals in an interval of time.", "Following necessary and unglamorous data wrangling (summarized in the footnotes), I consider the dual data streams for 709 bike stations in 2017 and 2018, unless otherwise stated.", "How different are the stations with respect to their data streams? The histogram below shows how many bike stations throughout London have a certain weekly number of departures plus arrivals.", "Most stations have between 200 and 600 arrivals plus departures in a week, while a few stations have a great deal more. This is evidently not just a normal variation around a common mean.", "There are seasonal variations as well. The total number of weekly bike rentals are shown for 2017\u20132019 below. The three cusps correspond to the warmer, less rainy, months in London.", "Within a week, and within days, there is variation. The diagram below illustrates the total number of rentals per half hour that took place during five consecutive days in 2017. Weekends and weekdays are qualitatively distinct.", "Bike rental activities, therefore, varies a great deal with time. The temporal variations make intuitive sense: biking in rain and cold is less attractive; commuting to and from work takes places mostly on weekday mornings and evening, respectively.", "As a side note, major temporal change due to the COVID-19 pandemic can be tracked in a change to the commuting data signature.", "Onto the spatial relations between the 709 stations. From the raw data I determine what percentage of departures from a particular station arrives at another station. A pair of stations between which people ride bikes a great deal is more strongly connected, or in terms of a non-Euclidean space, is closer together in the graph.", "The clustered heatmap of station-to-station travel percentages is shown below, with red-yellowish colours indicating a stronger connection for the corresponding pair of stations, blueish colours indicating the opposite, and green the intermediate relation.", "The heatmap is evidently clustered. The off-diagonal colours are not uniformly dispersed. So subsets stations can have similar distances to the same subset of other stations.", "The visible clusters roughly correspond with the geography of London.", "The cluster at the top-left includes stations around Battersea Park and Clapham Junction. Next small but distinct cluster includes stations around Fulham and Putney. The next bigger cluster includes stations in and around Hyde Park and all of Kensington. Then follows stations around The Reagent\u2019s Park, Marylebone and especially King\u2019s Cross Station, a major commuter hub. The large, but quite diffuse cluster contains most stations in central London, with Soho, Westminster, Liverpool Street, as well as the Waterloo Station. Finally, the most eastern stations in Whitechapel, Victoria Park form a fairly distinct cluster, and the stations around Shoreditch figure as the linchpin to the central London cluster.", "The spatial relations are therefore similar to spatial relations a two-dimensional metric would yield. This is helpful as we understand the method. However, the graph implicitly embodies the heterogeneity in direction and range of the urban bike transports, which the Euclidean metric does not.", "The weighted and directed adjacency matrix congruent with the heatmap above is the key to the following graph convolutions.", "The adjacency matrix says something about how data streams are coupled. If there is a jump in departures from a station, the probability of a jump in arrivals at other stations in the near future is not uniform.", "The adjacency matrix can, therefore, define an inductive bias. Intuitively speaking, our knowledge of the structure of the problem should allow us to guide the induction, inference, or the machine learning fitting. Like the standard square convolution window in CNN, which is biased to discover features in mostly proximate pixels, the graph convolution operation should be able to unearth local relations in the graph that are predictive.", "Time to build the model and find out.", "The deep learning model I describe and explore below is built on basis of the work by Yu et al. on traffic forecasting. They apply the method to Beijing and California highway traffic data. There are occasional deviation from their model and what I present below. Nonetheless, they defined the architecture and deserve the credit.", "My ambition is not to develop yet another state-of-the-art model for the task at hand. That would require plenty more architecting and fitting meta-parameters. Rather, I built a model from the template model by Yu et al., describe its components and their roles, and explore what GCNs can be in the process with the bike problem steering the way.", "To the best of my knowledge, this is the first forecasting task on the London bike dataset, so at least in that regard, I present novel work.", "Next steps in the presentation of the model:", "The temporal signal for a particular bike station begins with a one-dimensional convolution followed by a gated linear unit activation. As described above, there are two input channels per station: number of arrivals, s1, and number of departures, s2.", "The nine most recent data points are convoluted along the single time dimension with a kernel size of three. The steps are illustrated in the animation of the two rows of boxes on the left.", "The convolution is a linear transformation of the two input channels, three consecutive data points at a time, into 128 output channels. The transformation weights and bias, W and b in the animation, are learnable parameters. Also note that the convolution is without any padding, so the length of the output is two less than the length of the input \u2014 seven in this pass.", "The gated linear unit (GLU) is a non-linear activation function. One channel to the GLU acts as the controller of the gate, and the second channel as the data that can be passed through the gate or not. A gate is strictly a binary open-or-closed system. Since discontinuous functions are unpleasant to optimize, the gate is rather modelled as a continuous sigmoid function, \ud835\udf48, bounded between zero and one.", "The GLU therefore consumes two channels of data of length seven, and produces one channel of length seven. The animation only shows the GLU applied to two of the 128 channels. After all channels have been processed, 64 channels of data are the result for any particular station.", "The key parts of a custom class to perform the convolutions and non-linear activation with Pytorch is shown in the code snippet below. Details on how to slice and concatenate the data tensors are omitted.", "These steps are applied with the same set of convolution kernels for all 709 bike stations, and the input data tensor of dimension 709x2x9 becomes an output data tensor of dimension 709x64x7.", "I briefly note that the more common way to model a time-series problem like this is the recurrent neural networks (RNNs). One-dimensional convolution have recently been found to perform quite well too.", "Metaphorically speaking, the one-dimensional convolutions are tailored machinery for discovery of up to 64 features along the time-dimension, like steep increase, opposite trending departures and arrivals, brief jump from zero in bike departures, steep decrease \u2014 properties that relate to several contiguous points in the input data streams. It is left to the training of the method to learn what features are useful in the final forecast, but more about that later.", "Next, the spatial relations between the temporal features are to be turned into another set of features. This is where spatiotemporal features can start to emerge, that is, variations over time correlated between specific points in space.", "Because of the variety of local structures possible in a graph, the appropriate way to do convolutions consistently over said variety is not self-evident. A host of different graph convolutions have therefore been formulated and published since the first kind in 2005, all with their supposed advantages. This is not the place to survey all the options or sort out their logical relations. Instead I use two types of graph convolutions and focus the description on qualitative and conceptual properties. The two types are:", "I start with shared properties of the graph convolutions before getting into details.", "The input tensor following the temporal convolution is first sliced such that only one of the seven temporal dimensions is considered. Therefore, 64 channels of data for 709 vertices or bike stations comprises the input, see the left-hand block in the animated image below.", "An operation A selects a subset of bike stations, \u03a91, and reweighs the corresponding data. The selection and reweighing is governed by the graph, its weights and topology, which are properties represented in the adjacency matrix. The clustered matrix for the Santander bikes in London was illustrated as a heatmap in the earlier section.", "The reweighed subset, \u03a91, is linearly transformed with learnable parameters, W. The 64 data channels for the subset of stations are turned into 16 output data channels. The well-known Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is used as non-linear activation, and the output vector for the first bike station for the first temporal dimension has been obtained.", "Next: second bike station, first temporal dimension. A different local selection and reweighing is done, \u03a92, while the linear transformation with learnable parameters and non-linear activation with ReLU are as before. The spatiotemporal features of the second bike station are thus obtained.", "Repeat again, and again, until outputs for all bike stations and all temporal dimensions are computed and collected.", "At the conclusion of the graph convolution, a tensor of dimension 709x16x7 is obtained. It represents local spatiotemporal features of the 709 bike stations. As before, the precise features that the convolutions track are those that prove useful to the forecasting task, as revealed during method training.", "A brief note: The order I describe the steps in is not how it is implemented. There are many ways to evaluate the cumulative arithmetics and arrive at the same output \u2014indeed one of the virtues of neural nets that enable efficient implementations. The description is meant to help make concepts clearer, not to serve as an implementation specification.", "A closer look at selection and reweighing for the method by Kipf and Welling is provided in the figure below for a small collection of London bike stations. The graph on the left shows seven bike stations and how large the relative flows of bikes are between the stations. At this layer of the model, each station has 64 data channels.", "In order to obtain the output for the Stamford Street station, the other stations connected in the graph to Stamford Street are selected. The five stations with a thick purple border define that subset. The associated data are reweighed as a function of the graph weights and graph topology and summed up. A 1x64 tensor is obtained.", "The reweighing depends on the weights to and from Stamford Street at its topology within the graph. Qualitatively speaking, this is meant to balance more strongly connected and weakly connected stations, as well as to normalize for that some stations have more neighbours than others (a higher degree). These are unique issues to graph convolutions. The precise equation needs a more formal justification, which can be found in the linked articles.", "The last step for the Stamford Street station output computation linearly transforms the 64 channels of data into 16 channels of data using learnable weights. At the end a non-linear activation with ReLU is done.", "The following image illustrates the equivalent steps for Hatton Wall bike station, and its local environment in the graph.", "Finally a note about the other graph convolution method, TAGCN. It too selects a local environment to the bike station of interest. However, the environment includes stations not just directly adjacent. Instead it considers all pathways between stations of lengths less than or equal to an upper bound, which I set to two in the computations below. The reweighing is based on the sum of the weights along the pathways.", "Another way to view TAGCN is like an aggregation of two convolutions of different kernel sizes \u2014 one the direct neighbours, one the neighbours of the direct neighbours. An analog in CNN is the aggregation of square kernels of different sizes, which has been used in some image recognition tasks.", "The key parts of a class to perform the graph convolutions and non-linear activation with Pytorch and Pytorch Geometric is shown in the code snippet below. Details on how to slice and concatenate the data tensors are omitted.", "I denote the operations A and W as one spatial operation, S1, and we are now one layer deeper into the model.", "The adjacency matrix I use is an adjusted variant of the colourful heatmap in the previous section. There are pairs of bike stations between which very few rides take place, in some cases as few as a single one in a year. The associated weights are very small. A sparse matrix leads to quicker computations, and a lot of tiny weights are spatially uninformative at best, but also risk adding noise.", "For these reason two lower thresholds on the weights will be tested. Any connection lower than 1% or 2%, respectively, is removed from consideration. The get a sense of the sparsity, the adjacency matrix is shown below, with weights 1% or above as black dots, and weights below 1% as white space.", "The graph convolution and activation is followed by another one-dimensional convolution over the time dimensions. The operations are the same kind as in the first pass. The learnable parameters can be different, however, and the length of the time dimensions is 7, not 9. Furthermore, each data element for a particular station is not just containing past data for that station, but on account of the graph convolution, the data elements depend on trends at stations local to the given station.", "So the layers so far are as illustrated below.", "Neural networks with many layers are challenging to optimize and train. It has been discovered that some form of normalization help in that regard. A commonly cited reason for this enhancement is that the numerical limits put on the network through the normalization operation remove or dial back numerical issues that can be amplified through the many connected layers, the covariant shift being primary among them.", "The next addition is a layer normalization, which is described intuitively here. It fits parameters for each station and time dimension in order to scale the data in the 64 channels to be about zero mean and unit standard deviation.", "The appropriate PyTorch class is initialized", "where the spatial dimension is 709, temporal dimension 9 minus the effect of the convolution with the kernel of length 3, that is 5.", "The next convolution steps are repeats of the types of steps already described above. That is, a one-dimensional convolution over time for each bike station, a graph convolution for each time dimension, and another one-dimensional convolution plus layer normalization. The learnable parameters are different, but the concepts are the same.", "Because each convolution over time contracts the tensor along the time axis, the output after the convolutions consists of only one slice along the time axis.", "A compressed illustration of the method:", "Convolutions are intended to discover and represent useful spatiotemporal features. The last step is to compute the regression that based on the spatiotemporal features forecasts the bike arrivals and departures at the stations some time into the future.", "The workhorse of neural networks, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), is used for this purpose. It has one hidden layer, ReLU activations, and is fully connected. It takes as input the output from the sequence of convolutions and returns the forecasted values for departures and arrivals at the 709 stations, in other words, a 709x2 tensor.", "The return values are not integers, but real-valued numbers. In the real-world problem there can only be integer arrivals and departures. For that reason the output is interpreted as a central tendency (like mean or modal value) of a distribution of probable integer values. I do not characterize the distribution in other ways, though that is in principle possible.", "The model from start to finish:", "The time interval that will be used is 15 minutes. That is, each of the 9 temporal inputs describe the number of bike departures and arrivals in a 15 minute interval at each of the 709 bike stations. These are the known inputs given to the method.", "I choose the target for the forecast to be four steps ahead of the most recent input, or in other words, one hour ahead. Picture this as the scenario where we wish to forecast bike flows one hour from any particular present moment.", "I use data from year 2017 as training data. There is therefore about 35,000 instances of possible training data available. I randomly select about 17% of these to use for training. That means the training data covers mornings, evenings, weekdays, weekends, summer, winter etc.", "The objective of the training is the minimization of the mean square error of the forecasted bike arrivals and departures at all stations compared to the selected ground truth data from 2017.", "There is a great deal of art and science in optimizing neural networks, their size implies a mathematically and computationally tricky problem. I will not delve into these details, however. Here are one or two or three good places to look instead. I use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in the training.", "Batches is an additional concept in the training of deep neural networks. I refer the reader to other sources for what this is and why it is a common practice. For graphs neural nets it is quite natural to implement batches. As described in the Pytorch Geometric documentation, a batch of, say, 64 training data point can be represented as one graph with 64\u2715709 vertices, but where the 64 subgraphs are disjoint. Most of the computations can therefore be left as is for this larger concatenation of disjoint subgraphs.", "The training can begin. The essential parts of the training code are shown in the snippet below.", "The model as described above is initialized with the custom class STGCN from which snippets of code are shown in the previous sections.", "The class LondonBikeDataset does a lot of grunt work to parse, slice, format, and filter the raw data. As so often when dealing with real-world problems, this is the messy part where the cost of inconsistent data practices has to be paid, and the sloppy use of separators somewhere around the millionth row is a hex for sharp headache. The Pandas library is invaluable.", "Parts of the training I run on GPUs available from Google Colab \u2014 an amazing resource for the experimenter without a free expertly configured computer cluster standing by.", "Stamford Street is one station, nothing out of the ordinary with it. I use it to illustrate how results can look \u2014 summary statistics for all test data comes later. The graph convolution method of Kipf and Welling is used with an adjacency matrix with a 2% lower threshold for the weights.", "All test data is selected from 2018, therefore guaranteed not to have been part of the training data.", "The observed data for bike arrivals for four days in June at the Stamford Street station is shown as purple circles with thin connection lines. The corresponding forecasted data is shown as the green line.", "The fact that the number of bike arrivals in 15 minutes typically is small, in several instances zero, means the observed data is noisy. There is often no other reason than chance why in one quarter no arrivals takes place, and in the next quarter there are three ones. The stochastic nature of the process is evident when dealing with small numbers.", "In order to smooth out the noise, a five-window rolling average is computed for the observed data.", "It is easier to see the similarities and differences between observed and forecasted after smoothing. The distinct peaks in morning and evening of weekdays are captured. Note that the model has no explicit knowledge about which day in the week it is trying to forecast. Still, deviations between observed and forecasted are clearly present.", "Hyde Park Corner is another station \u2014 and this one is not ordinary, it is one of the busiest stations, especially on weekends. It is also station that varies a great deal between weekends due to the weather. The smoothed observed (purple) and forecasted (green) data are shown for four Sundays in September 2018.", "The model is not explicitly accounting for the dependencies on weather. But indirectly some outcomes of weather have been learnt in the training because of a persistent pattern. The fact that the morning of 23rd September is rainy has to manifest itself somewhere in the input data, such that the usual increase in rentals around 9:00 is not part of the forecast.", "This illustrates that just because the model is not directly accounting for day of week, weather, season, or a whole host of other factors that intuitively should matter to Londoners\u2019 appetite for a ride around the park, the cumulative impacts of said factors are to some extent handled by the model nonetheless.", "Short answer: a bit, but not that much.", "To make a fair comparison, I run a version of the model above with an adjacency matrix with all off-diagonal elements set to zero. Hence, no mixing of temporal features between vertices in the graph take place during the convolution steps.", "I compare the mean-square error of this time-only model (0.657 for arrivals, 0.683 for departures) with a number of variants with graph convolution (Kipf and Welling with 1% and 2% thresholds, and TAGCN with the same thresholds). The models with graph convolutions have mean-square errors consistently 2%-6% lower in relative terms. The two types of graph convolutions perform more or less the same, and with arrivals somewhat better forecasted than departures.", "An added complication is that a handful of stations have a greater number of rental events. The modestly reduced error therefore derives mostly from changes for this handful of stations. I call this a complication, not a flaw, because if this is right or wrong depends on what the ultimate objective of an application would be. Perhaps the high traffic stations are the ones we care about?", "I also trained a model with an adjacency matrix that replaced all weights with the same value (1.0), given that they were above the 1% threshold. Call it an intentional destruction of information on problem structure. The mean-square error is well above the time-only model. This test illustrates that a poor description of the structure of the problem can make outcomes worse. Simple is less wrong when wrong.", "The results show that the graph convolution is on average only moderately helping this forecast of a slice of London urban transport. There is no shortage of additional variations of meta-parameters of the model to try out.", "I wonder, though, does the one-size-fits-all adjacency matrix set the more restrictive limit on accuracy? Weekends and weekdays see the most obviously different usage of the Santander bikes. So two stations that are close, in the non-Euclidean sense of the graph, on weekdays may not be as close on weekends. The structure of the problem is itself dynamic, and dependent on global variables, thus the average structure has its fundamental limits as an inductive bias.", "So maybe expand the architecture to include two (or more) graph convolutions in parallel using different adjacency matrices? Or train entirely distinct models for weekends and weekdays, or before noon and after noon, or sunny versus rainy\u2026?", "To dig deeper, there must be a limit to what can be predicted by any method given this type of input data streams. The graph of Santander bike rides is highly branched. Without additional information therefore, a known increase of departures at a station is smeared out over a large number of possible end stations. London bike sharing is high entropy. This is not a highway where the distribution of paths is narrow. To push the accuracy higher, other types of input data streams are required.", "More work, inspiration, data mining, data wrangling, and precious GPU hours are needed to settle this. Those hills are not to be climbed today, but left for future exploration and exercise \u2014 as any good project for knowledge acquisition ought to conclude.", "Was this helpful or interesting?
