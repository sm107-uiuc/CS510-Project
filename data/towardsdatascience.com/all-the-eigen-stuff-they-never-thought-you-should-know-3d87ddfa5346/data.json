It\u2019s the stuff that tends to make STEM students \u201chit their heads against a wall\u201d in frustration. For me, eigenvectors (and determinants) were some of the most challenging ideas found in this branch of mathematics. And what\u2019s more, it\u2019s fundamental to ideas in statistics, physics, engineering, computer science, and more. In this article, I\u2019m going to describe Eigen-stuff as mind-blowingly simple and hopefully it will boost your confidence when tackling trickier topics based on it.", "Halloween is nearly upon us and as such, I\u2019m going to use a far-fetched example to illustrate Eigen Decomposition: Let\u2019s say, you\u2019re trick-or-treating down some street \u2014 all the odd numbered houses are on the left and even numbers are on the right \u2014 and so you bounce from left to right and back again as you make your way down Candy Lane. Neighbors on the left side of the street only give out KitKats, while neighbors on the right side only give out M&Ms. One \u201cround\u201d will include knocking on one door on the left side and then one door on the right side of the street.", "For whatever reason, all the neighbors observe some rules, namely, neighbors on the left will give you M&Ms based on the candy you currently have. Namely:", "These rules are expressed by the \u201clinear transformation\u201d captured by the below matrix:", "So the question becomes \u2014 after you travel down the entire street (or for an arbitrarily long stretch) what will your candy bag look like? And how important is your candy bag\u2019s starting composition? Let\u2019s say you start with one of each candy in your bag:", "After one round (left & right side of the street), your updated bag has 3 KitKats and 5 M&Ms \u2014 in other words, you\u2019ve gained 2 KK and 9 MM. (Remember to make the distinction: The linear transformation matrix scales your number of candies, it doesn\u2019t simply add to them \u2014 though we can compute the additive amount.)", "So what does your bag look like after two rounds?", "Let\u2019s see what our bag looks like after 10 rounds, using python:", "A pretty clear trend emerges: First, Iterations 1\u20138 are mapped very close to each other, near the origin while iterations 9 and 10 stretched further apart, which shows that the scaling effect\u2019s magnitude is compounded with each iteration. The second trend is that these iterations follow a line! Recall high school algebra \u2014 a line is described by two parameters, a slope, and a y-intercept. If the line passes through the origin (0,0), the line is defined entirely by the slope, alone. If you recall, \u201crise over run,\u201d the line describes a ratio of y-to-x or M&Ms to KitKats. The line shows that, almost immediately after you start trick-or-treating, your bag will be defined by the same ratio! This is nothing if not fascinating.", "Before we get too excited, let\u2019s try a different starting bag combination:", "Now this is exciting! We\u2019ve seen two different starting bad compositions, yet they converge on the same KitKat to M&M ratio.", "This isn\u2019t universally true, however. Note that if you start with 0 of either candy, due to the multiplicative nature of the linear transformation, said candy will never increase and so your trip down will Candy Lane will not converge on this ratio. (However, if you start with negative numbers in either or both candies, the convergence will still occur! Though, this makes no sense in the context of our problem.)", "Now, let\u2019s plot these data points on the eigenvector:", "Imagine that, after the first couple of iterations, the bag\u2019s KK to MM ratio follows one of the eigenvectors, exactly! But what does this mean?", "We can think of eigenvectors to linear algebra as we think of limits to Calculus! They describe the end behavior of a system. Note, just as not all algebraic functions have limits (sometimes the limit does not exist)\u2014 not all matrices have real eigenvectors: For example, rotational matrices have imaginary eigenvectors. Why? Because, you can rotate a vector an infinite number of times but it will never converge on any ratio! Whereas this linear transformation converges on a specific ratio of KitKats to Peanut M&Ms. Eigen decomposition has many applications in mathematics; one such application is solving systems of differential equations. Why? Because we\u2019re talking exactly about ratios!", "Note: There are infinite points along the eigenvector, and due to sharing the same slope, they are simply multiples (though not explicitly limited to integer multiples) of the same ratio. Keep this line versus point idea in mind.", "So far we\u2019ve left very import consideration out: A system can have multiple eigenvectors, yet, our analysis shows that we only converge on one eigenvector. The explanation lies in eigenvalues: An eigenvector stretches a vector (or rotates \u2014 again, imaginary) but the eigenvalue defines the relative magnitude of these effects.", "Notice that the first eigenvalue is ~0.13, whereas the second is ~7.88. When you divide 7.88 by 0.13, the resulting number is about ~60. This means that for every time the linear transformation matrix is applied (recursively) to a vector, the effect of the second eigenvector is 60 times more powerful than the other. After even just a few iterations, the effect of the first eigenvector is simply negligible and washed out by the dominant effect of the second. This leads us to a second (soft) definition of eigenvectors: The principal effect(s) of a linear transformation.", "From our trick-or-treat example, you can see that eigenvectors can describe the end behavior of random variables. We very quickly approach a specific ratio of KK to MM and once we\u2019ve reached it, knocking on more doors will only solidify the ratio, there\u2019s really no escaping it! If this sounds like Markov Chains to you \u2014 congratulations, you\u2019re picking up on context clues very well.", "Consider the below network of webpages; the below matrix\u2019s columns depict the webpage you come from and the rows represent the webpages you come to. So chain[0,1] represents the probability of transitioning from page 1 to page 0. Where does this matrix come from? It\u2019s based on links found on webpages; for example, column 0 says that of all links on page 0, 25% refer back to itself, 20% refer to page 1, 25% to page 2, and lastly, 30% direct to page 3.", "We want to know, which pages are more or less relevant. One way to do this is to use a random walk: We set a bot on a mission starting at any of the above pages, selected randomly, then move randomly according to the transition probabilities defined by the column corresponding to the current webpage. If the bot is allowed to walk indefinitely (or for an arbitrarily long period of time) and we normalize its number of visits to each page, we\u2019ll find the stationary distribution, which is the probability that the bot would be found on each of the pages if its infinite walk was randomly stopped at some time.", "This stationary distribution is really important; it\u2019s another example of end behavior ratios! And this means, it can be found very quickly by eigendecomposition. But it gets better \u2014 a convenient property of a Markov Chain\u2019s transition matrix is that the dominant eigenvalue equals 1. And this means that it pulls an input vector towards the end behavior ratio, without scaling it. In other words, it pulls the input vector towards a specific point in space, not simply any multiple of the ratio (as was the case for the previous example.)", "Note, this property is so useful that this is generally how computers evaluate any eigenvector (however, some scaling/adjustment is needed at every step to coerce the system into behaving as though the eigenvalue was equal to 1.) For code and an explanation, see the Power Iteration Method.", "Focus your attention on the first element of the eigenvalue array and the first column of the eigenvector matrix. This is the stationary distribution. We see that page 1 is visited slightly more frequently than pages 0, 2, and 3. Note: In practice, the PageRank algorithm is used, which accounts for various tricky issues \u2014 such as a webpage only linking to itself (an absorbing state) or pairs of webpages that only link to each other. These issues tend to \u201csteal\u201d more credibility than they deserve from the network, resulting in faulty ranks. But this a different issue entirely.", "Why is the Markov Chain so important? It\u2019s the theoretical foundation of many statistical techniques \u2014 MCMC sampling in Bayesian Statistics, Monte Carlo methods (closely related) for Stochastic processes, and many other applications. The big picture idea is \u2014 if you have some random process, such as trick-or-treating down Candy Lane, you can estimate the end behavior of the process, likeliness of some event occurring, or relative frequency of some outcome. And it all begins with Eigens-stuff!", "Note: Undoubtedly, you\u2019re aware that I never used, A*x = lambda*x, which says in plain English: \u201cA given vector x is the eigenvector of matrix A if (and only if) when transformed by A, a scaled vector is returned \u2014 scaled specifically scaled by the eigenvalue.\u201d You can verify from all that I\u2019ve demonstrated above that this is true. In fact, this rule is much more sensible now that we\u2019ve explored some of the core ideas, first, from a top-down approach. Bottom-up learning is far too common in mathematics education for my taste.", "If you enjoyed this article, please follow me for similar content! Cheers :)", "Your home for data science.
