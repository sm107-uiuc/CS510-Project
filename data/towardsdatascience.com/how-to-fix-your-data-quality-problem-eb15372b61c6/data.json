Bad data costs companies valuable time, resources, and most of all, revenue. So why are so many of us struggling with trusting our data? Isn\u2019t there a better way?", "The data landscape is constantly evolving, creating new opportunities for richer insights at every turn. Data sources old and new mingle in the same data lakes and warehouses, and there are vendors to serve your every need, from helping you build better data catalogs to generating mouthwatering visualizations (leave it to the NYT to make mortgages look sexy).", "Not surprisingly, one of the most common questions customers ask me is \u201cwhat data tools do you recommend?\u201d", "More data means more insight into your business. At the same time, more data introduces a heightened risk of errors and uncertainty. It\u2019s no wonder data leaders are scrambling to purchase solutions and build teams that both empower smarter decision making and manage data\u2019s inherent complexities.", "But I think it\u2019s worth asking ourselves a slightly different question. Instead, consider: \u201cwhat is required for our organization to make the best use of \u2014 and trust \u2014 our data?\u201d", "It\u2019s a scary prospect to make decisions with data you can\u2019t trust, and yet it\u2019s an all-too-common practice of even the most competent and experienced data teams. Many teams first look to data quality as an anecdote for data health and reliability. We like to say \u201cgarbage in, garbage out.\u201d It\u2019s a true statement \u2014 but in today\u2019s world, is that sufficient?", "Businesses spend time, money, and resources buying solutions and building teams to manage all this infrastructure with the pipe(line) dream of one day being a well-oiled, data-driven machine \u2014 but data issues can occur at any stage of the pipeline, from ingestion to insights. And simple row counts, ad hoc scripts, and even standard data quality conventions at ingestion just won\u2019t cut it.", "One data leader I spoke with at a major transportation company told me that, on average, it took his team of 45 engineers and analysts 140 hours per week to manually check for data issues in their pipelines. Even if you have a data team of 10 people, that\u2019s five whole days that could have spent on revenue-generating activities.", "No amount of fancy tools, well-trained engineers, and executive buy-in can prevent bad data from breaking your pipelines. While organizations invest so much in building great infrastructure, they often find themselves at a loss when it comes to the integrity of the system overall, or: data downtime.", "Data downtime, in other words, moments where your data is missing, erroneous, or otherwise compromised, is both your data ecosystem\u2019s biggest pain point and the key to fully understanding your data quality. Data downtime can lead to wasted time, poor decision making, and, perhaps most significantly, loss of revenue and customer trust.", "It doesn\u2019t matter how advanced your tooling is if you don\u2019t track data downtime. (To help my customers tackle this issue, I created a simple KPI that measures data downtime as a function of better understanding the reliability of your data.)", "While gut-based decision making is useful at times, it\u2019s my firm belief that using bad or broken data is worse than having no data at all.", "There are a lot of solutions that market themselves as a magic box, effortlessly consuming raw data to spit out actionable insights, but in my opinion, \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cmagic\u201d are two terms that should never be in the same sentence (okay, maybe only in some cases\u2026). Instead, it\u2019s important to think of data as something that should be frequently tracked and monitored as part of a \u201cpane of glass\u201d approach to data management.", "To unlock the true value of your data, we need to go beyond data quality. We need to ensure our data is reliable and trustworthy wherever it is. And the only way to get there is by creating observability \u2014 all the way from source to consumption. Data observability, an organization\u2019s ability to fully understand the health of the data in their system, eliminates this perception of magic by applying best practices of DevOps to data pipelines.", "And yes, data can be \u201cbad\u201d for a million different reasons. But in my experience, by focusing on the 5 pillars of data observability \u2014 freshness, volume, schema, distribution, and lineage \u2014 you can not only proactively find the issues in your data, but actually prevent them from occurring in the first place. (Check out my recent article on data observability for some actionable tactics, as well as a more thorough explanation of these 5 pillars.)", "Data observability may not tell you which fancy new data tools to buy next, but it can save you from making bad (and potentially costly) decisions with your data.", "Got bad data?
