Go win all those jobs!", "And while you look around for that crazy paying job with exciting challenges each day, this little guide on what to put to your resume might become a little handy.", "Writing a resume for an internship or job application is rarely fun. Cringing through a job application deadline when you finally start to put things together, you realize it more over the place then on a single page. The majority of the onus lies to get all the right things on your one-page resume. When a resume is often the first layer of the application process in the job, getting past this gatekeeper and reach the recruiter or hiring manager is burdensome but important.", "When I went to Grace Hopper Celebration this year, two months back, I met about 100+ recruiters discussing my resume and how good or okay I was standing at that point, how could I get better on my profile. In all that crazy frenzy, I was fortunate to have a long insightful discussion with a lady at Disney Animation who suggested some edits and tweaks on my resume and it actually helped me better convey my endeavors!

Recently, I had an interview where the interviewer directed the entire interview on all my past endeavors in all-depth. No coding questions, no pseudo codes to write, pure resume discussion!", "We\u2019ve all been told that looks don\u2019t matter as much as substance, but in the case of your resume, this just isn\u2019t true. The ideal resume design is clean, and uncluttered, with effective and strategic use of white space. Remember that your resume is your marketing tool. It\u2019s the first impression a potential employer has of you.", "Sometimes, I see some resumes and as a reader, there is too much information to grasp that sometimes you tend to get lost in the sea of erudition and deviate from what is important.", "To succeed in unique resume design, create your resume and support it with creative resume templates from free sites such as Novoresume, Zety, Creddle, Canva, VisualCV, CVMKR, SlashCV, or even a Google Doc resume template.", "Data is a field spread across multiple disciplines, say healthcare, finance, food and beverages, clothing, technology, movies, e-commerce, songs, and even Netflix! People working with data need a tint of every skill of the fields they work in.", "Perhaps the most prominent skill for a data expert is to be able to analyze information.", "An average day of a data person, she might be developing an algorithm or training a model, analyze data to learn about scientific processes, visualize market trends, and handle risk management statistics. They have to be able to comprehend patterns and trends and have an idea of what all those patterns mean. All of this takes strong statistical, analytical, mathematical, programming, reporting skills, and more.", "Your resume should atleast have the range of skills listed below, not limited to or necessarily this.", "Databases: SQL Server, MySQL, NoSQL, Oracle DB2, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CouchDB, Hadoop", "Visualization Tools: Tableau, PowerBI, MS Excel, MATLAB, Octave", "When I talk to the recruiters about what they ideally expect on a good candidate's resume project section, the common answer to that would be :", "I want to hear about a project they\u2019ve worked on recently. I ask them about how the project started, how they determined it was worth their time and effort, their process, and their results. I also ask them about what they learned from the project. Why did they choose that particular project?", "The recruiters gain a lot of from answers to this question: if they can tell a narrative, how the problem related to the bigger picture, and how they tackled the hard work of doing something.", "Put the projects that on your resume that are MOST relevant to the position you are applying. For instance, I am a FinTech enthusiast and have worked on about three projects surrounding finance terms. Now, when I interview for a financial firm, I make sure one of those three visualization projects gets placed on my resume.", "Next, if I apply for a healthcare firm, I would put a visualization project that talks about results on policy claims or life expectancy ratios and such.", "When you\u2019re looking for something extra to spice up your resume, licenses and certifications are a thing. Do list all relevant coursework that is applicable for the job description. Certifications are often believed to be a test standard for your current skills.", "Do not confuse certification with an online course though. An online course is synonymous to a college class that might not necessarily indicate that you are good at a particular skill. Certification can be a Google Cloud Developer, Google Data Engineer, IBM Data Science Professional and such.", "Almost every profession has certifications you can get. Whether you work for Starbucks or Microsoft or Target, resume certifications stays a long way with you to prove that you\u2019ve got the skills and knowledge.", "If you haven\u2019t already, MOOCs can be a good consideration.

For Data people, Data Camp and Coursera have some really cool things to offer!", "NOTE: If your certification has an expiration date, you\u2019ll need to add that as well. Don\u2019t list certifications on a resume that have expired.", "This is a non-compulsory section but can do wonders for people who have things to fill in here.", "When a recruiter sees my resume, I make sure the person reads through my awards and recognition. When you have achieved an exemplary feat in your professional career, be sure to list that down. However, make that a heading only if it cannot be mentioned as part of your education or employment history.", "I would not encourage adding First Prize Winner in a hackathon. That\u2019s completely not necessary. List only the achievements in a separate section if they\u2019re notable enough and IMPRESSIVE. Your entire resume should be about your achievements, not only one of its sections. Always try to include achievements together with your work history, education, or even hobbies. But if need be to add an awards section, be very specific when listing your achievements.", "With these six bullet points that I have learned over time from the recruiters, my resume definitely has improved its appearance, its performance and my confidence when I give my resume out. Strangely, your resume will be a huge validation when you get an interview call from THAT resume you\u2019ve worked on with sheer dedication.", "Thank you for reading!
