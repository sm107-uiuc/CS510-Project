So around 2 years back Intel released OpenVINO toolkit for optimizing inference of Deep Learning models on Intel\u2019s hardware.", "To know all basics around OpenVINO, Ihave divided this post into 3 sections and depending on your interest you can switch to any one of the below:", "Intel\u2019s Open Visual Inference and Neural network Optimization (OpenVINO) toolkit enables the vision application (or any other DNN) to run faster on Intel\u2019s Processors/ Hardware.", "The OpenVINO\u2122 toolkit is a comprehensive toolkit for quickly developing applications and solutions that emulate human vision. Based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the toolkit extends CV workloads across Intel\u00ae hardware, maximizing performance.- https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/", "To put it straight, an attempt by Intel to sell their underlying processors (CPUs, iGPUs, VPUs, Gaussian & Neural Accelerators, and FPGAs) for making your AI (vision) Applications run faster.", "This is not a toolkit for faster training of your Deep Learning task, but for faster inference of your already trained Deep Neural model.", "The tool main components of OpenVINO toolkit are", "For complete details on the toolkit, check this.", "The task of the Model optimizer (a .py file for individual frameworks) is to take a already trained DL model and adjust it for optimal execution for the target device. The output of Model Optimizer is the Intermediate Representation (IR) of your DL Model.", "The IR is set of 2 file which describes the Optimized version of your DL model", "The output of Model Optimizer (IR files), is what we must pass to Inference Engine, which runs it on your hardware.", "So to make best use of your Intel Hardware for your ML (Edge, cloud \u2026) applications running in production, all you need to do is, generate the IR files of your DL model and run it on the Inference Engine rather than directly running it over the hardware.", "As mentioned above a lot of Edge/ Cloud applications are already using more advanced Intel hardware/ processors/ architectures.", "So one of the most important reason why one would want to shift to OpenVINO is to make best use of the underlying Intel Hardware.", "Apart from this I have seen a lot of Application Development teams shifting to OpenVINO just for Intel\u2019s already optimized Pretrained models for their Edge Applications", "So all you are required to do is, download the IR files for one of the pretrained model and just use it with Inference engine for your end application.", "The main disadvantage for such pretrained models is when required, re-training these models with your costume data is not always easy, as not everything is well documented around re-training/ fine-tunning for all provided models.", "And if you are thinking to use one of the TF model Zoo (or similar for other DL frameworks) or building/ train your own custom Tensorflow (or PyTorch etc..) models and expect that it would be easy (or even possible every time) to convert it to the required IR files, that would not be the case always.", "So it becomes really important while deciding to port any of your applications to OpenVINO to do a quick check of below points:", "As you long as you are good with both the points above, you should be fine choosing OpenVINO for your DL Application, but if not, you might want to reassess your decision.", "The best way to understand how OpenVINO works is to build, train & Infer your own toy Deep Learning model onto the same. Remember OpenVINO would come in the picture only after we have saved our DL model.", "So lets build a toy Linear regression problem we want to solve, decide an DL framework we want to try, I am picking PyTorch for this post but feel free to get the TensorFlow version of the same.", "Let\u2019s generate sample data for the same", "Let\u2019s build a quick neural network for the solving the above Regression problem.", "Let\u2019s train our neural network model", "Check the prediction outputs of your PyTorch model before saving and using it with OpenVINO", "Now let\u2019s first save your pyTorch model so that we can get IR files for the model using model optimizer later.", "Now this is where we would need OpenVINO", "So before we go to next step, we would need to install the OpenVINO toolkit.", "Once you have installed the toolKit, let\u2019s convert the saved PyTorch model to the IR files", "Now once we have the IR files, the final step is to RUN our NN model on OpenVINO Inference Engine", "Note: Though the demo below was run on my laptop with Intel CPU, you could update the device as per your target hardware.", "If you need to look at the sample code, check the repo below:", "Your home for data science.
