One can get intimidated by this definition, or even worse, bored, but ever since I started discovering the Markov processes both in math and statistical modeling, I had nothing but fun. In this post I will try to explain the Markov process using an example and give some funny sentences that were produced by a natural language generator that uses Markov chains.", "Once upon a time in a magical kingdom lived a Queen. She was smart, powerful, but unpopular. Her kingdom was large, but only 20% of her people supported her and her politics, 80% of her subjects didn\u2019t like or support the Queen. But, as I said, the Queen was smart, so she decided to take actions. She went to the Magical Forest where lived a Forest Witch, who could see the future and make potions to alter it. The Queen brought gold and diamonds, and said to the Witch: \u201cHelp me, powerful sorceress. Only 20% of my subjects respect and support me. I need a potion that will make more people love me\u201d. The Witch didn\u2019t say a word, left the room, and an hour later returned with a potion. She said \u201cHere. Take this and it will help you. My crystal ball showed me that after you take this potion 90% of your supporters will stay with you and 70% of those who didn\u2019t support you, will from now on.\u201d", "According to the Queen, here is what the situation looks like:", "And according to the Witch, the situation after taking the potion will look like this:", "From this diagram, we can compute a transition state probability matrix:", "And since we remember how the initial situation looks like:", "We can now perform matrix multiplication to compute the number of the Queen\u2019s followers after she takes the magic potion:", "Jumping from only 20% to 74%\u2026 This witch deserves a lot of gold!", "As we can see from the math given in the example above, Markov process is used to compute the probability of one event following another. If the Witch has a crystal ball to tell her what will happen after the Queen takes her potion, we have math and code to compute the probabilities. This process is extremely useful and can be applied to a lot of things. One of my favorite applications of the Markov process is Natural Language Generators.", "When working with text data and using advanced NLP techniques, why not try to have some fun? By using the Markov process, a model can train on the entire text dataset and compute the probabilities of one word following another. The simplest example of it would be suggestions in text messages: when you type \u2018my\u2019, it will offer \u2018friends\u2019, \u2018parents\u2019, \u2018dog\u2019, etc., because this is how our natural language works. NLG\u2019s are never perfect, which makes them so fun to work with. Sometimes they give you meaningful suggestions, but other times not, and I personally find it very amusing.", "Here are some reviews generated by NLG after training on user reviews from Sephora.com:", "And here are some recipes (training on recipes from BBC Food and Allrecipes):", "Finally, check out a song written after training on Taylor Swift\u2019s lyrics:", "The code is pretty simple.
