I think this is awesome and it\u2019s this type of content that helped me immensely on my journey to data scientist and still helps me today as I continue to learn and grow.", "But as the amount of these posts grows larger, it requires a bit more work on the part of the reader to seek out, sift through, and process all of the available information. This post is designed to make it a little easier for aspiring data scientists to find all of the excellent advice out there from experts in the field. The majority of the ideas below are condensed from the following 6 posts that I found especially helpful:", "First, I went through each article and plucked out each individual insight or piece of advice. Then I looked over the list of ideas and made note of any common themes among the different resources, seen below. Later on in this post, I include all of the other pieces of advice that stood alone. Let\u2019s get to it.", "As mentioned previously, here are the ideas that were repeated among several of the articles linked above. For each point, I\u2019ll include a bit of commentary from myself to go along with it.", "This was probably the most popular theme of them all. The importance of communication in data science is often harped on, and for good reason. Sifting through data to find insights is useless if you can\u2019t communicate those insights and drive impact in some way. Like anything else, effective communication is a skill that you can practice and improve on with time.", "Whether it\u2019s data analytics, machine learning, running experiments, or something more esoteric, you can\u2019t avoid the use of statistics. Taking the time to build a solid foundation and master fundamental statistics concepts will pay itself off over and over again.", "As data scientists, we make assumptions constantly, whether we know it or not. These assumptions might be related to the data we\u2019re working with or the problem that we\u2019re trying to tackle, but they need to be questioned. By keeping some level of paranoia about our outputs, we ensure that we\u2019re on the right track. This skill is often associated with exploratory, research-oriented work, but it\u2019s much more applicable than you think.", "Similar to the last point, it also pays to be curious. Curiosity can lead you to interesting insights that you would never have found otherwise. It drives you to adopt a growth mindset and ask questions constantly \u2014 questions that will help you learn and grow as much as the work itself.", "This is a big one for me. Early on in my career, I learned about the benefits of putting your work out into the world. Whether it\u2019s through blog posts, projects, tweets, or something else \u2014 it doesn\u2019t really matter. What matters is that you are putting something out there. The tweet below pretty much sums up my stance on this:", "When working on learning projects, make sure you\u2019re interested in the topic. This seems pretty straightforward, but plenty of aspiring data scientists get caught up trying to produce the project that seems the most complex or impressive to would-be employees and colleagues. Stick to what you enjoy and use real-world data instead of super-clean Kaggle or UCI datasets. For bonus points, collect some data and build your own dataset.", "It\u2019s clear that data science is a broad, complex field. You could spend your whole working life practicing it and not even skim the surface. There\u2019s always going to be another technique to master, another tool to learn, and another paper to read. This is why imposter syndrome is so relevant in the field. I find this to be frustrating and exciting all at once.", "Along the same lines, just because you can\u2019t master every tool out there doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t master some of them. There will probably be a couple of building blocks that you spend most of your day working with. That might be R, SQL, Vim, Airflow, Scikit-learn, anything really. It doesn\u2019t matter as long as you hone in on your critical tools and learn them well.", "These are the ideas that I didn\u2019t find in more than one of the linked posts. You\u2019ll find equally useful and interesting information here, some more specialized than the common themes from before.", "Along with the primary articles that I used to compile this list, there are a million other great blog posts for aspiring data scientists to utilize. These posts below also helped inform some of the key points listed above.", "For more information on any of the bulleted points above, be sure to explore the awesome resources that I linked to throughout this post.", "The journey to data scientist isn\u2019t an easy one. Starting out as a data scientist is no different. But the beauty of information sharing makes things that much easier. It lets us learn from those that came before us. I think that\u2019s a pretty cool thing. Pass it on and enjoy the ride.", "Thanks for reading!
