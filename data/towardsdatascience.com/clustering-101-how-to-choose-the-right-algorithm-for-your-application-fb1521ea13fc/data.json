These algorithms are quite well-known among data scientists regardless of their application scope or research topic.", "Whenever you\u2019re working on a data science project, the chances are you will \u2014 at some point, to some extent \u2014 use various clustering techniques to either prepare your data for further analysis or whether initial insights from the data.", "Clustering techniques can be convenient in preparing and organizing unstructured and unclassified data for further analysis. The reason behind such algorithms' fame is that they provide a simple and fast approach to perform an initial analysis of the data and gain valuable insights into the nature of that data.", "Often, clustering is not meant to be a stand-alone solution to whatever problem you\u2019re trying to solve, rather an essential first step towards finding the answers you seek. This article will address the top 5 most commonly used clustering algorithms, definitions, and optimal use cases.", "In general, a cluster is a group of data that share some common properties. So, clustering algorithms are techniques that are followed to divide a big dataset into smaller clusters. Clustering is considered a form of unsupervised learning.", "When clustering a dataset, items within the same cluster are often close to each other in distance, while items from different clusters are distant from each other.", "There are various types of clustering algorithms; the top 5 ones are partition-based algorithms, hierarchy-based algorithms, fuzzy theory-based algorithms, distribution-based algorithms, and density-based algorithms.", "Partition-based algorithms \u2014 aka, centroid-based clustering \u2014 are a group of clustering algorithms that divide data into non-hierarchical clusters. The idea behind this type of clustering algorithms is to consider the centers in the dataset as the centers of the clusters.", "The most well-known algorithms of this type are the k-means and k-medoids algorithms. K-medoids is the discrete version of the K-means algorithm. Other kinds of partition-based clustering algorithms are CLARA, PAM, and CLARANS.", "The partition-based clustering algorithms are best used with categorical data \u2014 for example, grouping the data based on gender, age group, or education level. Moreover, most partition-based algorithms are simple, fast, and highly scalable. The down-side to these algorithms is that their performance depends on the initial number of centroids and the outliers in a dataset.", "Hierarchy-based clustering algorithms work by creating a tree of clusters. That is done by constructing a hierarchical relation between the different data points. So, in the beginning, each data [point in the dataset is its own cluster, and then, every two close clusters are merged together to form a new cluster until one cluster remains.", "Examples of such types of algorithms are ROCK, CURE, and Chameleon. These types of algorithms have many applications in classification and R&D.", "Needless to say, you can use hierarchical clustering if your data is hierarchical. It is also good to use when your dataset is randomized. You can use hierarchical clustering to classify elements \u2014 such as animals, products, research topic, etc.", "Unlike partition-based algorithms, a hierarchy-based algorithm doesn\u2019t need a fixed number of clusters. The algorithms will produce a visual representation of the resultant clusters for better interpretation and understanding.", "In fuzzy algorithms, some data points are assigned to specific clusters based on their level of belonging. This level of belonging is obtained using discrete values of {0->belong,1->doesn\u2019t belong} that are then changed to continuous values with the interval [0,1] to describe the belonging relationship more accurately.", "Examples of such algorithms are FCS, FCM, and MM algorithms.", "Fuzzy theory-based algorithms are well suited for application that requires multiple clusters for the same data point. For example, it can be used in marketing to cluster the preferences and shopping patterns of clients more realistically and help create a more personalized shopping experience.", "In distribution-based algorithms, the same cluster's data points need to belong to the same probability distribution. The most commonly used distribution is Gaussian distribution. For example, one application can divide the dataset into various Gaussian distributions; each has its own properties.", "One of the most important things you need to know is the type of distribution of your data. If you don\u2019t know it, you will need to try various distribution and choose the one that matches your data best. Examples of such algorithms are DBCLASD and GMM.", "Distribution-based clustering can be used to mine large datasets and produces complex models for clusters. Doing so reveals the correlation and dependence between the different data points.", "In density-based clustering, algorithms form the different clusters based on the data region's density at any given location. Using this approach, arbitrary-shaped distributions are formed in dense areas of the data. These types of algorithms struggle with data of varying densities or data with high dimensionality.", "The two well-known algorithms of this type are DBSCAN and OPTICS. Such algorithms are used in applications such as contact tracing for infectious diseases.", "These algorithms can analyze data and make predictions and hence can be used in various applications, such as contact tracing, marketing strategies development.", "Density-based clustering is also a good choice if your data contains noise or your resulted cluster can be of arbitrary shapes. Moreover, these types of algorithms can deal with dataset outliers more efficiently than the other types of algorithms.", "Clustering algorithms are probably the most known and used type of machine learning algorithms. These types of algorithms are considered one of the essential first steps in any data science project dealing with unstructured and unclassified datasets \u2014 which is almost always the case.", "This article went through the top 5 types of traditional clustering algorithms and when to use them.", "Other, more modern clustering algorithms exist, but none that can replace the traditional ones. Perhaps the biggest concern when dealing with clustering algorithms, especially for new data scientists, is answering the most important question, \u201cwhich algorithm fits my data best?\u201d.", "To answer that question, we need to consider the algorithm, the data we are using, and the application being built. Taking all that into account, you will be able to choose a clustering algorithm that will make your analysis work fast and efficient.", "As always, remember that in data science, it\u2019s always about the data. So, listen to what your data is trying to tell you.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Ph.D. candidate working on Quantum Computing.
