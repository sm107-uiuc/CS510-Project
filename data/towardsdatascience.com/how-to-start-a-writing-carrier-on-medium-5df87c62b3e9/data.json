As an Artificial Intelligence enthusiast, I sent my blog posts to a publication called Towards Data Science (TDS) which has about 280k followers at the moment. This story is a summary of my analytic thoughts after one month and 6 stories.", "In the last month, I published 6 stories in TDS in the field of Natural Language Processing. My stories involved around BERT and Machine Translation. In total, I have more than 12k views, 5k reads and 100 fans. Hopefully, this story can be a guide to someone thinking about starting a writing carrier on Medium.", "First of all, I\u2019d like to talk about my motivations. I started writing these stories as a summary of my experiences. I was investigating new fields of science and I wanted to save my first impression of it. Like a diary. However, I wanted to share it so everyone new to the field can benefit from it.", "At the end of the first month, I noticed that I can use my stories as help during my everyday work. To have a good Medium story I have polished the experiments to be a readable, understandable tool I can turn back for if I need it.", "I have a second line of motivations too: as a non-native English speaker, I found writing as a great practice to keep my language skills sharp. As an early-career science enthusiast, I think that writing Medium stories is a great practice for writing science papers as well as a good way to gain more acknowledgement in the field.", "I was curious about the Medium Partner Program as well. Is it possible to make a living out of it? As the first results of it came out I became aware of that my motivations started to shift from \u2018writing a good story\u2019 to \u2018writing a well-paying story\u2019. The most noticeable effect of it was that I feel the pressure of writing every day instead of the joy of sharing my knowledge. Currently, I consciously stop writing if I feel that my main motivation is wrong at that moment.", "Medium offers statistics about the distribution of your readers. You can understand whom and how did your stories reach. Based on this, I separate the story\u2019s life into three main stages.", "Early viewers are your friends whom you send your story, your followers and the publication\u2019s editors. They are the potential first fans and they can correct the obvious mistakes in your story.", "Social media shares are from your Twitter / Facebook / LinkedIn / etc. shares as well as from your early viewers\u2019 shares. For all my stories, some random twitter users whom I don\u2019t know share it resulting in 10\u201320 views. (Thank you very much!)", "Medium and publication distribution: These first two stages are very important regarding the third one. Both the Medium curators and the publication\u2019s editors have a choice to share your article somewhere on the website. I don\u2019t know the actual process behind these decisions but I assume that the early views, claps of the story are important. Of course, the most important part is the quality of the story!", "The raw stats of my stories is that all my stories published in TDS are selected for distribution by Medium curators. According to other stories (like this), this is a great achievement. Regarding TDS distribution, one important step for me is when TDS share the story on their Twitter (which has 25k followers). This happened with half my stories and I couldn\u2019t figure out the pattern here.", "Android app & Google Chrome Suggestions: These are the big numbers! To earn a good place in the Android app or the Chrome Suggestions, the story has to perform well in the previous stages. Medium suits to Chrome Suggestions so there are a lot of Medium articles in the Chrome Suggestions. However, to earn these places, you have to write about something hot, something people wants to read at the moment.", "Afterlife: Medium stories are news. They have a 3-day peak at the start but vanishes after it. For a story that received 100 views in the first day, it has 10 views per day after the first week. A 500 views peak story has 20\u201340 views and a story with 2000 views in the first day has 300 views after the first week. The correlation is obvious. However, it was surprising for me that after the first week, these numbers are quite steady. I expect a slow decrease over the months but this is only an assumption as my first article in TDS is only a month old. So far, I can\u2019t see this trend in my stories.", "One way to increase the views in the afterlife is to add a title for the story that suits well with Google Search. For example, I have a story called Simple BERT using TensorFlow 2.0, it has the name of two hot topics in the title (BERT and TensorFlow) and a good Google Search keyword (simple). If I\u2019ve been more thoughtful naming it, I\u2019d probably add the keyword example in the title as well.", "If you are interested in the topic, you can find a lot of articles about how to be a good writer on Medium. Here, I\u2019ll add my list suggestions.", "Native English speakers might not be aware of the handicap they have but if you use English as your second language you probably had moments in your life when you thought that \u2018it would be much easier in English\u2019. Yes, writing is easier in English. Even if it is not my native language. Assuming I wrote a story in Hungarian and it has 100 views, with the same rates an English-written story would have 20,000 views! (Estimates on English users based on this article.)", "I don\u2019t want to write much about quality. Yes, quality matters. A lot. Read quality papers, write carefully, use tools and listen to your reader, editors. You\u2019ll improve.", "The importance of consistency is something I predicted to be smaller but I had to correct myself after this first month. I already mentioned that the daily views of my older stories are relatively constant. The daily income of these stories is similar. If you wrote 4 articles that make $0.5 a day, you earn $2 a day. If you wrote 40 articles, it\u2019s $20.", "Also, writing a new story can boost the older ones as well, because if you wrote a good article, your readers might wonder if you have other great articles as well.", "If you are planning to write on Medium, you are probably aware of the existence of publications. Find quality publications and they\u2019ll help you write better articles and improve your view stats. Because of Towards Data Science, my stories are selected to distribution by Medium curators and are prefered by Chrome Suggestions.", "My last bullet point is something I call best selling keywords. There are always topics that are hot, words readers search for. Your interest is not always the same as the interest of the majority of your readers. But sometimes it is. And if you find the right terms for it and put it in the title of your article, it can boost your views. But don\u2019t write an article about something, you are not genuinely interested in. Even if you make a living out of writing, find the topics that are well suited for you!", "At the beginning of November, Medium changed to a read-based payment method and they upgraded the statistics of the stories. Here is an analysis of this new feature based on my stories\u2019 performance.", "First of all, we have a new overall measurement for the stories, called average reading time. And it is always between 30 and 50 sec for me. I assume that it includes the viewers who clicked on my article but closed it after realising the story is under the paywall. And the ones who just scroll through of it. Medium estimates a 3\u20138 minutes reading time based on the length of the articles. Well, not everyone read it thoughtfully.", "To the daily views of a story, we got two new daily stats: daily earnings and daily member reading time. The earnings of a story are based on the member reading time. For every Medium member, his/her membership $5 is distributed to the writers of the articles he read weighted by the reading time he/she spent on the articles.", "The image below is the data extracted from 3 of my stories. One of them has a total of 600 views, the other one of 1800 and the last one of 7000 views. All data is from the first days of the new era (Oct. 28 \u2014 Nov. 15). From this, we can calculate that I earn an average of $0.04 per minute my readers read.", "This story is a summary of my experience as a Medium writer. I write Data Science articles in the publication Towards Data Science (more specifically Natural Language Processing related stories). I published my first article on the 14th of October and this post analyses the first month. I wrote 6 articles since and have a total of 12k views, 5k reads and 100 fans. I earned $91.47 so far in the Medium Partner Program.", "Your home for data science.
