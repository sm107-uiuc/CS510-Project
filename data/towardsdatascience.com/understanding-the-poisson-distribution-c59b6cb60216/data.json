And I try to keep it more intuitive by using some concrete example cases.", "Before looking into details of something, it is nice to have an idea of what that something is useful for. The Poisson Distribution is typically described as a discrete probability distribution. It tells you the probability of discrete number of events in a timeframe, such as 1 event, or 2 events, or 3 events, \u2026 Not 1.1 events, or 2.7 events, or any other fractional events. Whole events only. This is why it is called discrete.", "Some example uses for the Poisson distribution include estimating the number of:", "One typical use of these estimates would be as input to capacity planning (e.g., call center staffing or hardware provisioning).", "Besides events over time, the Poisson distribution can also be used to estimate instances in an area, volume, or over a distance. I will present some examples of these different application types in the following sections. For further ideas and examples of its application, there is a nice Quora question/answers.", "Let\u2019s start by looking at what the Poisson distribution is, and how to calculate it.", "A process that produces values conforming to a Poisson Distribution is called a Poisson Process. Such a process, and thus the resulting Poisson Distribution, is expected to have the following properties:", "The following figure/line illustrates a Poisson Process:", "The dots in the above figure illustrate events occurring. The x-axis illustrates time passing. The units of time (on the x-axis here) could be any units of time, such as seconds, minutes, hours, or days. They could even be other types of units, such as distance. The Poisson distribution / process does not really care about the unit of measurement, only that the properties of the distribution are met. I generated the above figure using a random process that would generate values between 1\u201310, with an average value of 5. In practice, I used the Python random module to generate the numbers.", "As I said, the time unit could be anything, but for clarity of example I will use seconds. To calculate the Poisson distribution, we really only need to know the average number of events in the timeframe of interest.

Now assume we want to know the probability of getting exactly 18 events in a timeframe of 100 seconds (as in the figure).", "In this process, the average number of events would be 100/5 = 20.

Thus on average we have 100/5 = 20 events in 100 seconds.", "To answer the question on the probability of having exactly 18 events in a timeframe of 100 seconds, we can plug these numbers into the Poisson distribution formula.

One area that I find is a fitting example here, and where I have experience in seeing the Poisson distribution applied, is system reliability analysis. So I will illustrate the concept here with an example of how to use it to provide assurance of \u201cfive nines\u201d, or 99.999%, reliability in relation to potential component failures.", "There are many possible components in different systems that would fit this example quite nicely. I use storage nodes (disks in good old times) as an example. Say we have a system that needs to have 100 storage nodes running at all times to provide the required level of capacity. We need to provide this capacity with a reliability of 99.999%. We have some metric (maybe from past observations, from manufacturer testing, or something else) to say the storage nodes we use have an average of 1 failure per 100 units in a year.", "Knowing that 1 in 100 storage nodes fails on average during a year does not really give much information on how to achieve 99.999% assurance of having a minimum of 100 nodes up. However, with this information, we can use the Poisson distribution to help find an answer.", "To build this distribution, we just plug in these values into the Poisson formula:", "This results in the following distribution:", "Here \u03bb (avg in the table) is 1, since we have the average number of events at 1. For k (events in the table above), I have simply started at 0, and increased by 1 until I reached the target probability of 99.999%. The Poisson formula with these values is also in the table for each row. Adding up all the probabilities gives us the value of 7 as the number of potential failures until we reach the probability of 99.999% (cumulative in the table).", "So the answer to the original question in this example is to start the year with 107 nodes running to have 99.999% assurance of keeping a minimum of 100 nodes running at all times through the year.

It also assumes that you wouldn\u2019t be exchanging broken nodes as they fail. But this is intended as a Poisson analysis example, and one can always finetune the process based on the results and exact requirements.", "For those interested, some further examples of such applications in reliability analysis are available on the internet. Just search for something like poisson distribution reliability engineering.", "Now that we have the basic definitions, and a concrete example, let\u2019s look at what the distribution generally looks like. With the same parameters, the Poisson distribution is always the same, regardless of the unit of time or space used. Using an average number of events 1/minute or 1/hour, the distribution itself is the same. Just the time-frame changes. Similarly, looking at an average of instances per area of 10/m\u00b2 or 10/cm\u00b2 will have the same distribution, just over a different area.", "Here I will plot how the distribution evolves as the \u03bb (average number of events in timeframe or area) is changed. I use a varying number of events k in each case up until the probability given by the Poisson distribution is very small. I use discrete (whole) number for the \u03bb, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, although the average can have continuous values (0.1 would be fine for \u03bb). Let\u2019s start with \u03bb of 0:", "The above figure shows the Poisson distribution for an average of 0 events (\u03bb). If you think about it for a moment, the average number of events can only be 0 if the the number of events is always 0. This is what the above figure and table show. With an average of 0 events, the number of events is always 0.", "A bit more interesting, the above figure with an average of 1 events (\u03bb) in the time interval shows a bigger spread of probable number of events. This distribution is already familiar from the reliability estimation example I showed, as it had \u03bb of 1. Here the number of events (k) can be both 0 or 1 equally often (about 36.8%), after which the probability quickly goes down for larger number of events (k). The average of 1 is balanced by the large probability of 0\u2019s and smaller probability of the larger numbers for k.", "Here, with figure with an average of 2 events (\u03bb) in the interval, we see some trends with the increase of the average number of events (\u03bb) as compared to the distributions with \u03bb of 0 and 1. As \u03bb increases, the center of the distribution shifts right, the distribution spreads wider apart (x-axis becomes broader), and the percentage of single values becomes smaller (y-axis is shorter). So there are more values for k, each one individually having smaller probabilities but summing to 1 in the end.", "The distributions for \u03bb=3,4, and 5 show how these trends continue. The average value itself (here k=3) has the highest probability, but with the value right below it (here k=2) closely (or equally) matching in probability. And the center shifting right, with the spread getting broader.:", "To save some space, and to illustrate the Poisson distribution evolution as the average number of events (\u03bb) rises further, I animated it over different \u03bb values from 0 to 50:", "As I noted before, the average (\u03bb) does not need to be discrete, even if these examples I use here are. You cannot have 0.1 failures, but you can have on average 0.1 failures.", "With the above animated Poisson distribution going from 0 to 50 values for \u03bb, the same trends as before are again more pronounced \u2014 As the average number of events (\u03bb) rises,", "That sums up my basic exploration of the Poisson distribution.", "As I noted, I find concrete examples tend to make things easier to understand. I already presented the example from reliability engineering, which I think makes a great example of the Poisson distribution as it seems like such an obvious fit. And useful too.", "However, sometimes the real world is not so clear on all the assumptions on applying the Poisson distribution. With this in mind, I will try something a bit more ambiguous next. Because it is winter now (where I live it is), I use falling snowflakes as an example to illustrate this problem. When I say snowflakes falling, I mean when the flakes hit the ground, on a specific area.", "Assume we know the average rate of snowflakes falling in an hour (on the selected area) is 100, and we want to know the probability of 90 snowflakes falling. Using the Poisson distribution formula defined earlier in this article, we get the following:", "Putting these into the Poisson formula, we get:", "Which translates to about 2.5% probability of 90 snowflakes falling in an hour (the given time-frame), on the given area.", "To calculate the broader Poisson probability distribution for different number of snowflakes, we can, again, simply run the Poisson formula using different values for k. Remember, k here stands for the number of events to find the probability for. In this case the events are the snowflakes falling. Looping k with values from 75 to 125 gives the following distribution:", "Sorry for the small text in the image. The bottom shows the ticks for x-axis as the numbers from 75 to 125. These are the values k that I looped for this example. The bars in the figure denote the probability of each number of snowflakes (running the Poisson formula with the value k). The numbers on top of the bars are the probabilities for each number of snowflakes falling, given the average of 100 snowflakes in the interval (\u03bb). As usual, the Poisson distribution always peaks at the average point (\u03bb, here 100). The probability at the highest point (k=100) here is only about 4% due to wide spread of the probabilities in this distribution.", "So as long as we meet the earlier defined requirements for applying the Poisson distribution:", "As long as these hold, we can say that there is a 4% chance of 100 snowflakes, when the average number of observed snowflakes ( \u03bb) in the timeframe is 100. And about 2.5% chance of observing 90 snowflakes (k=90) in a similar case. And so on, according to the distribution visualized above.", "Let\u2019s look at the Poisson distribution requirements here:", "I considered a few times whether to use snowflakes as an example, since this list actually goes from the first item obviously being true, to the next one slightly debatable, the third more so, and the final one quite obviously not going to hold always. But everyone likes to talk about the weather, so why not.", "So if we take the first argument above as true, and the following ones at different degrees of debatable, lets look at the points 2\u20134 from the above list.", "2: Are falling snowflakes independent? I am not an in-depth expert on the physics of snowflakes or their falling patterns. However, 100 snowflakes on an area in an hour is not much, and I believe the independence of the snowflakes is a safe assumption here. But in different cases, it is always good to consider this more deeply as well (e.g., people tending to cluster in groups).", "3: How likely is it that two snowflakes hit the ground at the exact same moment? Depends. If we reduce the time frame of what you consider \u201cthe same time\u201d enough, there are very few real-world events that would occur at the exact same moment. And if this was a problem, there would be practically very few, if any, cases where the Poisson distribution would apply. There is almost always the theoretical possibility of simultaneous events, even if incredibly small. But it is very unlikely here. So I would classify this as not a problem to make this assumption. I believe this kind of relaxed assumption is quite common to make (e.g., we could say in the reliability example, there is an incredibly small chance of simultaneous failure).", "4: The average number of falling snowflakes being consistent is of course not true over a longer period of time. It is not always snowing, and sometimes there is a bigger storm, other times just a minor dribble. To address this, we can consider the problem differently, as the number of snowflakes falling on a specific area in a smaller interval, such as 1 minute. The number of snowflakes should be more constant at least for the duration of several minutes (or as long as the snowstorm maintains a reasonably steady state). Maybe it would be more meaningful to discuss the distributions of different levels of storms in different stages?", "The fourth point, the change over time, highlights an issue that is relevant to many example applications of the Poisson distribution. The rate of something is not always constant, and thus the time factor may need special consideration. I even found a term for it when I was looking for information on this on the internet: time-varying poisson distribution. And as highlighted by the third point above, some other considerations may also need to be slightly relaxed, while the result can still be useful, even if not perfect.", "The above snow example was a largely made up problem, but weather is always a nice topic to discuss. Perhaps a more realistic, but very similar, case would be to predict the number of calls you could get in a call center. Just replace snowflakes with calls into the call center.", "As with the snow example, with calls to a call center, over different time periods (depending also on time-zones), the average might vary, producing different distributions. Your distributions over days might also vary. For example, weekends vs holidays vs business days. But if you had, for example, an average of 100 calls during the business hours on business days, your Poisson distribution would look the exact same as the average 100 snowflakes in the snowflake example.", "You could then use this distribution for things like choosing how many people you should hire into the call center to maintain a minimum service level to match your service level agreement. For example, by finding a spot where the cumulative probability of receiving that many calls in an hour is less than 90%, and using it as evidence of being able to provide minimum of 90% service level at all times.", "In such a call center example, you would have other considerations compared to the weather scenario. Including the timezones you serve, business hours, business days, special events, the probability of multiple simultaneous calls, and so on. However, if you think about it for a moment, at the conceptual level these are exactly the same considerations as for the weather example.", "So far, my examples have only described events over timeframes. As I noted in the beginning, sometimes the Poisson distribution can also be used to model number of instances in volumes, or areas, of space.", "Besides events over time, the Poisson distribution can also be used to estimate other types of data. One other example is typically distributions of instances (events) over an area. Imagine the following box to describe a forest, where every dot is a tree:", "A Poisson distribution can similarly represent occurrences of such instances in space as it can represent occurrence of events in time. Imagine now splitting this forest area into a grid of smaller boxes (see my Kaggle kernel for the image generation. This image is from run 31):", "In the above figure, each tree in this is now inside a single smaller box, although the rendering makes it look like the dots on the border of two boxes might belong to two boxes. Now, we can calculate how many trees are in each smaller square:", "This calculation for the image above, gives the following distribution:", "From the calculation, the number of smaller boxes with 0 trees (or dots) is 316, or 79%, of the total 400. Further 17% of the smaller boxes in the grid contain 1 tree (dot), and 4% contain 2 trees (dots).", "Now, we can calculate the Poisson probability distribution for the same data. We have 400 smaller boxes, and 100 trees. This makes the average number of trees in a box 100/400=0.25. This is the average number of instances in the area (similar to timeframe in earlier examples), or \u03bb, for the Poisson formula. The number of events k in this case is the number of instances (of trees). Putting these values into the Poisson formula (k=tree_count, \u03bb=0.25, we get:", "Comparing this Poisson distribution to the actual distribution calculated from the tree grid image above, it is nearly identical. Due to random noise, there is always some deviation. The more we would increase the number of \u201ctrees\u201d in the actual example (randomly generate more), and the number of mini-boxes (smaller area), the closer the actual observations should come to the theoretical numbers calculated by the Poisson formula. This is how randomness generally seems to work, the bigger sets tend to converge to their theoretical target better. But even with the values here it is quite close.", "Besides the forest and the trees, one could use this type of analysis on whatever data is available, when it makes sense. As I read about Poisson distribution, its application to the London bombings in the second world-war (WW2) often comes up. There is a good summary about this on Stack Exchange. And if you read it, you will note that this is exactly the type of analysis that my forest example above showed.", "In this story, the Germans were bombing the British in London, and the British suspected they were targeting some specific locations (bases, ports, etc). To figure if the Germans were really targeting specific targets with insider knowledge, the British divided London into squares and calculated the number of bomb hits in each square. They then calculated the probability of each number of hits in each square, and compared the results to the Poisson distribution. As the result closely matched the Poisson distribution, the British then concluded that the bombings were, in fact, random, and not based on inside-information. Again, this is what would happen if we just replace \u201ctrees\u201d with \u201cbombs\u201d and \u201cforest\u201d with \u201cLondon\u201d in my forest example above.", "Of course, a cunning adversary could account for this by targeting a few high-interest targets, and hiding them in a large number of randomly dropped bombs. But the idea is there, on how the Poisson distribution could be used for this type of analysis as well. Something to note, of course, is that the Stack Exchange post also discusses this as actually being a more suitable problem for a Binomial distribution. Which is closely related to the Poisson distribution (often quite indistinguishable). Let\u2019s see about this in more detail.", "When I read about what is the Poisson distribution and where does it derive from, I often run into the Binomial distribution. The point being, that the binomial distribution comes from the more intuitive notion of single events, and their probabilities. Then some smart people like mr. Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson used this to derive the generalized formula of the Poisson distribution. And now, 200 years later, I can just plug in the numbers. Nice. But I digress. The Binomial distribution formula:", "The above figure shows the general Binomial distribution formula. It has only a few variables:", "We can further split the Binomial formula into different parts:", "I found a good description of the binomial formula, and these parts, on the Math is Fun website. To briefly summarize, the three parts in the above figure correspond to:", "To summarize, it uses the number of possible trial combinations, the probability of a positive outcome, and the probability of a negative outcome to calculate the probability of k positive outcomes. As before, by calculating this formula for the different numbers of k, we can get the Binomial distribution.", "What does any of this have to do with the Poisson distribution? As an example, let\u2019s look at the reliability example from before as a Binomial Distribution instead. We have the following numbers for the reliability example:", "We can convert these into the values needed for the Binomial Distribution:", "Comparing the results, we get the following table:", "In this table, poisson refers to the values calculated with the Poisson formula. binomial100 refers to the values calculated with Binomial formula using parameters n=100 and p=0.01. Similarly, binomial1000 uses n=1000 and p=0.001. As you can see, these are all very close.", "It is generally said, that when p nears 0 and n nears infinity for the Binomial Distribution, you will approximate the Poisson Distribution. Or the other way around. In any case, the idea being that as your interval of sub-trials gets smaller in Binomial, you get closer to the theoretical value calculated by the Poisson Distribution. This is visible in the table as binomial100 is already close to poisson, but binomial1000 is still noticeably closer with a larger n and smaller p.", "The difference between the Binomial and Poisson distribution is a bit elusive. As usual, there is a very nice Stack Exchange question on the topic. I would summarize it as using Poisson when we know the average rate over a timeframe, and the timeframe (or area/volume) can be split into smaller and smaller pieces. Thus the domain of the events is continuous and bordering on infinite trials (as you make the interval smaller and smaller). The Binomial being a good fit if you have a specific, discrete, number of known events and a probability. Like a thousand coin tosses. I recommend the Stack Exchange post for more insights.", "As I was looking into the Poisson distribution I found many examples trying to illustrate its use. Let\u2019s look at a few more briefly.", "Number of chocolate chips in a cookie dough. I though this was an interesting one. Instead of events over time, or instances in an area, we are talking about instances in a volume of mass. Kind of like 3-dimensional area. I guess if we looked at time (and distance) as 1-dimensional, and area as 2-dimensional, this would be the continuation to 3-dimensional. The applicability I think would mainly depend on how well the chips are distributed in the dough, and whether they could be considered independent (not clustering) and on average constant. But I find the application of the Poisson distribution to volumes of mass is an interesting perspective.", "Estimating traffic counts. How many cars pass a spot on a highway could be suitable for a Poisson distribution. I think there can be some dependencies between cars, since people tend to drive in clusters for various reasons. And this behaviour likely changes over specific time periods (of days, weeks, etc similar to the call center example).", "Estimating bus arrivals. This one does not seem very meaningful, since the buses are on a schedule. Maybe the average rate would be quite constant over some time periods, but not very independent. For estimating how much they will deviate from their schedule might work a bit better, although weather, traffic, and other aspects might have a big impact.", "People arriving in a location. This is a bit tricky. I think people often tend to travel in groups, and if they arrive to some events, such as school classes, workdays, meetings, football games, concerts, or anything else like that, they tend to cluster a lot. So I do not think this would work very well for a Poisson distribution. But maybe in some cases.", "Number of fatal airline crashes in a year quite a classic example. If we consider back to the past few years (today) and, for example, the issues Boeing had with their MCAS system, this would certainly not fit. But then this (MCAS issue) would show up as an anomaly, similar to what the British were looking for in the London Bombing example. And this would be correct, and a useful find it in itself, if otherwise not observed. Other than these types of clustered events due to a specific cause, I believe airplane crashes makes a reasonable example of applying the Poisson distribution.", "A bit like people, animal behaviour could also be of interest. One example I saw online (sorry, could not find the link anymore) was about cows being distributed across a field. And how they tend to group (or cluster), meaning the distribution would not be truly independent, and likely not very good for a Poisson distribution. This made me think about the minimum distance between events / instances as a parameter. For example, repeating my forest example, but setting a minimum distance from one tree to the next. The longer this minimum distance would be, the further the actual distribution should differ from the predicted Poisson distribution. This type of \u201cpersonal space\u201d seems likely in many real-world scenarios.", "Most of these extra examples I listed here actually seem to have some properties similar to my snowflakes / call center example. You might not have the perfect case for the Poisson distribution, but if you figure out your rules and limitations, and find a suitable angle, you might still benefit from it.", "I presented a bit deeper look at three cases of applying the Poisson distribution in this article. Hopefully they are helpful in understanding about its behaviour and potential use. I find the reliability example quite concise for the most \u201cbasic\u201d (or standard-like) application of the Poisson distribution. The call center / snowflake example gives it a bit more complex real-wold context, and finally the trees in a forest / London bombing example illustrates the expansion of the application into the two-dimensional space from the time-domain. The additional cases I briefly discussed further highlighted a few interesting points, such as the expansion into 3-dimensional volumes, and finding different angles where the Poisson might be useful, even if not directly matching all its criteria.", "Mostly my day to day job, or generally daily tasks don\u2019t really involve many uses for the Poisson (or Binomial) distribution. However, I believe the distribution is very useful to understand and keep in mind when the situation arises. And when it does, I find some good pointers are useful to remember. Some points I find useful:", "In the end, I think the most important thing is to remember what these distributions are good for. For Poisson, this would be estimating the probability of a discrete number of events, given their average rate in a timeframe/area/volume, and when the timeframe is continuous (e.g., you can divide an hour into smaller and smaller time units for more trials) but the events are discrete (no partial events). Binomial on the other hand if you have the probability for an event, and the number of trials is discrete (specific number of trials). Keeping the basic applications in mind, you can then look up the details as needed, and figure out the best way to apply them.", "That\u2019s all for today.
