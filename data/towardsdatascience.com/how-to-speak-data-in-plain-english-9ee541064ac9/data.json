Data science bootcamps and programs have sprung up promising 6-figure jobs in exchange for learning to code. For many analysts, though, coding is only the start.", "There\u2019s a person on the other end of the project that wants to make business sense of the analysis and can\u2019t understand when we talk about analytics concepts like p-values or Random Forest models. The most important soft skill a data analyst can have is to be an effective communicator and learn how to translate between \u201cdata-speak\u201d and \u201cbusiness-speak\u201d.", "Below are 3 ways to improve the way we communicate data to a non-technical audience:", "I\u2019m in the midst of reading The Wizard of Lies, a book that details the rise and fall of Bernie Madoff\u2019s $65B Ponzi scheme. For readers not familiar with finance, a Ponzi scheme is when an investor commits fraud by generating returns through bringing in new client money rather than successfully investing in stocks or bonds.", "Going through the book begs the question: How did no one pick up on this before it grew to a $65B problem and came toppling down?", "The truth is, they did. Madoff was arrested in 2008, but as early as 1999, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission; the \u201cWall Street police\u201d) received detailed reports about how Madoff\u2019s performance couldn\u2019t possibly be real. Why didn\u2019t they listen and act? There are many reasons, but I suspect one might be the way the information was communicated.", "In 2005, the same person that filed the 1999 complaint wrote and filed another report. It had 29 red flags identifying why he thought Madoff was a fraud. On the surface, it might make sense that the more red flags, the more overwhelming the evidence of guilt.", "However, let\u2019s take a look at just one of the red flags on the left (albeit one of the more number-intensive ones). Do you think you could interpret it? Could you keep track of all the numbers and figure out what they mean? Could you maintain your focus for the 24 red flags that follow afterwards? Personally, my eyes and attention wane by the third or fourth sentence.", "Humans are not designed to retain and process so much information at once. The most impactful 3 reasons for action can be more powerful than listing out all 29. What would you think about the case against Madoff if you were to only see the following 3 statements?", "Less takeaways and data points forces a reader to pay more attention and assign more weight to what you\u2019ve written. You can be persuasive by valuing the \u201cless is more\u201d philosophy.", "Lastly, notice how we don\u2019t need to include technical jargon to make our point. In the second bullet, most non-technical readers won\u2019t care how we arrived at the 1 in 1T (assuming the analysis is sound) but it will have its intended impact. Including technical detail for a non-technical audience adds unnecessary complexity. We want them to focus on the takeaway and why it matters rather than bog them down with the analytical process.", "You should always be asking yourself \u201cWhat is the easiest way to explain this finding?\u201d. Provide your findings to someone that has no context about the problem and see if they can understand what you\u2019re saying. Write what you want to say, then write it again with only 50% of the words. Empathize with your audience by considering whether you could understand what you\u2019re writing or saying if you had no knowledge of analytics.", "Let\u2019s take the following the statement in the complaint to the SEC\u2026", "\u201cDuring the 87 month span analyzed, Madoff was down only 3 months versus GATEX being down 26 months. GATEX earned an annualized return of 10.27% during the period studied vs. 15.62% for Bernie Madoff\u2026\u201d", "\u2026and suggest an alternate way that might be easier to follow:", "Over the 7 years studied, $100,000 invested with Madoff would have grown to $286,000 but only $203,000 for its competitor. Further, Madoff\u2019s performance suggests that he was 90% more effective at avoiding negative returns than comparable funds.", "We could also consider including a simple chart like the above to emphasize the point.", "What did we change to simplify the interpretation of the data? First, months was changed to years since its more common for someone to think of that amount of time in years. Then, instead of an annual return, we put it on dollar values, which people can more easily compare and appreciate the magnitude as it compounds over time. Then, we presented the data on negative returns in a format that I believe better emphasizes the difference in performance and should make someone question how the difference could be 90%.", "We should remove numbers where possible and add interpretation. The author mentions 3 negative months vs. 26 and 10.2% annual returns vs. 15.6% but what he\u2019s really saying is that Madoff\u2019s performance is uncharacteristically better than his competitor. For a non-technical audience, just give that answer and have the supporting data ready if necessary rather than giving the numbers and assuming they\u2019ll come to the same answer.", "A compelling way to communicate information is to make connections to something that\u2019s more familiar to your intended audience; to relate the data to something the person is already familiar with.", "Should the SEC be familiar with Hedge Funds and the language of the industry? Sure, they should, but maybe the people assigned to the case are new to the Agency. Did you know that the SEC\u2019s turnover in 1999 (the year the first report was received) was ~15% for Compliance Examiners and another 14% in 2000? This implies that ~30% of the staff was new when trying to act on the report. The author was a highly technical trader while the examiners were competent attorneys with a working knowledge of finance.", "Reframing the data means knowing your audience and considering a way to frame the problem in a context that they\u2019ll appreciate and understand. As Securities investigators, the examiners might not have fully understood the Options market, but they should understand the basic principles of how a stock market works. The report author mentions a red flag about the Options market not being big enough to support Madoff\u2019s strategy. An alternative way to communicate this could have been:", "If you want to take it outside of the finance industry, you could say:", "Another point of re-framing could be in the likelihood of achieving his monthly returns (the 1 in 1T). You could add context like: You would be 60,000x more likely to win the lottery than achieve the same returns as Madoff.", "We\u2019re trying to show that the scale of what he was doing did not match the constraints that the market provided in terms of size or performance. We want someone to say \u201cThat doesn\u2019t / can\u2019t make sense\u201d as we give the comparison. To do so, we need to remove the technical jargon and put the problem in a way that emphasizes the goal of an imbalance in magnitude rather than a straight reporting of the facts. You can and should report the facts, but help a reader interpret those facts where possible by including comparisons, benchmarks, or alternative interpretations that relate your key point.", "Communication is the single most important way to influence and persuade with data. It means having a strong enough grasp on the data, modeling, and analyses to perform sound analysis while being able to vary your communication style to meet the sophistication of your audience.", "We can\u2019t expect that someone can (or should) have the same level of knowledge as us. Take time to orient your audience to your findings by properly explaining charts and giving them the time to process what you\u2019ve shared. When I present, I oftentimes forget that I\u2019ve been looking at my presentation and findings for a week or more while my audience is seeing it for the first time.", "Finally, if you don\u2019t know your audience well enough to gauge their analytics sophistication, assume its low and work your way up from there. While it may initially appear insulting, it\u2019s significantly easier to scale up your technical explanations than to start too technical and lose your audience early.", "Interested in connecting?
