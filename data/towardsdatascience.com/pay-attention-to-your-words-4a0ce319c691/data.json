It takes a lot of thought \u2014 and we think in language \u2014 so you\u2019ll have greater odds of success creating good data if you really stop and zero in on the language you use to define your data.", "Below I relate some brief stories about companies which suffered significantly when their designers missed important, subtle mistakes in their thinking. The truth is, these kinds of mistakes are easy for anyone to make, because we all use language reflexively every day: language is so natural, we simply don\u2019t give our use of it much thought. By reading these stories and considering their lessons, it is hoped you will be inspired to carefully review your company\u2019s use of language from time to time, in order to avoid similar suffering.", "Before we dive into their nightmares, though, let\u2019s take a short journey back to a more peaceful time.", "\u201cHow many antelope did you see at the lake this morning?\u201d Grok inquired.", "\u201cHmm. I wonder where the others are?\u201d Grok was working on a new adornment for the cave wall. Should he incorporate this recent trend somehow? He was also concerned. He could remember when the antelope came to the lake every morning in large numbers. He frowned because he hadn\u2019t kept track of how many came in the years before \u2014 there had been so many, exact counts hadn\u2019t seemed important.", "Before we go on, did you notice something amazing? Not one computer or technologist anywhere in our story! There\u2019s a common misperception these days that data is about technology, but it\u2019s not. Data has been with us forever, and working with it is fundamental to human thinking. We all do data. It\u2019s the business of everyone.", "The beauty of Grok and Esmeralda\u2019s short scene above is it shows how easy and natural data analysis comes to us. It usually progresses like this:", "And it\u2019s all so easy, even Grok can do it! The common thread in all five elements? Thinking\u2014ideas\u2014expressed in language.", "Before you arrive at data, you have to navigate a lot of language. And to talk about the data later? More language.", "In the historical march of technology, data became lumped into technology because Data Processing started to manipulate data with computers, but adding computers never altered the language basis of data itself. If you want to be great at data, you\u2019ll need to be a master of your words.", "Numbers without words are meaningless. 42, anyone?\u00b2 Some words, without context, are also basically meaningless. Thing. There, you feel better, right? You know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.", "We\u2019ve all seen data context and meaning problems in action many times, and recently we lived a master-class lesson, as we watched the global pandemic unfold. Consider this article from early in the US outbreak: The Official Coronavirus Numbers Are Wrong, and Everyone Knows It. The article discusses the variances and limits of the available numbers, and declares that the data are untrustworthy because the processes used to collect them lacked unity of thought. It details how the CDC focused only on testing travelers, rather than testing more broadly. At the core, the CDC\u2019s concept or definition of who needed to be tested to obtain the answers sought was poorly conceived and too narrowly defined. They hadn\u2019t thought deeply enough about the problem we faced to create the right questions and, therefore, collected a poor data set. None of the problems discussed were technology problems, but all of them were thought/concept/definition problems.", "In most day to day conversations, quick or informal definitions don\u2019t cause huge problems because we can usually correct misunderstandings with a little bit of extra conversation later. \u201cOh, you were counting the eggs with red spots! Got it.\u201d However, when we\u2019re responding to international crises, or planning to run a business for years based on the data collected, we simply can\u2019t afford to operate off-the-cuff. Precise, well thought out words deeply matter.", "Nothing teaches like mistakes, so let\u2019s distill a few lessons from the suffering of others.", "In 1999, expansion of the Internet in the US was booming, fueled by the introduction of new broadband technologies. One of the early startups was pushing its network nationwide, running as fast as it could to interconnect homes and businesses using DSL for the last mile. As a first-year new hire, I came onboard to manage the data team, just as the initial data systems were being rolled out by consultants.", "Executives had proclaimed their simplified strategy to the consultants: to move fast, the company would only sell to Internet Service Providers (ISPs), relying on them as middlemen to bring in our end users. \u201cThe only type of customer we will have are ISPs, so set up the Customer Relationship Management and web ordering systems accordingly. We\u2019re going to be a wholesaler. We won\u2019t ever have any direct customers.\u201d So the development team turned its back on the traditional, broader definition of a customer, which is anyone who buys something from your company, and programmed (Customer = only ISP) everywhere. There was no provision left in the systems for any individual person to purchase directly from us. You can probably guess where this is going.", "Within a year, as the nationwide network neared full deployment, the company found it was burning too much cash and needed to accelerate its revenue growth to offset the burn-rate: we were simply bleeding too much money because ISPs couldn\u2019t be on-boarded fast enough. Leadership decided the company had to pivot and add selling to retail customers directly. To accomplish this, though, all of the customer and order handling systems had to be seriously overhauled, at great expense and lost time.", "Lesson 1: Stick with traditional, common definitions whenever possible. There are many reasons time-proven definitions, like Customer, exist. Picking the wrong data definition can seriously limit the flexibility and speed of your business.", "Lesson 2: If you create your own custom definitions of common words, you run the risk of causing accidental misunderstandings later. For instance: when you work with new parties who don\u2019t know you only mean \u201cISP\u201d whenever you use the word \u201cCustomer.\u201d", "A short time later, I took an assignment with a start-up division of a large, well-known tech company. They were entering a new market and had been building systems for the venture. During my first couple of weeks, I noticed that project participants were using the words \u201cAccount\u201d and \u201cCustomer\u201d interchangeably, as synonyms for each other, and I came to realize they had implemented their order tracking system as if the two were identical. I was a bit surprised a mature tech company\u2019s development team had failed to catch such a distinction, since they were experienced developers, but it shows how even experts can easily fall into subtle word traps if they are not careful.", "I assume that in the example scenarios they had considered during early planning, their Customers only had one Account. Now, as they arrived at system and integration testing, they started running into real problems. \u201cWhat do we do with large, multi-state customers who want separate accounts in each state? They\u2019re all still the same customer and we want to book all of their revenue under a single company, so how can we handle that?\u201d The way the system had been conceived and designed, they couldn\u2019t.", "Lesson 3: If you are using multiple synonyms interchangeably, pay attention! You most likely have different concepts in play, not a single idea. Explore the nuances of those synonyms thoroughly.", "On assignment with a regional power company, I was asked to review their asset management system, which had evolved over the years and, of course, had automated a business created well before the dawn of computerization (electricity carried on power poles).", "When they had constructed their system, they had created a Pole database table, in which they logically kept track of the power poles they had installed out in the field. All was pretty good, except, unfortunately, the designers never saw the pole as separate from the geographic location at which it was planted in the ground.", "The result? Not only did a pole number identify a pole, but also the pole\u2019s installation location on work-orders, field maps, etc. The pole and its location were seen as one and the same thing, even though with a little contemplation, it\u2019s clear they are not the same, just as you are not your home\u2019s street address (even if you work from home all day long now!).", "This(Pole = Location-of-pole)mistake caused problems in many ways. For example, in order to replace Pole 2000, they would need to send a work team to the pole\u2019s field location and install a second \u201cPole 2000\u201d \u2014 hmm\u2026 how do we put that into the system? \u2014 then try to issue a work order to move the power lines from (existing) Pole 2000 to (new) Pole 2000. The system simply couldn\u2019t handle any of that, because it only permitted one pole at a location, and so they had to manage replacements with external paper record keeping and off-line, manual processing.", "Lesson 4: Things and their locations are often mistaken for each other. We commonly refer to some things this way out of convenience \u2014 \u201cThe mole above your left eye\u201d or \u201cThe Server at IP address 10.1.127.10\u201d \u2014 but it does not make the thing and its location identical. If you examine the full lifecycle of your object and its location, you\u2019ll likely find the important places where they part company.", "One note on the lesson above: this is also the root of a very nasty problem baked into today\u2019s Internet, where the IP address serves as both the network location of a device and its identity. So even the original, really smart Internet wizards tripped over this same subtlety. The IP problem, it turns out, is perhaps the single biggest reason hackers can attack all of us with virtual anonymity these days \u2014 and the cost to fix this problem would be massive. Clearly, some up-front concept errors, if not caught, have huge consequences later! (Learn more about the IP problem.\u00b3)", "A friend of mine was a senior architect for a large, multi-state insurance company\u2019s data warehouse initiative. They spent years and millions of dollars building the data transformation \u201cpipelines\u201d between all of their regional systems, to bring the data into what they hoped would be a great new data warehouse. They were excited to get it all working and see the data start flowing\u2026until they dug into the results.", "The discovery: employees in the various regions had been using similarly named fields for completely different purposes. While the data had looked consistent and homogenous to the design team (and the definitions had seemed consistent, too), in real use the data was quite inconsistent. In many cases, they found that the users of the systems had been unaware of (or chose to ignore) the official definitions. When the data was finally flowing into the warehouse, everyone discovered that it simply didn\u2019t tell a reliable story and could not be used to make business decisions. After the years and millions spent, the outcome was a virtual disaster.", "Lesson 5: Even if you write great data definitions, don\u2019t expect the users to read them or adhere to them. They\u2019ll see the name of the field and put in whatever they think belongs, and sometimes they\u2019ll even knowingly enter inappropriate data if it helps them get today\u2019s job done. Before you rely on any user-supplied data, ensure it passes good validation and sanity checks.", "As you read this, besides the lessons above, please take away these two additional thoughts:", "[1] Illustration created specifically for this article by my colleague, Jon Jacquet \u00a92020 PNDLM | Used by permission", "[2] What? You don\u2019t recognize \u201cthe Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything,\u201d as recorded by Douglas Adams in The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy? Simple proof that all numbers need a good story to explain them!", "[3] One good place to start learning about the IP Address problem is rfc4423 in section 4, Background. Paragraph three states: \u201cIP numbers are a confounding of two namespaces, the names of a host\u2019s networking interfaces and the names of the locations (\u2018confounding\u2019 is a term used in statistics to discuss metrics that are merged into one with a gain in indexing, but a loss in informational value).\u201d I added the bolding. Unfortunately, that\u2019s pretty hard to understand. My translation: they mushed two ideas together, losing the separate meanings and important, related capabilities in the process! Just as you are not your home\u2019s address, a device is not its IP address, either.", "Perhaps the best book on this was written by one of the chief architects of Boeing\u2019s solution to the problem: Richard H. Paine, Beyond Host Identity Protocol: The End to Hacking as We Know It (2009). The solutions he helped Boeing develop and describes in the book later became official technology standards. The RFC referenced above is one of the related standards documents. Unfortunately, many years later, those standards have been largely ignored \u2014 much to the glee of hackers and spies everywhere, no doubt.", "Your home for data science.
