Just a bag full of attention and excitement is enough.", "If you\u2019re new to the world of data science and python, a virtual environment might seem like an incredibly complex idea \u2014 but the opposite is true. It is straightforward to understand and even simpler to use! You\u2019ll also have a head start if you have experienced Virtual Reality (VR) before (e.g. played a Virtual Reality game or tried VR glasses for any purpose). This post covers everything from what an environment is to setting up virtual environments and using them!", "An environment for a human being may refer to their surroundings \u2014 the place they live in. The notion of an environment for a programming language, like python, is similar. For python that is installed on your computer, the computer is its environment. It is often called the \u201clocal\u201d environment because languages can also run on servers (which are just computers that run in a data centre and are accessible using the internet).", "Have you ever experienced virtual reality or seen someone experience it? If not, here is an example:", "Recall the definition of an environment for a human \u2014 their surroundings. For the person in the above photo, their surrounding is what he is seeing through the lens. For him, the notion of reality (to an extent) has changed from what he was seeing through his naked eyes to what he perceives now.", "A virtual environment for python is a similar idea: you give it a separate \u201cenvironment\u201d inside an environment (your computer) and allow it to operate there.", "However, there are a few key differences between a VR experience for a human and the VR experience for python. Firstly, you can create multiple virtual environments for python (you can consider that python has an infinite number of faces, as compared to just 1 for humans so python can wear as many VR glasses it wants). Secondly, while a human can still touch and feel objects from the \u201creal\u201d environment, python may not necessarily do so. When you put on VR glasses for python, it may or may not have access to the \u201creal\u201d environment (depending upon your settings which are a bit too advanced for this post). As such, all the libraries and packages installed on your computer (aka the real environment) are inaccessible in a virtual environment and vice-versa.", "Ok, this sounds cool but what is the purpose of a virtual environment? Why give cool VR glasses to boring and complex programming languages?", "Convenience. Stability. Ease of mind. Not for the programming language, but for you as the programmer. Notice how different projects may require different versions of libraries and maybe even languages? That\u2019s where virtual environments are useful. The idea is to create a separate virtual environment for each project.", "Since the resources (libraries, packages, etc,) of a language are hidden from the real environment and other virtual environments, there is no interference and no clashes between versions. For example, consider that you update the library X in the virtual environment for project A. Since you updated it inside the virtual environment for project A, you can be sure that this doesn\u2019t cause the library X to update in any other environments. Therefore, your code and its dependencies in other places are unaffected.", "OK, how do I make a virtual environment?", "For this story, I\u2019ll be covering the virtualenv library, but there are many different (and maybe better) ways to create python virtual environments. I\u2019ll also be using a Mac, which is a UNIX based system. Hence, if your computer uses a different system, the steps might be varied.", "You might not have virtualenv installed on your system. You can check the same using:", "If you have it installed, terminal will print the version (e.g. 16.4.3) of virtualenv installed on your system. Else, it should give you a \u201ccommand not found\u201d error. If that is the case, enter the following command:", "PS: if you don\u2019t have pip, you can download it for your system. It is included by default with binary installers for Python 3.4 or higher.", "Next up, navigate to a directory where you want to create a virtual environment. You can create another directory just for environments and change to that directory with the following command:", "This creates a new folder called \u201cEnvironments\u201d and opens the directory in the terminal. You\u2019re now ready to create VR experiences for python. To create an environment, use the following command", "The above command creates an environment called \u201cproject_name\u201d inside your current working directory. Replace the \u201cproject_name\u201d with your project\u2019s name. After completing the above steps, your terminal window should look something like this:", "However, the virtual environment is not activated yet. Every time you want to go inside the environment or to activate it (aka wear the glasses), you need to run the following command:", "Tada! You\u2019re in your virtual environment now. How do you confirm that you are indeed inside a virtual environment? Your terminal will prefix the project_name in all the lines as shown below:", "That\u2019s it! You\u2019ve successfully learnt, created and activated a python virtual environment. You can now work on your project inside this virtual environment. You can install libraries as you would on your normal terminal, except that these will be installed in the virtual environment and not the \u201creal\u201d environment. You can exit the virtual environment using the following command to \u201clog-off\u201d the virtual environment:", "You haven\u2019t discovered the world of virtual environments entirely yet. There are many interesting things you might want to explore:", "This story compares different python virtual environment tools (recall that I only showed virtualenv):", "This is a great article for being a pro at virtual environments:", "The following article discusses the latest developments in relation to virtual environments:", "I hope this article helps you understand what virtual environments are and gets you started with them. If you have questions, please do not hesitate to respond to this story or contact me. Happy VR-ing with Python!", "Your home for data science.
