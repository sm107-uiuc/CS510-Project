This medium article by Tomas Pueyo published in early March was one of the first to explore COVID data in plenty of depth revealing many insights and getting tens of millions of views in just a few days. The John Hopkins University in the US has also provided a very useful dashboard as well as their data which gets updated daily. Their data combines multiple sources such as the WHO, the US Center for Disease Communication(CDC), and the EU CDC among others.", "Early on, the internet was infested with a multitude of reports from universities. I realized that I would not be able to make a world-class dashboard or report but at least I wanted to make my own and learn how to make one.", "\u00b7 Teaser\u00b7 ggplot, Plotly and Shiny\u00b7 Data sources\u00b7 Plan\u00b7 See you soon!", "Before we get started I want to show you what the end product will look like.

This library is based on the Grammar of Graphics (GoG) by Leland Wilkinson and is implemented and distributed as an R package. I recommend reading the original ggplot 2010 paper by the almighty Hadley Wickham on the first implementation of ggplot and a comprehensive but concise guide on the theory behind the GoG by Dipanjan (DJ) Sarkar.", "Plotly is a great cross-language library (originally written in JavaScript) that allows making interactive plots. In R, which is the language we will be using today, they have a function called ggplotly() that allows you to turn any ggplot plot into a Plotly with no overhead.", "Shiny allows R users to make great looking dashboards and interactive reports without needing to know a bit of JavaScript or HTML, all with R alone. RStudio also hosts up to 5 free dashboards websites per user which is a friction-less way to build your first dashboard, web-app, or interactive R notebook.", "When I started this project back in March, the data source I started using was from Kaggle: the Novel Corona-Virus dataset uploaded and maintained by the user SKR. As described in the dataset description, this is simply a mirror of the JHU dataset, which is also available in GitHub. Unfortunately, I discovered late in the project there were several artefacts with this data source. For example, in Spain, -10000 confirmed cases were reported on April 24th and -2000 deaths were recorded on May 25th, as discussed in this GitHub issue (out of the 1300+ open issues in the JHU repository). Similar other problems were present in the data and the fact that the repository maintainers did not step up to give an explanation for this made me doubtful about the use of this data. Furthermore, the COVID daily cases of plots from Google or Our World in Data(OWiD) did not show these artefacts.", "I decided to switch my data source away from the JHU and use OWiD instead. To my great satisfaction, the OWiD data was very clean and full of pre-computed features and statistics (such as statistics on testing, the population counts, life expectancy per country\u2026).", "I decided this project was too big for a single article hence I decided to write a 4 part series (including this introduction).
