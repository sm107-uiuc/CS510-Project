The second test is used to compare multiple observed proportions to multiple expected proportions, in a situation where the qualitative variable has two or more categories.", "Both tests allow to test the equality of proportions between the levels of the qualitative variable or to test the equality with given proportions. These given proportions could be determined arbitrarily or based on the theoretical probabilities of a known distribution.", "For this section, we use the same dataset than in the article on descriptive statistics. It is the well-known iris dataset, to which we add the variable size. The variable size corresponds to small if the length of the petal is smaller than the median of all flowers, big otherwise:", "For this example, we have a sample of 150 flowers and we want to test whether the proportion of small flowers is the same than the proportion of big flowers (measured by the variable size). Here are the number of flowers by size, and the corresponding proportions:", "Among the 150 flowers forming our sample, 51% and 49% are big and small, respectively. To test whether the proportions are the same among both sizes, we use the prop.test() function which accepts the following arguments:", "Considering (arbitrarily) that big is the success, we have:1", "The p-value is 0.806 so, at the 5% significance level, we do not reject the null hypothesis that the proportions of small and big flowers are the same.", "Note that prop.test() uses a normal approximation to the binomial distribution. Therefore, one assumption of this test is that the sample size is large enough (usually, n > 30). If the sample size is small, it is recommended to use the exact binomial test.", "The exact binomial test can be performed with the binom.test() function and accepts the same arguments as the prop.test() function. For this example, suppose now that we have a sample of 12 big and 3 small flowers and we want to test whether the proportions are the same among both sizes:", "The p-value is 0.035 so, at the 5% significance level, we reject the null hypothesis and we conclude that the proportions of small and big flowers are significantly different. This is equivalent than concluding that the proportion of big flowers is significantly different from 0.5 (since there are only two sizes).", "If you want to test that the proportion of big flowers is greater than 50%, add the alternative = \"greater\" argument into the binom.test() function:2", "The p-value is 0.018 so, at the 5% significance level, we reject the null hypothesis and we conclude that the proportion of big flowers is significantly larger than 50%.", "Suppose now that the qualitative variable has more than two levels as it is the case for the variable Species:", "The variable Species has 3 levels, with 50 observations in each level. Suppose for this example that we want to test whether the 3 species are equally common. If they were equally common, they would be equally distributed and the expected proportions would be 1/3 for each of the species.", "This test can be done with the chisq.test() function, accepting the following arguments:", "Applied to our research question (i.e., are the 3 species equally common?), we have:", "The p-value is 1 so, at the 5% significance level, we do not reject the null hypothesis that the proportions are equal among all species.", "This was quite obvious even before doing the statistical test given that there are exactly 50 flowers of each species, so it was easy to see that the species are equally common. We however still did the test to show how it works in practice.", "In the previous section, we chose the proportions ourselves. The goodness of fit test is also particularly useful to compare observed proportions with expected proportions that are based on some known distribution.", "Remember the hypotheses of the test:", "For this example, suppose that we measured the number of girls in 100 families of 5 children. We want to test whether the (observed) distribution of number girls follows a binomial distribution.", "Here is the distribution of the number of girls per family in our sample of 100 families of 5 children:", "And the corresponding frequencies and relative frequencies (remember that the relative frequency is the frequency divided by the total sample size):", "In order to compare the observed frequencies to a binomial distribution and see if both distributions match, we first need to determine the expected frequencies that would be obtained in case of a binomial distribution. The expected frequencies assuming a probability of 0.5 of having a girl (for each of the 5 children) are as follows:", "We now compare the observed frequencies to the expected frequencies to see whether the two differ significantly. If the two differ significantly, we reject the hypothesis that the number of girls per family of 5 children follows a binomial distribution. On the other hand, if the observed and expected frequencies are similar, we do not reject the hypothesis that the number of girls per family follows a binomial distribution.", "We see that the observed and expected frequencies are quite similar, so we expect that the number of girls in families of 5 children follows a binomial distribution. However, only the goodness of fit test will confirm our belief:", "The p-value is 0.601 so, at the 5% significance level, we do not reject the null hypothesis that the observed and expected frequencies are equal. This is equivalent than concluding that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the number of girls in families of 5 children follows a binomial distribution (since the expected frequencies were based on a binomial distribution).", "Note that the goodness of fit test can of course be performed with other types of distribution than the binomial one. For instance, if you want to test whether an observed distribution follows a Poisson distribution, this test can be used to compare the observed frequencies with the expected proportions that would be obtained in case of a Poisson distribution.", "Now that we showed how to perform the one-proportion and goodness of fit test in R, in this section we show how to do these tests by hand. We first illustrate the one-proportion test then the Chi-square goodness of fit test.", "For this example, suppose that we tossed a coin 100 times and noted that it landed on heads 67 times. Following this, we want to test whether the coin is fair, that is, test whether the probability of landing on heads or tails is equal to 50%.", "As for many hypothesis tests, we do it through 4 easy steps:", "In our example, the null and alternative hypotheses are:", "where p0 is the expected proportion of landing on heads.", "(See how to perform hypothesis tests in a Shiny app if you need more help in computing the test statistic.)", "The rejection region is found via the normal distribution table. Assuming a significance level \u03b1 = 0.05, we have:", "We compare the test statistic (found in step 2) with the rejection region (found in step 3) and we conclude. Visually, we have:", "The test statistic lies within the rejection region (i.e., the grey shaded areas). Therefore, at the 5% significance level, we reject the null hypothesis and we conclude that the proportion of heads (and thus tails) is significantly different than 50%. In other words, still at the 5% significance level, we conclude that the coin is unfair.", "If you prefer to compute the p-value instead of comparing the t-stat and the rejection region, you can use this Shiny app to easily compute p-values for different probability distributions. After having opened the app, set the t-stat, the corresponding alternative and you will find the p-value at the top of the page.", "Just for the sake of illustration, here is the verification of the above example in R:", "The p-value is 0.001 so, at the 5% significance level, we reject the null hypothesis that the proportions of heads and tails are equal, and we conclude that the coin is biased. This is the same conclusion than the one found by hand.", "We now illustrate the goodness of fit test by hand with the following example.", "Suppose that we toss a dice 100 times, we note how many times it lands on each face (1 to 6) and we test whether the dice is fair. Here are the observed counts by dice face:", "With a fair dice, we would expect it to land 100/6 \u2248 16.67 times on each face (this expected value is represented by the dashed line in the above plot). Although the observed frequencies are different than the expected value of 16.67:", "we need to test whether they are significantly different. For this, we perform the appropriate hypothesis test following the 4 easy steps mentioned above:", "The null and alternative hypotheses of the goodness of fit test are:", "where Oi is the observed frequency, Ei is the expected frequency and k is the number of categories (in our case, there are 6 categories, representing the 6 dice faces).", "This \u03c72 statistic is obtained by calculating the difference between the observed number of cases and the expected number of cases in each category. This difference is squared (to avoid negative and positive differences being compensated) and divided by the expected number of cases in that category. These values are then summed for all categories, and the total is referred to as the \u03c72 statistic. Large values of this test statistic lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis, small values mean that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.4", "Whether the \u03c72 test statistic is small or large depends on the rejection region. The rejection region is found via the \u03c72 distribution table. With a degrees of freedom equals to k \u2212 1 (where k is the number of categories) and assuming a significance level \u03b1 = 0.05, we have:", "We compare the test statistic (found in step 2) with the rejection region (found in step 3) and we conclude. Visually, we have:", "The test statistic does not lie within the rejection region (i.e., the grey shaded area). Therefore, at the 5% significance level, we do not reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the observed and the expected frequencies. In other words, still at the 5% significance level, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the dice is fair.", "Again, you can use the Shiny app to easily compute the p-value given the test statistic if you prefer this method over the comparison between the t-stat and the rejection region.", "Just for the sake of illustration, here is the verification of the above example in R:", "The test statistic and degrees of freedom are exactly the same than the ones found by hand. The p-value is 0.185 which, still at the 5% significance level, leads to the same conclusion than by hand (i.e., failing to reject the null hypothesis).", "Thanks for reading.
