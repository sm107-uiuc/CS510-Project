And there are many reasons to believe that they hold true if you look at each country\u2019s clubs performances in the Champions League or if you compare how many different Teams have won a Domestic League Title in the past 10 Seasons. However, there is much more to say about Europe\u2019s top 5 football Leagues of Spain, Italy, France, Germany and England.", "Entertainment doesn\u2019t always have to come along with having the best Teams or Players. Or why else would you regularly enjoy your local team\u2019s Sunday League matches? It is entertaining to see many goals, to witness change in leads from Half Time to Full Time or to visit matches of traditional Clubs with huge fan bases.", "For that reason, we put together a dataset using match data from football-data.co.uk from the last 10 Seasons since 2009/10 of La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1, Bundesliga and Premier League. Each row in that final dataset represents a Team that has played at least one season in the first division of its country in the past 10 years. Each Team has thirteen attributes that include describtions of its performance in Home Games over the past 10 Seasons.", "Using those attributes we created a network with graphext to calculate similarities and clusters of connected teams (see figure above). Now each Node in the Graph represents a Row/Team of the original dataset. Teams that have similar performances are connected to each other. Teams with many connections among each other form uniquely colored clusters. The closer two teams are to each other the more similar they are.", "The pink cluster holds Teams that usually win their Domestic Leagues. Their performances compared to the rest are mainly manifested in the number of goals they score, the seasons they have played in the first Division in the past 10 years and how often they have turned around a loss at half time to a win at full time. Very interesting is that German Club RB Leipzig is already a part of that group being only quite recently promoted to the Bundesliga. Since then they continuously played well an earned their spot in the pink group.", "The Teams in the Red Cluster have in common that they have scored and conceded many goals at Full Time. If you like entertainment as a neutral football fan we can recommend you watching a home game of one of these teams. You will see many goals for sure! Interestingly, the Bundesliga holds the most Teams in that Cluster (more than 30%).", "But now enough of that introduction, let\u2019s start with the Insights that we promised in our Headline. If you want to look for your favorite Team and with whom it is most connected you can access the project here by yourself.", "In England the competition is much stronger due to more investor activities in small clubs in the 2nd Division. These teams increase the pressure on the Premier League Teams and cause a much higher fluctuation.", "Keep that in mind when placing your next live bet ;)", "In 50% of the matches in Bundesliga you will see at least 3 goals (2.87).", "In 50% of the matches in Serie A in which the Home Team is leading or losing you will see a turned over result at Full Time in at least 18% of the cases.", "The difference between France and Germany is quite remarkable as well.", "We hope you enjoyed reading our Analysis on Europe\u2019s best Football Teams.
