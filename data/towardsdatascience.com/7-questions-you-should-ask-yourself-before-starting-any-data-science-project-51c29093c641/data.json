I think that it is also extremely important to learn to think like a data scientist. That means always questioning\u2026basically everything.", "Obviously every data science problem will require you to question your methods and the data in different ways, but there are a few things that I think are important to consider whenever embarking on any new data science project. In this story, I will go through those questions and why I think that they are important to be a responsible data scientist.", "My questions for any new data science project are:", "It is extremely important to at least have an idea of what question you are trying to answer before you interrogate any data set.", "You don\u2019t want to test multiple hypotheses and just see which ones come out as significant. If you did that, you would run into the multiple hypothesis testing problem. We will go into this in more detail when we do our lessons on statistics, but in brief, it occurs when you consider multiple hypotheses at the same time.", "When we talk about a significant result, in general, we are referring to a result that we are fairly confident is different from the \u2018control\u2019 because of a real effect rather than random chance. 95% confidence is most commonly used (p<0.05).", "That leaves an error rate of 5%, where we label a result as significant when it really is not. The problem with testing multiple hypotheses at the same time is that the likelihood of making this type of error for at least one of the hypotheses increases. Thus, by indiscriminately testing many hypotheses at once, you would be increasing your chance of making a false discovery.", "So rather than testing at random and seeing what sticks, it is much better practice to strategically use statistical tests when you have a thought out and well-research hypothesis.", "In addition to avoiding the multiple hypothesis testing problem, having clarity of thought about what question you are trying to answer will keep you from getting side-tracked.", "Sometimes there are so many different shiny and interesting insights to be gleaned from a dataset that it can be easy to fall down the wrong rabbit hole. You may end up doing a lot of work to solve interesting problems, but have no answers to your original questions.", "That may not be such a big deal if data science is a hobby for you, but it may be much more important if you are trying to work to a deadline, or solve a specific problem for the company you work for.", "Once you know what problem you want to solve, you need to know how you are going to solve it. Part of that is deciding what you are trying to measure.", "There are often multiple different ways to approach the same question. However, if you choose to measure the wrong effect or variable, then you may not be able to effectively solve your problem. So it is extremely important to thoughtfully consider if what you are trying to measure is the most effective way to answer your question of interest.", "Similar to number 1 above, if you choose the wrong effect or variable to measure, then you can spend a lot of time working on an analysis that does not really meet your needs.", "Deciding which approach to take can be the most important step in any data science project.", "It may take a bit of research to find out what is the correct variable to measure for your purpose, but it will be worth it. If you are confident that you have correctly chosen what to measure then you can be much more confident in the results of your analysis.", "Further, when you are communicating your findings to others you can do so with the assurance that you have appropriately considered which problem you want to solve and how to measure it correctly.", "So once you have a problem to solve and know how to measure the effect you are interested in, you need to have the data to make that measurement. There is no point in having the best, most interesting problem and variable to investigate if you do not have the means to do so.", "Having the perfect dataset to answer the exact question and measure the specific effect of interest is very rare.", "Not having the right data can be a huge frustration as a data scientist.", "Often we have to make do with what we have. Thus we may have to measure something slightly different to what we originally intended. That may be fine, as long as we then temper how we report our results to reflect that adjustment.", "It is sometimes possible to use one variable that you have data to represent another variable that you cannot gather data on. Yet, if you do this, it is imperative that you report your results appropriately. Make sure that you do not make claims of your results that you do not have the data to support.", "Just because you have the correct data to measure your effect of interest and solve the problem you have in mind, doesn\u2019t mean you can relax \ud83d\ude09", "Datasets don\u2019t just spring into being, fully-formed and containing complete data. There are many different ways data can be collected. Many of them involve machines or people, which means that errors can be made. Try to consider or at least acknowledge as many potential error sources as possible when you do any analysis.", "It would be impossible for me to describe all the possible ways that data collection can go wrong. Yet there are a few different investigations you can do to get to know your dataset. They can allow you to understand better what its shortcomings may be.", "It is important to get to know the history of your dataset so that you can decide if any of these potential shortcomings will prevent you from finding the answers you seek. Or alternatively if they are data issues that you can work with \ud83d\ude03", "This is a very important question that is often overlooked. Are your analysis and the results that you have come to ethical?", "You might wonder how an analysis could have ethical considerations. Surely numbers appropriately collected and measured with careful analysis could not be unethical? But the reality is that sometimes things like sexism and racism can creep in without us intending it at all. Especially when the world that we are trying to describe using data, has things like inequality and prejudice within it.", "There are lots of people who have written about ethics in data science so you can educate yourself to make ethical decisions when designing your data science projects. It is important to acknowledge the biases that exist in the world and decide for yourself if the analysis that you are planning would be ethical to complete. Be mindful and do your absolute best to perform analyses in a way that will make the world a better place.", "As data scientists, we are stewards of data. We can influence how companies do business, what decisions governments make, which drugs get developed etc. So it is extremely important that we do so responsibly and mindfully.", "Who is going to read or be on the receiving end of your analysis? Is it a user of a website or product? a data science team? marketing team? business development? sales team? etc. Each of these groups will have different levels of statistical understanding. So you may have to tailor your analysis to your audience. In particular, the methods you choose and how you convey your results and any caveats that are associated with them.", "It is your responsibility as a data scientist to make sure that you accurately convey your findings to their intended audience. You must take into account how much background in statistics your audience has.", "One of the most difficult presentations I ever had to give was to an audience who was extremely diverse in their understanding of statistics. There were neuroscientists, neurosurgeons and also people who had suffered brain trauma in the audience. The key was to include enough details to keep the experts happy but not make the other people feel like I was talking down to them or excluding them from the conversation. It is a balance that I continue to work on in conveying my results to various audiences.", "It is also common for different people to want to use your data for their own teams' purposes. You are obligated to make sure they know what the limitations of your analysis are and if they can confidently make the claims they want to.", "This can sometimes lead to conflict. Different stakeholders may have different purposes for your analysis, but it is important to stand your ground and make sure that everyone has a clear understanding of what your results mean. Furthermore, make sure they know what conclusions can be drawn.", "Before you decide what methodology to use in your data science project, it is important to know how much you will need to be able to interrogate the analysis or model you produce.", "Sometimes you might need to be able to explain each step you took in great detail. This includes all the variables that were taken into account and why. Other times, accuracy is the name of the game. In that case, it doesn\u2019t really matter what went into the model as long as it predicts with minimum errors.", "Knowing this will help you decide on your methodology.", "Whilst explainability should not be the primary consideration of choosing a machine learning model for analysis, it is worth thinking about. It can sometimes be a trade off between accuracy and explainability. So it is really up to you as a data scientist to decide which direction to go.", "So before you get started on any data science project ask yourself:", "I hope that these 7 questions have been thought provoking. They will make sure that in any data science analysis you perform that you don\u2019t go completely off the rails. Hopefully, they will save you some time and trips down unnecessary rabbit holes. As you gain experience in data science I am sure that you will come up with your own questions that you always like to ask yourself before starting any new project. Just remember to always be mindful in all your analyses and appropriately convey any caveats to your results.", "In addition to data, my other passion is painting.
