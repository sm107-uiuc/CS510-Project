Is there anything, that is meaningful? Anything you can learn? Nothing. A stopped world is equivalent to a no world! The world exists because it \u201cchanges\u201d. Rotations and revolutions of planets, the evolution of species, economic growth or decline, population mechanics, rise and fall of stock markets\u2026\u2026..there is a notion of \u201cchange\u201d at the heart of just every phenomenon.", "And if you take a big leap of generalization, you can see that all human knowledge is about the recognition, understanding, measurement, and manipulation of changes that occur in nature. Any knowledge about a phenomenon would roughly try to answer the following questions:", "Is there a change? Which things are changing?", "Does the change in one thing affects others?", "How can this change be measured? Is there a rule which can explain and express this change? Can it be used to predict the change in the future?", "When you are observing or studying a phenomenon, you focus on things that are involved. These things are called \u201cvariables\u201d because they \u201cvary\u201d or they \u201cchange\u201d. The kind of \u201cchanges\u201d or \u201cvariations\u201d they undergo depends on the kind of variables they are.", "Fundamentally, all variables (or all data) can only be of 2 types: Quantitative or Qualitative", "There are things for which you can measure the \u201csize\u201d or \u201cvalue\u201d like speed, distance, volume, weight, height, income, etc. These are numerical values and it makes sense to perform arithmetic operations such as addition or subtraction on such variables. Quantitative variables typically have measurement units, such as kilograms, dollars, years, and so on.", "On the other hand, there are variables that describe something. e.g name of a person or a place, or gender or race or category of animals, and so on. The arithmetic operations on such variables do not make sense. You can not add or subtract genders or categories. These variables typically do not have units. Note that qualitative variables can also take numerical values such as PIN Codes or Social Security Numbers but you will not want to add PIN codes or SSNs. It will not make sense.", "Now think of any data value about anything. This value will either be Quantitative or Qualitative. Quantitative variables are also called \u201cContinuous\u201d variables. Inherently, they represent a \u201cquantity\u201d that is being measured. e.g Weight. It's \u201ccontinuous\u201d because the value can be anything. e.g 50Kgs, 50.1 Kgs, 52 Kgs, 52.5 kgs\u2026.just about anything.", "Qualitative variables are also known as \u201cCategorical\u201d. Inherently, they represent a \u201cgroup\u201d or a \u201ccategory\u201d and the value will belong to a fixed set of that group or category. e.g Gender \u2014 (Male or Female), Result of a Medical Test (Positive or Negative)", "The type of variable (Quantitative or Qualitative) will determine the kind of analysis that can be done.", "Let's look at some of the operations that can be done to describe or understand the changes in these variables.", "Whenever something is changing, what is our natural inclination to express or summarize these changes? On average, people will tend to find the \u201caverage\u201d. (pun intended :)", "Calculating \u201caverage\u201d is the most intuitive thing which comes naturally when we are analyzing data. So let's say you want to know how good a batsman is? (In the game of cricket) You have been given the runs he scored in the last 10 matches.", "To measure his performance or to make a judgment of how good or how bad this player is, don't you have an instant urge to calculate \u201caverage\u201d runs scored over the 10 matches? You can not make a decision or inference just by looking at the score of each match in isolation. You need 1 representative number to reflect it. And the natural tendency is to find out the \u201caverage\u201d.", "Many of us don\u2019t realize but there are many ways to measure \u201caverage\u201d. These measurements are known as \u201cMeasures of Central Tendency\u201d.", "Most of the times, when people are talking about average, they actually mean \u201cMean\u201d :)", "Mean is simply the sum of all the given numbers divided by how many numbers are there.", "You can say that \u201cmean\u201d is one type of \u201caverage\u201d. Are there other types?", "Assume, that this player had another match in which he scored whopping 400 runs!", "In this case, the mean can be misleading because, in all matches, the player has scored much less than 46.45. Because of only 1 match where he scored 400, the overall summary is kind of distorted. Such data points are called outliers. In such cases, a better measure of average is \u201cMedian\u201d, which is the middle point of the data values. In our example, we will sort all the data values and choose the middle one.", "The median is 12, which is a more appropriate measure of \u201caverage\u201d in this case.", "A lesser-known measurement of \u201caverage\u201d is Mode, which is the most frequently occurring data value in our data set. In our example, \u201812\u2019 is repeating 2 times. So the mode is 12. Mean and Median are used for Quantitative variables while Mode comes in handy for Qualitative variables. There will no sense of calculating the mean or median for Qualitative variables like Gender, Colour, etc. Let's say, in our example, we have a column which tells if a particular match was won by the team or if they lost it.", "The mode of variable \u201cMatch Result\u201d in this case is \u201cWon\u201d since \u201cWon\u201d came 7 times while \u201cLost\u201d came only 3.", "We can say that on \u201caverage\u201d, the team is winning.", "\u201cMean\u201d, \u201cMedian\u201d and \u201cMode\u201d are the three kinds of measurements of average which give an idea about the \u201ccentrality\u201d of data.", "But does the average provide enough information when analyzing or summarizing data? There is more which we can do.", "In addition to finding out the average of a data set, we can also look at how much the data is spread out. Or in other words, how much \u201cvariability\u201d is there in the data set. Let us understand it by an example. Till now, we were looking at the scores of a single player. Let's say, we have been given the scores of 2 players of all 10 matches. We have to compare these scores and try to get an idea of how these players have performed in comparison to each other.", "Both players have a mean(average) of 50. So how can we compare them? One subtle thing to check is \u201chow\u201d these players have averaged over the matches. Is one player more consistent in scoring than others? Is a player scoring huge runs in few matches while scoring very few runs in other matches? How are the scores \u201cvarying\u201d across matches for these players?", "A very basic metric to check how the scores are varying is to calculate the range of scores for each player.", "Range is simply the difference between the largest and smallest observation in the data.", "Looks like Player 1 has more range of scores than Player 2. It means that the scores of Player 1 tend to have more variety than Player 2. If we look at the data of Player 1 carefully, there are outliers present. In some matches this player is scoring exceptionally high like 200 and in some matches, he is scoring nothing (0). Range can measure how far the values are spread out but it's sensitive to outliers.", "One way to overcome the shortfall of Range is to somehow exclude outliers and construct a \u2018mini-range\u2019. One such metric is \u201cInter-quartile range\u201d. We sort the data in ascending order and divide the data values into 4 groups(quartiles). We then consider only the middle 50% values. This gives us Inter-quartile range.", "We have 10 scores. The position of lower Quartile is n/4 = 3 (after rounding)", "The position of Upper Quartile is 3n/4 = 8(after rounding)", "IQR is (Score at Position 8\u2014 Score at Position 3)", "We have 10 scores. The position of lower Quartile is n/4 = 3 (after rounding)", "The position of Upper Quartile is 3n/4 = 8(after rounding)", "IQR is (Score at Position 8\u2014 Score at Position 3)", "A special graph called \u201cBox and Whisker\u201d plot is used to visualize ranges.", "For a given data attribute it shows 5 metrics:", "Let's compare the scores of the two players by drawing box and whiskers plots:", "As evident from the above graph, Player 1 has more variations as compared to Player 2. The median or mean for both players is same but the scores for Player 1 differ from mean a lot more than Player 2. We can say that Player1 is less \u201cconsistent\u201d than Player 2. Though the highest score for Player 1 i.e 200 is much more than the highest score of Player 2 (70), but he is not consistent in scoring runs.", "A more effective way to judge the performance of a player is to find out much a player deviates from its \u201cmean\u201d score. The more the deviation, the less consistent a player is. The less the deviation, the more consistent a player is.", "Variance is simply a metric that expresses the \u201cdeviation\u201d in a data attribute from its mean. You don\u2019t have to memorize the below formula for Variance:", "Remember, we are trying to find out how much variation is there in a data attribute. So, we can take the following simple steps:", "Standard deviation is simply the square root of Variance", "The square root is taken to negate the effect of the square done in Step 2 while calculating Variance.", "Standard Deviation is the measure of spread of data about the mean. It measures roughly how far off the entries are from their average. It tells us how the data is spread out. The more the SD, the more spread out data is. Since its simply a measure, it can\u2019t be negative.", "Player2 has much less standard deviation than Player 1. Hence we can say that this player is much more consistent. He has fewer variations in his performance. Though he is not scoring big runs, he is fairly consistent in all his matches.", "Think of any variable in nature. If the standard deviation of this variable is large, you can safely say that this variable has a lot of different values. The behavior is not consistent. But if it has a low standard deviation, then you can assume that the behavior of this variable is fairly consistent.", "Have you got a friend who is mostly calm, at all times while there is another one who is very moody(sometimes angry, sometimes composed, sometimes indifferent)? You now know whose \u201cstandard deviation\u201d is bigger.", "If a variable has a constant value, what would be its standard deviation? You don't need the formula. It will be 0.", "\u201cAverage\u201d and \u201cDeviations from Average\u201d are 2 things that should be kept in mind while studying a data set.", "Your home for data science.
