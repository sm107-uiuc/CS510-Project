Or let's say if you want to find out the total number of people drinking Starbucks in a day? Are you going to stand out of Starbucks for the entire day and count the people entering Starbucks? Well, that would be absurd and time-consuming! So, here we use Sampling techniques and select a subset of the data to be analyzed. Obtaining the entire set of data of interest is too expensive or time-consuming. Also, it\u2019s time-consuming and expensive to process all the data that is collected. So, using a sampling algorithm can reduce the data size where a better, but the more expensive algorithm can be used. Sampling helps in answering to questions related to Bird counting problem, the number of people surviving an Earthquake.", "The key to an effective sampling is that the sample should work almost as well as using the entire data set. For Starbucks example, if I take only data from 9 am to 11 am then obviously I will have more people drinking Starbucks because it\u2019s morning and people have developed a routine of drinking coffee before going to work in the morning. So, an effective and unbiased approach should be selected to sample from the large dataset which will cover all the variations found in the large dataset.", "A.Random Sampling: For this type of sampling, there is an equal probability of selecting any particular item. E.g: Picking 10 numbers from 1\u2013100. Here, each number has an equal probability of getting picked.", "The type of sampling we use depends a lot on the question we are trying to answer.", "When the population consists of different types of objects with a large number of objects, simple random sampling can fail to represent those types of objects with lesser occurrences. This can cause problems in the analysis because the rare class will not be included in the sample. So, the stratified sampling method is used.", "B. Stratified Sampling: In this type of technique, we sample from a specified group of objects from the entire population. An equal number of objects are drawn from each group even though the groups are of different sizes. Also, there is a variation where the number of objects drawn from each group is proportional to the size of that group. Let\u2019s take a famous Titanic problem where more Female survived than male. So, if we randomly sample male and female then we are going to get a wrong answer and there is going to be an imbalance in our training model. We have to use stratified sampling method where we sample male and female carefully. We can sample male and female depending on their survival.", "Sampling is not always useful. Sometimes there is a loss of information. Determining proper sample size is also very important. People have started using adaptive or progressive sampling. This approach starts with a small sample, and then increase the sample size until a sample of sufficient has been obtained.", "Check out this fine example of how sampling helps when there is a class imbalance:", "Sampling techniques are widely used in solving a variety of problems. Sampling helps in reducing the cost, saves time, helps in the organization of data, it collects intensive and exhaustive data and is suitable when we have limited resources. However, we need domain knowledge to sample from the population. Also, when the units of measurement are not homogeneous, sampling won\u2019t make sense and of course there are chances of bias.", "Your home for data science.
