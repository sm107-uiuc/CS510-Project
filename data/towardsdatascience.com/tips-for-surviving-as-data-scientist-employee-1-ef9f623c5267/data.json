This gives Data Scientists ample opportunities to get in on the ground floor and play a part in guiding an organisation towards a data savvy future.", "I\u2019ve been lucky/masochistic enough to do this with two different companies \u2014 a web design agency and a law firm. In the process I\u2019ve learned a lot about how my field can better serve those working in other areas and bring value to a company. It hasn\u2019t been easy, and there have been times when I\u2019ve missed working alongside my peers. But this baptism of fire can supercharge your learning, broaden your skill-set and give you a chance to make a real difference through data. Here is my perspective on some of the opportunities and pitfalls of being the \u201cdata-guy\u201d.", "Data Science is a well-known term, but it is a little abstract and mysterious to those without a technical background. Your new colleagues might not immediately see your usefulness and how your skills might help them \u2014 they are used to their own ways of doing things and most will happily go on as before given the choice.", "\u2014 you have to become a salesperson, not just for your own skills, but for the entire field of Data Science \u2014", "This isn\u2019t a criticism, it\u2019s just the way human beings are. The onus is on you to make the case for how Data Science can benefit others in their roles. As such, you have to become a salesperson, not just for your own skills, but for the entire field of Data Science.", "An outreach strategy will help you raise your profile within the business and get conversations started about ways you can contribute.", "There\u2019s a lot of hype around Data Science and AI. Companies in all industries are keen to tell the world how much they are investing in Big Data and all the wonderful benefits it\u2019s bringing.", "It serves no-one to promise the impossible and fall short", "For those outside the industry, it can seem like magic. The almost mind-reading capabilities of Facebook and Google, plus stories about AI outperforming humans in an ever-increasing list of tasks \u2014 create a mythology that suggests anything is possible.", "In that context, along with your eagerness to impress in your new role, it\u2019s easy to over-promise. Good work takes time and careful iteration. It serves no-one to promise the impossible and fall short. Once you\u2019ve disappointed someone it\u2019s hard to win them back, so those early pieces of work are crucial to hit out of the park.", "Data science is hard, time-consuming and often frustrating, with no guarantee of getting the answers you want. Communicating the limitations of your field is just as important as communicating the opportunities. Anyone can talk blue-sky brainstorming, but it\u2019s your expertise that tethers that creative thinking to the practical reality. By being honest about what you can achieve in a certain time-frame, you build trusting relationships through which your skills can really shine.", "Even if you do an amazing job in selling and educating people about Data Science, there will be some people who still consider you in the general I.T. bucket. This can mean requests coming to you which don\u2019t push you or make the most of your expertise. For example, I\u2019ve been asked questions about computers not booting up, resetting passwords and editing WordPress pages.", "When you\u2019re new to the role, eager to appear useful and busy, it\u2019s easy to end up accepting work that isn\u2019t really appropriate for you. As such, while it\u2019s important to be approachable and helpful, make sure to be assertive and communicate clearly when a piece of work would be best done by someone else.", "Think carefully before you start about the things you want to be able to achieve in the first 6-12 months. Consult with your manager ahead of time and be informed by the conversations you had around your interview. Nothing puts you on a better footing when starting a new job than having a plan. You\u2019ll need to be agile, as priorities will change as you learn more about the business, but having a list of project ideas will help you gain momentum quickly.", "Early on, you\u2019ll probably notice a heap of things you can easily contribute to. Your new colleagues will have developed their own ways of working with their data. But with the injection of your expertise, there will likely be many ways you can quickly improve things. Simple things like restructuring and adding a few handy formulas to someone\u2019s spreadsheet or writing a little PowerShell script to automate a task can have a big impact on someone\u2019s workweek. These low hanging fruit are great opportunities to immediately prove your worth and start building a network of allies within the business.", "Of course, your primary sponsors in the organisation will likely have been champing at the bit to get you on-board, with a long list of projects to kick start. They hired you because they see the potential for Data Science within the company and will be keen to make the most out of your skill-set. They\u2019ll have their own ideas about what you should be prioritising and it\u2019s important to take on board what they have to say. But they also don\u2019t have your eye for what\u2019s possible and what\u2019s more difficult than they might have thought. So don\u2019t hesitate to be proactive, to push forward your own ideas and try to come up with a plan together.", "When you work for a company specialising in Data Science, or in a team of Data Scientists, you have a network of equally nerdy peers to go to when things get tough. Whenever you need to brainstorm ideas, design solutions or debug work, there is always someone there with the ability to understand and contribute.", "However, if you\u2019re the first Data Scientist on the ground, in the beginning, you\u2019ll be going solo. Those around you might get what you\u2019re up to at a high level, but for anything deeper, you\u2019re on your own. It\u2019s often stressful when you\u2019re struggling against a difficult problem with no-one to get ideas from. Therefore if you can find anyone within the business who has an interest in Data Science, and is wanting to learn and get involved, then encourage and support them.", "I was spoiled in much of my early career by working solely on big data warehouses of financial and sales data. I didn\u2019t have to worry about how the data reached those tables. After moving to a small web-development agency as DS#1, I had to quickly raise my Data Integration game. Data for a project would be scattered across different platforms in various formats. Rather than simply selecting from a couple of tables, I might have to gather data querying MySQL here, PostgreSQL there, looping through paginated API requests or scraping website content. Each system was perfectly well designed for its original function of course, but from a Data Science perspective, it required a lot more work to pull data into a form I could use.", "Performing an audit and sketching out a map of what information is stored where, will act as a useful reference when you\u2019re first exploring the company\u2019s data. It will also open up opportunities to improve data governance and assess data quality.", "If the work you produce is of high quality, people will want more of it and demand will soon outpace the hours in the day. This is a nice problem to have and introduces the opportunity to expand the team.", "With the lack of Data Science peers, assuring quality in your work becomes more difficult. If there isn\u2019t anyone who can understand and question your models, you have to put your own measures in place to keep quality high. Setting standards, using checklists and rigorous unit testing can help you build comfort around the work you\u2019re delivering. But probably the best advice is just to give yourself more time to complete things, allowing yourself to properly mentally process the tasks at hand, and perform thorough testing.", "When you\u2019re surrounded by other Data Scientists, working on dozens of different projects, you learn a great deal passively through pure osmosis. Water-cooler and lunchtime chats are invaluable in learning about interesting new applications and their technical pitfalls. More formalised learning through knowledge-shares and internal training also serves to keep developing and adding new skills to your repertoire.", "As DS#1, it all falls back on you. Whilst the day to day work of establishing data science in a new firm will certainly keep you busy, it\u2019s important to continue investing in your skills and adding strings to your bow. This means putting time into MOOCs, keeping up with industry news and socialising with your professional peers, outside of the 9 to 5.", "It\u2019s important not to fall out of the loop", "Websites such as Meetup, along with Facebook and LinkedIn groups are great ways to meet like-minded people in your city. It\u2019s important not to fall out of the loop and miss out on what your peers are getting excited about. By attending one or two events per month, you\u2019ll be able to keep up with what\u2019s going on in the industry, and avoid becoming isolated within your new role.", "If you work for a medium to large tech company, you\u2019ll be surrounded by a diversity of technical know-how, with clearly delineated roles in many different areas of data science and technology. If your expertise is in one area, there\u2019s enough support around you to stay focused on what you\u2019re good at.", "However, if you\u2019re DS#1, you\u2019ll need to fill out your \u201cstack\u201d of skills. Your new colleagues might not know what Data Integration is, so they sure as hell won\u2019t care if you\u2019ve no experience in it. Using \u201csomeone else used to handle that part\u201d isn\u2019t going to fly. Therefore, upgrading your skills across the entire Data Science process is essential to being able to regularly deliver valuable work.", "My first few months as DS#1 proved a baptism of fire, but I probably learned more in that period than at any other in the rest of my career.", "While there are many attempts to define the \u201cData Science Process\u201d, the following components are commonly referenced:", "For a more in depth explanation, I recommend this article by Chanin Nantasenamat.", "You will likely have a very different background to those you will be working with. This means there may be big differences culturally between the way they work and the way you\u2019re used to doing things. Rather than bulldozing your way in and working the way you always have, it\u2019s important to tune in to the working culture and adapt to your new environment.", "We may be members of the \u201csexiest profession of the 21st century \u201d, with companies like Facebook and Google setting new standards for working life. But the Silicon Valley way isn\u2019t the only way, and a square peg isn\u2019t going to fit into a round hole. Your work will only bring value by being sensitive to the culture and making it easy for others to benefit from.", "Moving from a Retail Analytics firm into commercial litigation, one of the things that struck me was the change in pace. In Retail, everything is moving at a frantic speed, turning around multiple pieces of analysis each week. When I arrived at the law firm, I\u2019d ask people when they wanted to see results, and the deadlines would be months, if not years away. At the same time, the need for quality and confidence in the analysis I\u2019m providing is much higher. If my work is going to be relied on in court, it needs to be absolutely watertight.", "This has led to a slower, more considered, test driven approach to work, with rigorous documentation and clear communication of the quality standards put in place. Without this adjustment, it\u2019s likely my colleagues wouldn\u2019t feel as comfortable using my work.", "I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed these tips based on my experience of being the first data scientist at a couple of different companies. Whilst it can be difficult at times, getting in at the ground floor for Data Science is a rewarding challenge that pushes your skills to a higher level. I\u2019d recommend it to anyone.", "Data scientist, computer programmer and all-round geek with 10 years of using data in finance, retail and legal industries.
