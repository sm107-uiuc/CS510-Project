But I needed some money and heard that work was good for you. Reagan was going to spend the Soviet Union into the Stone Age, so there was a boom in hiring in the defense industry. Thus, I stumbled into Data Science and a front row seat of History.", "The McDonnell Douglas Missiles and Space Division (MDAC) had not hired anyone since the end of the Apollo program, when they hired about 40 of us fresh out of college. The staff didn\u2019t really know what to do with us \u2018Young Turks,\u2019 and they had trouble disciplining us as they kind of thought of us as their kids (some of which we ended up dating). But they proceeded to teach us everything they knew. Our Rabbi was Dr. Stan Sholar, who produced a course on \u201cStatistical Decision Theory\u201d (nowadays called Decision Science).", "These guys were Old School. Most of them had been in the military and obtained their Masters or Ph.D.\u2019s under the GI bill. Many still had slide rules in their desk drawers and hard-copies of their programs (decks of IBM punch cards) in metal filing cabinets. One co-worker was on the bomb crew for the Enola Gay. Another was the only surviving pilot of a carrier squadron in the Korean war. We had a retirement party for a guy who had worked at Douglas Aircraft for 45 years! He had started in high school, as a riveter on B-17s. (We spray-painted a Swatch gold, as his farewell gift.)", "I was 6 years old when I made my parents take me to see 2001: A Space Odyssey. I stayed up nights to watch every, single moon landing. The Huntington Beach plant made the third stage of the Apollo rocket. When NASA decided to end the Moon program, there were going to be a few left-over Saturn rockets. If we were no longer going all the way to the Moon, the third stage is just cargo. In 1962, MDAC had submitted a proposal to convert the Saturn IV Oxygen tank into crew living quarters (the fuel tank was essentially the toilet)\u00b9 (Fig. 2). Folk lore had it that the proposal was drafted on a cocktail napkin, which if not true, was almost true. Werner von Braun had proposed a similar approach in his notebook (Fig. 3).", "But, there was not much going on with the Space Program at first, so I was assigned to the Ballistic Missile Defence Program.", "My first boss, Harlan Romberg \u2014 was 30 years my senior and had a Ph.D. (30% of the staff had PhDs.) He sat me down to explain Game Theory and how our job was to make the odds so uncertain the Russkies would never consider a nuclear war. He quoted WarGames, \u201cStrange game\u2026 nobody wins.\u201d (Fig. 4) He also told me Americans could easily fight off a Russian invasion by driving all our cars into them. He was full of stuff like this.", "Then, I was placed in the \u201cDeep Freeze\u201d for 5 months, while I waited for my secret security clearance. So, I read Aviation Week every week, cover to cover. Dr. Romberg would drop by from time to time, to give me tutorials and unclassified problems to play with. He gave me a 20-page photocopy of \u201cHow I learned to stop worrying and love matrix inversion,\u201d (Kalman Filtering \u2014 more about that later). He spent a majority of his days with pen and paper, deriving efficient ways to invert matrices.", "I was young and restless, so I complained that I had nothing interesting to do. Dr. Romberg told me, \u201cIf there was something interesting to do, I\u2019d being doing it, not you.\u201d He also gave me a great piece of career advice:", "\u201cBoy, your problem is you were never in the Navy\u2026\u201d", "I was expecting to hear about duty, honour, discipline, respect or some such thing. He continued, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how stupid people really are. I ran the medical dispensary \u2014 every time we went to port, a third of the crew got the clap. Look around you; this place is paradise!\u201d", "The BMD program dated back to the 1960\u2019s and was managed by the US Army, out of Huntsville, Alabama (lovingly dubbed \u201cHuntspatch\u201d). Missiles were fired from Vandenberg AFB, CA to Kwajalein Atoll in Micronesia, a US protectorate. Why fire missiles at an Atoll? First, they told me, because there is hardly anything there at all. Second, inside the ring of islands, the ocean was no more than 200 feet deep, so divers could recover any warheads or telemetry. The islands were littered with radars from previous programs, most facing East \u2014 towards Vandenberg. There was a joke going around that when Skylab came crashing back down to Earth from the West, Kwaj was in the flight path, so it would have blindsided them.", "There are a few things everyone needs to know about incoming ballistic missiles. Warheads are cone-shaped for re-entry (Fig. 5). They are given a spin when released (like a rifle bullet), for stability. (The early Russian warheads were not; consequently, they would tumble through the atmosphere and often miss their targets by a 100 miles.) As they hit denser and denser atmosphere, their trajectory slows, they heat up, and they precess like a top.", "Our current project was to design the Terminal Imaging Radar, a giant phased array radar, which would track, discriminate, and target incoming warheads. What you need to know about radars: First, you don\u2019t passively watch a phased-array radar (like the spinning ones in the movies); you use it to interrogate space with pulses. There are several types of pulses, from simple search, to tracking, to powerful \u2018imaging\u2019 pulses (a radar-photo of the object). The more information you need, the more powerful the pulse needs to be. As a result, measurements are irregularly timed and opportunistic, having to schedule pulses and receive return signals as they can. Lastly, the units of measurement were meters/sec (velocity), kilo-feet (altitude), and nautical miles (longitude and latitude).", "With a physical model for the ballistics of an object, it is not only possible to track and predict its trajectory, you can also determine whether it is a threat or a decoy. Smaller mass decoys would lose velocity faster and have higher precession frequencies, or have smaller radar signatures than the real thing. The sequence of radar returns can then be fed into a model and estimates of all the physical variables updated with each new piece of information. This is what the Kalman filter was for\u00b2\u00b3\u2074. It is a foundational algorithm for missile guidance and essential for getting us to the Moon. It\u2019s wider application into other commercial solutions (like self-driving cars) was decades off. Another legacy from radar to data science is the ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristics), which remains the best way to assess statistical model performance, rather than the annoying confusion matrix, which only looks at one point on the curve\u2026and takes about 20 minutes to explain.", "The pure engineering culture nourished eccentricity. One of the directors commuted from Catalina island on a jet boat. Another was an amateur magician. Another competed on American Gladiator. One of the Young Turks went surfing every lunch, so he always smelled of kelp. Unfortunately for the rest of us in an after-lunch meeting, his sinuses emptied onto the conference table. The Director, \u201cDub\u201d Egbert had given up smoking, picking up the peculiar habit of constantly chewing scotch tape. He had a birthday gift in his office \u2014 a giant reel of tape, marked on the side with a sharpie, \u201cchewing tape.\u201d But, the BMD team was special, partly because of Kwaj.", "Most everyone in the BMD team had had 18-month offshore assignments on Kwajalein. After 17 months, one would have a 510 days party, meaning they became eligible for no US tax (income tax from The Marshall Islands was only 5%). Some people called it paradise. Others likened it to South Pacific, without the jungle, Bali Hai, Bloody Mary, or nurses. It was obvious that it had a special place in the hearts of those who had stayed for a full 18 months. Everyone had to develop an interest in sailing or Scuba diving, or lose their mind.", "One employee possibly had. Unbeknownst to everyone, he had taken a hatchet, hacked down a palm tree, and built a dug-out canoe to sail in. (Perhaps he was trying to escape.) He was testing it on the day of a launch, but the mast broke, stranding him in the lagoon in front of the phased-array radar. If it had been turned on, he would have been cooked in minutes. The launch had to be cancelled, at considerable expense.", "When people returned from Kwaj, they were not quite the same. My officemate had spent too much time there, and he lost the habit of wearing shoes and socks and lived on his sailboat. Hawaiian shirts were acceptable work dress. We had a meeting with the Army, and the general had an array of embroidered commendation ribbons sewn onto the breast of his favourite Hawaiian shirt. My new boss, Flint Smith, convinced me to drink the Kool-Aid, so I enrolled in a PADI open water certification, taught by another MDAC engineer. As a bonus, I got to go diving in the underwater test facility with the lights out, an experience any SCUBA diver would envy. I also received $1.25 hazard pay.", "Once the radar project ended, I wanted to go work on my first love, the Space Station. One of the old-guard pulled me aside and said, \u201cNASA? You don\u2019t want to work for NASA. It\u2019s all elbows and assholes over there \u2026 and \u2014 mark my words \u2014 sooner or later the Space Shuttle is going to blow up, and sure enough there is gonna\u2019 be some lady schoolteacher on board when it happens.\u201d", "Aerospace was not really private industry \u2014 all our \u201ccustomers\u201d were branches of US Government. The Aerospace Corporation was essentially a subsidiary of the Air Force. Hughes Aircraft down the road was a non-profit, as was the RAND Corporation (a Douglas Aircraft spinoff). There was a lot of complaining then and now about $700 coffee makers, but who in their right mind would go to a missile factory and order 10 custom coffee makers (with full documentation of where all the parts were manufactured and sourced)?", "The Government is good at spending other people\u2019s money \u2014 spending it wisely \u2014 not so much. (I doubt the situation has improved since government spending was re-branded as government investment.) With the Space Shuttle, NASA had somehow come up with the most expensive way to put things in orbit, while the Soviets were mass producing 1950\u2019s rockets, fuelled with kerosene. Everyone in the industry knew this and cringed, but with NASA, \u2018the customer is always right.\u2019", "All capital investment was essentially government property. We had a 60-foot deep cylindrical swimming pool, with a circular railroad on the floor (serving as a \u2018wind tunnel\u2019 for torpedoes). After that contract was over, NASA was using it as a zero-gravity test environment for the Space Station program. The building used to construct the third stage of the Saturn rocket was converted into an auto-service garage for the fleet vehicles. It was weird to see cars up on hydraulic pistons, with 100-foot ceilings, and the rain pouring in as the doors couldn\u2019t be closed.", "Documentation had a productivity hit. But secrecy was the real killer. Any \u201cVault Project\u201d (literally working behind a bank vault door, with no email, phone, or windows) doubled or trebled the cost of getting anything done. Conscious or not, Soviet spying worked, causing us to limit the free exchange of information, like them. Confident Libertarians at the time argued that we should abandon classified work altogether, as there is no way in hell the communists would be able to keep up with \u2018real\u2019 Capitalism. (At the time, most of Europe couldn\u2019t compete with real Capitalism).", "But have no fear, taxpayers, we had regular government efficiency audits. If you were sitting at your desk, you pass. If you went to the computer center, library, or toilet, without leaving a note, you fail. And, yes: the government efficiency auditor was two people - one had a clipboard.", "We had timecards, but they only took 5 minutes to fill out. There was no ancillary management staff to complicate the billing process. We worked from 8.5 to 4.2 (8:30 to 4:12 \u201cMetric Time,\u201d with 0.7 hours for lunch). Unfortunately, they had thrown away the 1970\u2019s Metric Clocks. The secretaries had special machines, called Wang \u201cword processors.\u201d When I saw what they could do, I asked if I could borrow one to write my report. The answer was no, \u201cthey are afraid if they let the engineers use them, they all will want one.\u201d On the other hand, we had this thing called e-mail, 10 years before places like McKinsey ever heard of it\u2075.", "There were no service managers, resource managers, or business \u2018translators.\u2019 I remember us circulating an Economist article, discussing what an MBA was good for. Presentations were university style, maybe with a handout for very technical topics. There was not a soul in the room who couldn\u2019t read a ROC curve or didn\u2019t know what a Laplace transform was. My boss, on completion of his presentation, handed out a quiz to the executives, to see if they understood the content. Encouragingly, the highest score was from the Senior Director \u2014 none other than the tape-chewing, Dub Egbert. Imagine anything like that happening in today\u2019s consulting culture.", "And everybody actually worked. Well, except on Fridays, which started with lunch happy hour and ended with vacation planning. Everyone\u2019s office either had a map of the desert (for off-roading/camping) or a dive map on their wall. We would donate blood Friday mornings, to get a better buzz at lunch.", "As I left MDAC, to take my 10-year vow of poverty in academia, we started another uniquely Southern California tradition, with one last homage to Dr. Strangelove \u2014 Riding the Grasshopper (Fig. 6).", "But the things I learned at MDAC followed me throughout my career. I ended up doing my thesis research under Hans Bremermann, a pioneer in genetic algorithms and neural networks\u2076, whose funding throughout the \u201cAI Dark Age\u201d came from another highly innovative defense agency \u2014 the Office of Naval Research (ONR). My first paper (perhaps ironically) used the same technologies to discriminate seismic signals for the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Program\u2077. I think I have the only Bioengineering dissertation from UCSF with a map of the Nevada nuclear test site. As a postdoc at Los Alamos, we applied these methods to Credit Risk.", "The collapse of the Soviet Union was bad news for Southern California. What were they all going to do, deprived of a worthy adversary? Like the end of the Moon race, it was a tough time to be a Physicist of Engineer. Jobs disappeared overnight. It was the 1970\u2019s all over again\u2078. Maybe worse, as a flood of Eastern European scientists fled West. San Diego fell into a deep recession. The General Dynamics factory became an airport parking lot. Having worked for the defense industry was \u2018resume stain.\u2019", "Of course, many of the young Turks found their way to SpaceX. Elon Musk apparently shared our disappointment in the Space Race, \u201cWe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.\u201d SpaceX and Blue Horizon can now put cargo into orbit at 1/3 the price of the government-run operations (Russia, China, US, France/EU), suggesting the Libertarians were right all along.", "In 1986, TRW was downsizing. A research team headed by UCSD Professor Robert Hecht-Nielsen and Todd Gutschow had been working on neural networks and pattern recognition. The two created a start-up, with the blessing of TRW, $2MM investment, and one of their senior executives, Bob North. (For those in the Decision Science world, TRW also ran a credit bureau, which they spun off as TransUnion.) Shortly after, HNC launched what was to become the first billion-dollar neural network product, Falcon\u2079.", "Falcon is essentially a missile tracking algorithm, analogous to a Kalman filter, which updates customer state estimates with each transaction and uses a neural network to discriminate fraudulent activity\u2079. I was hired by HNC in 1998, partly because I had more-or-less guessed the design of Falcon in the interview. Of course, model performance was measured using a ROC curve. After 20 years, Falcon still dominates the market, outperforming dozens of competitors who claim to do AI\u00b9\u2070. HNC alumni (the \u201cHNC Mafia\u201d) went on to found over 170 start-ups\u00b9\u00b9.", "In 1988, BMD program successfully intercepted a missile with a direct physical hit (literally hitting a bullet with a bullet), scaring the piss out of the Russians\u00b9\u00b2. Though my contribution was nonexistent, I was proud. There was noise at the time that this was \u201cFake News,\u201d that the US was provoking the Soviet Union, that the experiment had been rigged with telemetry, and so on. But it was clear we were decades ahead of the Soviet Union.", "Legend has it that in a meeting with US diplomats in 1972, Zhou Enlai was asked what was the significance of the French Revolution. His answer was, \u201cIt is too early to say.\u00b9\u00b3 But the jury was out on Communism long before the Opening of China. In case you missed it in class, communism was not just a deeply-flawed economic model; it was a criminal enterprise that enslaved and murdered millions of people\u00b9\u2074. The efforts of the BMD teams may have contributed to shortening this dark history. Maybe we wasted some money, but precious few lives.", "I was privileged to have worked at both MDAC and HNC.
