In addition, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna stated that the company will be removing itself from the facial recognition technology business after major concerns being raised over the years.", "Krishna released the following statement regarding the usage of IBM\u2019s technology:", "\u201cIBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and principles of trust and transparency\u201d", "While this is most definitely a step in the right direction, it does not remove the extremely worrisome past that IBM has had with regards to the utilization and development of facial recognition technologies.", "IBM has had a very interconnected relationship and history with the NYPD, specifically in regards to the police department\u2019s desire to flood New York with surveillance cameras across the entirety of the city.", "The NYPD\u2019s fascination with surveilling the activities of ordinary New York residents resulted in the cooperation with IBM with regards to developing technology that would allow the NYPD to sort individuals recorded by skin colour. This was all conducted through a secret partnership and was only made public through the obtainment of \u201cconfidential corporate documents\u201d by The Intercept.", "Given the state of racial tension and systemic racism within the United States, this type of partnership is especially destructive for people of colour. The United Kingdom\u2019s largest police force, the Metropolitan Police, conducted a test with facial recognition technologies. The Independent found that \u201c98 per cent of alerts generated\u201d were false positives according to the report.", "Very similar results occurred with the usage of such technology by another police force in the United Kingdom, the South Wales Police. According to the same article by The Independent, the system \u201creturned more than 2,400 false positives in 15 deployments since June 2017\u201d and only found that \u201c234 alerts \u2014 fewer than 10 per cent\u201d were actually correct at the time of publication.", "Biometric data extraction is conducted through the following steps according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) via the Iowa Department of Transportation and in regards to fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses:", "Facial recognition technologies have been criticized for their lack of usefulness and ability to generate true positives for years now. IBM\u2019s shift towards abandoning the industry is a positive move as mentioned earlier, but it does not demonstrate a permanent move, leaving the doors open for the company to return publicly if warranted.", "In regards to symbolic gestures, this is, of course, a positive development. However, the faults of police and state organizations are still present and there is little to nothing stopping police departments like the NYPD from enlisting the support of other companies similar to IBM for the production of facial recognition and artificial intelligence technologies. According to a paper done by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP), the \u201clargest non-Chinese supplier of AI surveillance tech is Japan\u2019s NEC Corporation\u201d to 14 countries as of publication in September 2019.", "Clearview AI, the lucrative company responsible for developing applications regarding facial recognition and being at the forefront of potentially eliminating privacy \u201cas we know it\u201d according to The New York Times has been in the news recently with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic and the protests against institutional racism in the United States. Clearview AI has consistently sold facial recognition technologies over the course of the last few years to foreign governments, \u201cdomestic law enforcement\u201d, and more, prompting concerns to be raised.", "The lack of functionality of facial recognition technologies should be enough to not have it be used in public, but it would not be surprising to see it become even more of a utilized tool after the protests that have engulfed the country over the last couple of weeks.", "While IBM has officially stopped the production of these technologies, departments such as the NYPD still have access to the developments made via the partnership with IBM over the course of the last 15 years or so and it should not be surprising if IBM decides to eventually return to the industry in the future.", "Your home for data science.
