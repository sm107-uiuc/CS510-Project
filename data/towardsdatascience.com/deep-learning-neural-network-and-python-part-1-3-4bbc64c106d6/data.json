The first one will cover the meaning of neural networks through a mathematical and statistical perspective.", "The next one is an operating mode on creating a neural network using TensorFlow package to tackle a basic case of image detection easily. The last one will be an example of using deep learning and neural network to solve a finance case and predict the variation of the market.", "Back in the 50s, history of artificial neural networks and psychologists like Frank Rosenblatt focused on understanding the human brain. Initially, they were designed to mathematically model the processing of information similarly to biological neural networks found in a mammal\u2019s cortex. Today, their natural realism is irrelevant, and it is instead their effectiveness in modelling complex and nonlinear relationships made them successful.", "Mostly, neural networks are nothing but a way to build parametric models, for which the decision function is explicit. Unlike other parametric algorithms such as linear regression, they make it easy to create complex and nonlinear models.", "Let us start smoothly, a Perceptron, this neural network composed of a single layer, was invented by Rosenblatt cited earlier.", "The perceptron is formed by the first layer of units(or neurons), which allow the user to \u201cread\u201d the data: each unit corresponds to one of the input variables. We can add a bias unit that is always enabled (1 is always transmitted). These units are connected to a single output unit, which receives the sum of the units connected to it, leisured by the connection weights, for p variables x1,x2,\u2026,xp ; the output unit receives the initial weight (w0) and the sum of weights (w1 to wp) multiplied by their variables (x1 to xp). The output unit then applies an activation function to this event.", "A perceptron thus predicted by a decision function f defined by:", "This function has an explicit form; it is indeed a parametric model.", "In the case of a regression, it is not necessary to convert the weighted sum received as an input. The activation function is the identity function; it returns what it has been shared in its totality.", "In the case of binary classification, the user can use a threshold function of this type:", "As in the case of logistic regression, we can also use a sigmoid function to predict the probability of belonging to the positive class:", "In the situation of a multi-layer classification, the user will have to change the architecture of perceptron. Instead of using a single output unit, it will use as many as classes. Each of these units will be connected to all input devices. Therefore, the remained will be k. (p + 1) connection weights, where k is the number of classes.", "Can then be used as the activation function Softmax. This is a generalization of the sigmoid equation, which can also be written :", "If the output for class k is sufficiently more significant than other classes, its activation will be close to 1 (while activating others will be close to 0). We consider that this is a way to work similarly to the support vector machine algorithm, which will make the training more understandable.", "Now let\u2019s discover how to train a Perceptron :)", "The first question which comes in mind is: how to determine the connection weights?", "To train a perceptron, we will seek to minimize the prediction error on the training data set. We could do that explicitly, as in the case of the least-squares method for linear regression.", "Neural networks are supposed to be flexible, which means, they are continually adapting, depending on the signals they receive. So, let us assume that our n observation x(1),x(2)\u2026,x(n) are not observed simultaneously but sequentially, one after another.", "Thus neural networks are trained by algorithms called online learning, as opposed to models that we have seen so far, which are train by batch learning. An intermediate solution is to consider that the observations are executed step by step, called mini-batch learning.", "According to the previous statement, we can assume that perceptron\u2019s training is an iterative process. After each observation, the user will adjust the weight of connections (w1 to wp) to reduce the perceptron's prediction error at this time (T0). To solve it, we will use the gradient algorithm: Gradient giving us the direction of the more considerable variation of the function (in our case, the error function). To find the minimum, the user must move in the opposite direction to the gradient. (When the function is minimized locally, its gradient is 0.)", "The user will start randomly selecting initial values (w0(0) 0,w1(0) to wp(0)) of our connection\u2019s weights. Then, after each observation (x(i),y(i)), the user will apply to each of the weight the following updated rule appearing on the graph.", "We can iterate as many times over the data set. Usually, we choose to iterate, either until the algorithm converges (the gradient is sufficiently close to 0) or, more commonly, for a fixed number of iterations.", "\u03b7 hyperparameter is a factor of neural network, called learning rate.", "If \u03b7 is large, we are getting further from the optimum. If this was already close to the optimal value, we may exceed our goal and wj (t + 1)be beyond its optimum. The algorithm may diverge, which means, getting far away from the optimal solution.", "Otherwise, if wj(t)is far from its optimal value and \u03b7 is low; the algorithm will take a massive amount of time to converge.", "Therefore, it is crucial to choose the speed of learning.", "In the case of regression, we will choose the squared error (as linear regression). The error function is defined as follows:", "In the case of classification, we will select the cross-entropy. In the binary case, the cross-entropy is defined by :", "The cross-entropy is a little more complicated to differentiate than the squared error methodology, but we can determine after some calculations that the connection weight update rule can be simplified as :", "And this is true for the multiclass version of the cross-entropy as well.", "The perceptron is essentially a linear model. His modelling capability is necessarily limited, which has been the source of a certain disenchantment with the scientific community in early 1970. In a famous 1969 book on the subject, mathematician and educator Seymour Papert and cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky even mention their intuition of the uselessness of extending the perceptron multi-layer\u2026 history will harm their architectures!", "How to create such an architecture?", "We will create an hidden layers between the input layer and the output (see graph above). Each neuron of a layer is connected to all the neurons of the layer above it. We call it, a multi-layer perceptron or \u201cMLP\u201d.", "Let\u2019s take the example of a perceptron with a single hidden layer. The output zh of the neuron number h, of the hidden layer, is obtained by applying the activation function of the neuron to a linear combination of inputs:", "The output is then received by applying the activation function of the output neuron to the linear combination of the outputs of the hidden layer (That can sound weird I know):", "Suppose we used the logistic function \u03c3 : u \u21a6 1/(1+e-u) as the activation function for all neurons, then:", "We can all conclude that it is a parametric model (we can explicitly write the decision function as a function of input variables), but it is not linear at all!", "This parametric model has even more settings (connection weight) than hidden layers and neurons, in these layers. More we include parameters, and longer it takes observation to avoid over-training, and deep neural networks often require massive amounts of data to increase the model accuracy.", "To improve efficiency, we often use as activation function, interlayers function. The hyperbolic tangent function converts the linear combination of input signals, into a number between -1 and 1 rather than between 0 and 1.", "Various types of architectures can be designed, this is just an example. In the following example, all the connections come from the lower layers to the upper layers, but this is not necessarily the case. This type of conception without a back loop to the lower layers is called a feed-forward architecture.", "A result due to Cybenko in 1989 (refined by Hornik 1991) tells us that every continuous function f defined on \u211d can be approximated with arbitrary precision by a neural network formed by a single hidden layer (if using a sufficient number of neurons in that layer).", "This is an extremely encouraging result: we can now model any function! However, this result is to moderate by the practice: the number of neurons needed in this hidden layer is, in many cases, colossal, making neural networks with one hidden layer ineffective.", "The solution is to stack the hidden layers, creating what is now called a deep neural network. This is the deep learning that shows its face!", "A multi-layer neural network can be interpreted by assuming that each hidden layer's output is another way to represent data. The strength of multi-layer neural networks is the ability to learn \u201cgood\u201d representation. Representation such as the linear model (Perceptron) between the last hidden layer and the output can be effective.", "As for the perceptron, we will use an iterative algorithm based on the gradient one. For calculation purposes, we will use an idea of \u200b\u200bback-propagation, set out for the first time (outside the field of neural networks) in the 1960s and popularized in connectionist by Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams 1986.", "The concept is to divide the error through the chain rule theorem:", "In the network, located at a hidden layer, the partial derivative of the error E based on the weight whj can be written :", "The last two terms are simple to calculate because the derivative of the logistic function \u03c3 is u\u21a6\u03c3(u)(1-\u03c3(u))u\u2019 :", "The partial derivative of the error with respect to a weight of a lower layer can therefore be calculated by solving the partial derivative of the error with respect to the decision function and the partial derivatives of the outputs (f, or z in this example single layer) with respect to the preceding layers (x or z in this example).", "Updating weights can therefore be done by alternating a forward phase (or uplink), wherein the outputs of the intermediate layers are updated, and a backward phase (or downlink), wherein the error gradient relative to the weight of a layer can be calculated from the gradient of the error with respect to the weight of an upper layer. The updating weight is at the time of the descending phase (after the necessary gradient has been calculated).", "The back-propagation algorithm allows learning multi-layer neural networks, for which it is not known explicitly optimize the model parameters. Unfortunately, this algorithm has several limitations, and we must be careful in handling it. This is why neural networks are returned to fashion in 2006, when Hinton works, and combined with the computing power of modern computers, helped overcome some difficulties. It is currently still evolving field!", "Unfortunately, the derivatives of the error function used in a network of multi-layer neurons are generally poorly conditioned. This means that if we disturb a little bit the initial conditions of our algorithm, the result will differ. In practice, it shows in that the error function is a bit more tricky than expected.", "Having a gradient equal to zero does not mean an optimum!", "Thus, a multi-layer neural network's error function admits a large number of local minima, that is to say, points that are optimal in their neighbourhood. These points are located in wells. These points are not global minimum, but the gradient algorithm can remain \u201cstuck\u201d in such an area.", "The initialization of connection weights, standardization of variables, the choice of the speed of learning, and the activation function all impact the ability of a multi-layer neural network to find a reasonable minimum. Using learning algorithms, mini-batch, or adaptive learning speed can overcome this problem in part.", "In the multi-layered architectures, the gradient tends to be more and smaller when you go down the hidden layers from the output to the input of the network. This means that the neurons of the lower layers learn much more slowly than those of higher layers. We call it, the phenomenon of gradient disappearance.", "Conversely, it is also possible that the gradient takes substantial values \u200b\u200bin the lower layers, the so-called exploding gradient.", "What is essential is that the gradient is unstable. This instability is related to the fact that the gradient of the lower layers is a product of the high layers in the back-propagation.", "Saturation is a phenomenon that occurs when most network logistic activation neurons have an output of 0 or 1 (-1 and +1 for a hyperbolic tangent activation), ie when the weighted sum of the signals they receive input is too large (in absolute value). This means that the connection weights are too large. At this point, a small change in the input data will have almost no impact on the output, and the network can not learn (or very slowly). Besides, a network is often saturated in a situation of over-learning \u2026", "One of the strategies that can be used to avoid over-training is regularization. Yes, as for linear regression! We even use the same as for regularizing ridge regression: the l2 norm connection weight. Check this standard makes it possible to control the absolute value of the weight, avoiding the weighted pre-activation amounts are too large. In the world of neural networks, this technique is called weight decay.", "\u00b7 The perceptron makes parametric learning models based on a linear variable combination.", "\u00b7 The perceptron makes learning regression models (the activation function is the identity) of binary classification (the activation function is the logistic function) or multi-class classification (the activation function is the softmax function).", "\u00b7 The perceptron is driven by iterative updates to its weight through the gradient algorithm. The same weight update rule applies in the case of regression, the binary classification or multi-class classification.", "\u00b7 Stacking perceptrons in a multi-layer neural network (feed-forward) allows modelling arbitrarily complex functions. This is what gives the deep neural network predictive power currently makes them successful.", "\u00b7 The drive of these networks is effected by back-propagation. Warning, this algorithm does not necessarily converge, and not necessarily to the optimal solution!", "\u00b7 The more parameters (ie connection weight), the longer it takes data to learn the values \u200b\u200bof these parameters without risking over-learning.", "\u00b7 There are many other neural network architectures than the one presented here and for modelling particular types of data (images, sounds, time dependencies \u2026).", "Activation function: In a neural network, the activation function is responsible for transforming the summed weighted input from the node into the activation of the node or output for that input.", "Perceptron: In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers.", "Variable: A variable is a quantity that may change within the context of a mathematical problem or experiment.
