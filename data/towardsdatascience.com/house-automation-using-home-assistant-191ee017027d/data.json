It can make our lives easier and enable my laziness. \ud83d\ude42 As a teenager, my bedroom had the ultimate luxury: an LCD monitor on the ceiling to watch movies, rock concerts and play PC games all day and night without even having to sit up.", "When my wife and I bought our first home last year, I knew I wanted to indulge in some quality home automation. The engineer in me demanded a system that was:", "1. Opensource2. Privacy focused3. Geared towards quick setup and user-friendly customization4. Lets me get under the hood when I want to code and develop custom features", "Could there even be such a system? I did extensive research online and evaluated many private cloud automation systems. Eventually, I found the perfect match called Home Assistant.", "Not only is Home Assistant a privacy-first opensource home automation system, but it also has a great community of fantastic people who build and support robust integrations for a plethora of popular smart devices. This was a huge advantage for me as a new home automation user just putting my toe in the water. I invested in home automation hardware based on the Home Assistant user community\u2019s suggestions and integration plugins that were already developed.", "I realized that as important as the hardware and existing integrations were, the server that Home Assistant runs on is equally important.", "Home Assistant runs on a Raspberry Pi or a local server. I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 Starter Kit from canakit.", "I connected it to my router\u2019s ethernet and installed Hassio from this source. Hassio only runs the Home Assistant software on the Pi, allowing the software full use of its resources. Without competition from other software, it can run 24/7. I also took the measure to securely expose my Hassio instance to the web on a custom port and turned on two factor authentication and https to make secure connections to it.", "My wife and I started buying smart LED lights as the first step towards automation. We wanted a lighting system that turned on and off automatically as our needs shift from room to room. We also wanted soft lighting to help us wind down after a long day and wake up without harsh, blinding lights. I researched quite a few systems and ended up with Philips Hue. The Philips system has a wide range of bulb sizes and a hub that connects them all together. Admittedly, there are cheaper smart lights options on the market, I feel we made the best decision between price and performance. The Hue hub connects via LAN and there is no need to expose your hub to the internet unless you want to enable geo-fencing with your smart phone (I\u2019ll touch more on this later). I also bought several Philips Hue motion sensors for strategic points in our home which work really well with the lights. We said good-bye to using traditional wall switches and began to embrace the automation.", "I also wanted all my outdoor lights to come on at sunset and turn off before sunrise. It made sense to link the Philips Hue hub to Hassio. Hassio has a great plugin for node-red that lets you drag, drop and wire together flows using a GUI to quickly and intuitively setup events. I added the plugin\u2019s timer functionality to turn my outdoor lights on and off at the appropriate time. Viola! No more switches for our outdoor lights. If I want to take back control from the motion detectors and timers, Hassio\u2019s app for iPhone and Android allows me to control the Philips Hub remotely.", "We share our home with a puppy and two birds. After a brief scare last year that involved our neighbors, a panicked drive home from work, and a faulty detector, we decided to prioritize automation of our smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Automation has an added benefit of knowing what\u2019s going on at home even when you\u2019re travelling.", "I believe that traditional smoke and CO alarms provide limited benefit if they are unable to alert a person present in the house or local fire and emergency responders. However, you can get false positives and then the fire department at your door over a slice of burnt toast. This lack of precision and control is frustrating. We selected the First Alert Z-Wave Enabled Battery Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Combo Alarm after some research. It felt like a good choice as they were relatively low cost and also had smart altering capabilities.", "However, they can\u2019t connect to Hassio directly. These alarms needed a z-wave receiver to connect to Hassio to receive alerts and report them in real-time. I did some more research on the helpful Hassio forum and found Zoos Z-Wave S2 USB Stick which was very simple to integrate. All I had to do was plug in the USB device to my Raspberry Pi and Hassio detected it automatically. After this I had to get pair my First Alert devices to one at a time. Admittedly, this took some trial and error, especially in order to map the names of the multiple smoke alarms to the z-wave nodes and label them correctly by location.", "It took a solid afternoon, but now they work without a flaw, reporting their status as idle or active at regular intervals. Each alarm also reports the time of the status and their current battery level. This is a huge advantage by itself: taking the guess work out of replacing batteries when they are low and helping us know these devices are reporting frequently and not malfunctioning. I also wired up notification services in node-red to send me an email and alert me on my phone when the status on the detectors changes from idle to fire or carbon monoxide alerts. The system got a great test: my wife set off an alarm accidentally while cooking. I was outside and immediately got an alert on my phone. Problem solved!", "Next time an alert happens I can quickly peek at my motion sensor temperature events for each room. If it\u2019s a false positive, I can hush the alarms. If it\u2019s a genuine alert, I can call the local fire department no matter where I am on the planet.", "Inspired by James Bond villains and their uber-cool liars equipped with CCTV footage from multiple cameras, I decided to invest in a robust home security camera system for indoor and outdoor use. I wanted something that would detect movement, alert me, record the feed, save it locally, rely as little as possible on the cloud, and be cheap and easy to integrate. Yi Home Indoor and Outdoor Cameras fit the bill both in terms of budget and in terms of storage and detection. They let you store a generous amount of footage on each camera\u2019s SD card. They also have night vision that enables round-the-clock motion detection. It took me a while to install the outdoor ones. They need a wired power source and it took a while to determine the most advantageous place to mount them. It was worth the planning: I managed to cover all corners of my house.", "I plan to create more smart reporting with alerting in the future via Hassio but this was a solid first step. Some additional indoor cameras help keep an eye on the birds and the puppy, making sure they are safe and not up to any general mischief when we were away. The takeaway here? Simply more peace of mind.", "Hassio\u2019s smart phone companion app let you report your location securely via web-hooks from your device to the Hassio home server. It\u2019s very easy to set this up via the app. It works nicely with Hassio zones which are geo-fences that let you track where the devices are. I paired my and my wife\u2019s phone to Hassio and setup flows on node-red to reliably track our devices. I enabled a variable that sets to Home when at least one of us are at home. If we are both away it sets to Away mode.", "This home vs away detection really opens the door for so many additional automations. For example: we don\u2019t want the motion sensors to turn on the indoor lights if our dog sets them off while we are away. We want the garage doors to automatically close if we forget to close them when we are both away. If we are away over a certain time threshold, vacation mode should automatically activate to turn lights on randomly during evenings to simulate people are at home, etc, etc. The list of automation possibilities are limited only by your imagination!", "I have always liked Slack\u2019s notification capabilities and used them extensively at work. Hassio apps have notification features but they are not as feature rich and detailed in comparison to Slack. I wanted a more verbose notification system to hit me real-time with whatever was going on at home over a channel which I would usually mute but browse through when I wanted to. I also wanted another minimal notification of the essential things my wife and I need to know that are going on in the house over the course of a day. And of course, a red alert channel for emergency alarm notifications. Luckily, a good Samaritan posted this extensive article in the Hassio community that met all my notification needs. Slack also has a free account with limited features which was more than sufficient for my use case so I got set up with the notifications and they work well and reliably!", "After months of home automation integration, I realized that it\u2019s an endless pursuit. Some examples I plan to integrate in the future are: find a way to connect my smart washing machine with Hassio and continue to report on washing progress when I am at work; smarter motion detection for kitchen, bathroom fans, gas fireplace, sprinkler system, and similar automatable devices. I already invested in the MyQ Chamberlain garage door system which I can hook up with various alerts and automation. The privacy focused voice integration system Mycroft runs locally, providing benefits over Alexa or Google Home cloud based assistants.", "I know I can continue to invest in hardware and find more things to automate around the house but at some point, you start to wonder if it\u2019s worth the effort. To me, I find this a fun side project but I could argue that this approach is not for everyone, unless they\u2019re willing to get their hands dirty and spend time rigging things together and troubleshooting. Ultimately I have learned that this is a marathon and not a sprint. I have been chipping away at my home automation vision slowly and steadily.", "If you like this article and would like to talk to me about other interesting home automation ideas you have planned or completed, please connect with me on LinkedIn and I\u2019ll be happy to hear your thoughts and discuss home automation projects.", "GIS software enthusiast, Spatial Agent who loves solving map based
