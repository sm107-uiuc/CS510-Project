Marketing departments are lasering in on market segmentation data to find consumers who are ready to buy, speeding up the sale-closing process whenever possible.Business executives must examine bigger trends in the market, such as changes in pricing of resources, shipping or manufacturing.", "Your project is only as powerful as the data you bring.", "The choice of data entirely depends on the problem you\u2019re trying to solve.Picking the right data must be your goal, luckily, almost every topic you can think of has several datasets which are public & free.3 of my favorite free awesome website for dataset hunting are:", "The good thing is that data is means to an end, in other words, the quantity of the data is important but not as important as the quality of it. So, if you\u2019d like to be independent and create your own dataset and begin with a couple of hundred lines and build up the rest as you\u2019re going. That\u2019ll work too. There\u2019s a python library called Beautiful Soup. It is a library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.", "This is one of the hardest step and the one that will probably take the longest unless you\u2019re lucky with a complete perfect dataset, which is rarely the case. Handling missing data in the wrong way can cause disasters.", "Generally, there are many solutions such as:", "But you have to be smart. For example, you\u2019re working in a traveling agency and you\u2019ve been collecting data about travelers, for some reason, around 5% of your dataset is missing the traveler\u2019s nationality. Filling those missing values with null values is a terrible mistake. Cause a person\u2019s nationality greatly affects the traveling papers & procedure that they have to go through on traveling. In this case, nationality is a sensitive area. You\u2019re better off deleting the whole record.", "Age, on the other hand, can be safely replaced by the average value. It isn\u2019t that sensitive in this case.", "Feature extraction can be a turning point for you. It is what makes a dataset unique. Getting insight by making relations between features is an outstanding creative thing.", "For example, you\u2019re still casually doing your job at the travel agency, They asked you to create a model to prioritize your clients using clustering.You have 3 features in your dataset:", "You know you can\u2019t feed your model non-numerical data, still, you want to include them. Some of the insights the data scientist in you can observe:1) Stay duration: Difference between departure day and return date. That\u2019s the duration they\u2019re staying.2) Request duration: Difference between the arrival date and the request date.Okay, that\u2019s good. Taking request duration further and further. 3 travelers with request durations 3 days, 3 weeks & a year respectively. Obviously, the 3-day guy is the most urgent so they\u2019re our number one priority for now. Applying this concept (closeness of departure date) on the other two can be faulty though. When was the last time you booked a flight a year in advance? This person could be a regular customer who travels yearly with the agency. That would make him a priority too. Maybe it\u2019s time to send them some free kilometers.", "Now, this one is tricky. Originally this should be the model\u2019s job. You could simply dump the whole dataset you have and just let the artificial intelligence be intelligent. AI is able to decide which features truly affect the output and which doesn\u2019t. On the downside, The more data you give your model, it costs you money (computer power) & time. Both not always available. So, Giving your program a little help isn\u2019t always a bad idea. If you\u2019re sure that a certain feature is completely unrelated to the output, you should just disregard it altogether.", "The famous rule of splitting the data is 80\u201320 percent training & testing sets respectively. Sometimes, that 20% for the test set should be engineered in a way that they\u2019re not just randomly cut out of the dataset. As an example, you\u2019re working in your travel agency and they want you to create a program to detect whether a person will book a ticket this year or not.So you go on with your data collecting of all travelers since the agency ever started, processing your data. It\u2019s time to split your dataset now. You get the feeling that you want to cut the test set in a way that it spans all years. Is that really smart though? If you want to predict whether a person will travel or not in 2019 why care whether he(or similar people) traveled in 2008? A lot of global changes had happened since then. Maybe the country they\u2019re from is having problems with your country, maybe it\u2019s not going so well in his country. In this case, a smart thing is to engineer the test set for it to be in most recent years only.Your training set may contain all data from across the years, cause the happier the merrier. But it\u2019s a wise idea to give weights according to the year. A client record from 2008 should have a lighter weight than a record from 2018.", "In most cases, engineering the test set so that it spans many years is a good piece of advice though. But not in all cases.", "Cross Validation is an important procedure used to estimate the skill of the model on new data. Example: K-fold, in which you divide your training set into K groups. For each group, you hold this group as a mini-test set, you train and fit your model on the other groups and evaluate your model on this mini-test set, retain the evaluation score and discard the model, then move on to the next group.", "Bottom line is, In order to get most out of your data, you have to look further into it & into the business as a whole. Not just applying techniques & strategies you learned rather than whether these strategies go well with your case or not.", "Your home for data science.
