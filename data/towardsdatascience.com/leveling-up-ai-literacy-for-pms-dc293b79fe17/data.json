Don\u2019t make promises to the business without talking to the engineers.\u201d", "Too many organizations are hiring teams of data scientists without simultaneously investing in the data and AI-literacy of everyone else. As a result, there are too many product managers out there who are driving data scientists crazy (and vice versa, too).", "Here\u2019s why product managers need to become AI-literate:", "\u2744\ufe0f 7 billion special snowflakes: Your users demand it. \ufe0f\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f", "The cat\u2019s out of the bag \u2014 every individual wants to feel like (wait for it\u2026) an individual. You, me, and all of our users demand intelligent, personalized experiences that make us feel like the special snowflakes that we are. If everyone else is getting the same thing as me, what\u2019s so exciting about that?", "When users give data to companies by registering an account, engaging with the application, and providing feedback, they expect the product to continuously improve and become more intelligent over time. These improvements often require productizing the data generated by the user\u2019s engagement with the product itself.", "AI-enabled products are all around us. Spotify uses your listening history to create personalized playlists, Gmail uses previous email content to finish your sentences, Woebot remembers past conversations in order to give you a personal therapy session, and IntelligentX\u2019s AI algorithm uses your feedback from the previous batch of beer to create a recipe tailored just for your tastebuds. Yes, that\u2019s right, you can now purchase beer that is brewed by AI.", "Even if it\u2019s just marketing hype, the fact that we are surrounded by all of these exciting developments is the very thing that endlessly increases our expectations and our \u201cneeds\u201d (or wants). But for product managers, it\u2019s not just hype \u2014 it\u2019s your job to deliver on these expectations.", "\ud83e\udd63 The Goldilocks PM: Not too technical, not too much hype \ud83e\udd63", "The job of a PM encompasses envisioning what future products are possible, and delivering what is valuable. In order to do this, PMs need to have a just-right amount of knowledge about the current state of data science technologies. This Goldilocks-level understanding enables PMs to bridge the gaps between teams of different expertise \u2014 business, technology, and design \u2014 without getting too caught up in the AI hype, or too deep into the weeds.", "As a whole, the PM discipline is already well-versed in traditional software development technologies. This skillset is table stakes, across the board. When it comes to data science technologies, though, most PMs don\u2019t have the same level of technical understanding as they already have in business, engineering, and design \u2014 and that\u2019s because they haven\u2019t always needed it.", "Until now. As products become increasingly \u201cintelligent\u201d in order to meet the needs of each and every one of those special snowflake users out there, more and more of the application\u2019s decision points will be taken over by predictive models, rather than by heuristics and explicit if-then-else logic.", "Too often, PMs will drive their data science counterparts crazy by either getting too far into the technical weeds (less likely) or getting over-enthusiastic about hyped-up applications (more likely). The sweet spot is somewhere in between. A successful PM needs to understand the basics of data modeling, data infrastructure, machine learning models, and model evaluation metrics. Armed with just the right amount of knowledge, PMs can not only ship products that delight current users, but also deliver a vision of what is possible to create in the future.", "\ud83d\udd2e\u201cML isn\u2019t magic\u201d: Product managers need to understand the ML development process in order to effectively collaborate with the data science team*. \ud83d\udd2e", "In order to build better partnerships (and products) with their data scientist and machine learning engineer counterparts, PMs need to understand major differences in the development process and where he or she can play the most impactful role.", "Specifically, PMs can have the most impact in two areas: the model inputs and the model output. The \u201coutput\u201d is the prediction that the ML model will generate. It\u2019s critical that the PM clearly articulates the business value of this algorithm output, as well as the relevant constraints \u2014 great model predictions do not guarantee successful business results. The \u201cinputs\u201d are the features (aka attributes, independent variables, columns, etc.) that feed into the model. Garbage in, garbage out. Sharing domain knowledge and context with the data science team can help the team find stronger signal, leading to a higher-quality, more interpretable output.", "As for the rest \u2014 step away and leave it to the black box of machine learning, right? Not so fast. As one data scientist said, \u201cPMs need to know that ML isn\u2019t magic.\u201d Beyond the inputs and the outputs, there are many places in the development process where PMs can get tripped up unexpectedly. Here are some potential scenarios:", "Bias, data cleaning, model evaluation\u2026suffice to say, the development process for machine learning products is full of pitfalls that can easily derail a carefully planned product roadmap. AI-literate PMs can more easily foresee and proactively address these potential scenarios \u2014 before they happen.", "To address these challenges, Professor Nick Ross and I developed a 7-week certificate course at the University of San Francisco\u2019s Data Institute called Data Science for Product Managers. The certificate covers key data science and machine learning concepts, including analytics, statistics, regression, clustering, classification, NLP, recommendation systems, and deep learning \u2014 with a focus on product applications and business challenges.", "By strengthening the AI literacy of PMs, we can build more effective partnerships between data scientists and product managers, and ship more intelligent products for all of the 7 billion special snowflakes out there.", "* I am using \u201cData Science team\u201d as an umbrella term to refer to the people who are building the product. This person\u2019s title could be Machine Learning Engineer or Data Science Engineer (ideally), but is sometimes called simply \u201cData Scientist\u201d.
