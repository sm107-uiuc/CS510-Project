There are traditional approaches that focus on the sequence of discrete and well-defined steps, like the Waterfall model, where communication channels are realized bypassing documents, and others, like the Agile model, which emphasizes the need for flexibility and constant, direct communication between team members. These newer models are very popular with software teams of varying sizes. Due to the importance and the means of communications described by these models, it is desired to recruit people that possess both technical and communicational skills. The problem, though, that arises when looking for people like these, lies in the difficulty of assessing these skills.", "Within the context of this project, we focus on this issue. To do so we employ data mining techniques for identifying different team roles and also assess the activities of team members within the software development and operations process. The implemented system draws user activity data from the GitHub web platform and uses them as input to cluster team members. This way we attempt to provide insight into the different team member roles that appear in open source projects, like the ones at GitHub, and the performance of the users that act under these roles.", "After extensive experimentation with different combinations of datasets and evaluation features, the results that are presented as final are considered to offer critical insight into those matters.", "Our dataset consists of features about every contributor engineer in GitHub\u2019s 240 most stared projects, which have 5 to 10 contributors. The data was collected from GitHub\u2019s API [1].", "Our first part of this project was focused on engineers\u2019 role classification in every collected GitHub project. The second part was focused on the engineers\u2019 quality of contribution in every role. To conclude these questions, we separated engineers in three main roles Dev, DevOps, and Ops. Dev stands for developers who are responsible for the creation and verification of the project\u2019s code. DevOps stands for Developer and Operations who are responsible for the releases and the planning process of the project. Ops stands for operations that are responsible for monitoring and configuration.", "Three clustering algorithms were used(K means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering Complete linkage). The evaluation for the selection of the preferred parameters for each algorithm was done by repeatedly running each algorithm with different parameter values and compare the results based on each algorithm\u2019s valuation metrics.", "To answer each one of our questions specific metrics of the dataset were selected to determine the role classification and the contribution evaluation for every engineer. In the first case, we applied each clustering algorithm and evaluate the results with Cohesion, Separation and Average Silhouette to determine the algorithm we are going to use to continue our research.", "The final dataset is a result several of pre-processing stages in order to eliminate the error percentage in our final model. In each stage, only the engineers who are compatible with the stage\u2019s scenario were kept. Each stage\u2019s dataset is the entrance to the next filter. Therefore, each dataset is a subset of the next one, excluding the original one.", "It\u2019s also important to deal with missing/null/inf values in your dataset beforehand. There are many ways to deal with such values, the one that was chosen to be implemented is to remove them.", "In the first stage, the engineers who have only contributed to the project for one day were eliminated. The thought behind this filter was that we can make o reasonable conclusion of their sole cause of the short time of their activity. The filter was structured based on the activity_period_in_days metric of our dataset.", "Third stage: Exclude short time contributors", "In this stage, 10% of the engineers who participated in the least in the projects were excluded. The dataset was ordered based on activity_period_in_days metric and keep the upper 90% of the dataset.", "At this final stage of the dataset\u2019s process, the scale of metric values did normalized, because each observations\u2019 feature values are represented as coordinates in n-dimensional space (n is the number of features) and then the distances between these coordinates are calculated. If these coordinates are not normalized, then it may lead to false results.", "This whole process is done to optimize the clustering process.", "In order to demonstrate the role classification, three clustering algorithms 1. DBSCAN, 2. K means and 3. Hierarchical Clustering with complete linkage and both Euclidean and Manhattan distances were used. Role classification was based on 4 metrics from the final dataset resulted after the pre-processing act (issues_participated, issues_opened, issues_closed, commits_authored). The results of each algorithm are going to be represented separately in the following sections.", "DBSCAN is a known density-based algorithm used in datasets with different data densities. Therefore, DBSCAN is failing to extract information-rich clusters from our dataset mainly because the data points are being concentrated around zero and categorize them in the same cluster. Although we can use DBSCAN as an extra stage of preprocessing in order to get rid of some outliers. These outliers were going to form clusters with not enough data, so it would be very difficult to extract conclusions about the role evaluation of each group. Thus, to focus on our main distribution of data at the beginning of the axes was preferred. As the result of this final stage of preprocessing, we produce the dataset that we call no irregulars", "The problem with K means relies on the fact that our data is not equally distributed. Unfortunately, our data points\u2019 density around the axes center is higher than normally expected, resulting in not well-defined roles. Furthermore, the density of our data around zero creates misleading high evaluation metrics. This conclusion is easily understandable by the results of the original data metrics Fig. 2. The reason that only this metric was used is that as we can see Cohesion (as well as Separation) cannot be compared between the datasets. This is happening because each observations\u2019 feature distances that are being examined are extremely different from each and cannot be put in the same unit system.", "Out of the three methods of clustering, the one that was chosen to continue with is Hierarchical Clustering with complete linkage. As we can see from the figures hierarchical clustering provides the best division between the clusters as well as sufficient results in various metrics. Furthermore, it is the most compatible with our data because it can handle irregular clusters. The only problem with this method is the creation of one cluster where its values concentrate at the beginning of the axes and we are unable to extract enough information. Therefore, again hierarchical clustering will be used in order to further examine this particular cluster and identify the roles that it contains. Here we must point out that in this examination the results we get can only be compared with the values inside the cluster and not with the other results of clustering.", "As we can see from the figures it is more preferred to use the normalize euclidean dataset. From the elbow method, we can use either 6, 7 or 8 clusters without any significant change at the result of the metrics. Although through further examination and visualization of the data we jump to the conclusion that it is best to use 7 clusters for our analysis.", "In this section, we try to identify the specific roles that an engineer can have in a project based on our dataset.", "The characteristics that were examined in order to get our conclusions are (\u201cIssues Opened\u201d, \u201dIssues Closed\u201d, \u201cCommits Authored\u201d, \u201cIssues Participated\u201d). Thus, we have the following groups", "In order for a cluster to belong to a specific group, its values must be relatively high in those specific categories compared to the other clusters. Although it should be pointed out that this is not the only criterion that needs to be met in order to categorize a cluster. More specifically if a cluster belongs in the DevOps group that does not necessarily means that its values are high in all of the above categories but just a relative good combination of those would be adequate. Also, it is possible that the analysis would result in new categories except the above.", "As shown above, the 1st cluster was categorized as Dev. It has the highest commits in the dataset and the other characteristics have low values as well as the \u201cIssues Closed\u201d which for the Dev cluster. That happens because as we know at Github the privilege to close issues can be granted only from the repository owner. So the Dev cluster may consist of some engineers that contribute to the repositories without being owners or have the privilege to close issues. The 2nd is being categorized as Undecided because it is difficult to jump to any conclusions with all of the characteristics being \u201cLow\u201d. Thus we need to further examine this particular cluster and that\u2019s because it contains most of our data and it cannot be ignored. Also in the 7th cluster, the values of the characteristics are unlike anything that has been seen before and that\u2019s the reason it has to be categorized as a new group that it hasn\u2019t yet been predicted.", "Here a specific model is produced in order to further examine the 2nd cluster as has been said. In this model, Hierarchical Clustering is also used to get the metrics of Cohesion Separation and Silhouette as shown in the above figures. Again using the elbow method we choose to continue our analysis with 7 clusters.", "Here we follow the same rules as the first model. But it is important to say that the values of this model can only be compared to each other and not with the values of the first model. Therefore the meaning of \u201cLow\u201d \u201cMedium\u201d \u201cHigh\u201d is different in each model but here too we have the same clustering targets.", "Here the 2nd contains again most of the data but its distribution and most of its values are extremely Low so we can not extract any useful information about how to characterize it. Although the 3rd cluster also contains Low values considered the overall dataset but they are relatively higher than the 2nd cluster and that is why we can categorize it as Ops. In the other clusters, the same approach is followed as the first model in order to categorize them.", "In this section, the performance of each engineer will be analyzed in each role. The same methodology will be implemented for this evaluation as we are going to create clusters for each role.", "The algorithm that will be used for this is the Hierarchical Clustering and the dataset will be the normalized Euclidean dataset as the concept of this experiment remains the same with the role classification.", "In this examination, there is no need to look for a large number of separate clusters but we rather prefer a smaller number of clusters that are richer in the matter of information. We came to this conclusion because now we are not looking for separate roles of engineers but we try to find commons characteristics between the Devs. In the Dev cluster, we include both the Devs of the original analysis and the Devs that came from the further examination of the 2nd cluster. As we can see from the figures which refer to the Dev cluster we choose using the elbow method to have 4 clusters. The main characteristics of those clusters are:", "i. Productive: If the team has high \u201cIssues Closed Per Day\u201d", "ii. Responsive: If the team has low \u201cAverage Time to Close Issues\u201d", "iii. Elegant: If the team has low \u201cViolations Added\u201d", "The difference of this evaluation is that we examine a team which has characteristics both from Dev and the Ops cluster. Therefore it would be more useful to have slightly more teams than the other 2 evaluations in order to have more distinct roles. Using the same methods as before and looking at the DevOps figures we come up with 8 distinct teams.", "Here we are looking for distinct teams that show how much engaged and helpful is an Op in a particular project. Just like before we are using the elbow method in order to find the optimal number of clusters which is 4. We follow the same logic as the Dev Evaluation and we can characterize an Op as:", "i. Involved: If the team has low \u201cInactive Time\u201d", "ii. Verbal: If the team has high \u201cAverage Comments Length\u201d", "iii. Productive: If the team has high \u201cAverage Comments Per Issue\u201d", "In order to evaluate the Dev, Ops, DevOps clusters we extract certain metrics from the original:", "c. Average Time To Close Issues", "e. Average Time To Close Issues", "In this section, the results of the above analysis are presented and each original cluster is categorized in teams based on characteristics that we extract from the original dataset.", "The initial target of this examination was to successfully identify the different roles that engineers can have in a project. And then evaluate each role based on some characteristics. It\u2019s obvious that when it comes to a software project it is rather difficult to evaluate someone who participates in it. So it goes without saying that in some cases we simplified the data and the models which are being used for complexity reasons and only if it was necessary we have made a more thorough examination. In this case, we considered it would be more sufficient to use 4 different models in order to choose the most appropriate one for our data.", "As a final observation, we must point out that most of the characteristics that have been used in the role interpretation were oriented towards the Dev and not the Ops. This is happening because GitHub as a platform appeals more to the Devs and not the Ops and the dataset contained very few PureOps characteristics. Furthermore, most of the data were concentrated at the begging of the axes around zero. So, it was difficult to identify distinct clusters with enough data points to get thorough results. Although we consider that we have achieved our target of successfully finding the different roles of engineers through our method of preprocessing and the most compatible clustering with our data.", "[2] I.
