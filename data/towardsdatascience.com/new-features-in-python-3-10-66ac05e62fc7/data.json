This looks like a continuing trend with further additions to typing in 3.10.", "The evaluation of type annotation has always been performed at function definition time, meaning that type annotations are evaluated line-by-line in a top-down fashion.", "Although it seems logical, there are two issues to doing this:", "So instead, annotations will be stored in __annotations__ and the evaluation of these can be performed together \u2014 allowing forward referencing and executing module imports first (reducing initialization time).", "3.10 introduces conditional logic with the | operator. When annotating data types, we can use | as OR. For example, we have a variable that is expected to be either an int OR float \u2014 we write it as int | float, like this:", "Pre-3.10, the equivalent operation would be written using the typing.Union method \u2014 like Union[int, float].", "Back to the forward referencing issue, a common solution to avoiding forward references is to write them as strings.", "However, writing types as strings can cause problems when assigning those types to variables \u2014 as Python will assume our string literal type annotation is simply a string.", "Using that type annotation variable in places that we would usually use type annotations will return an error. For example:", "Here, we are attempting to use MyType as an alias for a type, however, MyType will be read as a string value \u2014 not a type alias.", "This is valid as long as ClassName is defined later in the code. Currently, this will throw annotation errors.", "To solve this, a method for explicitly identifying MyType as a type alias has been added:", "Although this is certainly not a huge, game-changing move, it\u2019s incredibly cool to see the Python developers doubling down on enhancing the typing features.", "The strength of Python comes with its ease of use and the lack of a steep learning curve. One of the reasons for this is the lack of need to explicitly define types throughout our code.", "It may seem counterintuitive, but giving developers the option to define types can greatly enhance the readability and maintainability of code-bases. For example, take these extracts from the source code of the Transformers library:", "Even without context, we can read this code and immediately grasp what data we should expect to be fed into these functions, classes, and methods \u2014 and exactly which datatypes we should be expecting to return.", "In complex code bases (and even simple ones), type annotation can massively improve readability. Simultaneously, not everyone will want (or need) to use them \u2014 so an optional, exception-free functionality strikes a perfect balance.", "These changes show a commitment to the type annotation features of Python. The added clarity to our favorite libraries (and our own code) may leave an interesting long-term impact on the Python ecosystem.", "Alongside the new typing changes, we also have a few updates and new features to other core Python functionalities.", "The first of those comes with PEP 618, which adds an optional strict flag to the zip() function. If we set strict=True an error will be raised if both inputs to zip are not of an equal length.", "Rather than blindly truncating mismatched data, the new strict argument allows us to control the behavior of zip \u2014 something that will save plenty of developers from a headache somewhere down the line.", "Also known as a population count, this new method allows us to count the number of ones in the binary representation of an integer. All we write is int.bit_count().", "We are simply returning the count of positive bits in the binary values representing each integer:", "Three dictionary methods dict.keys(), dict.values(), and dict.items() all return a different view of a dictionary. Now, a mapping attribute has been added to each of these view objects.", "This new attribute is a types.MappingProxyType object that wraps around the original dictionary \u2014 if we call it on a view, we return the original dictionary.", "That\u2019s all for now \u2014 although we\u2019re only a few months into the development timeline for 3.10, there are already plenty of interesting changes!", "Python's evolution is continuing and looks like there will be plenty more fascinating features added to the language over time.", "I hope you enjoyed this article. If you want more, I have started posted programming tutorials over on YouTube here. Or if you have any questions, ideas, or suggestions \u2014 let me know via Twitter or in the comments below.", "If you\u2019re still catching up with Python 3.9 \u2014 I covered everything in the full release here:", "Your home for data science.
