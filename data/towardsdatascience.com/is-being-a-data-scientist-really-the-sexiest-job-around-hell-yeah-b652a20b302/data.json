In other words, a cipher is an algorithm for accomplishing the encryption of information. Cipher systems were widely used to protect wartime secrets during the second world war. Turing and his team focused on cryptanalysis to decode these messages. At its core, this decoding involved building counter-algorithms to deconstruct the working of the German cipher systems, most notably Nazi Germany\u2019s Enigma cipher machine. Turing and his team made several advancements towards this.", "It is estimated that Turing\u2019s work shortened the war by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives. Talk about having an impact!", "The interesting thing is that in many ways, Turing\u2019s work, both in cryptanalysis as well as his subsequent research with early computing systems, dealt with some of the initial development of intelligent machines. Therefore, this really represents the beginnings of the impact of AI itself.", "And if we fast forward a few decades into the future, it is amply evident that the impact of AI has only increased further \u2014 going far beyond wartime code-breaking into encompassing much of our everyday lives. Let\u2019s take a few examples.", "In 2006 LinkedIn was still a small company with big ambitions. It was then that a young Analyst, soon after completing his PhD in Physics from Stanford, had joined LinkedIn as one of their first data scientists. His name was Jonathan Goldman. Little did he know what a profound impact he was going to have, not just on LinkedIn\u2019s future, but also on clearly establishing the importance of data science for companies around the world.", "While wading through the rich troughs of data that LinkedIn had begun acquiring about its users by then, Goldman came up with an interesting thought. He realized that while users joined the network and also invited their friends/colleagues to join, there was still a gap. They were unable to connect with people they knew that were already on the platform.", "He dived into the data about the users \u2014 who worked where, studied where and when, was connected to who else, was located where etc. He formed hypotheses around probabilities of knowing someone based on these parameters and tested them. He looked for patterns \u2014 e.g. if I worked with X and X knows Y, what are the chances I know Y? Eventually, this was the base from which Goldman built the \u201cPeople You May Know\u201d product, now a ubiquitous part of the LinkedIn experience. And once released, the feature catapulted LinkedIn\u2019s growth numbers very rapidly. The rest, as they say, is history.", "Netflix has always been a company deeply rooted in data. Some of you might remember that Netflix originally started as an online DVD rental company (before pivoting into online video streaming in the mid 2000s). A key factor in determining early success for Netflix lay in its ability to put in front of the customers the movies that they were most likely to rent, as opposed to having to search through the entire catalog to find something of interest. In essence, this was one of the world\u2019s first large scale recommender systems.", "But then Netflix did something that changed the game. For Netflix, and for the world at large.", "In Oct 2006, Netflix launched a competition that started humbly enough but very soon snowballed into becoming the largest Machine Learning competition ever held.", "The rules were simple enough. Netflix offered a grand prize of $1,000,000 to the team that managed to beat Netflix\u2019s in-house movie recommender (called Cinematch) by more than 10% (or, to be technically correct, the requirement was to reduce the error rate \u2014 RSME \u2014 by over 10%). Participants were given a sparsely populated training dataset of ~100 million ratings to build their models on.", "The competition ended up running for 3 years and saw participation from over 40,000 teams from 186 countries.", "The Netflix competition led to profound insights \u2014 and commensurate improvements in performance \u2014 in the world of analytics as applied to optimizing machine-based recommendations. Not only did it revolutionize recommender systems, applications of which go far beyond movies, it forced practitioners to really push the envelope when it came to machine learning application. Today, you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a business-to-consumer company that does not leverage recommender systems in some way or form, including matchmaking! (Read my article on this topic for more: \u201cCan Artificial Intelligence Help You Find Love: Understanding The Business of Matchmaking\u201d)", "Now that we\u2019ve established the undeniable impact of data science and AI on humanity and business alike, let\u2019s see if this influence is episodic or has it seen a sustained growth. The short answer is \u2014 yes, a thousand times yes \u2014 for sustained, exponential growth! But don\u2019t take my word for it. Let\u2019s instead look at a few hard data points.", "Gone are the days when one had to do extensive primary research or surveys to get a sense of the pulse of the public. Google trends can now provide these insights with a few clicks.", "Ironical that data helps us establish the increasing importance of data in this case!", "Fig 1. provides the steadily and significantly growing trend from 2008 to 2020 for three key search terms on Google across the world \u2014 \u201cMachine Learning\u201d, \u201cData Science\u201d and \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d.", "One of the leading indicators of a particular discipline gaining traction is the number of students aspiring to pursue their education in the said discipline. The AI Index Report for 2019 mapped these trends across a few top universities. Fig 2a and 2b provide the increasing trend of enrollments in courses on \u2018Introduction to Machine Learning\u2019 and \u2018Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\u2019 respectively. Do note, that university enrollments are also limited by number of seats available, so these charts, though skyrocketing in recent years, likely under-represent the actual interest in these disciplines!", "Another interesting student statistic is the growing number of doctoral candidates. According to the 2019 AI Index Report, AI has quickly become the most desired specialization among computer science PhD students in USA.", "There are over twice as many PhD students for AI compared to the second most popular specialization (security/information assurance)!", "We live in a decidedly capitalistic world. Therefore, the direction in which money is flowing is almost always one of the best indicators of what is the hottest thing around. We therefore look at total funding attracted by AI startups.", "From humble beginnings of just over $300 Million invested in the AI space in 2009, the landscape changed rapidly in less than a decade. In 2018, a total of $40.4 Billion was invested in AI startups globally. This is a mind-boggling increase at a cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 70%!", "To sum up \u2014 AI, data science and machine learning have truly arrived. Throughout recent history, this emerging branch of study has had a disproportionate impact on how people live their lives and how companies run their businesses. This trend is not just here to stay but is undoubtedly going to witness a further explosion in growth rates, as evident from looking at the best talent and big money gravitating towards these fields.", "Your home for data science.
