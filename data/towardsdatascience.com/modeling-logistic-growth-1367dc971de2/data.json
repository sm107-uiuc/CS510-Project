It was limited to the first phase of the outbreak since the big limitation of Exponential Growth is that it never stops growing.", "In this article, I present the next step for this model: the Logistic Growth model. If you want to follow along, you can get the notebook here and the data from here.", "Logistic Growth is a mathematical function that can be used in several situations. Logistic Growth is characterized by increasing growth in the beginning period, but a decreasing growth at a later stage, as you get closer to a maximum. For example in the Coronavirus case, this maximum limit would be the total number of people in the world, because when everybody is sick, the growth will necessarily diminish.", "In other use cases of logistic growth, this number could be the size of an animal population that grows exponentially until the moment where their environment does not provide enough food for all animals and hence the growth becomes slower until a maximum capacity of the environment is reached.", "The reason to use Logistic Growth for modeling the Coronavirus outbreak is that epidemiologists have studied those types of outbreaks and it is well known that the first period of an epidemic follows Exponential Growth and that the total period can be modeled with a Logistic Growth.", "Logistic Growth is characterized by the following formula:", "I also list two very other interesting points about this formula:", "For those who want to have a better mathematical understanding of the formula: the above function is actually derived from the below differential formula discovered by Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Verhulst. I will explain it in small steps:", "To make this more clear, I will make a hypothetical case in which:", "We first need to plug the values for a and b in the formula to obtain the formula for our specific epidemic:", "In Python this looks as follows:", "Then we can use this formula to compute the value of y for each value of t from 0 to 10. When we do this, we obtain the following numbers of Infected people at every time step, as seen in the below table. This shows that in the beginning, there is fast growth of the number of infections, but then it slows down a lot and ends at the maximum capacity.", "If we want to represent this graphically, we start to see a graph that looks a lot like the very alarming curves that we see concerning the Coronavirus:", "Now, we know that this graph has more or less the right shape, but we need to make an additional step to make our analysis useful. We need to find the real curve of the Corona epidemic, by looking at the data from the epidemic spread.", "In this case, I will take the data from China: since the growth has already strongly declined over there, the logistic curve will be quite a good match.", "When looking at the data, we only have the number of cases per day. We also have the formula that we want to apply, but we do not yet have the correct values of the parameters a, b and c in the formula.", "Unfortunately, it is not possible to rewrite the Logistic Function as a Linear Regression, as was the case for the Exponential model. We will therefore need a more complex method: Nonlinear Least Squares estimation.", "STEP 1 \u2014 Read in the data", "STEP 2 \u2014 Define the logistic function that has to be fitted", "STEP 3 \u2014 Randomly initialize a, b and c", "In this case I use np.random.exponential for this, but you can use anything you like. Attention though: your choice here may affect the performance of step 5.", "STEP 4 \u2014 Set upper and lower bounds for a, b and c", "Lower bounds for all parameters are 0. I set an upper bound for b on 3, because at my first try I let it free and it became way too high. a and c upper bounds did not negatively affect the curve fitting, so I let their bounds relatively high.", "STEP 5 \u2014 Use Scipy Curve Fit for Nonlinear Least Squares Estimation", "In this step, Scipy does a Nonlinear Least Squares optimization and gives us the values for a, b and c that minimize the Least Square Error of our model.", "STEP 6 \u2014 Plot the fitted function vs the real data", "As you can see in the graph below, the Logistic Model is really not that far from the actual Chinese Coronavirus data.", "We have found a Logistic Function that is really quite close to the observed Coronavirus data from China. To really use this information in real life, it would be necessary to do a lot of model validation, compare accuracy and other performance metrics of different models and follow closely whether future trends follow the selected model.", "This would go way beyond this article, which is merely trying to show how to fit a Logistic Growth curve, but still, using the theory, we can state some observations:", "We can also compute when the maximum growth rate occurred according to this model:", "With a thoroughly validated model, this type of information could for example be used by policymakers to estimate how to take the right measures.", "I hope it has become clear for you how to fit a Logistic Model and how to use it for different use cases.
