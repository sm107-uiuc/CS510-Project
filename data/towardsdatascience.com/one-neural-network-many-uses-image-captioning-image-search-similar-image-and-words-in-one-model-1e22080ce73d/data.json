This is unlike the human brain which is able to use the same concepts at amazingly diverse tasks. For example, if you have never seen a fractal before and I show you one right now.", "After seeing the image of a fractal, you\u2019ll be able to handle multiple tasks related to it:", "How are you able to do all these tasks? Are there dedicated neural networks in your brain specializing in all these tasks?", "Modern neuroscience suggests that the answer is that information in your brain is shared and communicated across different parts. Exactly how it\u2019s done is an area of research but we have a few hints at how this multi-task performance might be happening. The answer might be in how data is stored and interpreted inside a neural network.", "A representation is, as the name suggests, how information is encoded inside a network. When a word or a sentence or an image (or anything else, really) is provided as an input to a trained neural network, it gets transformed over successive layers as weights are multiplied by inputs and activations are applied. Finally, in the output layer, we get numbers that we interpret either as class labels or stock prices or any other task that the network is trained for.", "This magical transformation of input -> output happens due to transformations of input that happens in successive layers. These transformations of input data are called representations. A key idea is that each layer makes it easy for the next layer to do its job. This process of making the life of the successive layer easier results in activations (transformation of input data at a particular layer) meaningful.", "What do I mean by meaningful? Let\u2019s see an example of activations of different layers of an image classifier.", "What an image classifying network does is that it transforms an image in pixel-space to increasingly high-level concept space. So, an image of a car that\u2019s represented as RGB values will start getting represented in space of edges in the first layer, and then in the space of circles and basic shapes in the second layer and in the pre-final layer, it\u2019ll start getting represented in high-level objects such as wheels, doors, etc.", "This increasingly rich representation (that emerges automatically because of the hierarchical nature of deep networks) makes the task of image classification trivial. All that the last layer then has to do is to weigh concepts of wheels and doors more to be like cars and ears and eyes to be more like people.", "Because these intermediate layers store a meaningful encoding of the input data, you can use the same information for multiple tasks. For example, you can take a language model (a recurrent neural network trained to predict the next word) and interpret activations from a specific neuron to predict sentiment of the sentence.", "The amazing fact is that the sentiment neuron emerges naturally in the unsupervised task of language modeling. (See this tutorial for a good writeup). The network was trained to predict next works, nowhere in the task did we ask the network to predict the sentiment. Perhaps sentiment is such a useful concept that the network invented it in order to do a better job at language modeling.", "Once you get the idea of representations, you\u2019ll start seeing deep neural networks in a different light altogether. You\u2019ll start sensing representations as a transferable language that makes it possible for different networks (or different parts of the same network) talk to each other.", "To fully understand what representations are, let\u2019s build our own deep neural network that does four things:", "Each one of the three tasks here is a project in itself and traditionally would require three models. But we\u2019re going to do all of them using one model.", "The code will be written in Pytorch in a Jupyter Notebook. You can download it from this repository.", "There are many good tutorials on the net to implement image captioning so I\u2019m not going to go in depth into it.

Extract the zip file in the \u2018Flicker8k_Dataset\u2019 folder in the same directory as your notebook. You\u2019ll also need to download captions from here. Extract captions in the folder \u2018caption_datasets\u2019.", "There are broadly two components to image captioning: a) an image encoder that takes an input image and represents it in a format that\u2019s meaningful for captioning; b) a caption decoder that takes the image representation and outputs textual description of it.", "The image encoder is a deep convolutional network while the caption decoder is a traditional LSTM/GRU recurrent neural network. We can, of course, train both of these from scratch. But doing so will require more data than we have (8k images) and extensive training time. So, instead of training the image encoder from scratch, we\u2019ll take a pre-existing image classifier and use its pre-final layer activations.", "This is the first of many magical examples of representations that you\u2019ll see in this post. I\u2019m taking the Inception network available in PyTorch modelzoo that\u2019s trained on ImageNet to classify images across 100 categories and using it to give me a representation that can be fed into the recurrent neural network.", "Note that Inception network was never trained for the image captioning task. Yet, it works!", "Like I did in my generate machine learning ideas via machine learning post, we could have used a pre-trained language model for caption decoder as well. But for this time, since I was reimplementing a model from the tutorial that worked well, I simply followed along and trained a decoder from scratch.", "The full model architecture looks like this:", "You can train the model from scratch but it\u2019ll take a couple of days on a CPU (and I haven\u2019t optimized for GPU). But worry not! My laptop has spent sleepless nights so you can enjoy the fruits of an already trained model. (If you\u2019re training from scratch, note that I stopped training at about 40 epochs when the running average loss was around 2.8)", "I\u2019ve implemented the beam search method that gives a good performance. Following are examples of captions generated by the network for the images from the test set (it has never seen them before).", "Let\u2019s see what the network captions my own photo:", "Not bad! It\u2019s impressive that the network knows that the image contains a man who\u2019s wearing a white T-shirt. The grammar is a bit off (which I\u2019m sure more training can fix), but the basic gist is fine.", "And if the input image contains something that the network has NEVER seen before, it tends to fail. For example, I was curious about what the network will label an image of the iPhone X.", "It didn\u2019t do so well. But overall, I\u2019m pretty satisfied with the performance and that gives us a good basis for building other functionalities using the representations that network developed while learning to caption an image.", "Recall what we do to decode the caption from an image representation. We feed the representation into the LSTM/GRU network, generate an output, interpret it as the first word and then take the first word and feed it back into the network to generate the second word. This continues until the network generates a special token indicating the end of the sentence.", "In order to feedback the words into the network, we need to convert words into representations that become the input for the network. This means that if the input layer comprises of 300 neurons, for each of the 8000+ distinct words across all captions, we need to have a 300 numbers associated that uniquely specify that word. This process of converting a dictionary of words into numeric representations is called word embeddings (or word representations).", "There are pre-existing word embeddings like word2vec or GLoVE that we can download and use. But in the present case, we learn a word embedding from scratch. We start with randomly generated word embeddings and explore what has our network learned about words by the time training is done.", "Since we can\u2019t visualize a 100-dimensional space of numbers, we will use a wonderful technique called t-SNE to visualize learned word embeddings in 2 dimensions. t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction technique that tries to make neighbors in the high-dimensional space remain neighbors in the low-dimensional space as well.", "Enough of talking. Let\u2019s see a space of word embeddings as learned by our caption decoder (unlike other language tasks where there are millions of words and sentences, our decoder only had seen ~30k sentences in the training dataset).", "So, our network has learned that words like \u2018play\u2019, \u2018plays\u2019 and \u2018playing\u2019 are very similar (they have similar representations as evident from the tight cluster with the red arrow). Let\u2019s explore another area in this 2D space:", "This area seems to have clustered numbers \u2014 \u2018two\u2019, \u2018three\u2019, \u2018four\u2019, \u2018five\u2019, etc. Another one:", "It knows people are similar to children.

You can take two words (like \u2018king\u2019 and \u2018queen\u2019) and subtract their representations to get a direction. When you apply this direction to another word representation (say, of \u2018man\u2019), you get a representation that\u2019s close to the actual analogous word (say \u2018woman\u2019). This magic is why word2vec became so famous when it was introduced:", "I was curious if the representations learned by caption decoder had a similar property. Even though I was skeptical because the training data was not much (~30k sentences), I gave it a go.", "The analogies that the network learned were not perfect (some of the words literally appeared for <10 times, so network didn\u2019t have enough info to learn). I had to squint my eyes but it sort-of found analogies.", "If riding is to sitting, what would walking correspond to? My network things it would be \u2018laying\u2019 (which is not bad!).", "Similarly, if the plural of \u2018man\u2019 is \u2018men\u2019 what would be the plural of \u2018woman\u2019:", "The second result is \u2018women\u2019 which is pretty decent.", "Lastly, if the grass is green, what color would be the sky:", "The network thinks it is silver or grey, none of which are blue but both of which are colors. It\u2019s amazing that the network is able to infer the direction of colors.", "If word representations cluster similar words together, what about image representations (that Inception powered image encoder outputs). I applied the same t-SNE technique to the image representations (the 300-dimensional tensor that goes as an input in the first step of the caption decoder).", "The dots are representations of different images (I did not take the entire set of 8K images, but it is a sample of about 100 images or so). The red arrow points to a cluster of nearby representations.", "So do kids playing in forest/grass-like area.", "And basketball players are clustered together.", "Finding Images Similar to an Input Image", "For the similar words task, we were limited to our test set vocabulary to find similar words (if a word didn\u2019t exist in the test set, our caption decoder wouldn\u2019t learn its embedding). However, for the similar images task, we have an image representation generator that will take any input image and generate its encoding.", "This means we can use the cosine-similarity method to build a search-by-image functionality as follows:", "Google Images is likely using this (or a very similar) method to power their reverse image search functionality.", "Let\u2019s see how our network does. I clicked the following photo while I was in a vacation in Goa. (PS: I love Goa!)", "Note that this image is my own. The model we\u2019re using has never seen it before. When I query for similar images to this, the network outputs the following image from the Flickr8K dataset:", "Isn\u2019t this mindblowing? I wasn\u2019t expecting such good performance, but there we are. Deep neural networks are unreasonably good.", "In this final part, we run the image caption generator in reverse. So rather than taking an image and generating a caption for it, we input a caption (textual description) and find the image that most closely matches it.", "Sounds too good to be true? Well, it\u2019s not.

It includes code for data pre-processing, model description, pretrained image captioning network, visualizations. It does NOT include the Flickr8K dataset or captions which you\u2019ll have to download separately from here and here.", "I hope you enjoyed the article. If you want to go one step further, here\u2019s a challenge for you: generate an image from a given description. Just like from a random starting point generated a 300-dimensional image representation that matches the user-supplied caption, can you go one step further and generate an image from scratch for a user-supplied caption?", "It\u2019s 10x harder than what we have handled in this post but my sense is that it is doable. How cool would be to have a service that not just searches for an image corresponding to a text, but is able to generate one on the fly.", "In the future, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Google Images does this and starts giving results for images that don\u2019t yet exist (like \u2018two unicorns flying on a carpet made of pizza\u2019).", "That\u2019s it.
