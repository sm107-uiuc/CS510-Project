It is known that the human ability to absorb and memorize information through images is the best one and this is the key to data visualization\u2019s utility. In a more practical level, within a company, the purpose of data visualization is that of helping the business units in decision making, simplifying the process of data analysis and often putting in evidence insights that one could miss by analyzing directly the numbers.", "The terminology might vary from one tool to another but the basic terms that you have to deal with when doing data analysis are not many: data source (local files or in cloud data), data model (dataset with relationships as a whole), visualizations (plots based on the data model) and report/dashboard (the whole of pages that contain the visualizations). Let\u2019s not forget filters, everything rotates around filters in a report.", "The usual process of creating a report consists in putting together different data sources (it is very common that not all data is stored in the same place), making the data sources talk to one another (creating the relationships the data tables) and data cleaning (thumb rule in visualization, inconsistencies are very quick to jump to the eye when plotting them). The rest depends on the data, exploration and a bit of story telling; the closest thing to a magical rule is the general interpretation of the different types of plots, like a scatter plot is used to represent the distribution of data as well as detect outliers, a box plot is also a representation of a distribution using 5 indexes (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum), a line chart is used to show trends and so on. Once the report has been created, it is then published and shared with the people of interest who can navigate the report and learn about the data on which it was based on. When reports are published, a refresh of the data is scheduled so that they are always up to date and show the latest and most correct data to the end-users.", "There are now countless tools for the job but the two I\u2019ve had to use lately are Power BI (Microsoft) and Spotfire (TIBCO).", "Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft which gives the users the possibility to create interactive visualizations as well as the ability to provide them business intelligence capabilities. The Desktop version, which is used for the development of the reports comes for free but just about anything else that regards publishing and sharing reports requires a paid license, Pro or Premium, which you then have to buy for every user of said reports.", "There is a large number of data sources supported and you can also combine them together in the same report. It offers a wide variety of visualizations that you can use, as seen in the Visualization pane, and these visualizations can be rendered highly interactive with one another, even when they are on different pages of the report. These visualizations can be customized, you can pretty much change everything. You can apply all sorts of filters to your visualizations also, most often concerning the date, either through slicers or under the filter pane and you can render them fairly dynamic. Also, being a Microsoft tool as well as an improvement of Excel in some sense, it has a lot of things in common with Excel.", "A particular thing about this tool is that it has its own querying language: DAX (Data Analytics eXpressions) language. It has few rules and a lot of functions that you can use to query your data and create what are called measures or new columns in PBI. It is fairly easy to understand, a little bit harder to use and optimize. This, however, can be a drawback because anyone that wants to use the tool needs to learn a new querying language and it requires extra effort.", "As a tool, it offers a lot of functionalities however one of its limits concerns the relationships between the tables that you can define. If a relationship could cause ambiguity you cannot define it and you have to find workarounds any time this issue comes up and it is not rare that this happens. Most often the problem arises because as we know datasets are not perfect nor is the way they were thought of at first. It can be quite frustrating to find a solution when these issues come up.", "Fun fact: there is a distinction between report and dashboard in Power BI. A report is what you develop and publish in Power BI Desktop while a dashboard is created in Power BI Service using visualizations coming from different reports.", "Spotfire is yet another business analytics tool that was bought by TIBCO. The purpose of the tool is the same as that of Power BI: you create reports to visually analyze your data. The drill is pretty much the same, different data sources are supported, many types of visualizations are available, you can customize them as you wish as well as make them interactive with one another, filters can be applied and so on and so forth.", "In this case, the language used to query your data is that of SQL so there is no need to learn a new and specific language for the tool. The tricky part of the tools, however, is in knowing the \u201chidden\u201d functionalities like document properties, static and dynamic variables or inserting R/Python scripts. The general idea that I have created while working with these tools is that these functionalities are closer to a classic programming language where you have to define variables and then use them later on. These functionalities of the tools are not endless, nor are they very difficult to use but in contrast with PBI functionalities, they are not immediate.", "Another cool and useful feature of Spotfire is that is you can use HTML and JavaScript scripts to better define your report and customize it as much as possible which is after all the whole purpose of a tool like this.", "The thing about these tools is that they are built to create content with the purpose of sharing. Dashboards are built so that they can be shared within a company or externally, depends on the data being used and the information being shared. In a sense, these tools are optimized for this last step of the whole process, the possibilities of creating categories of users, to create roles and assign these roles to people or groups of people and show each role the designated data without having to create many copies adapted to the group of users. In both tools all these options are possible. However, there are limitations for example in the case of Power BI there are limits if you want to assign roles to users and also give them the possibility to refresh the dataset.", "One of the things that you notice when looking up this kind of visualization tools is that they also provide the possibility to do what is called Self BI. What is meant with Self BI is that of the end user creating their own reports given a dataset without the intervention of the IT or the analytics team. The end user of a report is intended as anyone, which means that everything needs to be simplified and generalized so that it can be used from an engineer but also from someone who does not have any knowledge in databases and SQL. While the generation of visualizations per se can be quite easy building the data model is not a piece of cake so quite often the data model is provided to the end-user and they build their reports on top of that. The alternative would be that of training said users to get the fundamental knowledge in order to build those models and that requires investment in time and money and it can be counterproductive.", "The intelligence part of the name is also referred to the fact that on top of everything else these tools provide some Artificial Intelligence features like forecasts for series, clustering or classification. As these tools are made to simplify and generalize the data analysis process they also generalize the application of a predictive algorithm, reducing it to a black box. These are a topic for another day but needless to say the generalization of any AI algorithm has yet to show any result.", "Just like the \u201cNo Free Lunch \u201d theorem in Machine Learning goes or how the comparison of programming languages for a task conclude that there does not exist one that is the best fit for every situation, the same can be applied to data visualization tools as well. There exist many, each one of them with the pros and cons that one has to evaluate before choosing. However, since the functionalities offered by them are nowadays pretty much the same, in most cases it goes to a simple factor: the costs of use and maintenance of such service within the company. The costs don\u2019t include the tool itself per se, it is a question of licences for the end users and the frequency with which the dashboards will then be used.", "When I first started working with data visualization tools the engineer in me would often get frustrated with how (at times) inefficient these tools can be when it comes to querying the data and cutting out some of the possible scenarios with their limitations. I would instantly think of how easily some simple data operations can be done with a programming language, being used to always doing data visualization using Python or R. These tools do offer the possibility to insert scripts within them but these features are most often used in cases where the dashboard has to interact with some other system like trigger the run of an algorithm. Nonetheless, being their sole focus the visual analysis and more importantly, the sharing features they provide make these tools the go-to choice for doing data visualization.", "Your home for data science.
