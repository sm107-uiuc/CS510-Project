At Insight Data Science, I created a tool to help families in California understand the risk of attending a newly opened charter school.", "Charter schools are publicly funded but privately operated, so they aren\u2019t run by traditional public school districts, but they don\u2019t charge tuition like a private school. Charter schools have experienced substantial growth over the past 25 years, with about three million students enrolled nationally in 2016 (accounting for six percent of total public school enrollment). Charter schools often focus on a particular curriculum, such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) or the arts, and are often smaller than traditional public schools. These features can be appealing to students looking for an alternative to more traditional educational settings, and in part explain the growth of the charter sector.", "While I was working on my Ph.D. in economics at the University of Arizona, I had the opportunity to perform quantitative work for BASIS Schools (a charter school network). At BASIS Schools, I observed classroom instruction and various other aspects of the administration, and was impressed by the educational experience being provided by the network.", "BASIS Schools started from humble beginnings: its first school opened in 1998 in a leased space that formerly served as a grocery store. BASIS Schools grew to include two high schools in the U.S. News and World Report 2019 national rankings of best public high schools, including the third-ranked overall school, BASIS Scottsdale.", "Unfortunately, not all charter school stories end with the same level of success. As charter schools often lack the level of operational and financial support of schools run by traditional public school districts, they can face greater levels of instability.", "Of the 831 charter schools that have opened in California since 2010, 73.5 percent are still operating (as opposed to 90.4 percent of California traditional public schools that opened over the same period). An unexpected school closure can lead to serious distress for a family, leaving parents and students scrambling to find a suitable educational alternative.", "One mother whose daughter was enrolled at a new charter school that unexpectedly closed said that she would consider enrolling in a charter school again, but wanted to know:", "\u201c\u2026how can I do a better job of evaluating everybody\u2019s numbers?\u2026 What are the hard questions we need to ask? So that if we can prevent this in the future, we absolutely will.\u201d", "Understanding the potential positive and negative aspects of attending a new charter school, I created CharterPredictor. At charterpredictor.com, families in California can find a recently opened charter school that opened during the 2017 or 2018 school years, and run CharterPredictor on the school. CharterPredictor then provides the parents with a measure of whether or not the school is a \u201crisky\u201d or \u201csafe\u201d choice, along with the probability that the school will continue to operate for three years after initially opening.", "CharterPredictor also displays the school\u2019s initial enrollment, an important predictor of whether or not a school will continue to operate (school funding is tied to the number of enrolled students, making it difficult to cover fixed costs if an insufficient number of students are enrolled). CharterPredictor also offers additional information on new charter schools adjacent to the school of interest so that families who might be interested in supporting a new charter school can quickly learn about other relevant options.", "While ultimately we are interested in the stability of all charter schools, for this iteration of the project, I wanted to focus on new charter schools as these are particularly at risk of closure as they tend to lack the resources of more established schools.", "The data behind CharterPredictor come from the California Department of Education, which include information on school openings and closings, enrollment, and demographic information. I collected records from 2004 through 2018 school years, and then combined them with ZIP Code level data on unemployment and education levels from the American Community Survey. Finally, I obtained parent ratings of traditional public schools (from GreatSchools \u2014 GreatSchools is like Yelp for schools, where parents can leave a review and rating for a school) adjacent to each charter school in order get a measure of traditional public school competition.", "In order to predict which new charter schools are at risk of closing, I took all new charter school openings in California over the period of 2004 to 2016 (which consists of 1,017 new school openings) and I split the data into a training set and a test set using a 60/40 split. CharterPredictor then uses information from schools opened in 2017 and 2018 to make predictions.", "I use XGBoost to model the closure of charter schools, as XGBoost gives me slightly more accurate predictions than a logistic regression model. The XGBoost model results in an area-under-the-curve (\u201cAUC\u201d) measure of 0.95, whereas the logistic regression results in an AUC of 0.94. Although the logistic regression is more interpretable, I proceeded with XGBoost as I expect it will better generalize to new states beyond California and new features.", "I use cross validation and a grid search over several hyper-parameters including maximum tree depth, shrinkage, and number of boosting rounds to tune the model (you can view the code to construct the analysis data set and at the CharterPredictor GitHub repository). Charter schools with a predicted probability of closing of 20 percent or greater are classified as \u201crisky,\u201d as this seems like the level I might want to be notified of if I were a parent considering the stability of a school, though the cutoff is admittedly somewhat arbitrary.", "The trained model has 94.1 percent accuracy, recall of 70.3 percent and precision of 70.3 percent when evaluating the test set. Of the 38 schools that actually closed in our test set, CharterPredictor would have correctly classified 26 of those as risky. If the primary goal of CharterPredictor is to protect students from instability, we might choose a lower the probability of closing as a threshold to define a school as risky. However, it is important to avoid becoming over-zealous in classifying schools as risky as some of these schools might be good opportunities we want families to consider.", "As educational data and charter school policies vary from state to state, I wanted to start by focusing on California. The next step to make this a more useful tool would be to expand this beyond California. As of now, I believe that CharterPredictor could be a useful tool for helping California families feel more confident in their educational choices.", "In general, I enjoy working with industries that straddle the private and public spheres (e.g. education, health, energy), as they tend to have great data available (I likely would have trouble obtaining enterprise details and openings/closings in entirely private markets). Also, these public/private markets tend to be tied to outcomes we tend to care a great deal about from a social perspective.", "Patrick Cizek obtained his Ph.D. in economics at the University of Arizona, where he specialized in empirical microeconomics.
