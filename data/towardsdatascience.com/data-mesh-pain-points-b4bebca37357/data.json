It pretends to drive a new architecture approach for building the analytics solutions which often is treated as cutting edge, fancy approach and started already to be adopted by some of the organizations.", "Despite the fact, Zhamak Dehghani brings a lot of great thoughts with decent reasoning behind them (original article is here), I see serious concerns preventing me from recommending it to apply to the majority of data analytics platforms.", "The Data Mesh Architecture is broad and covers different aspects of a data analytics platform, but I would like to concentrate on two ones, which in my point of view are important to delve deeper into:", "In addition to that, domain data is being split into:", "A high-level illustration of the data domains distribution along with possible data pulls dependencies is reflected in the picture below:", "When I look at the diagram above, the right part of it (set of consumer-oriented domain datasets), looks very similar to the Data Marts component in the famous Inmon\u2019s CIF architecture published in 1998:", "The domain-oriented datasets were just called datasets created for the departmental needs or Data Marts.", "The very similar approach you could find also in Data Vault architecture defined by Daniel Linstedt, the only difference here that data marts are called \u201cInfomation Marts\u201d but serve the same purpose.", "Ralph Kimball also mentioned (as one of the alternatives to his Bus Architecture) an \u201cIndependent Data Mart Architecture\u201d with the same part related to the consumption:", "So, I don\u2019t agree with Zhamak\u2019s statement in regards to data platforms that haven\u2019t leveraged the Domain-Driven design paradigm yet:", "Though we have adopted domain oriented decomposition and ownership when implementing operational capabilities, curiously we have disregarded the notion of business domains when it comes to data", "As you can see this notion started to be introduced at the data analysis architectures in a slightly different form more than 20 years ago with all its following compliments and critiques, praises, and even holy-wars (Inmon vs Kimball)", "Let\u2019s first agree on the statement that the best data model for analytics is a (multi-)dimensional data model, built on top of star schemas. It is the most efficient and flexible. It is well scaled and the majority of the modern MPP engines are optimized for it. It is used on the data consumption layer in all the big architectures (Inmon\u2019s, Linstedt\u2019s, and Kimbal\u2019s).", "So we have the separation of the model between facts/events and dimensions. Facts that describe different business processes at an organization could be pretty well isolated from each other and could be distributed between different domains. But what about dimensions? Usually, we have a bunch of dimensions that are shared between different domains, like products, customers, org structure, employees, bank accounts, stores, etc. With a data mesh approach and isolated consumer-oriented datasets, we have two options here, both with their issues:", "Zhamak mentioned partially these concerns in her article, and gave the resolution to it with the following approach: \u201cglobal governance to enable interoperability between polyglot domain datasets\u201d.", "Frankly speaking, I believe global governance could help to prevent chaos and keep track of all the versions of the same entity in different domains, inform about the differences or similarity between them, but in fact, it won\u2019t prevent problems with duplications of the datasets and efforts related to their support.", "So the \u201cmonolithic\u201d nature of the data warehouse with its negative interpretation could be translated to the Integrated and Consolidated with all its positive meaning and advantages.", "In my opinion, Integration and Consolidations is one of the crucial benefits of the data platform which actually allows doing the data analytics in all its flavors: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive. If each of the sources contained the self-sufficient data there would be no sense to load it somewhere else. The actual integration, consolidation, and correlation of different datasets, brings the most value to the business.", "There is a myth that Data Warehouse projects are long-running and never-ending. They cannot be performed in an agile manner since it is hard to split them into the incremental parts with business value in each.", "But in fact, it is not true.", "If we follow the Bus Architecture promoted by Ralph Kimball, each row in his Bus Matrix which describes a business process could be implemented in the scope of one iteration from the end-to-end and deliver business value. So that using this kind of approach the value delivered to the business could be measured by weeks and not months or years.", "Having 15+ years of experience in building the analytics solutions on a big service provider company I have the following observation which works better: combining engineers with deeper expertise in a narrower area of knowledge is better than a set of engineers with shallow expertise in broader topics.", "So the separation of the expertise between streaming, ETL batch processing, DW design, data visualization areas of knowledge works just perfectly.", "And if we have 5\u201310 different domains, keeping the cross-functional team from 4+ engineers plus data owner in each of the domains looks just unreal and not affordable for the majority of projects.", "The data warehousing or data analytics solutions are already on the market for more than 25 years, so they are well-matured from the different perspectives and in terms of methodology in particular. What is actively changing are technologies for the underlined storages and frameworks delivering the data: they become faster, more reliable, and efficient in terms of performance and cost of ownership.", "It\u2019s worth just leverage this heritage and apply it to the modern realities with the proper adjustments, but there is no need to invent another bicycle.", "My intention was not to diminish the data mesh architecture, but rather underline the different aspects of existing data warehousing methodology which often are and not known, under-studied and under-valued.", "I hope it will lead to some productive and collaborative discussions :)", "Your home for data science.
