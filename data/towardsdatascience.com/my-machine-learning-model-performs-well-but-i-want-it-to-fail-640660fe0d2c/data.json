We can pick any dataset of our choice to work with and in my case, I chose to use the Center for Disease Control\u2019s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) results for the years 2007\u20132016 and train a model to predict whether or not an individual has high blood pressure (binary classification: yes or no). I tested a range of 28 variables in my machine learning model from demographics, eating habits, alcohol intake, activity level, occupation, and others. After testing various models, I selected a logistic regression model using 5 variables, oversampling, and setting a threshold of 0.34 to bring my target metric of recall to 0.899. I built a nice Tableau graphic to represent my findings and with this, I had technically achieved my objective: classification model complete. Check.", "To those in the data science community, this likely isn\u2019t a ground-breaking exercise. To those outside the data science community, you likely are thinking (if I haven\u2019t already lost you), \u201cI don\u2019t know what a logistic regression model or any of the things you said after that are.\u201d Well, regardless of what audience you\u2019re in, I get it. But the technicalities of my model isn\u2019t what I want to talk about.", "Well, four of the five variables in my model were somewhat expected. First was age, which is unfortunate but inevitable. The higher your age, the higher your chances of having high blood pressure. Then increase in weight, alcohol intake, and cigarette smoking all also increased chances of predicting high blood pressure, which can be hard but can be controlled or changed by an individual.", "But it\u2019s the fifth variable of the model that threw me. The variable was a particular minority race \u2014 if an individual was of this race they would have higher blood pressure. I don\u2019t feel the need to say the race here, as I don\u2019t want this piece to be about me (white woman) talking about another race. That\u2019s not my place and not a platform I deserve. If you really want to know, it\u2019s not hard to find out with a quick google, as I found out after I saw my model\u2019s results and searched for what put people at risk of high blood pressure to check my variables against (and hoped would show me why my race variable was wrong).", "What I do want to talk about is how to feel about that race variable in my model and what responsibility a data scientist has in a situation like this. There is a possibility that there is a genetic connection between the race and high blood pressure \u2014 which is sad in itself \u2014 but there\u2019s also a possibility of it being representative for many other societal things that this race faces that could lead to high blood pressure. And that\u2019s\u2026.really sad. Even if not the case for this particular model, this same line of thinking could be applied to any model where race appears as a variable due to historical oppressions of that group.", "Some might believe it\u2019s not the responsibility of the data scientist \u2014 that it\u2019s the responsibility of others to address and the data scientist just builds the thing. I don\u2019t quite agree with that and feel an obligation to do more, but I also don\u2019t know what that looks like. So I wanted to raise the question here because what I do believe this should warrant a larger conversation. For me, it\u2019s hard to just hand this model off as \u201cdone\u201d and move on. I was proud of my technical work on the modeling, but can\u2019t say I was proud to present the findings. I was sad, mad, and uncomfortable.", "Maybe my machine learning model was simple, but the moral question it raised is complex.", "I encourage and hope for comments on this article. As mentioned before, I\u2019m not here with answers; I\u2019m here to start a conversation and hope you join in so we can all work towards solutions.", "Full code for this model can be found here on github.", "Your home for data science.
