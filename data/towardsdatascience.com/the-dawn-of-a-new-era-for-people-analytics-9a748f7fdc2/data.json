Supercharging People Analytics with\u2026 | by James Hope | Towards Data Science", "h1": "A New Era for People Analytics", "description": "For every modern enterprise, to overcome the biggest strategic challenges in Human Capital Management \u2014 developing and retaining talent, improving performance, enabling growth-mindset and developing\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["For every modern enterprise, to overcome the biggest strategic challenges in Human Capital Management \u2014 developing and retaining talent, improving performance, enabling growth-mindset and developing Agile working cultures \u2014 being able to leverage People Data is essential. Yet leading industry-wide human capital management surveys find that most organisations are just about capable of the most basic level of people analytics \u2014 that is, \u2018operational reporting\u2019. Only a relatively small percentage of industry leading organisations surveyed utilise predictive analytics, and a smaller percentage still utilise these predictive algorithms to automate and enhance HCM.", "The reality facing so many organisations is that \u201ctheir People Data\u201d isn\u2019t actually theirs. Their people put their data on popular professional networks \u2014 LinkedIn of course \u2014 and on one of the many open professional networking / community platforms. And understandably so \u2014value comes in part from being connected.", "Many large organisations have seen numerous attempts at HCM platforms and intra-organisational networking tools, with one failure after the next. Too many have fallen into the same preconscious space as the open networking platforms liked LinkedIn, and in doing so, have been poorly understood. And whilst much can be learnt from the user experience and the algorithmic behaviours of these open networking tools, intra organisational networks have largely failed to deliver on what should be their overriding advantage \u2014tangible and relevant benefits placed in the user\u2019s organisational context.", "The need for organisations to find ways to derive value from their People Data \u2013 to manage talent, to understand networks and promote working culture \u2013 is greater now than it ever has been. Indeed, surveys repeatedly find that employees want their employer to be better at it. This is anecdotally supported too with unprecedented levels of employee churn and a recruitment industry that is booming. What happened to the job for life?", "To be successful in building the social enterprise today means creating and conquering \u2013 at least in the consciousness of employees \u2013 a new space where employees and companies can find relevance and value. Rebuilding the social enterprise isn\u2019t about trying to compete with the open networking platforms; it\u2019s about building an intra-connected community, where the rewards \u2014of access to learning, to professional development and to individual success \u2014 are so deeply entrenched in organisational culture and that the value of participation is great. Suffice to say that \u2018networks\u2019 are the technology that will underpin this smart capability, because people data is intrinsically interconnected.", "If anything can be learnt from the domination of professional networks like LinkedIn, it is that connecting data drives value. People data is connected. Within the privacy constraints, the interests, awards, experience, interests, positions, performance, skills and how these connect with each person drive enormous insight and value.", "People Data is not only connected but interconnected, too. For example, if employee, Anne, has a skill that is required by a vacant position, we might recommend that position to her. Conversely, if Anne requires a skill for a role she is interested in, we might want to recommend a course to her to enable her to acquire that skill.", "With these relationships between the data explicitly defined, the opportunities for organisations to develop and leverage talent, evaluate and improve performance, is vast. To continue the example, the path that Anne is following; the skills she has yet to acquire; her influence in the organisation and her chances of making the cut are easier to quantify because they are more deeply understood. And crucially, because individual aspirations \u2014 well beyond just remunerative \u2014 are better understood, rewards are more relevant and the level of engagement in the data process is that much higher.", "It is being able to understand the constantly evolving relationships in what people learn, who and what they interact with that is the key to human capital management. Developing, maintaining and querying relational-SQL structures to extract meaning from People Data is using the wrong tool for the wrong job. Developing and maintaining a graph on the other hand is not just more performant, but allows analysts to develop iteratively, through continual feedback from the business users, because modelling with graphs is intuitive enough for users to understand. Such is the schema-less nature of native graph technologies that the data users become the data analysts, and opportunities for People Data exploration \u2014 tasks usually reserved for the data scientists \u2014 become a possibility for every team and every employee, no matter how junior or senior. All this makes for a new era for People Analytics, where People Data is connected, available for everyone, and the analytics is just as agile as the organisation and decision makers want to be with it.", "Looking to the future, the opportunity for People Analytics powered by graph technology is great for a number of reasons:", "Social enterprise applications that employees adopt will need to be built on graphs\u2014 because personalised recommendations and predictive analytics around learning, career development and support is all easily achievable with graphs, content will be more relevant and employees therefore are more likely to interact with those applications.", "Better insights into people data \u2014 People Data is highly connected. Graphs provide the ideal technology stack for connected data and graphs algorithms for centrality and community detection offer insights that are hard to obtain with relational table structures.", "Organisations become more adaptable\u2014 Graph enable Agile ways of working with data which is key in being adaptable in human capital market that is changing and evolving all of the time. In particular, with graphs, business users can make an active contribution to defining and evolving the graph model which means that the analytics and views of the data are always relevant.", "Improved efficiency and analytical capability \u2014 Data Analysts are spared from writing time consuming joins as they would to query on relational structures, and can instead be reallocated to higher-order tasks such as developing the graph model for advanced analytics.", "Analytics becomes democratised and drives decision making\u2014 Querying graphs is more intuitive than relational structures and visualisation tools provide powerful story telling for decision makers across the business.", "See a People Graph in action. In my next post I\u2019ll build a People Graph to show you how graphs improve HCM capability.
