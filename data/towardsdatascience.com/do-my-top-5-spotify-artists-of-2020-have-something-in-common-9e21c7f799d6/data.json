You can get the code with regards to the scraping of data on my GitHub repository.", "From the data available, I have only selected those variables related to the audio features. The audio features are as follows:", "After retrieving the dataset from Spotify API through scraping, now it\u2019s time to transit the programming language from Python to R. Before importing the dataset, let\u2019s call the packages that would be used throughout this exercise.", "The below datasets were scraped through Python\u2019s Spotipy when accessing the Spotify API to call each of the Top 5 Spotify Artists from my #2020Wrapped.", "In order to merge the 5 datasets of the different artists, rbind is implemented. This function can be used to bind several vectors, matrices, or data frames by rows.", "Thereafter, the cleaning of the compiled dataset is necessary. This includes the dropping of unnecessary columns that would not be used in this exercise.", "Before moving on to the next stage, Exploratory Data Analysis, I need to ensure if there are any null values in the dataset.", "Fortunately, in the below results, there are no null values in both of the datasets else there is a need to drop data with null values.", "The creation of the new dataset that retains numerical variables is done for the later process of this exercise \u2014 Model Building.", "Lastly, the function of generating radar charts is created where the audio features are normalised at the values from 0 to 1 to provide readability of the chart.", "A radar chart is useful to compare the musical vibes of the 5 artists in a more visual way.", "From the visualisation, we can infer the patterns for each artist:", "After getting a glimpse of the audio features among the artists, we would like to understand the correlation between the popularity of the songs and the audio features of the songs by using a correlation matrix.", "From the correlation matrix, we can identify that:", "In this sub-section, we would like to understand which audio features made the songs of the top 5 artists popular.", "From the above plots, we can observe that most of the songs by the 5 artists are:", "These seem to be characteristics of songs that I am interested in listening to.", "In this sub-section, we would like to understand the variations of the above features between the artists.", "From the boxplot diagram, Lauv\u2019s songs have the highest acoustics while both Martin Garrix\u2019s and Gryffin\u2019s songs have a similar interquartile range of acoustics. It is expected that Lauv\u2019s songs have high acoustics among the rest of the artists\u2019 as most of his songs are played without the use of electronic amplification equipment. Whereas, the rest of the artists\u2019 songs do use electronic amplification equipment as they are EDM songs but Kygo\u2019s songs also include acoustic version (such as Kids in Love (feat. The Night Game) \u2014 Acoustic Version) of his original EDM songs, hence, Kygo\u2019s songs have higher acoustic than Martin Garrix\u2019s, The Chainsmokers\u2019, and Gryffin\u2019s.", "Surprisingly, Lauv\u2019s songs have the highest danceability as the rest of the artists\u2019 songs are mainly EDM songs. Both the songs from The Chainsmokers and Gryffin have a similar median of danceability and similar first quantile (25th percentile) of danceability, which is similar to the median of danceability of the songs from Martin Garrix.", "Martin Garrix\u2019s songs have the highest energy as compared to the rest of the artists. Furthermore, the songs from Kygo, The Chainsmokers, Martin Garrix, and Gryffin have higher energy than Lauv. This is expected as EDM songs have high energy.", "Gryffin\u2019s songs have the highest loudness as compared to the rest of the artists. Similar to the analysis of energy, the songs from Kygo, The Chainsmokers, Martin Garrix, and Gryffin are louder than Lauv. This is expected as well because EDM songs are loud.", "The tempo represents the speed of a song and the mood it evokes. The higher the tempo of a song, the more inspiring and joyful it tends to be. Else, it indicates sadness of a song. Both songs from The Chainsmokers and Gryffin have a similar third quantile (75th percentile) of tempo. Martin Garrix\u2019s songs have the lowest tempo.", "Among the rest of the artists\u2019, Lauv\u2019s songs have the highest valence while Martin Garrix\u2019s songs have the lowest valence. As compared to the songs from the rest of the artists, this means that Lauv\u2019s songs bring in more positive vibes while Martin Garrix\u2019s songs bring in more negative vibes. Both the songs from Lauv and The Chainsmokers have a similar median of valence. Both the songs from The Chainsmokers and Gryffin have similar third quantile of valence.", "Clustering is conducted in this exercise to find out which songs of the artists are similar and discover new songs that I might like.", "Firstly, we need to conduct the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to detect outliers before conducting clustering.", "Based on the correlation between variables within Dimension 1 (25.99%), We found 5 variables considered as most contributing variables, i.e: energy, loudness, liveness, valence, and danceability.", "Before initiating the process of clustering, it is necessary to remove the outliers. Then, in order to get a new PCA, there is a need to create a new data scaled.", "After completing the above task, we will have to pick the optimal number of clusters (K) by using the Elbow Method. The following is the function of building the elbow method chart as well as the output of the elbow method chart of the top_5_artists_df_scale1.", "From the chart, we can infer that the optimal K is 8 since within groups\u2019 sum of squares is not changing significantly after K = 8.", "From picking the optimal number of clusters, i.e. 8, we can start on building the clusters.", "After building the clusters, now it\u2019s time to perform profiling of the clusters.", "From the table, the characteristic summary of the songs of the Top 5 Spotify Artists in the same cluster are as follows:", "After finishing the clustering and profiling of the songs, a song recommendation system is built to enable listeners to get effective suggestions regarding the next best songs according to their taste.", "In this exercise, I would like to check which cluster does my favourite song, Lauv\u2019s Mean It, belong to.", "From the output table, my favourite song is in cluster 8 (Lowest tempo, and most popular).", "Now, let\u2019s try a new artist, let\u2019s say\u2026 Gryffin. Hence, we can check the best songs from Gryffin that I should try listening to based on my taste given that my favourite song is Mean It by Lauv.", "These are the songs from Gryffin that I should try listening to based on the music taste of my favourite song, Lauv\u2019s Mean It.", "Further analysis is made to understand what are the common words popping up in the Top 5 Spotify Artists\u2019 songs\u2019 lyrics through the generation of word cloud as well as the conducting of sentiment analysis based on emotions of all the lyrics from the Top 5 Spotify Artists. Special thanks to Ekene A. for providing clear and concise instructions on how to scrape lyrics from Genius.com using Python.", "In this exercise, the lyrics of each artist\u2019s top 3 songs are scraped.", "Before conducting the generation of word cloud and emotion sentiment analysis, it is necessary to process text cleaning in order to remove the punctuations, numbers, and irrelevant words.", "In this exercise, the word cloud is generated based on the top 200 common words among the top 3 songs of each artist.", "In a word cloud, larger words meaning more appearances in the lyrics.", "Out of the 200 frequently appeared words in the lyrics of the top 3 songs of each artist, Love is the most frequently appeared word. This shows that love is definitely a common theme that revolves around my Top 5 Spotify Artists. Other words that follow the theme of Love include Paris, Heart, and Baby. Due to this, it seems that I\u2019m a person who prefers songs that bring romance vibes.", "From the visualisation, we can observe that the lyrics of all the top 3 songs of each artist are associated with negative emotion of sadness. Furthermore, the lyrics associated with the negative emotion of fear and the positive emotion of joy are the same. Lastly, the lyrics associated with the negative emotion of disgust is less than 15.", "This could mean that I would prefer songs that provide low valence and low tempo since the majority of the lyrics from the top 3 songs of each artist are associated with sadness.", "Other than briefly mentioned of data scraping using Python, this exercise has demonstrated data cleaning & transformation, data analysis, data visualisation, and data modelling using R.", "It has allowed us to understand what is the relationship between the audio features of the songs as well as what are the common audio features of my Top 5 Spotify Artists of 2020.", "Furthermore, clustering and profiling were done to group the songs based on their similarities to understand their characteristics which, in turn, constructing a song recommendation to find out what other songs that can give them a try to listen based on the taste of my favourite song.", "Additional analysis was done to find out the insights of the lyrics of the songs from the artists. However, there is a limitation to scrape the lyrics. One can input any amount of songs to scrape the lyrics from the artists but the output of data scrape would be empty or not entirely scraped. Hence, due to making sure that all lyrics were scraped, this exercise has scraped the lyrics from the top 3 songs of each of the Top 5 Spotify Artists.", "This exercise has also illustrated the plotting of the word cloud, identifying the theme occurred in the word cloud, as well as implementing an emotion classification with NRC sentiment to interpret emotions found in the lyrics.", "In the case when such similar exercise exists in the future, I will explore more on Multiple Linear Regression model or Logistic Regression model to predict the popularity of the songs based on their audio features.", "All in all, this exercise is fulfilling and allows me to understand my music taste more!", "Your home for data science.
