Reports and dashboards are go-to approaches for modern-day business intelligence tools.", "Disclaimer: I am in no way, shape, or form affiliated with any of these BI tools. The article is based purely on personal and professoional experience.", "All of the BI tools you\u2019ll see in this article are top contenders in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant. Because of that, all of them are considered to be go-to solutions for enterprise businesses.", "Here\u2019s a list of my top BI tools:", "In addition to evaluating these tools, I\u2019ll also answer the question of whether you should develop custom dashboards from scratch, and when would be an appropriate time for that.", "This BI tool doesn\u2019t need an introduction. If you\u2019re reading this article, you probably know what Tableau is and what it can do. It is considered one of the leading analytics platforms for good reasons \u2014 it is intuitive and easy to use and has remarkable visualization capabilities that look great by default.", "Further, Tableau can connect to almost any data source you can imagine, handles larger datasets with ease, and has a great community behind it.", "If this wasn\u2019t the case, I seriously doubt that giants like Charles Schwab, PepsiCo, Verizon, and St. Mary\u2019s Bank would use it on a daily basis.", "The impressive features and ease of use don\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t any downsides to using Tableau. A lot of Tableau users complain about inadequate support. In many cases, all that the support team does is recommend that you buy another feature, promising that it will solve your issues.", "With Tableau, you are also limited in embedding features. If you have many visual elements, it becomes a real challenge to build a responsive dashboard. Further, I\u2019ve found it almost impossible to build an external component that interacts with Tableau charts.", "Next, let\u2019s discuss pricing. Tableau offers a 14-day free trial, but once that\u2019s over, the only viable option is to pay $840 for a year-long subscription. That comes to $70 per month, which is by no means cheap (and since we\u2019re all stuck at home \u2014 we already have multiple streaming service subscriptions to pay for monthly).", "Scale this cost to a 10-person team, and that\u2019s an expense you\u2019ll notice ($8,400 per year!). More affordable options are available, but these are either limited in their capabilities or can\u2019t be purchased for a single user.", "For example, maybe some team members only want to look at charts and dashboards \u2014 so the Viewer license is enough for them. That will only set you back $12 per month instead of $70. If you want to use Tableau on the web only, the Explorer license is available. This will cost you $35 per user/month, but it requires you to purchase at least five licenses.", "To conclude: Tableau is an excellent and easy-to-use BI tool, but it\u2019s not cheap and has multiple potential deal-breaker limitations.", "PowerBI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn unrelated sources into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights \u2014 at least according to Microsoft.", "PowerBI is one of the most widely recognized BI tools due to its intuitive interface, various visualization options, and because it looks good by default. Even if something isn\u2019t supported, PowerBI can easily connect to R and Python.", "PowerBI comes in a few different flavors:", "All of these options and plenty of other more technical details made PowerBI a tool of choice for giant corporations, such as Walmart, Apple, And ExxonMobil.", "PowerBI is easy to get started with. You\u2019ll only need a couple of crash courses to create impressive data visualizations. Don\u2019t let this fool you though \u2014 PowerBI is tough to master, as this requires learning the whole suite of Microsoft tools.", "At the same time, that\u2019s the biggest reason to use PowerBI \u2014 it includes full integration with the Microsoft ecosystem (authorization, Azure, Office 365, and so on). If you are a big fan of Microsoft\u2019s UI, it\u2019s safe to say you\u2019ll find PowerBI somewhat familiar and comfortable.", "As with Tableau, PowerBI isn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows. PowerBI is read-only, and you can\u2019t access the source code. As a result, it is nearly impossible to maintain proper version control.", "Also, you can\u2019t do too much about visuals within PowerBI. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there is a lot you can tweak, but the amount of options doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with how charts end up looking. The UI can also feel overwhelming at first because there are too many icons and menus to look at, which takes focus away from the visualizations.", "When it comes to pricing, things look better with PowerBI than with Tableau. PowerBI desktop is entirely free, provided you have a Windows machine. It is limited to approximately 2GB of data, but you can always upgrade to the Pro version if you need more. It will set you back $9.99 per month per user, so this shouldn\u2019t be a deal-breaker.", "There are more advanced Premium versions of PowerBI which are used in enterprise situations, and those currently cost $4,995 per month per dedicated cloud compute and storage resource.", "To conclude: PowerBI can be entirely free for individuals and small teams depending on the use case. The tool has its quirks, and it\u2019s not as intuitive as Tableau, but it won\u2019t cost you a small fortune to get started.", "Sisense falls into a category of excellent but lesser-known BI tools. It\u2019s not that no one is using Sisense \u2014 just the opposite \u2014 but it\u2019s the lack of brand awareness that makes you think of Tableau or PowerBI first. Even so, I think Sisense gives PowerBI and Tableau a run for their money.", "Sisense provides a drag and drop solution for analytics and dashboards, both on-premise and in the cloud. Dashboards and insights can be shared with multiple users, and they can even run their queries, depending on the set permission level.", "Sisense has been placed in the Visionary quadrant of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for BI and Analytic platforms (read more). That\u2019s a huge accomplishment because the competition is harsh in this department. Further, Sisense is well-recognized and used by companies such as Hewlett Packard (HP), Phillips, Nasdaq, Motorola, and Wix.", "Sisense is divided into two parts:", "In the ElastiCube, you can load and establish connections to the data. Keep in mind that it requires a Windows machine to function. If you are not on Windows, the cloud is the only option. Any form of analysis and visualization is done through the web interface. Sisense is known for its good performance on larger datasets and low-ish hardware requirements.", "That all sounds great, but let\u2019s consider the downsides. It has been reported many times that Sisense dashboards only work well on the web. The other big downside is that Sisense doesn\u2019t support sending scheduled reports via email. Besides that, Sisense is a great BI tool that doesn\u2019t lag behind its more well-known competitors.", "With regards to the pricing, there\u2019s not much I can tell you. They offer an annual licensing model tailored to individual business needs, but how much it actually costs for an arbitrary user is unknown.", "Answering this question isn\u2019t easy. The only truly correct answer is \u201cit depends\u201d, but you are unlikely to view that as a satisfying answer. I\u2019ll try to demystify this question as much as possible in this section.", "Using a BI tool is sometimes enough. If you are analyzing and visualizing data for yourself, it doesn\u2019t have to look amazing. The only important thing is that it gets the job done. This might also be the case for internal analysis and visualization projects in smaller companies.", "But what if you are performing and delivering analysis for a client? Can you afford to make your reports look only somewhat decent instead of amazing/impressive? Probably not. That\u2019s where custom-built web applications in the form of a data analytics dashboard come into play.", "Most BI tools fail whenever you try to integrate them within other web apps, and you are forced to use their products individually. This limitation often results in having multiple BI tools within one organization rather than having access to a single integrated solution.", "If you want to leave a professional impression on your clients, developing an analytical solution from scratch isn\u2019t just one of the options \u2014 it is the only option.", "Covering all of the available business intelligence tools isn\u2019t feasible for a single article. Instead, I wanted to cover a few of the top market leaders. Tableau, PowerBI, and Sisense have their place in modern data analytics and visualization, and it\u2019s up to you to decide which one(s) you\u2019ll use.", "If price is your main concern, start with PowerBI. The free version comes with more than enough features for many users, but if you want something completely customizable, R Shiny and other code-based solutions are your only real options.", "Loved the article?
