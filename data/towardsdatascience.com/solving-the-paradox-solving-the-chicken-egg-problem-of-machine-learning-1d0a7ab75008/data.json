Machine classification is easy when you\u2019ve already extracted 10,000+ positive/negative/anything examples of what you want to classify and have them neatly laid out in a .txt file somewhere. Machine classification is hard when you don\u2019t have any way of assembling something close to that scale without paying a domain expert hundreds of thousands of dollars to do an extremely boring task. You\u2019d typically turn to a labeling system to do that for you \u2014 but wait! You need the classification system to do the automatic labeling for you. There lies the paradox.", "This is something I\u2019ve devoted a serious amount of my time to while at Northwestern and in my career is developing workarounds to this issue. How do you crack that \u2018Chicken and Egg\u2019 problem of needing a good classification model to have a labeling system, but in order to get a good labeling system you need a classification model? The answer lies within the sentence, with particular attention to the word \u2018good\u2019.", "See, humans benefit from already having the equivalent of a generalized machine learning system in their heads. That\u2019s why the premier example of a deep learning algorithm is called a neural network. Our brains are really good at spotting initial patterns in information, they just don\u2019t scale well and aren\u2019t perfect at it. In this paper, I\u2019m going to lay out a schema for training a classification model \u2014 which is arguably the first step before you can go into any other kind of machine learning tasks like generation or reinforcement learning.", "This schema will not be groundbreaking to any experienced machine learning engineers. It is something that they probably had a vague sense of doing when they were faced with complex problems that didn\u2019t have neatly labeled datasets. Instead, the purpose of this post is to potentially frame a very ambiguous topic in a slightly different wording \u2014 in the hope that it makes a complex topic a bit easier to understand for someone going forward.", "The answer I am about to propose is that you stop trying to create a perfect system right away. A perfect system often (but not always) is hindered by one thing. It\u2019s not the hyperparameters, it\u2019s not (always) the model you choose (though that is important to get right), but rather the data needs to be in some form of order to analyze it. It\u2019s helpful if it\u2019s already arranged in a neat Excel document, but as unstructured data scientists know, the most potent information is rarely ordered.", "I don\u2019t have a great framework for how to handle unstructured environments in place yet. All I can offer is my own strategy for creating labeled datasets from unstructured word documents, and gather suggestions on how to expand outward and generalize across a variety of environments.", "My task is to create a \u2018sectionizer\u2019 or a way of classifying areas of a document under a particular label. This is intended to be a building block for a later construct \u2014 a way of contextualizing unstructured documents across a variety of fields. For the purposes of this post, I use unstructured to refer to documents that aren\u2019t split up across database-like fields. It isn\u2019t to suggest that there is no structure to them \u2014 in fact, the underlying structure of the documents and my ability to spot it is partially why this approach works. Considering that all my input documents are unstructured in this sense, I\u2019m attempting to introduce structure and labeling to create a labeled dataset.", "All of the elements of my \u2018unstructured text\u2019 are labeled to some degree with headers preceding the sections. In a sense, this is a \u2018label\u2019 but it\u2019s not a label that I can use reliably. The section headers aren\u2019t always going to match (there are different authors who use different ways of referring to the same thing), but I need to be able to match a certain document\u2019s sections to a universal taxonomy. This is the reason for needing training data.", "My plan is to spot the section titles by tokenizing the documents into sentences, and then tokenizing each individual sentence and getting the length of the string & pairing it with the sentence. Then I\u2019ll extract only the \u2018sentences\u2019 that are less than 6 words, and consider those the section titles. I won\u2019t always be right, but I\u2019ll have something go off of. I\u2019ll then \u2018sectionize\u2019 each document using this method, identifying each section title as a \u2018label\u2019 and everything that follows it until the next section as the \u2018content\u2019. In separate .txt files, I will title each .txt file as the section title and write in its associated contents as the data. My hypothesis is that as I run this across 20+ documents, I will assemble a dataset of 20+ examples of each section within this ecosystem of .txt files.", "Finally, my justification for creating this training set is the assumption that all the documents I\u2019m working with won\u2019t fit this neat schema I\u2019m developing. The section titles won\u2019t always match, even though their content should. It will be a far cry from a perfect way of assessing each section, but I think it will serve to be a useful preliminary dataset assembly process. The hope is that with time and initial classification algorithms, I can then implement an active learning solution that I can use to improve the data I\u2019m feeding in.", "I\u2019d be interested in getting others\u2019 opinions about my strategy, whether it hinges on too many uncertain assumptions or whether my approach is too convoluted. However, I think it\u2019s a good first step in approaching a highly unstructured environment that needs a bit of preliminary structure to begin work in it. It\u2019s taking advantage of the fact that my own observations can notice some small patterns, which I can use to circumvent the paradox of needing labeled datasets to produce good classifications, but needing a classifier to produce an automated labeled dataset. My next step is to create several baselines to identify improvements in the model I create.", "Your home for data science.
