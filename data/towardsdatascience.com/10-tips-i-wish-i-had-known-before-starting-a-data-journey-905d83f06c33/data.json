Lots of people are studying the field, but in some sense, information is quite spread and not homogenised. This post is a brief summary of the 10 things I would have loved to know about data before I started:", "This talk was the keynote to kick-off the 3rd edition of the AI Saturdays Madrid\u2019s chapter. AISaturdays is an amazing initiative to democratise the access to Artificial Intelligence by gathering together and learn by coding with the aim of creating projects.", "At some point, it looked like all of the sudden most of the companies had a strong interest in \u201cBig Data\u201d. From all that noise, a sentence came up: \u201cBig Data is like teenage sex: everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone claims they are doing it\u201d", "Three things evolved to create this \u201cBig Data\u201d opportunity:", "Think of data as dimensions, like points in a graphic. A dimension could be something as simple as an Excel column. In the following example you can see three people represented by a set of variables (dimensions). This variables can be represented in a graph:", "In this case we have 3 dimensions, distance_loom, weekly_hours and churn_ai. The objective here is to separate the different users with an algorithm.", "Once you represent the information in dimensions, you will understand much better what an algorithm does.", "Once you see data as a collection of dimensions, think of an algorithm as a tool that tries make sense over those dimensions. In the following example, the objective is to differentiate the blue from the red users with the available data (columns / dimensions). Different algorithms will extract their logic in different ways:", "The function the algorithms want to optimise to differentiate these points (in our case the separation between users) is what we call the objective function. A function that guides the algorithm, and tell us whether it is right or wrong:", "The final objective is to get the Real Value and the Predicted Value as close as possible, without overfitting. The algorithm uses the dimensions available (variables) and uses its own logic to approach this objective.", "There is a bias for complexity in Machine Learning, period. Once you are working in the field, sometimes you may try to mix different models, in some esoteric way, which only adds more and more complexity. Usually, the simpler the better. In order to improve your algorithm\u2019s performance, there are two clear ways:", "Almost always, clever data will win. When you are facing an ML problem, think about which variables will help you to improve your model.", "Period. Most of the time, when you arrive at a company you may think they will have a Machine Learning problem, as you saw in the courses, ready for you. Reality couldn\u2019t be further away. There are three types of situations:", "You should have two things in mind when looking for a Machine Learning problem:", "The key for having an impact is to iterate end-to-end with the algorithm process as fast as you can. Your variables could be misleading / non realistic for your problem (leak), some of them could be unfeasible to calculate in production. Ask yourself the question: does my prediction make sense?", "These are the kind of things that you realise when you iterate until the end of the process.", "\u00bfLooking for a job?

After all these years there has always been a discussion, which is better:", "Old enterprise software? Open source R or Python? This has currently shifted to frameworks of reference. Think in an \u201cOpen Source way\u201d, embrace knowledge and be ready to learn something new. New, unfruitful discussions like these will surely arise, do not waste your time with them.", "This is a marathon rather than a sprint. On the left graph you have what was called a Data Scientist back in the days, a unicorn (\ud83e\udd84). On the right one, a more realistic diagram from David Silver\u2019s RL course (link).", "In my humble opinion it\u2019s pseudo impossible to stay up to date and to be an \u201cA.I. expert\u201d. You can be an expert in a field, but not in all the fields. This can generate some sort of an impostor syndrome. Do not worry, it happens to almost every Data Scientist I talked to. In this profession you have to learn everyday.", "This is Trevor Hastie. A Stanford professor and one of the most acknowledged statisticians in the world. The story behind the picture is that I knocked his door asking for an book autograph (yes, nerd), and we had a great conversation about statistics, Deep Learning and R.", "He, one of the best, he was extremely humble and kind with me. A very important thing for the journey.", "The boom of the Data Science profession could be similar to that of a \u201cDoctor\u201d profession being born all of the sudden. Data Scientist is a generic term that is becoming more and more specialized. Two profiles are top notch:", "One of the most interesting topics in my opinion is Causal Inference. We are creating amazing things that predict, build insights and help us, but how do they make decisions? Can we conclude causality from our analysis?
