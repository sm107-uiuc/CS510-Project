A refrigerator looks incomplete to me unless there are a few scratch-offs or Mega Million tickets stuck to it. Every holiday or birthday I would (and still do) receive scratch off tickets combined with half-joke/half-threats that \u201cif you win big, I\u2019m getting a cut!\u201d", "For better or for worse, I eventually moved to Alabama where the lottery is illegal. This was a bit of a shock for me, but I eventually got used to it. Every time I visit family in NY, however, I\u2019m reminded of the pull it has on people when I see the glowing billboards, when I see the primary colored logos blasted in my face at every gas station, and (of course) when I hear my family bring it up in conversation regularly.", "All that goes to say, I\u2019ve always been curious about the actual numbers behind the scenes. I finally decided to buckle down and simulate the Mega Million to add some perspective to the way I think about it.", "Let\u2019s start with the basics. How do you play Mega Millions and what are the rules? (If you already know this, feel free to skip)", "Their website explains it pretty well. Below is an image with the instructions and the prize breakdowns with their corresponding odds.", "Take a second and go over that. And yes, on that last row the 1/37 odds of winning the megaball is correct. That stumped me for a minute too. The reason it\u2019s not 1/25 (which you would initially assume due to there only being 25 mega balls) is because that prize is specifically for instances when you win only the mega ball without matching any white balls.", "At its core, its 2 random number generators and a \u2018while-loop\u2019. The simulator continues to generate random numbers (replicating the 5 white balls and the mega ball) again and again until they match, aka, the jackpot is won. During each run there are if-statements which add up the smaller prizes so we can keep track of the total profit/loss.", "As you probably notice, I set the jackpot prize at $197,000,000. That isn\u2019t arbitrary. I calculated the average cash jackpot over the last 3 years. Feel free to experiment with it and change the jackpot during your simulations.", "Mathematically (if you read the rules in the previous section), you should win the jackpot once every 302,575,350 plays. I ran my simulator 3 times. Let\u2019s compare these runs with that statistical average.", "Helpful analogy: If you roll a dice 6 times, theoretically you should roll one \u20186\u2019. However, we all know you could roll a \u20186\u2019 on your first try. OR you could roll a \u20186\u2019 after 20 rolls. Same for winning the lottery. Just because you play the lottery 302 million times, doesn\u2019t guarantee you will win once. You might win thousands of times. Or you might not win until a billion tries. That\u2019s what make these scenarios fun. You never know what the results might be.", "With that said, let\u2019s look at the results!", "If you bought 1 ticket per draw (twice a week) it would take you 244,744 years before you won the jackpot in this scenario... And this is extremely lucky! Take a look at the breakdown in quantity of prizes won below:", "Below shows the distribution of duds and prizes types won for the 25million plays.", "The day before you won the jackpot, you\u2019d be at a $50 million loss\u2026 But, all those years would have paid off because once you won you will instantly be ahead 150 million! (I\u2019m excluding the interest gains you would have had on that 50 million for that long though\u2026 if you consider that you probably won\u2019t be ahead)", "It\u2019s interesting to notice that the lottery pays out the least amount on the middle prizes.", "Winning ticket for this scenario (if you want to test your luck on the real thing):", "Below shows the distribution of duds and prizes types won for the 316million plays. This is about as statistically average as you can get. If you bought 1 ticket per draw (twice a week) it would take you 3,038,461 years before you won the jackpot. This is the most likely scenario and what you should expect while playing the lottery\u2026", "The day before you won the jackpot, you\u2019d be at a $546 million loss\u2026 And unfortunately even after you win after 3+ million years, you will still be at a $349 million loss\u2026", "Finally, I thought I\u2019d just show you the unlucky scenario and let you take a look at the numbers. The charts look almost identical to the scenario above.", "Winning the lottery is extremely unlikely. If you want the thrill of the gamble without the headache of losing money, download this simulator @ my GitHub and try for yourself. If you want to test your luck on the real thing, you can expect it to take around 3 million years before you win the jackpot(assuming you buy 2 tickets a week).", "But! If you decide to play for the long haul and consistently enter no matter what, you have about a 1/3 chance of winning the jackpot (thus being profitable) in the first million years. If you win in the first million years, the jackpot winnings will outweigh the cost of tickets\u2026 So there\u2019s hope!", "Please subscribe if you found this helpful.
