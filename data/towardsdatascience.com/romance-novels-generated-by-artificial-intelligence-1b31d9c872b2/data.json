So when I started futzing around with text-generating neural networks a few weeks ago, I developed an urgent curiosity to discover what artificial intelligence could contribute to the ever-popular genre. Maybe one day there will be entire books written by computers. For now, let\u2019s start with titles.", "I gathered over 20,000 Harlequin Romance novel titles and gave them to a neural network, a type of artificial intelligence that learns the structure of text. It\u2019s powerful enough to string together words in a way that seems almost human. 90% human. The other 10% is all wackiness.", "I was not disappointed with what came out. I even photoshopped some of my favorites into existence (the author names are synthesized from machine learning, too). Let\u2019s have a look by theme:", "A common theme in romance novels is pregnancy, and the word \u201cbaby\u201d had a strong showing in the titles I trained the neural network on. Naturally, the neural network came up with a lot of baby-themed titles:", "There\u2019s an unusually high concentration of sheikhs, vikings, and billionaires in the Harlequin world. Likewise, the neural network generated some colorful new bachelor-types:", "I have so many questions. How is the prince pregnant? What sort of consulting does the count do? Who is Butterfly Earl? And what makes the sheikh\u2019s desires so convenient?", "Although there are exceptions, most romance novels end in happily-ever-afters. A lot of them even start with an unexpected wedding \u2014 a marriage of convenience, or a stipulation of a business contract, or a sham that turns into real love. The neural network seems to have internalized something about matrimony:", "Doctors and surgeons are common paramours for mistresses headed towards the marriage valley:", "Christmas is a magical time for surgeons, sheikhs, playboys, dads, consultants, and the women who love them:", "What or where is Knith? I just like Mission: Christmas\u2026", "This neural network has never seen the big Montana sky, but it has some questionable ideas about cowboys:", "The neural network generated some decidedly PG-13 titles:", "They can\u2019t all live happily ever after. Some of the generated titles sounded like M. Night Shyamalan was a collaborator:", "How did the word \u201cfear\u201d get in there? It\u2019s possible the network generated it without having \u201cfear\u201d in the training set, but a subset of the Harlequin empire is geared towards paranormal and gothic romance that might have included the word (*Note: I checked, and there was \u201cVeil of Fear\u201d published in 2012).", "To wrap it up, some of the adorable failures and near-misses generated by the neural network:", "I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed computer-generated romance novel titles half as much as I have. Maybe someone out there can write about the Virgin Viking, or the Consultant Count, or the Baby Surgeon Seduction. I\u2019d buy it.", "I built a webscraper in Python (thanks, Beautiful Soup!) that grabbed about 20,000 romance novel titles published under the Harlequin brand off of FictionDB.com. Harlequin is, to me, synonymous with the romance genre, although it comprises only a fraction (albeit a healthy one) of the entire market. I fed this list of book titles into a recurrent neural network, using software I got from GitHub, and waited a few hours for the magic to happen. The model I fit was a 3-layer, 256-node recurrent neural network. I also trained the network on the author list in to create some new pen names. For more about the neural network I used, have a look at the fabulous work of Andrej Karpathy.", "I discovered that \u201cSurgery by the Sea\u201d is actually a real novel, written by Sheila Douglas and published in 1979! So, this one isn\u2019t an original neural network creation. Because the training set is rather small (only about 1 MB of text data), it\u2019s to be expected that sometimes, the machine will spit out one of the titles it was trained on. One of the more challenging aspects of this project was discerning when that happened, since the real published titles can be more surprising than anything born out of artificial intelligence. For example: \u201cThe $4.98 Daddy\u201d and \u201c6'1\u201d Grinch\u201d are both real. In fact, the very first romance novel published by Harlequin was called \u201cThe Manatee\u201d."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
