In the past couple of years, computer vision applications such as face detection and vehicle detection have become mainstream. One of the reasons is the availability of pre-trained models.", "Convinced by the success of deep learning on these applications, businesses have now started to solve their own problems using deep learning.", "But what if the available pre-trained models are not suitable for your application?", "Imagine that you have a poultry farm and want to use object detection to classify good eggs from bad ones so that you can automatically discard bad eggs from going into packaging.", "A pre-trained model maybe able to detect eggs but it will definitely not differentiate between good and bad eggs because it has never been taught to do so.", "Get lots of images of good and bad eggs and train a custom detection model.", "A common challenge in creating a good custom computer vision model is training data. Deep learning models require huge amount of data to train its algorithm as we can see with benchmark models such as MaskRCNN, YOLO, and MobileNet, which were trained on existing large dataset COCO and ImageNet.", "How do you get data for training a custom detection model?", "In this post, we will look at 5 such ways of collecting data for training your custom model that solves your problem.", "If you are lucky, you might just get a labelled dataset you want online.", "Here is a list of free image datasets for computer vision that you can choose from.", "ImageNet: ImageNet dataset consists of around 14 million images in total for 21,841 different categories of objects (data as of 12th Feb 2020). Some of the popular categories of objects in ImageNet are Animal (fish, bird, mammal, invertebrate), Plant (tree, flower, vegetable) and Activity (sport).", "Common Objects in Context (COCO): COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. It contains around 330,000 images out of which 200,000 are labelled for 80 different object categories.", "Google\u2019s Open Images: Open Images is a dataset of around 9M images annotated with image-level labels, object bounding boxes, object segmentation masks, and visual relationships.

Always check the copyright of each image before using them.", "If you cannot find images of object you want, you can collect them by clicking photographs. This can be done manually, that is by clicking each image by yourself or crowdsourcing, that is hiring other people to take photographs for you. Another way to collect real-world images is to install programmed camera in your environment.", "We know that deep learning models require large amount of data. When you only have a small dataset, it may not be enough to train a good model. In such cases, you can use data augmentation to generate more training data.", "Geometric transformations such as flipping, cropping, rotation and translation are some commonly used data augmentation techniques. Applying image data augmentation not only expands your dataset by creating variation, but also reduces overfitting.", "Sometimes, real data may not be available. In such cases, synthetic data can be generated to training your custom detection model. Due to its low cost, use of synthetic data generation has been increasing in machine learning.", "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is one of many techniques which is used for synthetic data generation. GAN is a generative modelling technique, where artificial instances are created from a dataset in such a way that the similar characteristics of the original set are retained.", "Collecting training dataset is the first step towards training your own custom detector model. In this post, we looked at some of the techniques used for collecting image data which includes searching through public open labelled datasets, scraping the web, taking photographs manually or using program, using data augmentation techniques and generating synthetic datasets.", "In the next post, we will look at the next step in training your custom detector, that is, labelling your dataset.
