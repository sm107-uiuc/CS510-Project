The bar\u2019s not high on the telephone interview. The next step, the face-to-face, means meeting a few members of the team. They\u2019ll grill you. My job is to screen out the uncomfortably bad experiences.", "I\u2019m just trying to protect them and not waste your time. But be prepared \u2014 this question is a technical one. However, it\u2019s not meant to test the breadth or depth of your technical knowledge, but rather to lay bare your soul to me and reveal who you are as a data scientist.", "I\u2019ve interviewed hundreds of experienced and aspiring data scientists \u2014 and hired several dozen. I\u2019m not looking for one type of person. I build teams, and there are many ways that very different people can fit together to form a great team. I also don\u2019t expect to find the exact piece I need. I\u2019m looking for someone to invest in. But I have high standards.", "It\u2019s a big responsibility. I treat my teams as a family. I\u2019m introducing a potential, new family member. I want two things for each family members:", "If I let someone in who isn\u2019t prepared to be brutally honest with themselves and others about the quality of their work, even as a candidate, it\u2019s an insult. They see the caliber of the candidate as a reflection of how I see them.", "I don\u2019t just blurt this question out. I want it to be unassuming. I want to gauge how important you think the question is. I don\u2019t want to bias you, so I\u2019ll sneak it in as a follow-up.", "So first, I\u2019ll ask you to tell me about your relevant experience. Perhaps I say, \u201cWhich of your projects are you most proud of? Tell me about it.\u201d", "Here, I\u2019m looking for two things:", "Some people fail the interview on this question, but few. Some people cannot explain their work \u2014 to the point you\u2019d question if they just made it up right then. Others just present themselves poorly \u2014 speaking extremely rudely of previous co-workers or saying things that are flat out wrong. One or two have droned on for the remainder of the interview refusing to be interrupted.", "But almost all pass and are now set up for the big one.", "Now, finally, I can gauge the degree of your intellectual honesty. You\u2019ve just told me so much about the data science project you\u2019re most proud of. At some point, you\u2019ll have at least mentioned the statistical or machine learning model central to your project. So, I casually ask you how well your model worked.", "Since I asked casually, I\u2019m not surprised or dissuaded if I get a superficial response, but ideally, you jump at the chance to go into great detail about how you evaluated and tested your model. Take this opportunity.", "If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll underline my interest with skepticism: \u201cHow do you know it worked?\u201d. The first time I asked, I implied that it worked and worked well. It was a question of degree, now I am asking for a defense.", "There is no single right answer. But there are several wrong responses. Brushing the question off a second time is perhaps the worst. I\u2019ll suppress my ire, make a third and final attempt, but that\u2019s effectively the end of the interview. Many flounder and reveal they have no idea how to evaluate a model in even the most cursory ways.", "One common poor answer is something like, \u201cI had a test set and a training set; the accuracy of the model on the test set was 90%\u201d. Why is this poor? Well, for starters, I\u2019d need more information to know if 90% accuracy is a good result or a terrible one. If 95% of the test set is the same class, 90% accuracy is terrible!", "Also, that answer doesn\u2019t address several other important questions including:", "I\u2019ll ask as many of these as time permits. I need to know you at least care that your model is correct and not just turning the crank until you get a favorable result.", "The most common poor answer tries, somewhat, to address the issue of over-fitting: \u201cI used cross-validation\u201d. There seems to be a pervasive misconception that cross-validation solves several fundamental and complex problems in data science. It doesn\u2019t.", "Cross-validation is a great tool, but it guarantees nothing. You can still easily cherry-pick results or features, bleed information from one fold to another, or use information in a way not possible in production. Nor can it address more epistemological issues in data science such as black swans, dragon kings, reproducibility, and the effect of predictions on the outcomes they are meant to predict.", "Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not looking for a philosophical treatise. I just need to know you don\u2019t think that machine learning is magic.", "If you want to succeed where the vast majority of the other candidates fail, think like a scientist. Your job is to find the truth, not prove or disprove any particular theory. Don\u2019t just find patterns, find meaningful patterns.", "Take some time. Ponder the implications of what you are doing. Explore data science with more skepticism. Maybe even read more philosophy of science. And dig into the various metrics and model-evaluation packages of the tools you already use.", "And most importantly, go back over your old work and see where you can poke holes in what you\u2019ve done. Because if you don\u2019t, I will.", "If you\u2019re active on LinkedIn, say \u201chi\u201d to me here.", "Your home for data science.
