As a kid I always wanted to help Nemo get back to his dad. I just didn\u2019t know how.", "Now that I have grown with technology by my side, I think I have finally figured a way out.", "We can use Azure to help Marlin find Nemo. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ll need:", "Azure Custom Vision is a cognitive service that lets us build, deploy and improve our own image classifiers and object detectors. An image classifier is an AI service that applies labels to images, according to their visual characteristics while an object detector is an AI service that finds specific objects in images, in our case, Nemo.", "The Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to apply labels to images. Images are labelled at the time of submission. Then the algorithm trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images. Once the algorithm is trained, we can test, retrain, and eventually use it to classify new images according to the needs of our app.", "To start building our AI solution, first we need to get an Azure Custom Vision account. Let\u2019s get started:", "2. Sign into the Microsoft account linked with Azure subscription and accept the terms of service", "Now we are all set to build a Machine Learning model that will be able to recognize Nemo and tell where he is. To use Custom Vision Service, we will need to create Custom Vision Training and Prediction resources in the in the Azure portal. This will create both a Training and Prediction resource.", "2. Enter a name and a description for the project. Then select a Resource Group. If your signed-in account is associated with an Azure account, the Resource Group dropdown will display all of your Azure Resource Groups that include a Custom Vision Service Resource.", "3. Select Object Detection from Project Types and choose General (compact) from Domains. Compact domains are optimized for the constraints of real-time object detection on mobile devices. The models generated by compact domains can be exported to run locally.", "Classification and object detection: Custom Vision functionality can be divided into two features. Image classification applies one or more labels to an image. Object detection is similar, but it also returns the coordinates in the image where the applied label can be found. Thus enabling us to find the position of an object in an image.", "As a minimum, Azure Custom Vision service requires at least 15 images per tag for Object Recognition in the initial training set. We\u2019ll also need a few extra images to test the model once it is trained.", "In order to train the model effectively, we\u2019ll use images with visual variety i.e., different images of Nemo.", "Additionally, all training images must meet the following criteria:", "In this section we will upload and manually tag images to help train the object detector.", "2. Unlike a classifier, in individual images have to be tagged manually after selecting the region of the image with Nemo. Click on an uploaded image to open the tagging window.", "Once all the images have been tagged, we need to train the model to use it.To start training", "2. Choose Advanced Training with 1 hour of training budget, and click Train.", "The training process should only take a few minutes. During this time, information about the training process is displayed in the Performance tab.", "After the training has completed, the model\u2019s performance is estimated and displayed. The Custom Vision Service uses the images that we submitted for training to calculate precision and recall, using a process called k-fold cross validation. Precision and recall are two different measurements of the effectiveness of the model:", "mean Average Precision (mAP): mAP tells the overall precision of the object detector at finding Nemo.", "Note: The compact domains have lesser precision than general domains to build models that can run locally on smartphones with limited compute resources.", "This is the threshold for a predicted probability to be considered correct when computing precision and recall.", "Interpreting prediction calls with a high probability threshold tends to return results with high precision at the expense of recall meaning that the found detections are correct, but many were not even found by the model; a low probability threshold does the opposite i.e., the model detected most of the instances, but there are false positives within that set. With this in mind, we should set the probability threshold so that we can find Nemo.", "2. In the Quick Test window, we click in the Submit Image field and enter the URL of the image to test. To use a locally stored image instead, we click the Browse local files button and select a local image file.", "The selected image appears in the middle of the page. Then the results appear below the image in the form of a table with two columns, labeled Tags and Confidence. We can close the Quick Test window, after viewing the results.", "We can use the image submitted previously, for training, using the following steps:", "2. Hover over an image to see the tags that were predicted by the model. To add an image to training data, select the image, select the correct tagged region in the image, and then select X button in the top right of the window. The image is removed from Predictions and added to the training images. It can be viewed by selecting the Training Images tab.", "We can now retrain the model with the updated training data and it will be saved as a new iteration.", "Finally, we have built, trained and tested an object-detection model using Azure Custom Vision service that can now help Marlin in his search to find Nemo.", "We will export the trained model to run locally on an app on iPhone using CoreML", "Thanks for reading.
