Being the Project Charter the source of its construction, a process map consists in describing the steps that a process entails and the identification of its inputs, outputs, parameters and features; it describes the current situation of a process and is fundamental for the identification of root causes. Process maps are eyes-openers, they help identify the stakeholders of the process (e.g. owner, customer, supplier), bottlenecks, wastes and opportunity areas for kaizen events and lean improvements.", "However, building process maps is not an easy task; collecting information about processes is not trivial matter. The breakdown of a top-level process map (i.e. splitting the process into simple steps) and the information retrieving process could include many obstacles that must be overcome. Motivating the staff to obtain more precise information about a process represents one of the most significant challenges a Process Engineer must overcome, which could be achieved by choosing the best strategy to engage them on the project and convince them about the potential benefits its successful implementation could bring to the entire organization.", "Once the process has been broken down into smaller steps, the Process Engineer must focus on each of them independently. Parameters (all factors or variables that may have an influence over the features of the product at the output of the process) and features (characteristics that define quality) must be identified and measured adequately in order to plot and analyze them to design experiments, test hypotheses, and obtain significant results for future improvements.", "The SixSigma and grid packages from R contain several functions for developing step-by-step process maps. For the following example, we will consider the Pizza Restaurant case from the Six Sigma with R textbook by Cano, Moguerza and Redchuk (2012), where the manager of a restaurant was interested in studying the process of making and serving a pizza. Let\u2019s take a look at the R code!", "The SixSigma R package contains great features for developing top-level process maps with just a few lines of code. The main advantage of developing them with R is their reproducibility (i.e. every time they are generated, they will have the same aspect), which represents a useful feature for when using reproducible research techniques on a project. By having the code stored on your own library, you will only have to modify the inputs and the process map will be automatically rendered again, which will save you time by not having to open a new drawing diagram, modify it, check the aspect and export the image from other so-called user-friendly programs. While this SixSigma feature for developing process maps does not intend to replace other programs, it provides a new approach for developing them in a faster and reproducible way.", "If you found this article useful, feel welcome to download my personal codes on GitHub.
