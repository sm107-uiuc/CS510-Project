In this first part, I draw parallels between the production of physical products and ML products. In Part II, I discuss why these similarities should inform how data scientists approach product development.", "As a field, data science is very new, and the norms that govern the field are still being established. There are plenty of resources explaining the mathematics, statistics and iterative logic involved in machine learning. There are even more examining how machine learning can be applied as a tool to guide decision-making and solve business problems \u2014 such as A/B testing and predicting customer churn \u2014 or as a feature to optimize the user experience \u2014 think recommendation systems and personalized curated content. But, because it is less common in business, there has been much less discussion of machine learning as a product, where it\u2019s primary purpose is to solve a market problem and directly generate revenue, such as with self-driving cars, customer support chat bot services and automated insurance services, etc.", "In this series of articles, I frame the machine learning product concept in a new way, using my background in aerospace manufacturing to draw parallels that inform how data scientists and product managers should approach the development and maintenance of ML products.", "Although it may seem counterintuitive, the process of developing and maintaining a machine learning product has more in common with building a physical product than developing a software application. What\u2019s typically missing from the software development lifecycle is one critical component: the data supply chain. And that absence makes software development simpler in some respects because having a supply of data that is integral to the product means needing to consider it throughout its lifecycle.", "So, what does that mean? Let\u2019s start with a simple analogy that I find helps my non-technical friends understand the link between machine learning products and physical products.", "When you want to produce a physical product \u2014 let\u2019s use an aircraft radio, since I used to work at a company that manufactured those \u2014 you need to design and build the factory, train the staff how to assemble the radio, manage the supply of parts that are required to build it, incorporate any client customizations, build the radio and deliver it to your customers. Similarly, in building an ML product, you need to train the model (that is, design/build the factory and train the workers), collect client inputs (customizations) and enrich those inputs (manage the supply of parts) to generate predictions (that is, the radio).", "Because there are so many highly interdependent moving parts, failure in one function can bring down the others. You can have a state-of-the-art factory with high-end equipment and top labor skills, but an unreliable or inadequate supply chain (i.e. missing data or not the right data) will eventually sink your product.", "By comparison, the process of developing software products is much more contained. It\u2019s akin to designing and building an experience. Take for example a website that sells apparel. Once built, there\u2019s a maintenance aspect involved in keeping it operational. You may want to periodically swap out the content or add new features to enhance the user experience, but you don\u2019t typically depend on a streaming supply of externally sourced data for the website to function. While there will be a supply chain for physical inventory, this is segregated from the website operation; there\u2019s simply no need for a dedicated supply chain for the website itself. For that reason, the supply management aspect does not exist in the software development lifecycle framework. As soon as data products rely on continuous incoming data, the framework needs to follow the supply management practices of physical products, otherwise you\u2019ll be forced into reactive management.", "Going back to the physical product analogy, let\u2019s look at a couple real-life scenarios that illustrate why the comparison to physical product is so informative, particularly as relates to supply chain management.", "For a period, I worked as a buyer for that aerospace company that produced radios. One day, we discovered that there was a bad batch of switching ICs (a type of electronic chip). Most of the batch failed testing and we needed to buy more to build one of our less popular radios. When I checked with our supplier, I discovered that they no longer sold that chip. Worse, other suppliers had listed it as obsolete. The manufacturer had stopped making them 2 years prior and we didn\u2019t know about it. We had been making the radio for 12 years. We needed a replacement chip ASAP!", "We were able to do a minor redesign on a sub-assembly to incorporate a newer, smaller chip. That necessitated halting production until the new design was in place, re-testing the product before restarting production and working overtime to backfill the orders to honor customers\u2019 commitments. For a more conservative industry, where the same products are sold for decades, this type of scenario is not uncommon.", "Although it might not be immediately obvious, this type of situation is actually incredibly similar to what data scientists might encounter. Recently, I was checking data updates for a prototype model. I wanted to verify that all the external contextual data we were using were fresh, so test predictions would be accurate. In checking, I noticed that one source was out-of-date and, worse, we no longer had access to that source. We needed a replacement dataset ASAP!", "While we were able to find a new source of comparable data, the data was not an exact match. Just as in the previous example with aircraft radios, substituting a replacement necessitated retraining and re-testing a new ML model and re-running all of our evaluation metrics to check the impact. Fortunately, this was not hosted in a live environment; I could only imagine the nightmare of having to pull a production model offline to fix a data quality or data retrieval emergency such as this one. It would be incredibly disruptive. There are best practices and checks that can be put in place to help prevent these issues, but I\u2019ll save that discussion for another time.", "From these examples, a few deeper similarities between physical and ML product development should be apparent. Both:", "What\u2019s more, these examples hint at the need to manage development with an awareness of how the supply chain affects the various stages of the product lifecycle. Just as in manufacturing, data products that rely on a supply of data need to be managed from the get-go with that data in mind. This is what I\u2019ll discuss in the next post of this 2-part series, where I explore traditional supply chain management methods used to minimize risk, translated and repurposed for data science products.", "In summary, the nature of machine learning and data-reliant systems opens you up to unique risks not typically seen in other software applications, but these risks are not unique to the industry. They exist in a similar form in the manufacturing world and the concept of supply chain strategy can be directly applied to data science. To manage data risks well is to ensure the continued success of your ML product. This is where the existence of or lack of a data supply strategy can make or break your product.", "Hi, I\u2019m Katie Lazell-Fairman. I\u2019m a data scientist at GeoPhy, based in New York City.
