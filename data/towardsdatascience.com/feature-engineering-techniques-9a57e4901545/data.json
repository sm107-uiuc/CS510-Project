Creating the best possible Machine Learning/Deep Learning model can certainly help to achieve good results, but choosing the right features in the right format to feed in a model can by far boost performances leading to the following benefits:", "Other common techniques which can be used in order to make the best use out of the given data are Features Selection and Extraction, of which I talked about in my previous posts.", "We will now walk through some of the most common Feature Engineering techniques. Most of the basic Feature Engineering techniques consist of finding inconsistencies in the data and of creating new features by combining/diving existing ones.", "All the code used for this article is available on my GitHub account at this link.", "For this example, I decided to create a simple dataset which is affected by some of the most common problems which are faced during a Data Analysis (eg. Missing numbers, outlier values, scaling issues, \u2026).", "When using Log Transform, the distributions of the original features get transformed to resemble more closely Gaussians Distributions. This can particularly useful, especially when using Machine Learning models such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Naive Bayes Classifiers which assume their input data follows a Gaussian Distribution.", "In this example, I am going to apply Log Transform to all the Numeric Features available in the dataset. I additionally decided to subtract the original features with their respective minimum values and then add them to one, in order to make sure each element in these columns is positive (Logarithms just support positive values).", "Imputation is the art of identifying and replacing missing values from a dataset using appropriate values. Presence of missing values in a dataset can be caused by many possible factors such as: privacy concerns, technical faults when recording data using sensors, humans errors, etc\u2026", "There are two main types of Imputation:", "We can now, first of all, examine which features are affected by NaNs (Not a Number) by running the following few lines.", "One of the easiest methods to deal with Missing Numbers could be to remove all the rows affected by them. Although, it would better to set up a threshold (eg. 20%), and delete just the rows which have more missing numbers than the threshold.", "Another possible solution could be to replace all the NaNs with the column mode for both our numerical and categorical data.", "Date Objects can be quite difficult to deal with for Machine Learning models because of their format. It can, therefore, be necessary at times to divide a date into multiple columns. This same consideration can be applied to many other common cases in Data Analysis (eg. Natural Language Processing).", "In our example, we are now going to divide our Date column into three different columns: Year, Month and Day.", "Outliers are a small fraction of data points which are quite distant from the rest of the observations in a feature. Outliers can be introduced in a dataset mainly because of errors when collecting the data or because of special anomalies which are characteristic of our specific feature.", "Four main techniques are used in order to identify outliers:", "Other more advanced techniques commonly used to detect outliers are DBSCAN and Isolation Forest.", "Going on with our example, we can start by looking at our two left numerical features (X2, X3). By creating a simple BoxPlot using Seaborn, we can clearly see that X2 has some outlier values.", "Using both the Z-score (with a factor of 2) and the Percentiles methods, we can now test how many outliers will be identified in X2. As shown from the output box below, 234 values were identified using the Z Score, while using the Percentiles method 800 values were deleted.", "It could have additionally been possible to deal with our Outliers by capping them instead of dropping them.", "Binning is a common technique used to smooth noisy data, by diving a numerical or categorical feature in different bins. This can, therefore, help us to decrease the risk of overfitting (although possibly reducing our model accuracy).", "Most of Machine Learning models are currently not able to deal with Categorical Data, therefore it is usually necessary to convert all categorical features to numeric before feeding them into Machine Learning models.", "Different techniques can be implemented in Python such as: One Hot Encoding (to convert features) and Label Encoder (to convert labels).", "One Hot Encoding takes a feature and split it in as many columns as the number of the different categories present in the original column. It then assigns a zero to all the rows which didn\u2019t have that particular category and one for all the ones which instead had it. One Hot Encoding can be implemented in Python using Pandas get_dummies() function.", "Label Encoder replaces instead all the categorical cases by assigning them a different number and storing them in a single column.", "It is highly preferable not to use Label Encoder with normal features because some Machine Learning models might get confused and think that the encoded cases which have higher values than the other ones might be more important of them (thinking about them as in hierarchical order). This doesn\u2019t instead happen when using One Hot Encoding.", "We can now go on dividing our dataset into features (X) and labels (Y) and then applying respectively One Hot Encoding and Label Encoder.", "In most of the datasets, numerical features have all different ranges (eg. Height vs Weight). Although, for some for Machine Learning algorithms, it can be important to limit our input features within a defined range. In fact, for some distance-based models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and Clustering Algorithms, it would then be almost impossible to compare different features if they all have different ranges.", "Two common ways of scaling features are:", "In this example, we will be using Standardization and we will then take care of our Outlier Values. If the dataset you are working with does not extensively suffer from Outlier Values, scikit-learn provides also another Standardization function called RobustScaler() which can by default reduce the effect of outliers.", "Different techniques and packages have been developed during the last few years in order to automate Feature Engineering processes. These can certainly result useful when performing a first analysis of our dataset but they are still not able to automate in full the whole Feature Engineering process. Domain Knowledge about the data and expertise of the Data Scientist in modelling the raw data to best fit the analysis purpose can\u2019t yet be replaceable. One of the most popular library for Automated Feature Selection in Python is Featuretools.", "It\u2019s now time to finally to test our polished dataset prediction accuracy by using a Random Forest Classifier. As shown below, our classifier is now successfully able to achieve a 100% prediction accuracy.", "I hope you enjoyed this article, thank you for reading!", "If you want to keep updated with my latest articles and projects follow me on Medium and subscribe to my mailing list.
