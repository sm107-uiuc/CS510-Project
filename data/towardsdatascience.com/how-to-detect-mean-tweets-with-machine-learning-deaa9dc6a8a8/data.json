Just look at Reddit or YouTube or eelslap.com and you\u2019ll see what I mean.", "Twitter has always been a platform where people can be open about everything that goes on in the world and in their lives. Our president is extremely good at using this platform to express his opinions and even adjust the general opinion of the American public. You can imagine that given the fact that there are 126 million DAILY users of Twitter, there will be some who unfortunately don\u2019t have a filter when speaking their mind. People with a lack of filter leads to very inappropriate tweets, which leads to inevitable arguments and bitterness.", "Today we\u2019re going to have some fun and see if we can automate the process of filtering out which tweets are offensive and which are not.", "If you want a more in-depth view of this project, or if you want to add to the code, check out the GitHub repository.", "Like always, before we get to the actual nitty-gritty, we need to prepare our data before we can do any of the fun stuff. All of the necessary data is in the GitHub repository.", "We have two files, a train file and a test file. Within the train file, we have a random assortment of various tweets. There are three features, a unique id, a label, and the actual tweet text. The label is \u20180\u2019 if the tweet is non-offensive (not racist or sexist, etc.) and the label is \u20181\u2019 if the tweet is very offensive.", "First, we\u2019ll import a whole bunch of libraries.", "Now we will use pandas to read the test and train files.", "Let\u2019s use pandas to actually see what our data looks like.", "I\u2019ll use a bit of fancier data notation to only show the tweets that are labeled as offensive.", "Now that we\u2019ve loaded our data, we can maximize the effectiveness of our machine learning by cleaning up our data.", "For data cleaning, we\u2019ll take three steps:", "In order to save time, we\u2019ll combine our train and test dataframes and do all the data cleaning on both.", "Now we\u2019ll create a regular expression that allows us to pinpoint and remove the Twitter handles from our tweets.", "Now our combined dataframe should no longer have Twitter handles. We can remove the special characters, numbers, and punctuation with a simple script.", "Then we\u2019ll remove the short words that add no value.", "Let\u2019s see how our combined dataframe looks like now.", "Here\u2019s where the real fun begins! Because machine learning algorithms can\u2019t find patterns and insights like us (they can\u2019t just read in a whole bunch of text so they have to take in individual words), we need a way to preserve the \u201cessence\u201d of each tweet while making it as easy as possible for the algorithms to learn what makes a tweet offensive or not.", "Thankfully, we have this useful form of pre-processing called tokenization, which is basically splitting up all of your text into the bare-bones units.", "Here\u2019s an example of what that would look like.", "Tokenizing is actually really easy. All you have to do is split up your text into the individual components.", "Now that we\u2019re done tokenizing, we need to move on to a further pre-processing step called stemming, which is essentially converting each tokenized word into its root form and tense. For example, stemming the word \u201ccreating\u201d would result in the word \u201ccreate\u201d and the word \u201cconsignment\u201d would become \u201cconsign\u201d.", "Let\u2019s take a look at our stemmed tweets.", "Before we move on to the machine learning, it\u2019s a good practice to get some intuition into what\u2019s going on in our data. Data visualization is a great way for us to actually explore and understand our data.", "Some questions we want to answer are:", "To see the common words in our tweets, we can create a wordcloud to actually SEE them.", "(Warning: the words in this wordcloud are definitely NSFW)", "We purposely didn\u2019t remove the hashtags because they can carry a ton of useful information. We\u2019ll extract the hashtags and see which ones come up most often.", "Now let\u2019s plot the most common hashtags.", "Now that we\u2019ve done all the necessary steps, it\u2019s time to actually get to the machine learning.", "We will be using the logistic regression machine learning algorithm to train our prediction model. Before we can actually train our model, we have to transform our text data into a format the algorithm can actually read.", "There are two methods we can use, Bag-of-words and TF-IDF (term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency). I won\u2019t go too much into detail in how these feature extraction models actually work, but feel free to learn more about them through the resources I\u2019ve placed at the bottom of this article.", "Now we can use these extracted dataframes to train our logistic regression models.", "First we\u2019ll build with the bag-of-words dataframe.", "Now let\u2019s see the results of our prediction accuracy.", "Now we\u2019ll build the model with TF-IDF dataframe.", "Looks like we have a lot to improve in our model.
