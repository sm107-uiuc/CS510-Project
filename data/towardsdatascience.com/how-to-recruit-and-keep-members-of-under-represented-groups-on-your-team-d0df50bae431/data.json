Some points focus on ways to recruit women specifically because this is what I know and understand best, but I believe that they are useful ways to bring in individuals form other under represented groups as well.", "Through freelancing and full time employment, I have worked on a lot of teams. Most of the time the teams were majority straight, cis gender White or Asian males. A few times, I have been the only woman on the team. With one employer, I was the first woman to join a seven person team in the nine years the company had been around. (On my first day, someone made a comment about me being the \u201cguinea pig\u201d to determine whether or not the team was capable of having a woman on it.)", "Three years ago, I created a rule for myself. I do not go to an interview with all White or Asian male interview panels. When recruiters have scheduled me for one, I have politely asked them to specifically add a woman or non-binary individual to the list of interviewers.", "This request has a polarizing effect on recruiters. I have had recruiters thank me for making this request and include impressive females to my interview list.", "I have also angered recruiters with my request. I\u2019ve been told that this request is impossible to meet. I have been told that my unwillingness to join a large all male team is the reason that they don\u2019t have women on their team and that I am the real problem.", "A few days ago, I had a particularly bad exchange with a recruiter and I vented about it on my Instagram stories. I was particularly frustrated by the notion that the cause for the lack of diversity on the interview list was a \u201cpipeline problem,\u201d and was out of the control of employers. My graduating class of Mechanical Engineering majors was more female than male. I don\u2019t know how much further they need the pipeline to go.", "In the process of blowing off steam, I encountered an unexpected upside. I received earnest requests from people for advice about how to diversify their applicant pool. I began posting my answers to my story, and then posting ideas others sent me. I wrote ways to bring on women from my perspective as a woman, however, I think these are useful techniques for bringing on candidates from any Under Represented Group (URG):", "(Credit for 9b goes to Casey Wessel. Credit for 10\u201315 goes to Landon Dickey.)", "One friend asked for clarification of what would be considered \u201cinadvertently gendered terms.\u201d I struggle to define exactly what these are, but I think anything that implies a \u201cbro\u201d-ish culture, whether that be saying all employees are \u201crockstar ninjas\u201d or asking that candidates like to \u201cwork hard and party hard.\u201d", "I crowd sourced suggestions for a better way to describe inadvertently gendered terms, Maddie Mirzoeff pointed me to this article. She also added the first bullet point below to the list.", "Some suggestions I have received since these screenshots include:", "I hope to continue to add to this list. I\u2019m also hoping that in sharing that questions from my white male friends helped me to develop this list, people who aren\u2019t members of URGs will feel comfortable joining the conversation and asking questions. I am interested in ideas from others of ways to create a list that anyone can add to that also gives people credit for their contributions.", "Achieving successful inclusion of Under Represented Groups and in particular, individuals at the intersection of those groups will take some creativity to upend the status quo. Determining actionable clear next steps won\u2019t be easy. But I believe the community of professionals in STEM are up to this challenge.", "Your home for data science.
