Do not forget to wear a face mask for the purposes of preserving the health of yourself and others as well as circumventing facial recognition measures in various cities.", "Given the major concerns with facial recognition technology being used in cities such as New York and by departments like the NYPD, covering your face in various forms can assist with maneuvering around the way it extracts biometric data from your facial characteristics.", "Countless corporate entities have been at the forefront of advancing the usage of facial recognition technology, including but not limited to the following:", "With surveillance being at an all-time high through the advent of giant social media platforms, anti-terrorism state surveillance bills, and more, protecting your privacy, data, and identification is becoming increasingly necessary.", "Here are 5 absolutely integral precautions that you should take before partaking in protests.", "Perhaps the least technologically relevant method of ensuring your digital privacy as you are marching through the streets is to simply leave your phone at home. While some may require their phones for communications with other people, it might not be necessary for you to bring your phone with you everywhere you go.", "However, if you do decide to bring your phone to a protest, make sure you employ the tips listed below this one. If using your phone is not necessary, be sure to leave it at home as officials may request to search through your device(s) for information they can actively use against you or people you know. Most smartphones have location-based tracking turned on by default which can hinder your ability to stay anonymous online.", "Additionally, if it is absolutely necessary for you to have a phone, but you do not wish to go through extensive measures to ensure your privacy, try to at least pick up a cheap burner phone that you can use for the duration of the protest to stay connected and simultaneously not have any personal information directly tied to you.", "Make sure to actively secure your device before leaving your home. If you do not use a passcode or password, there\u2019s no better time to start than today. The best possible option would be to use a strong password as opposed to a standard 4-digit code, but both work well for basic preemptive measures.", "However, steer clear of using facial recognition to have your phone unlocked as well as using your fingerprint. While a federal judge did rule in January 2020 that police officers do not have the right to force you to unlock your device using your fingerprint or facial biometrics, it never hurts to be on the safe side of ensuring your right to privacy.", "In addition, having your phone either turned off or on airplane mode can assist your pursuit of reserving your privacy and anonymity.", "Encrypting your data is also a valuable preemptive measure that you can take if you have a device with sensitive information on it, including but not limited to confidential data regarding specific persons, evidence of police brutality, and more. Encryption has also become a core feature on most devices.", "For Android devices, you\u2019ll need to navigate in the following order (depending on the model and make of your device):", "Settings \u2192 Security \u2192 Advanced \u2192 Encryption & Credentials \u2192 Encrypt Phone", "With Apple devices such as an iPhone, it is extremely similar to the way you do it on an Android device as well:", "Settings \u2192 Touch ID and Passcode \u2192 Turn Passcode On", "Backing up your data allows you to safely delete important and confidential information or not cause you to panic if your device gets stolen or if you get stopped by authorities. Ensure that your backup is secure as well, as law enforcement are not the only figures you should be wary of, as cloud backups, depending on the provider, may be susceptible to third-parties with malicious intent.", "It is important to state that backing up your data should not only be done in regards to attending protests, but rather as a regular chore to ensure everything is up to date and that you are not at risk at any given moment in the future.", "Using Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or default SMS for communicating with people at a protest is not the most secure method of ensuring digital privacy. Alternatives to these, while not compromising ease-of-use, are applications such as Signal.", "Signal is a messaging application that is available for both Android and iOS devices and offers very strong levels of encryption in order to secure both text messages and phone calls. In addition, the platform has recently announced the addition of face-blurring to photos sent within the application to ensure anonymity beyond just voice and text messaging which is a very useful development.", "In addition, the platform has zero advertisements, eliminating the possibility of \u201caffiliate marketers\u201d and \u201ccreepy tracking in Signal\u201d. The end-to-end encryption provided by Signal is open-source and states that \u201cwe can\u2019t read your messages or listen to your calls, and no one else can either\u201d, building on the notion that privacy is permanent with their application.", "In addition to communicating securely through the usage of Signal, do not underestimate the importance of using a secure browser such as Tor. While eavesdroppers may see that you are using the Tor browser, they cannot distinguish between yourself and another user on the Tor network, making the browser arguably the most secure out there.", "The Tor browser is especially great because of a number of different reasons. First of all, it completely anonymizes your browsing to the point where browsing habits cannot even be traced to your specific session. Tor is designed to make all users on the network seem identical to each other to eliminate the threat of fingerprinting and surveillance by various actors.", "Secondly, it blocks trackers that may be linked to advertisers or hackers. This means that these entities cannot follow you from one place on the internet to the next.", "All traffic that goes through the Tor network is encrypted three times over, providing complete anonymity based on your session and your location. The traffic is always passing through what are known as Tor relays which are most easily described as volunteer-run servers on the network.", "The Onion Browser is available on the App Store, while an official Tor Browser is available on Google Play.", "If you decide to continue using standard browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and others, then the following tools are helpful to see the unique fingerprint that is emitted from your browser and device combination:", "The EFF also has a very organized website that assists concerned civilians with defending their data, privacy, and online communications through various articles, guides, and tools that are useful not only for protection during times of unrest, but overall as well.", "The most important thing regarding going to protests is ensuring your safety. Doing so results in your future well-being both in person and online.", "Your home for data science.
