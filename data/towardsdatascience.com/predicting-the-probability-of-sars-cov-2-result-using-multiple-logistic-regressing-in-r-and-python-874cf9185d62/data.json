So, I attempted to use this dataset to predict the probability of having SARS CoV-2 and to check what variables affect the most predicting SARS CoV-2 result.", "Until March 27, the state of S\u00e3o Paulo had recorded 1,223 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 68 related deaths, while the county of S\u00e3o Paulo, with a population of approximately 12 million people and where Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein is located, had 477 confirmed cases and 30 associated death, as of March 23. Both the state and the county of S\u00e3o Paulo decided to establish quarantine and social distancing measures, that will be enforced at least until early April, to slow the virus spread.", "This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.", "The dataset has a total of 5644 rows and 111 columns.", "This article will not be enough to explain all the variables used. So, I will talk about some important predictors on the fly.", "For the data preparation, I\u2019ve used Pandas from Python. and for the logistic regression analysis, I\u2019ve used R. Let\u2019s now jump to the data preparation.", "The first glance at the dataset and I found many NaN values. This issue of missing values must be corrected before moving forward.", "From here, I am separating the dataset into two subsets, named condition and disease. (they\u2019re just names and don\u2019t represent anything) The orange marked ones are the disease subset and green marked ones are the condition subset.", "The missing values in variables Neutrophils and Proteina C reativa must be imputed. I\u2019ve used KNNImputer to impute the missing values.", "For both the dataset, our target variable is SARS_CoV2_exam_result. The dataset disease has all the categorical predictors and the dataset condition has all the continuous numeric predictors.", "For categorical variables, 0 is no disease detected and 1 is disease detected.", "From here, I will use R for our analysis. So let\u2019s begin with the disease dataset.", "I have to skip Parainfluenza 2 as there are no cases for it.

The next step is to predict the values on the test dataset and preparing the confusion matrix.", "I\u2019ve put a tight threshold(1%) to minimize the type-II error. The model must minimize the number of falsely undetected patients. 60% of patients who have COVID-19 will be falsely detected negative from the model, which is quite high.", "And as predicted, ROC curve is okayish.", "The symptoms of Rhinovirus are close to the SARS CoV-2 virus and mostly found in the nose (Rhinovirus). Therefore, the probability of having SARS decreases as Rhinovirus is detected.", "Condition dataset has all numeric predictors, values taken from the blood samples. The data look normal from the summary.", "Repeating the same steps to apply logistic regression on the higher correlated predictors on the target variable.", "Here we see some highly correlated variables. However, we only consider the predictors who have a high correlation to the target variable. So for the analysis, I will use Patient_Age_Quantile , Leukocytes , Eosinophils , Red_blood_cell_distribution_width_RDW , Platelets , and Proteina_C_reativa_mg_dL predictors. Let\u2019s take a look at the glm summary.", "Let\u2019s predict the error on our test dataset. With this model, 30 cases out of 121 cases gave false results and the ROC curve is better than the previous model.", "We can see that patient's age quantile and Proteina C reativa have a positive correlation, and the rests have a negative correlation with the probability of the target variable.", "Some of the predictors show great promise when analyzed separately. Those predictors are,", "I will now create a function that analyzes each of those variables to see their effects.", "Except for platelets, all predictors have a positive correlation on the probability of having SARS CoV-2.", "For the hospitals, it is important to distinguish between a person with Rhinovirus and a person with COVID-19. Separating patients with Rhinovirus and COVID-19 will make the process a lot faster.", "High %vol of white blood cells indicate that the body is fighting against the virus.", "While having the virus, the body is not producing enough platelets which help to stop bleeding.", "With the given patient\u2019s blood data, the model can predict the probability of having SARS CoV-2.", "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R; Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani", "Your home for data science.
