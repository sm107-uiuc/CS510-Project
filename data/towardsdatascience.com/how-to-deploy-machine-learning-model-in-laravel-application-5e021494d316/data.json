In this article, we are going to learn how to call our model API from the Algorithmia platform to the Laravel application and make predictions.", "Before moving on I recommend you read my previous article where I explained in detail all about the Algorithmia platform and how you can deploy your model and call it for prediction in the programming language of your choice(Python, PHP, javascript, java, c#, NodeJS, Go, Ruby e.t.c).", "In the previous article, you will learn", "Why Algorithmia?Algorithmia helps to separate Machine Learning concerns from the rest of your application (example, e-commerce site or android app). By calling your model and making predictions as an API call, your application can be free of the concerns of a machine learning environment. All you need to do is create correctly formatted input.", "Laravel is one of the most popular open-source PHP web frameworks for the development of web applications, created by Taylor Otwell.
