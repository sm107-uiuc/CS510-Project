Sometimes, life throws you a random curveball you couldn\u2019t have anticipated no matter your level of decision genius. When that happens, adjusting your decision process is bad thinking.", "Let me explain with an example.", "Imagine that you\u2019re about to observe the simultaneous flip of a fair coin and roll of a fair six-sided die. Before it happens, you are offered the choice between two gambles:", "The better decision appears to be the coin, which has a 1/2 chance of giving you money compared with the 1/6 chance on the die. Right? Right. If you\u2019re motivated by the $100, it should be a no-brainer.", "Now the action happens and we see the outcomes: the coin lands tails up while the die shows a 6. Dang, you should have chosen the die!", "No. No, you shouldn\u2019t have. Definitely not. That\u2019s outcome bias and it\u2019s a habit you should kick as soon as you can \u2014 especially if you have any hopes of being a good leader or decision-maker.", "Always evaluate decision quality based only on what was known at the time the decision was made.", "If we look at outcomes, you got $0 when you could have had $100. Can we fix that? Nope, that decision is over. What should you learn from it? Nothing, I hope. Otherwise, you might choose a fair die instead of a fair coin next time. That would be a stupid choice if you like money. No matter how you slice it, 50% to win is a better gamble than 17% for the same prize.", "Perhaps more alarmingly, outcome bias threatens society\u2019s ability to promote and retain competent leaders. Suppose the decision between betting on the coin and the die wasn\u2019t yours to make. Instead, you watched Heather make it. Like Heather, you would have chosen the coin, but you\u2019re not thinking about that. You\u2019re too busy focusing on the bad outcome she got: tails+6 = missed opportunity for $100. If you\u2019re outcome-biased, you\u2019ll blame her for the outcome \u2014 forgetting that she made the decision wisely \u2014 and you\u2019ll clamor for her to be replaced with another decision-maker who doesn\u2019t have bad outcomes to their name because:", "Either way, you\u2019ve just voted to shrink society\u2019s pool of competent decision-makers, punishing Heather for randomness (outcome) when you should have celebrated her wise action in light of what she knew at the time (decision).", "Outcome bias exerts a terrible price on society.", "Outcome bias exerts a terrible price on society. Our wise decision-makers are our best asset, yet many people are willing to sacrifice them as scapegoats when the real culprit is randomness. If you have reason to believe that someone\u2019s decision process is top notch, don\u2019t hold a bad outcome against them.", "When evaluating the skill of a decision-maker, ignore outcomes. Look only at what was known at the time of the decision. In our example, that was 50% versus 17% chance to win. The decision-maker chose 50%? Good. I hope they\u2019ll choose the same way next time too.", "If you\u2019re a senior leader (or aspiring to be one), you can find additional practical advice in my follow-up article, The problem with analyzing policy decisions in hindsight.", "Outcome bias is not an argument about moral philosophy. Here\u2019s why.", "If you\u2019re curious to learn about the role that outcome bias plays in perpetuating prejudice, check of the last section of my related article:", "Let\u2019s be friends!
