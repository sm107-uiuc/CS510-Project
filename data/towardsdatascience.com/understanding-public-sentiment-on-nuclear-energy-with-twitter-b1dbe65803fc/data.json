And thus, the discussion around nuclear energy is impossible to avoid as it is a key contender whose efficiency cannot be denied. However, nuclear energy has become a divisive and polarizing topic as its byproducts can have devastating effects on human health and the environment without the proper precautions.", "For this project, we wanted to understand if sentiment could be easily identified around nuclear energy and what that looks like. With the help of Twitter and its users\u2019 opinions \u2014 we were able to attempt this classification. Our goals for this project were to first get a read on public opinion regarding nuclear energy by classifying the sentiment around tweets and then extract value in terms of key words or themes associated with each sentiment. This would be incredibly useful for both companies and policymakers in terms of optimizing and tailoring messaging and strategy around what their audience is talking about.", "We used Twint to randomly scrape 3,000 tweets from Twitter using the search term Nuclear Energy. All tweets were pulled from 2020. An example tweet text in our dataset is below:", "The sentiment of each tweet was labeled with the assistance of Vader. The three labels used in this project were: Positive, Negative and Neutral. The distribution of our labeled tweets was severely imbalanced \u2014 most tweets carried a neutral sentiment followed by positive and then negative.", "Our initial EDA focused on analyzing the word frequency of each sentiment class. Clear differences in vocabulary can start to be observed between the classes in the WordClouds below.", "The neutral class definitely seemed to be picking up more research and informational topics.", "As we were solely working with the text data of each tweet, the cleaning and engineering steps taken prior to modeling were:", "To classify the sentiment of a tweet, we trained and tested the following models \u2014 a baseline dummy classifier (predicts the majority class), a Naive Bayes classifier, a Random Forest classifier and a Linear SVM classifier. As our classes were initially imbalanced, we had to take that into account for our models. A snapshot into the accuracy scores of our test predictions is below:", "Our Linear SVM model performed the best followed by Random Forest. Linear SVM works really well with NLP and text classification as we ended up with more features than observations.", "With our Linear SVM, we were able to get useful insight into what features, or words, were being used by the model to make the sentiment classification. In these 3 graphs, we visualized the top 5 feature/word coefficients for each sentiment. For the most part, the words do seem reasonable and provide transparency into each sentiment\u2019s classification.", "The use of social media such as Twitter has been such an important tool for capturing public opinion on any and all topics. This is vital information for companies and policymakers alike. We were able to use Twitter to capture public opinion around nuclear energy and highlight the key issues and themes around each sentiment \u2014 positive, negative and neutral. This can be really significant for companies and policymakers in terms of marketing and messaging. For one example \u2014 waste is often associated with the negative discussions, so we can conclude that a big concern is around nuclear waste and its consequences rather than the energy source itself. Therefore, messaging can be crafted with this in mind, to address concern and worry.", "To expand on our model\u2019s predictive power, adding other non-text based features could be worthwhile, as well as exploring neural net models.", "If you\u2019re interested in the code behind this project \u2014 check out my Github: https://github.com/AlisonSalerno/twitter_sentiment_analysis", "Your home for data science.
