Finally, we will implement a few practical illustrations to see how these concepts can be applied in model building.", "There are 3 types of error in predictions due to deviation from the actual truth:", "Irreducible error is a measure of noise inherent in the data. There might always be some predictors which have some small effect on the target variable and are not part of our model.", "Thus, no matter how good a model we might select, it will not be able to approximate the actual function perfectly, hence leaving the error which cannot be reduced.", "So, let\u2019s focus on what we can control while building model i.e. bias and variance and how.", "For this purpose, we will use \u2018mlxtend\u2019 library (developed by Sebastian Raschka) to calculate \u2018bias_variance_decomp\u2019 .", "Bias refers to the error when the approximated function learned by a model is trivial for a very complex problem, thereby ignoring the structural relationship between the predictors and the target.", "High bias results in underfitting and a higher training error. It can be reduced by augmenting more signal to the model i.e. if we can add features which better describe the association with target variable.", "Let\u2019s look at an example below:", "We assume as if all features were not available at once, and keep introducing a feature one at a time in the order of its contribution (from df_feat). As evident from the chart below, bias came down significantly at the expense of higher variance", "But what if we already have comprehensive features in the model i.e. there is no additional feature to introduce from business knowledge, but the bias is till high. In that case, we need to improve the modelling space i.e. use an algorithm which can better comprehend the structural nuances in the data.", "Variance is the extent to which the approximated function learned by a model differs a lot between different training sets. High variance results in overfitting", "When the level of complexity in a model increases, it starts fitting the data by learning the small fluctuations, even to the extent of random noise as well.", "As the model learnt some patterns in the training data which happened to exist by chance and were not true properties of data, the similar pattern might not exist in test data. This leads to lower training error but very high test set error", "Regularization methods are commonly used to control the variance.", "In above example, we compare the variance in lasso model (regularization parameter set to 0.05) with that of a linear regression and observe 7.5% decrease in variance", "Pruning is commonly used to regularize the Decision Tree.", "We observe 62 % decrease in variance by pruning the tree", "Let\u2019s look at what happens to bias and variance when we increase the number of neighbors in K nearest neighbors algorithm", "As a greater number of neighbors are deciding the output it leads to a simpler model with lower variance and higher bias.", "We saw that in order to reduce one, we ended up increasing the other error which is not desirable. So, how can we reduce both bias and variance. Is it achievable?", "The two error terms do not change in a linear fashion; hence the prediction error depends on the relative rate of change of the two.", "Ensemble and cross validation are frequently used methods to combat the bias variance dilemma.", "Lets look at how Random Forest reduces the variance by 82% without increasing bias much, as compared to a single Decision Tree", "Jupyter notebook can be found here.", "Your home for data science.
