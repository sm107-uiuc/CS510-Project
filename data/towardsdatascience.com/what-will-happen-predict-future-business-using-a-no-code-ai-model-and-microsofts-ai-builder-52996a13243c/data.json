It further natively integrates into Common Data Services (What is CDS?), which gives it an immensely powerful ecosystem.", "The current release of AI Builder supports a wide range of prebuild AI Models as of today:", "Furthermore, AI Builder gives you the option to train your own AI Custom Models using these AI model types:", "The high-level process of building AI models with AI Builder is straight forward and quite simple.", "You configure your model with existing data and train it. After that, you verify the model performance and do some quick tests. Once the model is ready, you publish it. From that point on, you can consume the model in many ways and in various places. You could use it inside of your business workflows or within mobile apps, to name just a few.", "Let\u2019s look at one of the AI custom models in more detail: Prediction.", "The Prediction Model allows us to predict business outcomes by using historical data with historical outcomes.", "In other words: It allows training and testing of a Machine Learning Model with absolutely no code and no background in math, statistics, or any other data science related fields.", "Here is everything we need for our own AI model:", "Let\u2019s assume we\u2019re working for a bike sharing/rental service company, and we have a bunch of historical data telling us a lot about past rental numbers and the exact weather conditions that day. Furthermore, our data contains information about weekdays, holidays, and other interesting facts.", "Our goal is to build an AI model that can predict the number of potential rentals a day given a set of input variables, expressed by the weather forecast, overall season, and upcoming holidays or weekends.", "We\u2019ll work with a slightly modified version of a data set taken from UCI Machine Learning website and stored on my GitHub repository.", "Let\u2019s go step by step through the creation process of our AI model.", "First, go to https://make.powerapps.com, select Entities, and click Get Data.", "From the list of sources, click Text/CSV.", "Next, enter the URL to the bike-sharing.csv in my GitHub repository to directly crawl the data from there.", "After the data has loaded, it is important to note the cnt #(count) column, which represents the number of bike rentals that day.

This is how we tell the AI Builder which feature we want to predict. Click Next.", "On the next screen, we select all features we want to use to build the model.", "Note that some fields are already excluded. This is because system fields created by CDS, like Created On can skew prediction results, so they are excluded by default.", "Furthermore, not all data types are shown. Our model can study numbers, currency, date, two options, option set, and text data types.", "The rest of the selection is up to you and part of your business domain knowledge. For our data set, we rely on the documentation of the original data set and choose the following fields.", "Of course, you could choose a different combination and see if you can get better results. We will later see which of the variable drives the prediction most. Click Next when you\u2019re ready.", "We skip the filter step and click Next.", "Now it is time to do a final review.

The model is good but not perfect. It leaves us room for improvement, but this is part of another story.", "After you reviewed everything, you just need to click Publish.
