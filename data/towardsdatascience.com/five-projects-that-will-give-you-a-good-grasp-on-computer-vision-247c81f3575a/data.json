In this article, I\u2019ve collated five computer vision online tutorials that anyone can easily follow through and learn from. I personally think that learning theoretical knowledge is sometimes too mundane and building mini side projects can be a great way to supplement one\u2019s learning.", "Many online tutorials or projects that I\u2019ve gone through often only teach a portion of the entire project and you\u2019ll often have to reference other materials to make the project work as a whole. That\u2019s why, the following few tutorials I\u2019ve collated are all suitable for beginners as each project will work in its entirety.", "That being said, please feel free to leave a comment here (or in their original articles) if you run into problems and want some extra help! :)", "I\u2019ve personally started with the tutorials listed in docs.opencv.org when I first dabbled in Computer Vision. I remember feeling frustrated at their inextensive documentation when I was given my very first Computer Vision project to do (it was to track eye-gaze movements).", "However, retrospectively, OpenCV.org has quite a few not-to-be-missed tutorials that really help explain the basics and if you have time for it, do try to carefully go through some of their listed tutorials.", "GrabCut in particular is a really interesting tutorial to go through because Image Segmentation is a huge domain within the Computer Vision field and going through this tutorial kinda gives you a teaser of how pixels work and lets you appreciate how noisy images (without user intervention) really affects the outputs. Additionally, it briefly introduces the min-cut algorithm (what\u2019s used to segment the graph).", "There are much more novel image segmentation methods now (e.g. those that involves deep learning, etc) since this GrabCut algorithm got published 16 years ago (in 2004) \u2014 but having a good grasp of foundations can really help especially when you\u2019re trying to explore more complex methods of image segmentation.", "CV Concept(s): Colour Histograms, Image Descriptors, Features", "This was one of the first few tutorials that I thought was really cool and so I really wanted to share this here. It takes at most 30 minutes for a reader to complete and going through his tutorial helps you get a much better understanding of what Colours histograms, Images Descriptors, and Features are. And at the end of it, you get to walk away with something fun and usable.", "How it\u2019s built is not something super novel but it helps one appreciate how simple imaging techniques can already achieve decent results. Furthermore, understanding what features and image descriptors are will be crucial when building more complex deep learning pipelines for various computer vision/imaging tasks.", "Supplementary links from PyImageSearch (on the same topic): link, link, link", "CV Concept(s): OCR (Optical Character Recognition), kNN, SVM", "Research into OCR has been ongoing for a really long time. Recent attempts at doing such tasks are mostly achieved with the help deep learning techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Convolutional neural networks (see link).", "However, if our goal is to understand the underlying concepts of handwritten digit recognition, I highly recommend looking at:", "They\u2019re both introducing concepts of OCR and allows one to compare and contrast between kNN and SVM. These are tutorials not to be missed since Computer Vision and Machine Learning are topics that are now tightly entwined together now. Furthermore, kNN and SVM are probably must-know concepts that one should be introduced to when first learning Machine Learning.", "After going through the above links, here\u2019s another more recent OCR tutorial that involves Keras, Tensorflow and Deep Learning \u2014 link.", "CV Concept(s): Camera Calibration, 3D Reconstruction", "Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) are pretty hot topics these days and with just a computer and Unity installed (with libraries such as VRTK and Vuforia too, of course), anyone can pretty easily create their own AR/VR game.", "However, with this OpenCV tutorial, it shows you how to draw 2D diagrams in the right positions to simulate a 3D effect. (Lmao random side note here but at this point in time I just noticed how ancient looking the background of the above image is, I suppose this tutorial is somewhat ancient). Anyhow, the tutorial still clearly explains the basic concepts of how this \u201c3D diagram\u201d is created.", "From: LearnOpenCV \u2014 Written by Taha Anwar ( BleedAI.com )", "CV Concepts: Image Classification, Deep Learning, Application Development", "The difference between this project and the previous few is, it\u2019s less about explaining CV fundamentals and more of showing how CV is integrated with deep learning to create really cool applications nowadays. It might be a little tedious to go through as it demands users to have a more in-depth understanding of Deep Learning as compared to the previous four projects.", "However, these days CV and DL/ML seem to go hand in hand so often that I thought it would be apt to include it in this list.", "Lastly, I would just like to note that Image Classification is also a really popular topic in the field of CV and I thought I\u2019d just include two more Image Classification tutorials from LearnOpenCV:", "I personally think that when it comes to OpenCV (and other libraries), installation issues can sometimes be even trickier than coding itself \u2014 version incompatibility is a thing :\u2019/", "If it helps, feel free to refer to this article for OpenCV4 and Python3 setup.", "This list is definitely not exhaustive but I tried my best to cover some of the topics that I think are most important and relevant.", "That\u2019s about it for this article! Thank you for reading and if you have any questions and comments, please feel free to reach out :)", "Your home for data science.
