We were bored of doing the same repetitive tasks again and again. So, we thought why not let machines do it. Lo and behold, today you have chatbots, self-driving cars, and the list goes on.", "But, all of this effort starts from a single thing. The PROBLEM.", "What are you trying to solve?", "That is the starting point. And just like in real-life conversation, the first impression sets the precedent to the success of the whole conversation, when posing a machine learning problem, one has to make a good impression upon themselves of the problem.", "Any deep learning problem has three things that need to be clearly defined to achieve success in it.", "Suppose, we start with a computer vision problem. I want to create a DL algorithm that solves the problem of computer vision. But, if you just open that door, there are a nearly thousand sub-problems. Want proof, here it is:", "All those sub-problems are there today because people chose to solve a specific problem rather than doing everything at once (psst, that\u2019s a bad idea).", "Use a top-down approach for this.", "We again re-iterate this task finding. Suppose you have to create a system to automatically shelf books in a library.", "Question 1: What is the task?", "Answer: To automatically shelf books in a library.", "Question 2: What would this task comprise of?", "Answer: To read the name of the book and then, classify it to a topic.", "Question 3: How can I solve that using Deep Learning?", "Answer: I can use Text Recognition (Computer Vision) and Topic Classification (Natural Language Processing).", "Tada! You have finally arrived at your tasks.", "\u201cSome things cannot be taught; they must be experienced. You never learn the most valuable lessons in life until you go through your own journey.\u201d\u2015 Roy T. Bennett", "It is not so different for machines. They need to experience the problem, in order to solve it.", "What is the experience my DL system needs to perform optimally?", "Continuing the above example, we now have two tasks: Text Recognition and Topic Classification.", "Question: What experience would my system require to recognize the texts on books easily?", "Answer: To read from a lot of book covers.", "Usually, for DL systems, we don\u2019t always get what we want. So, we ask another question.", "Question: What kind of experience would then help my system perform optimally if I am not able to procure said data?", "Answer: If I am not able to find this specific data, then, I should find data that contains text against various background colors, angles, and light conditions.", "The point is to find some general data which shall cover your specific problem. Here, you are taking a generalist approach.", "And, then, comes the point where you go on your search for data. If you are lucky, you find it. If not, then, you need to ask yourself this:", "Question: What kind of experience can help my system now that I can\u2019t find any data?", "Answer: If I can\u2019t get it, I will have to make it. I would need to generate images with printed text upon them from various angles and the backgrounds would have to vary from tad simplistic monotone colors to vivid backgrounds.", "And this is what you mostly resort to when you go where no man has ever gone. The journey is not still complete.", "Question: Can I use any existing data to create experience for my own system?", "Answer: The answer will be mostly YES and that will make your life much easier. Getting some real data and building your data upon it is one of the biggest favors you can do to yourself.", "You have to design the experience for your system to work optimally.", "Choosing the right experience for your system will decide its failure or success.", "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.-Albert Einstein", "If you end up measuring the performance of your system incorrectly, you will end up thinking it to be a failure rather than a success.", "Continuing with the above example, how do we measure if our system is performing optimally.", "The question you ask yourself is:", "What metric would help me properly judge the performance of my system?", "In our case, the answer would be the number of books correctly shelved.", "But, does that give us the whole view of the performance of the system?", "As you have two tasks, their performance decides the performance of the whole system. So, you decide performance measures for them also.", "For text recognition, you can choose the character-level accuracy of recognition.", "For topic classification, you can choose the number of times topics were correctly assigned.", "All real-life tasks are multi-faceted and hence, require to be evaluated on multiple dimensions. In our case, there is the performance of the sub-systems and the overall performance of the system.", "In this post, we understood how to delve into a machine learning problem and how to think about it. We understood how it is important to break the deep learning problem into these barebones (Task, Experience & Performance Measure). We then understood how to explore these barebones to arrive at solutions that may surprise us. Right thinking leads to the right solutions.", "Your home for data science.
