But do we really perform convolution operation when using CNNs? I know the Data Science and AI community has gained alot of expertise in using CNNs effectively and there are frameworks like Tensorflow, Keras and PyTorch that has enabled very fast and efficient usage of CNNs for building Deep Learning models? But whenever we teach the concept of CNNs why do we refer using the mathematical operation of convolution, when we actually do is perform cross-correlation! Wait, you don\u2019t believe what I am saying? Then let\u2019s take a deep dive into this article!", "For some of you reading this article, whatever I am going to discuss in the following sections may actually blow your mind! But recently, I had a great discussion with one of my friends, where he tried to convince me that both convolution and correlation operations are actually same and that\u2019s why we still say that CNNs use convolution, rather that correlation, which I strongly disagreed and hence I wanted to articulate my thoughts and my angle of argument, that CNNs are actually Correlational Neural Networks!", "For some of us, we might not get enough time to dust off our maths concepts that we had learnt long back, so I wanted to replay the difference between convolution and correlation on mathematical terms for a better base of argument :", "So basically when we do correlational filtering in computer vision or image processing related work, we usually slide the center of the correlation filter on the image, then multiply each value in the correlation filter by the pixel value in the image, and finally sum these products. So does these series of operations sound familiar to you? Yes? Well, yes you are right, this is exactly what we thought of doing when we applied CNNs over unstructured data like images!", "Did I confuse you? Then let me try to explain what happens when we try to apply convolution filtering instead. Like correlation filtering, convolution filtering is also a linear filtering but there is a small difference between correlation and convolution. In convolution filtering, we flip the kernel or the filter in both dimensions (bottom to top, right to left) and then perform the same steps as correlation filtering.", "What is the difference in output?", "Some of you might be thinking, well that\u2019s okay, it is a possible flaw in just the nomenclature, so what\u2019s the big deal in it? Some of you might be thinking, what if we apply the actual convolution operation instead of the disguised correlation operator, what will change?", "To answer these questions, let me show you some output of using a Gaussian Blur filter on an image by both convolution and correlation operation.", "From the above two images, we can clearly see that there is difference in output when we had applied the same filter on the same image using convolution and correlation. So, now the question arises, which of these is really useful for a neural network to learn weights and biases? My answer here would be correlation filtering as convolution filtering may actually introduce noise in some cases, which may lead to misleading results for the deep learning model.", "You might be wondering, that even though we are using cross correlation in CNNs, why do we still call it Convolution Neural Networks? Is it because convolution sounds more sophisticated? Or does CovNet look more funky than CorrNet? Well, these reasons may be true, but when I did my research, I found that the very initial inception of CNNs is considered to be originated from the paper Neocognitron, which is known to use convolutional filtering, but later implementations of CNNs and most ML/DL packages are known to use correlation filtering instead of convolutional filtering, but we still kept using the name of Convolutional Neural Networks. Although mathematical or algorithm complexities actually remains almost same but there is a difference in outcome.", "Now, after reading this, will you support my side of argument of renaming CovNets as CorrNets? Or atleast support me when someone argues telling that CovNets and CorrNets are actually same, when there is a clear difference?", "Did you like this article? And want to see few more articles on the same topic? Then please take a look at this: Convolution Vs Correlation, Convolutional Neural Networks Conv (CNN): Correlation or Convolution? Our fellow medium authors have done a nice job in highlighting the difference and hence these articles might be really helpful for you.", "Thus, this brings us to the end of this article. In my personal website, I am trying to compile a Deep Learning Glossary, which will have details of more interesting concepts used in Deep Learning and I will be picking up some more interesting concepts in future.
