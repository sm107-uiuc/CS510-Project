To be honest, not that much. Statistics is subfield of mathematics that deals with, amongst other things, randomness, uncertainty and information. It is a part of science used to extract knowledge from data, and it is used in pretty much any scientific field nowadays.", "This knowledge extraction can be made through algorithms, which sometimes require a lot of computational power. Some of these algorithms could not have existed or be tested many years ago, due to the lack of powerful enough computers. However, with the overwhelming advances in computer science and technology, we are now able to develop much more sophisticated methods to extract that information from data. Not only that, but we now have access to much more data than before. It\u2019s as if we had given steroids to statistics, and then it became data science. If you want to read more about it, you can start here.", "Behavioural economics, on the other hand, is the application of psychology in the economics field (thus, it is also known as economic psychology). Many years ago, the mainstream economic theory was based on some assumptions, one them being that humans act rationally (the infamous homo economicus).", "At first sight, this assumption doesn\u2019t seem to make much sense, since we all know we don\u2019t act rationally all the time ourselves. However, we have to take into account that this assumption can seem more reasonable if we look at the big picture: I might not act completely rationally, neither might you. However, humans, in the aggregate, might. It\u2019s like our irrationalities cancelled out each other. It\u2019s a more reasonable assumption, and it makes it a lot easier to create models and to try and predict where the markets are going.", "Even this more plausible assumption, however, has been questioned and proved wrong in some cases, by the field of behavioural economics. Moreover, its greatest contribution was not showing that economists were oversimplifying reality by disregarding our irrationality, but by showing that that irrationality can sometimes be predictable. We behave in a certain way that might not be consistent with the rationality assumption, but that is consistent with itself, meaning we always tend to act in that same irrational way. That kind of behaviour is called a cognitive bias.", "Now that we have the data and computational power to come up with better models of reality and that we know that human irrationality can be measured and predicted, how can we use this to our advantage? Well, I\u2019ll present some famous cognitive biases and how you can use data science to measure or incorporate them in your product/service.", "One of the most famous cognitive biases is the confirmation bias. It represents our tendency to look for things that confirm what we already know and ignore points of view that disagree with our own. If I\u2019m against gun control and I see an article saying that guns increase violence, I\u2019ll tend to ignore it. If I see another article, however, that shows evidence of the opposite, I\u2019m more likely to read it. Facebook, for instance, profits from this bias by choosing to show us posts, articles and opinions that agree with our view of the world.", "But how can you go so deep as to know someone\u2019s view of the world, just looking at data? Well, you don\u2019t have to. You can use algorithms that consider the kind of content I tend to like, compare me to other users who have liked the same content, and suggest to me content that they have liked and I haven\u2019t seen before. It\u2019s the same principle with Netflix\u2019s recommender system. The type of algorithms that do that for you is called \u201ccollaborative filtering\u201d and can also be used to recommend products or services.", "Depending on the context, people can be more or less prone to taking risks, which can often cause them to make irrational decisions. Let\u2019s say I invite you to bet on a coin: heads I give you $50, tails you give me $100. Doesn\u2019t seem fair, right? We can actually calculate the expected return for this sort of game, by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability of happening, and summing the results: 50% * (- $100) + 50% * ($50) =- $25. This means you can expect to lose an average of $25 by playing this game. If you still decide to play it, however, by being over-optimistic and still hoping to win $50, then you are having a risk-prone behaviour. If it was the other way around, however, then you would be behaving in a risk-averse manner.", "The expected value general equation in situations like this can be written as follows:", "Where the p\u2019s are the probabilities, and the v\u2019s are the associated values, for each possible outcome. Risk-neutral individuals would make their decisions based on this equation. Usually, however, people tend to be irrational, and thus behave more like the model below:", "Here we added \u03b1, which represents the individual\u2019s attitude towards risk: when \u03b1>1, the individual is prone to risk; when \u03b1<1, the individual is averse to risk (and when \u03b1=1, the equation becomes just like the one above).", "Studies have already shown some characteristics that can influence your attitude towards risk, such as sex, age and wealth. Since this bias can be seen not only in coin-tossing games but also when people buy insurance, warranties and lottery games, you could use regression algorithms to calculate and predict your customers\u2019 behaviour towards risk. By doing so, you could make sure you price your services accordingly, depending on the person\u2019s profile.", "This bias is well seen in insurance industries, and can be better explained with an example: once you have your car insured, you start worrying less about taking risks with it: you won\u2019t avoid parking in dangerous neighbourhoods as much as before, for instance. To take that into account when pricing your insurance, companies start not only considering overall statistics on age and sex, for instance (eg.: young men are more likely to get into car accidents, so their insurance policies will usually be more expensive), but they have to take into account how those probabilities change after you get your car insured. This implies controlling their analysis by a dummy variable that tells if people have insurance or not.", "To sum up, we know that data science can bring value to areas where there is inefficiency in decision-making processes. Behavioural economics can show us where those inefficiencies are, and can already provide us with some models, to which we can apply our already-known data science methods. Data science, on the other hand, might help us identify new biases that we were still not aware of. It\u2019s a win-win game.", "Your home for data science.
