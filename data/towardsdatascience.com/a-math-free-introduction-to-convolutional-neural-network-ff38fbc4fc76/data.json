I\u2019ve always heard that CNN is a type of neural network that\u2019s particularly good at image-related problems. But, what does that really mean? What\u2019s with the word \u201cconvolutional\u201d? What\u2019s so unusual about an image-related problem that a different network is required?", "Recently I had the opportunity to work on a COVID-19 image classification problem and built a CNN-based classifier using tensorflow.keras that achieved an 85% accuracy rate. Finally, I think I\u2019ve figured out the answers to those questions. Let me share with you those answers in a math-free way. If you are already familiar with CNNs, this post should feel like a good refresher. If not, take a look, you could gain an intuitive understanding of the motivation behind CNNs and the unique features that define a CNN.", "Before diving into neural networks, let\u2019s first see the machine learning big picture:", "Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. \u2014 Wikipedia", "Looking at the problems that ML tries to solve, ML is often sliced into", "Among others, deep learning is a powerful form of machine learning that has garnered much attention for its successes in computer vision (e.g., image recognition), natural language processing, and beyond. The neural network is inspired by information processing and communication nodes in biological systems. By design, input data is passed through layers of the network, containing several nodes, analogous to \u201cneurons\u201d. The system then outputs a particular representation of the information. DNN is probably the most well-known network for deep learning, and it can be trained to learn the features of the data very well.", "Roughly speaking, there are two important operations that make a neural network:1. Forward propagation2. Backpropagation", "This is the prediction step. The network reads the input data, computes its values across the network, and gives a final output value.", "But how does the network computes an output value? Let\u2019s see what happens in a single layer network when it makes one prediction. It takes input as a vector of numbers. Each node in the layer has its weight. When the input value is passed through the layer, the network computes its weighted sum. This is usually followed by a (typically nonlinear) activation function, e.g., step function, where the weighted sum is \u201cactivated\u201d.", "If you know a bit about algebra, this is what the operation is doing:", "where w \u2022 x+ b is the weighted sum, f is the activation function, and y is the output. Now, in a deeper neural network, the procedure is essentially the same, i.e., the input -> weighted sum -> activation process is repeated for many layers.", "This is the training step. By comparing the network\u2019s predictions/outputs and the ground truth values, i.e., compute loss, the network adjusts its parameters to improve the performance.", "How does the network adjust the parameters (weights and biases) through training? This is done through an operation called backpropagation, or backprop. The network takes the loss and recursively calculates the loss function\u2019s slope with respect to each parameter. Calculating these slopes requires the usage of chain rule from calculus; you can read more about it here.", "An optimization algorithm is then used to update network parameters using the gradient information until the performance cannot be improved anymore. One commonly used optimizer is stochastic gradient descent.", "One analogy often used to explain gradient-based optimization is hiking. Training the network to minimize loss is like getting down to the lowest point on the ground from a mountain. Backprop operation finding the loss function gradients is like finding the path on your way down. The optimization algorithm is the step where you actually take the path and eventually reach the lowest point.", "I am glossing over many details, but I hope you now know that DNN", "We are ready to talk about CNNs!", "Ordinary neural networks that we\u2019ve talked about above expect input data to be a vector of numbers, i.e., x= [x1, x2, x3, \u2026]. What if we want to train an image classifier, i.e., use an image as the input? Let\u2019s talk about some digital image basics.", "Therefore, this black and white Lincoln image is just a matrix of integers.", "Since a digital image can be represented as a 2D grid of pixel values, we could stretch out/flatten the grid, make it into a vector of numbers and feed it into a neural network. That solves the problem\u2026right?", "However, there are two major limitations to this approach.", "2. It does not consider the properties of an image.", "On the other hand, CNN is designed to scale well with images and take advantage of these unique properties. It does with two unique features:", "This is done through the operation of convolution:", "Actually, let\u2019s see the operation in numbers and images. It will be easier to understand what\u2019s really going on. Here we create an image of a bright square using 0s and 1s. matplotlib interprets values in [0,1] the same as in [0, 255].", "And this is how the image looks like:", "Recall that a filter is a 2D weight matrix. Let\u2019s create an example filter, and call it the \u201cmean filter\u201d:", "In a convolution, this \u201cmean filter\u201d actually slides across the image, takes the values of 9 connected pixels, multiplies each with the weight (0.11), and returns the sum, i.e., the weighted average of the original 9 values, hence the name \u201cmean filter\u201d:", "You can see the averaging effect from the filtered image pixel values. It blurs out any edges in the image.", "What\u2019s this to do with a convolutional neural network?", "Well, CNN essentially applies the same convolution procedure, but the key difference is it learns the filter weights through backpropagation (training).", "Also, there are usually many filters for each layer, each with a different weight matrix, applied to the same image. Each filter would capture a different pattern of the same image. A CNN could also have many layers of convolution. The complexity of the network allows features at different scales to be captured. For example, here\u2019s an illustration of features learned by filters from early to the latter part of the network.", "While DNN uses many fully-connected layers, CNN contains mostly convolutional layers. In its simplest form, CNN is a network with a set of layers that transform an image to a set of class probabilities. Some of the most popular types of layers are:", "Now, if you are designing your own CNN, there are many elements to play with. They generally fall into two categories:", "2. How to connect each layer?", "Besides the type of layers, you need to design an architecture for your CNN. This is an active field of research, e.g., what\u2019s a better architecture? or can we automatically search for a better architecture? Check \u201cneural architecture search\u201d out if you are interested. A commonly used architecture goes like this:", "The powers (N, M, K) mean that the operation is repeated those number of times.", "Thank you for reading until the end! I hope by now you could see the difference between a CNN and a regular DNN, and also gained an intuitive understanding of what convolution operation is all about. Please let me know your thoughts or any feedback in the comment section.", "In the next article, we explore how CNN can be used to build a COVID-19 CT scan image classifier. Unsurprisingly, a pre-trained CNN can achieve strong baseline performance (85% accuracy). However, it would take more than a neural network to produce reliable and convincing results. Here\u2019s the article:", "If you are interested in knowing more about CNNs, check out \ud83d\udc49:", "and how to implement them \ud83d\udc49:", "Your home for data science.
