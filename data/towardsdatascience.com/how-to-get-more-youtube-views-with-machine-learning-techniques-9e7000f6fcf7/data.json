So before matching, we also create 2 features area and workout_type. These features concatenate all the body parts and workout types of one video into one string. For instance, a workout video could do both \u201cab\u201d and \u201cleg\u201d, or both \u201ccardio\u201d and \u201cstrength\u201d.

The process is manual, so we do not include them here.", "With the above keyword-based features, we can already find specific popular types of videos. But does that mean Sydney should always post the same types of videos?", "To answer this question, we also create some time series-based features:", "These features help us see whether the audience prefers similar or various types of videos.", "Take a look at the detailed process of feature engineering below. It involves some conversion to suit the rolling functions in Pandas.", "We find out that Sydney posts non-workout-related videos occasionally. They get significantly less views and behave differently from the workout videos. So we remove them from the analysis.", "We also filter out the first 30 days of videos since they lack enough historical data.", "Multicollinearity (also collinearity) is a phenomenon in which one predictor variable in a multiple regression model can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy.", "Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least within the sample data set; it only affects calculations regarding individual predictors.", "As Wikipedia explains, multicollinearity does impact the power of individual features on the outcome.", "Assume Sydney only posts strength workouts on Mondays, and her videos always get more views on Mondays. Do these videos get higher views because they\u2019re posted on Mondays or because they\u2019re strength workouts?", "When making recommendations, we want to answer these types of questions. So we want to make sure there\u2019s no strong collinearity among our features.", "Now that we are clear about the reasons for testing for multicollinearity. Let\u2019s see which method we should use.", "Often we test collinearity using pair-wise correlations, but it\u2019s not sufficient sometimes. There could be collinearity among multiple features (more than a pair) at the same time.", "So instead, we use a more sophisticated method. At a high level, we use K-fold cross-validation to achieve this.", "We select the features below since they are essential for predicting the views of YouTube videos.", "As you can see, we also add three features rand0, rand1, rand2 composed of random numbers. They serve as anchors when comparing the relationship between features. If one predictor feature is less important or similar compared to these random features, then it is not an important predictor of the target feature.", "In this process, we transform the categorical features area and workout_type. This transformation makes sure there is at least K number of values for each category level.", "Next, we loop through each feature and fit a model to predict it using the other features. We use a simple model of Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) and K-fold validation.", "Depending on whether the target feature is numeric or categorical, we apply different models and scores (model predictive power evaluation metrics).", "When the target feature is numeric, we use the Gradient Boosting Regressor model and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE); when the target feature is categorical, we use the Gradient Boosting Classifier model and Accuracy.", "For each of the target, we print out the K-fold validation score (average of the scores) and the most important 5 predictors.", "We look into each of the target features and their relationship with the predictors. We won\u2019t be covering the entire process but only explain two examples below.", "We find out that the length and the calories features are correlated. This finding is intuitive because the longer the workout, the more calories likely burned.", "We can also visualize the relationship.", "As you can see, there is a positive correlation between length and calories. But it\u2019s not strong enough for us to drop them. The calories burned in 40\u201345 minute videos overlap with 30\u201335 minute, 50\u201355 minute, and even 60+ minute videos. Hence, we are keeping both of them.", "Also, we find out that num_same_area and area_full features are correlated. This finding is somewhat surprising. Let\u2019s explore the reason.", "The following chart shows the relationship between num_same_area and area.", "The feature num_same_area counts the number of videos (including the current one) posted in the past 30 days that focused on the same area. The feature area_full represents a full-body workout, which is the most common type among Sydney\u2019s videos.", "As a result, when the num_same_area is large, the only possible area these videos focused on is the full body.", "Assume we find out that the higher num_same_area (>=10) does cause higher YouTube views. We wouldn\u2019t be able to know if it was because of the area_full or num_same_area. So we drop the num_same_area feature to prevent this situation.", "Besides this, we drop num_same_workouts as well using similar logic.", "As you may recall, the goal of this project is to increase YouTube views. Should we just use the number of views as our target?", "The distribution of views is highly skewed. The median video received 27,641 views, while the most received 1.3 million. This skewness could cause problems for the interpretation of the model.", "So, instead of views, we create feature views_quartile as the target.", "We classify videos into two categories \u2014 highly viewed videos (\u201chigh\u201d) and lesser viewed videos (\u201clow\u201d). \u201chigh\u201d is defined as the 75th percentile of views (35,578) or above, and \u201clow\u201d is otherwise.", "In this way, we use the predictive model to find the feature combinations that produced the top 25% viewed videos. This new target provides stable results and better insights.", "Finally, we have everything to build the model!", "We train a decision tree model on the target views_quartile.", "To avoid overfitting, we set the minimum sample of a leaf to be 10. To make the interpretation easier for us, we set the maximum depth of the tree to be 8 levels.", "Related article: How to Visualize a Decision Tree in 5 Steps", "In this last step, we look into and summarize \u201cbranches\u201d that lead to either high or low views.", "What are the main insights we find?", "Yes, calories_per_min is the most important feature.", "People don\u2019t seem to care as much about the types of workout or the parts of the body.", "For the videos with medium calories per minute burned (between 9.846 and 12.025), other factors kicked into effect.", "Of course, everyone wants to be efficient at burning calories!", "This insight is somewhat different than what we imagined. Shouldn\u2019t the variety of workouts be better?", "When the number of unique body areas worked in the past month (num_unique_area) was high (\u2265 10), the videos tended to have lower views. This statement was true even when the calories burned per minute were high.", "Combining the previous two insights, 42/(12+42) = 78% of the videos received more views when", "Too many body parts mentioned in the recent month might have created confusion for the audience.", "While we can\u2019t see other specific body parts stand out in the tree, Sydney\u2019s audience wants to work out the \u201cbutt\u201d area!", "So, what are some strategies that we could recommend to Sydney?", "As we can see, calories burned per minute is the most crucial feature. 12.025 calories per minute burned seems to be the magic number.", "The following table is a good starting point for how many calories should be burned for popular videos of different length:", "We suspect that the displaying of the numbers (of length and calories) is psychological. People may like seeing the first two digits of calories form a much larger number than the length.", "People dislike too many unique body parts described in the workout titles. According to our model, focusing on less than 10 body parts combinations within a month is better.", "We have noticed Sydney using fewer body parts keywords in her recent videos. The most obvious one is she\u2019s been using \u201carms\u201d or \u201cupper body\u201d rather than words such as \u201cbiceps\u201d or \u201cback\u201d.", "Sydney\u2019s subscribers are likely more ladies, and they tend to focus on working the \u201cbutt\u201d rather than gaining muscular arms. People are willing to sacrifice burning less calories to get a more toned butt. Perhaps Sydney should always include some butt work for the videos burning fewer calories.", "Besides the above strategies, there are also other ideas worth further investigation.", "For example, Sydney can try to:", "This is an application we are trying to explore to boost YouTube views.
