Also, it aims to capture valuable information explaining high variance which results in providing the best accuracy. It makes the data visualizations easy to handle. It decreases the complexity of the model and increases computational efficiency.", "There is a lot of confusion behind the concept of selecting the number of principal components. In this article, we go through all the steps and understand the logic to determine the number of components that need to be selected for our dataset.", "We are going to use the Pizza dataset with 8 variables. You can find the dataset [here].", "Below are the first few records of the Pizza dataset. \u201cBrand\u201d is the target variable and the remaining are independent variables.", "Removing the \u201cBrand\u201d column as we need to do PCA only for independent variables.", "Before proceeding with PCA, we need to perform the standardization of the data.", "Performing standardization is a crucial step because the original variables may have different scales. We need to bring them to a similar range to get reasonable covariance analysis.", "From the sklearn library, we can use the below code to standardize the data.", "\ud83d\udc49Step 2: Computing covariance matrix with standardized data", "The covariance matrix represents the correlation between two variables. This helps us to understand which two variables are heavily dependent on each other and to capture bias and redundancy in the dataset.", "If the entry in the matrix is with negative sign means they are indirectly proportional to each other. If the sign is positive means they are directly proportional.", "\ud83d\udc49Step 3: Calculating Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues on the covariance matrix", "These two algebraic formulations are always computed as a pair which is also known as Eigendecomposition helps to reduce the dimension space by compressing the data. The core of the Principal Component Analysis is built on these values.", "Each Eigenvector will have a corresponding Eigenvalue and the sum of all the Eigenvalues represents the overall variance in the entire dataset. It is very important to compute the Eigenvalues because it explains where the maximum variance lies in the dataset.", "To know more about Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues, visit this [link]", "\ud83d\udc49Step 4: Sorting the Eigenvalues list in decreasing order", "After completing Eigendecomposition, we need to order the Eigenvalues in a descending order where the first value is the most significant and thus forms our first principal component.", "\ud83d\udc49Step5: Selecting the number of Principal Components", "The first principal component will capture most of the variance from the original variables and the second principal component captures the second highest variance and so on\u2026", "From the above, we can see that the first principal component (PC1) captures overall 60% of the variance followed by PC2 with a 32.7% variance.", "From the cumulative variance, overall 92% is being captured by 2 components and 98% of the variance is being explained by the first 3 components. Hence, we can decide that the number of principal components for our dataset is 3.", "We can also visualize the same through the below scree plot with a cumulative sum of the explained variance ratio.", "With all the steps mentioned above, we have determined the number of components needed for our dataset is 3 considering with maximum variance.", "PCA can be done only to the numerical variables. If you have categorical data, then you need to convert into numerical features before applying PCA. Also, note that these principal components are linear combinations of the original dataset. These components are not as readable and interpretable as original features.", "In this article, we have gone through all the steps to understand how to select the number of principal components required for the dataset. One should keep in mind that the components need to be select with utmost care or there would be a chance of information loss.", "This PCA technique can be applied and would be a great help if you are dealing with multicollinearity issues in your dataset.
