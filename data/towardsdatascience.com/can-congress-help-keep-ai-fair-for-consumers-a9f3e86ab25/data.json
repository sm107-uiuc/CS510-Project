Who should determine the standards for that?", "We need to ensure that AI does not create biases in lending toward discrimination.", "These aren\u2019t questions from an academic discourse or the editorial pages. These were posed to the witnesses of a June 26 hearing before the US House Committee on Financial Services [1] \u2014 by both Democrats and Republicans, representatives of Illinois, North Carolina, and Arkansas.", "It is a bipartisan sentiment that, left unchecked, AI can pose a risk to fairness in financial services. While the exact extent of this danger might be debated, governments in the US and abroad acknowledge the necessity and assert the right to regulate financial institutions for this purpose.", "The June 26 hearing was the first wake-up call for financial services: they need to be prepared to respond and comply with future legislation requiring transparency and fairness.", "In this post, we review the notable events of this hearing, and we explore how the US House is beginning to examine the risks and benefits of AI in financial services.", "On May 9 of this year, the chairwoman of the US House Committee on Financial Services, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), announced the creation of two task forces [2]: one on fintech, and one on AI.", "Generally, task forces convene to investigate a specific issue that might require a change in policy. These investigations may involve hearings that call forth experts to inform the task force.", "These two task forces overlap in jurisdiction, but the committee\u2019s objectives implied some distinctions:", "And explicitly, Chairwoman Waters explained her overall interest in regulation:", "Make sure that responsible innovation is encouraged, and that regulators and the law are adapting to the changing landscape to best protect consumers, investors, and small businesses.", "The appointed chairman of the Task Force on AI, Congressman Bill Foster (D-IL), extolled AI\u2019s potential in a similar statement, but also cautioned,", "It is crucial that the application of AI to financial services contributes to an economy that is fair for all Americans.", "This first hearing did find ample AI applications in financial services. But it also concluded that these worried sentiments are neither misrepresentative of their constituents nor misplaced.", "In a humorous exchange later in the hearing, Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia (D-TX) asks a witness, Dr. Bonnie Buchanan of the University of Surrey, to address the average American and explain AI in 25 words or less. It does not go well.", "DR. BUCHANANI would say it\u2019s a group of technologies and processes that can look at determining general pattern recognition, universal approximation of relationships, and trying to detect patterns from noisy data or sensory perception.", "REP. GARCIAI think that probably confused them more.", "Beyond making jokes, Congresswoman Garcia has a point. AI is extraordinarily complex. Not only that, to many Americans it can be threatening. As Garcia later expresses, \u201cI think there\u2019s an idea that all these robots are going to take over all the jobs, and everybody\u2019s going to get into our information.\u201d", "In his opening statement, task force ranking member Congressman French Hill (R-AR) tries to preempt at least the first concern. He cites a World Economic Forum study [3] that the 75 million jobs lost because of AI will be more than offset by 130 million new jobs. But Americans are still anxious about AI development.", "In a June 2018 survey of 2,000 Americans [4] conducted by Oxford\u2019s Center for the Governance of AI, researchers observed", "This public apprehension about AI development is mirrored by concerns from the task force and experts. Personal privacy is mentioned nine times throughout the hearing, notably in Congressman Anthony Gonzalez\u2019s (R-OH) broad question on \u201cbalancing innovation with empowering consumers with their data,\u201d which the panel does not quite adequately address.", "But more often, the witnesses discuss fairness and how AI models could discriminate unnoticed. Most notably, Dr. Nicol Turner-Lee, a fellow at the the Brookings Institution, suggests implementing guardrails to prevent biased training data from \u201creplicat[ing] and amplify[ing] stereotypes historically prescribed to people of color and other vulnerable populations.\u201d", "And she\u2019s not alone. A separate April 2019 Brookings report [5] seconds this concern of an unfairness \u201cwhereby algorithms deny credit or increase interest rates using a host of variables that are fundamentally driven by historical discriminatory factors that remain embedded in society.\u201d", "So if we\u2019re so worried, why bother introducing the Pandora\u2019s box of AI to financial services at all?", "AI\u2019s potential benefits, according to Congressman Hill, are to \u201cgather enormous amounts of data, detect abnormalities, and solve complex problems.\u201d In financial services, this means actually fairer and more accurate models for fraud, insurance, and underwriting. This can simultaneously improve bank profitability and extend services to the previously underbanked.", "Both Hill and Foster cite a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper [6] finding where in one case, algorithmic lending models discriminate 40% less than face-to-face lenders. Furthermore, Dr. Douglas Merrill, CEO of ZestFinance and expert witness, claims that customers using his company\u2019s AI tools experience higher approval rates for credit cards, auto loans, and personal loans, each with no increase in defaults.", "Moreover, Hill frames his statement with an important point about how AI could reshape the industry: this advancement will work \u201cfor both disruptive innovators and for our incumbent financial players.\u201d At first this might seem counterintuitive.", "\u201cDisruptive innovators,\u201d more agile and hindered less by legacy processes, can have an advantage in implementing new technology. [7] But without the immense budgets and customer bases of \u201cincumbent financial players,\u201d how can these disruptors succeed? And will incumbents, stuck in old ways, ever adopt AI?", "Mr. Jesse McWaters, financial innovation lead at the World Economic Forum and the final expert witness, addresses this apparent paradox, discussing what will \u201credraw the map of what we consider the financial sector.\u201d Third-party AI service providers \u2014 from traditional banks to small fintech companies \u2014 can \u201chelp smaller community banks remain digitally relevant to their customers\u201d and \u201cenable financial institutions to leapfrog forward.\u201d", "Enabling competitive markets, especially in concentrated industries like financial services, is an unadulterated benefit according to free market enthusiasts in Congress. However, \u201credrawing the map\u201d in this manner makes the financial sector larger and more complex. Congress will have to develop policy responding to not only more complex models, but also a more complex financial system.", "This system poses risks both to corporations, acting in the interest of shareholders, and to the government, acting in the interest of consumers.", "Businesses are already acting to avert potential losses from AI model failure and system complexity. A June 2019 Gartner report [8] predicts that 75% of large organizations will hire AI behavioral forensic experts to reduce brand and reputation risk by 2023.", "However, governments recognize that business-led initiatives, if motivated to protect company brand and profits, may only go so far. For a government to protect consumers, investors, and small businesses (the relevant parties according to Chairwoman Waters), a gap may still remain.", "As governments explore how to fill this gap, they are establishing principles that will underpin future guidance and regulation. The themes are consistent across governing bodies:", "In the US, President Donald Trump signed an executive order [9] in February 2019 \u201cto Maintain American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,\u201d directing federal agencies to, among other goals, \u201c foster public trust in AI systems by establishing guidance for AI development and use. \u201c The Republican White House and Democratic House of Representatives seem to clash at every turn, but they align here.", "The EU is also establishing a regulatory framework for ensuring trustworthy AI. Likewise included among the seven requirements in their latest communication from April 2019 [10]: privacy, transparency, and fairness.", "And June\u2019s G20 summit [11] drew upon similar ideas to create their own set of principles, including fairness and transparency, but also adding explainability.", "These governing bodies are in a fact-finding stage, establishing principles and learning what they are up against before guiding policy. In the words of Chairman Foster, the task force must understand \u201chow this technology will shape the questions that policymakers will have to grapple with in the coming years.\u201d", "An hour before Congresswoman Garcia\u2019s amusing challenge, Dr. Buchanan reflected upon a couple common themes of concern.", "Policymakers need to be concerned about the explainability of artificial intelligence models. And we should avoid black-box modeling where humans cannot determine the underlying process or outcomes of the machine learning or deep learning algorithms.", "But through this statement, she suggests a solution: make these AI models explainable. If humans can indeed understand the inputs, process, and outputs of a model, we can trust our AI. Then throughout AI applications in financial services, we can promote fairness for all Americans.", "[1] United States House Committee of Financial Services. \u201cPerspectives on Artificial Intelligence: Where We Are and the Next Frontier in Financial Services.\u201d https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=403824.
