Three 2020 candidates have integrated Spotify into their campaigns: Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg. In their playlists, she\u2019s featured more than any other artist, and only she and Aretha Franklin appear on all three.", "While it\u2019s easy to notice Lizzo in each playlist, we can use Spotify\u2019s datasets to reveal less obvious trends. Spotify makes a track\u2019s popularity, stylistic information, and other metadata publicly available\u2014data which can be useful in understanding not only the audience each candidate is targeting, but also how the candidate wants to be seen by that audience.", "The analysis will consider three playlists: \u201cButtijams\u201d from the Buttigieg campaign, \u201cGillibrand 2020\u201d from the Gillibrand campaign, and \u201cKamala\u2019s Summer Playlist\u201d from the Harris campaign, shown in the timeline below. (The full playlists are also embedded at the bottom of this article.) There are others that exist: Biden released playlists alongside Obama in 2016, and Beto O\u2019Rourke released a very Texan playlist during his Senate campaign. In 2017, Harris released a playlist to celebrate African American Music Appreciation Month under her official Senator account, and Buttigieg\u2019s most popular playlist is \u201c50 years, 50 Anthems: Pride 2019.\u201d With this in mind, however, it\u2019s more straightforward to focus on the playlists that are explicitly for the 2020 presidential campaign. All data was collected August 1.", "While \u201cnumber of listens\u201d is a more direct method of measuring a song\u2019s popularity, Spotify has created a \u201cpopularity\u201d index from 0 to 100 that weighs the number of plays with how recent those plays are. Here are the most and least popular tracks from each candidate\u2019s playlist.", "It can be clearer, however, to look at the exact breakdown of two factors that contribute to popularity: listens and release date. These distributions are laid out in the boxplots below.", "The most striking trend here is that Gillibrand has focused almost all of her music in the 21st century. This is also revealed in the average number of \u201cListens\u201d being dramatically higher than the other two candidates. This could suggest that she\u2019s focusing on a younger demographic, or simply choosing \u201csafer\u201d songs (Gillibrand has 1 explicit song, compared to Buttigieg\u2019s 3 and Harris\u2019s 8). Harris seems to have the most evenly distributed playlist; her earliest track is from 1964, but at least a quarter of her playlist are tracks released in 2019.", "While Spotify does not explicitly define genres for tracks, it does relate genres with artists. By combining these two data sources we can roughly approximate what genres candidates decided to associate with their image.", "Probably the most striking differences are the genres absent from certain candidate\u2019s playlist. Harris includes no country music in her playlist and Buttigieg includes no rap music. The most popular genre for Buttigieg is rock making up 40 percent, pop for Gillibrand at 31 percent, and soul for Harris at 30 percent.", "Below is a graphic that helps show the artist overlap between the candidates. The artists\u2019 popularity is in parentheses. As mentioned previously, Lizzo and Aretha Franklin are the only two artists that appear in all three playlists.", "Buttigieg and Harris share least popular artists McFadden & Whitehead and Sharen Jones & The Dap-Kings, while Harris and Gillibrand share the most popular artists listed: Beyonce, Arianna Grande, and Chance the Rapper.", "Spotify also uses indexes that help their algorithms make recommendations. In this analysis, however, it can be helpful to distinguishing the stylistic differences between the three candidates in a more detailed way than genres can offer.", "Three interesting features used by Spotify are the \u201cEnergy\u201d, \u201cDanceability\u201d, and \u201cValence\u201d features. As categorized by Spotify, a track with a lot of energy feels fast, loud, and noisy. A track with \u201cDanceability\u201d is, as one might expect, suitable for dance. A track with high valence is positive, and a track with low valence is depressed or angry.", "Buttigieg\u2019s campaign has posted songs with the most energy and the \u201chappiest\u201d tracks of the three candidates. The Gillibrand campaign posted the saddest songs of the group with Try a Little Tenderness by Otis Redding and Superwoman by Alicia Keys. Harris\u2019s playlist was best suited for dancing.", "There are many more ways to explore how the 2020 candidates are using music to communicate their message. If you\u2019re interested in conducting analysis of your own, here is a link to the data I\u2019ve collected. Spotify\u2019s datasets offer another novel way to analyze how campaigns are trying to relate to the electorate on a more personal basis.", "Questions? Mistakes? Contact me and see more projects on my website.", "NB: The embedded playlists will likely update while the stats above will not. Harris, for example, recently removed \u201cOne Nation Under Groove\u201d from her playlist, and although used in statistics, will not appear in the embedded playlist below.", "Your home for data science.
