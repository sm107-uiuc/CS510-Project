When a point in a dataset is dependent on other points, the data is said to be sequential. A common example of this is a time series, such as a stock price, or sensor data, where each data point represents an observation at a certain point in time.", "The RNN is more suitable than traditional feed-forward neural networks for sequential modelling, because it is able to remember the analysis that was done up to a given point by maintaining a state or a context, so to speak. This state, or \u2018memory,\u2019 recurs back to the net with each new input.", "Long-Short Term Memory \u2014 addressing gaps in RNNs", "RNNs are needed to keep track of states, which is computationally expensive. Also, there are issues with training, like the vanishing gradient and the exploding gradient. As a result, the RNN, or to be precise, the vanilla RNN cannot learn long sequences very well. A popular method to solve these problems is a specific type of RNN, which is called the Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM).", "LSTM maintains a strong gradient over many time steps. This means you can train an LSTM with relatively long sequences. An LSTM unit in Recurrent Neural Networks is composed of four main elements: the memory cell and three logistic gates.", "The memory cell is responsible for holding data.", "The write, read, and forget gates define the flow of data inside the LSTM. The write gate is responsible for writing data into the memory cell.", "The read gate reads data from the memory cell and sends that data back to the recurrent network, and", "the forget gate,maintains or deletes data from the information cell, or in other words determines how much old information to forget.", "In fact, these gates are the operations in the LSTM that executes some function on a linear combination of the inputs to the network, the network\u2019s previous hidden state, and previous output", "See the figure below for comparison of traditional RNNs and LSTMs:", "Natural language processing (NLP) is a classic sequence modelling task: in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable. Common applications of NLP are machine translation, chatbots and personal voice assistants, and even interactive voice responses used in call centres.", "Historically, datasets big enough for Natural Language Processing are hard to come by. This is in part due to the necessity of the sentences to be broken down and tagged with a certain degree of correctness \u2014 or else the models trained on it will lack validity. This means that we need a large amount of data, annotated by or at least corrected by humans.", "The Penn Treebank, or PTB for short, is a dataset maintained by the University of Pennsylvania. It is huge \u2014 there are over four million and eight hundred thousand annotated words in it, all corrected by humans.", "The dataset is divided in different kinds of annotations, such as Piece-of-Speech, Syntactic and Semantic skeletons. For this example, we will simply use a sample of clean, non-annotated words (with the exception of one tag \u2014 <unk> , which is used for rare words such as uncommon proper nouns) for our model.", "(Adapted from PTB training modules and Cognitive Class.ai)", "Comparison of commodity cloud vs WML-CE", "In this era of managed services, some tend to forget that underlying compute architecture still matters.
