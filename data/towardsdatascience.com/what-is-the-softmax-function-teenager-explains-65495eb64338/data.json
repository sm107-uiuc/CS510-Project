Or perhaps, at this moment, I may have been in class, trying to keep up with my professor\u2019s explanation on exact equations. With schools shut down all over the world, students like myself are left to fight their procrastination on their own. A sad struggle, one I am clearly not winning. For the past couple of weeks, despite the overwhelming online work of my university, I had decided it was the best time to learn everything I could about deep learning. Like a lot of other curious people, I decided to take a course on Udacity called Deep Learning with PyTorch (naturally, this article is inspired by concepts in this course.)", "If you have followed along from my previous article on perceptrons, you already know that a perceptron is a binary classification algorithm that makes its predictions using some linear function. But what if we wanted to classify more than two kinds of data? How can we do this? We can actually use an activation function called the softmax function. In this post we will discuss, what is a softmax function, compare binary classification and multiclass classification, discuss how the softmax function works, and provide some example code.", "A softmax function is a generalization of the logistic function that can be used to classify multiple kinds of data. The softmax function takes in real values of different classes and returns a probability distribution.", "Where the standard logistical function is capable of binary classification, the softmax function is able to do multiclass classification.", "Let say we have a model where we know that the probability that you will get a job or not is given as,", "So, the probability that you will get a job is p(job) = 0.8 and, consequently, the probability that you do not get the job is p(no job) = 0.2.", "The model will take in some inputs like, what are your final exam grades? Or how many projects have you built? And based on a linear model it will return a \u2018score\u2019 (as an unbound value), where the higher the score the more likely it is.", "Then the probability of getting a job is simply the sigmoid function of the score. (If you want to know more about how the sigmoid function works check this video out.). As we know the sigmoid function will convert the score into a probability, where probabilities are bound between 0 and 1.", "This probability is then compared to the probabilities we know(so, p(job) = 0.8 and p(not job) = 0.2).", "Suppose, we are trying to build a model which classifies 3 different items. A pencil, a pen and an eraser. Let\u2019s say the probability of getting a pencil is p(pencil) = 0.5, the probability of getting a pen is p(pen) = 0.4 and the probability of getting an eraser is p(eraser) = 0.1. Therefore the probabilities look like,", "Where the sum of the probabilities is 1.", "Now, let\u2019s do the same steps to our model as we did with the binary classification, given some inputs, calculate the linear function, and give a score to each item.", "Now that we have the scores, how can we find their probabilities of all three items? This is where softmax functions come in.", "Given the unbounded scores above, let\u2019s try to convert this into probabilities.", "Well we need a function that will do two things,", "Sigmoid functions do not always add up to 1. In other words, sigmoid functions output independent distributions, p(x1) and p(x2), so with a sigmoid function we can say that the p(job) = 0.89 and p(not job) = 0.26 which does not add up to 1. So sigmoid functions are useful when we have independent binary labels such as red or blue, cat or dog etc. As we will soon see the distribution for softmax functions is joint with output variables as p(x1, x2, x3) etc.", "One way we might be able to convert these scores to probabilities is by using this function,", "The score of one item, over the sum of all the scores. This works because each probability will come out to be between 0 and 1. It also will make each probability add up to 1.", "So this looks good, but you might have already guessed that there is one problem. What if the score was negative? This can be problematic since the probabilities will no longer add to 1.", "How can we make it so that every number is positive? Well we can try to use an exponential function so that the function might look like this,", "This is what is known as the softmax function. It can take in real values and turn them into probabilities. This is super useful since now we can classify more than two kinds of data. (For a video explanation I recommend you check out this!)", "Now let\u2019s take a look at how to write the formula for the softmax function with python.", "This code was taken directly from Udacity course, Deep Learning with Pytorch.", "This softmax function takes in a value L, which represents the score. Calculates the numerator, and the denominator of the function, then divides it.", "A softmax function is an activation function that can perform multiclass classification. It takes in real values and makes a probability distribution. The function looks like this,", "Check out this deep fake!
