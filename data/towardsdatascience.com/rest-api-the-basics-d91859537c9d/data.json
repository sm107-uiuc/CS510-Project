How do they work, and what differentiates them from SOAP? And, as easy as it might be for many, for me it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never spent much time on studying or understanding to their depth. It\u2019s one of those topics I have never got a chance to explore. Never was required for any of my previous projects. And I feel it\u2019s a very relatable topic if someone is in Software Development. Almost all of my friends and colleagues have good knowledge on them or have worked on them as part of their previous projects. That\u2019s why I feel it\u2019s high time for me to take a leap towards understanding REST APIs.", "So, this article is about exploring REST APIs, how they work and why do we need them. I have a few more articles to come up in the same topic, or rather I can say a series of articles.", "This article covers all the basics of what an API looks like, what are requests and responses, HTTP methods, and some more terminologies which might be required further. The next one coming up in the same series briefs REST APIs with respect to their architectural constraints. That\u2019s where we find the real potential of using REST for building APIs for any application. And the next few that I\u2019m writing on this series are developing APIs based on REST.", "Here we go. The diagram below shows a chat between two computer systems, where one is called a client and the other one is called a server. Server hosts a Social media application where people can post or comment about anything. Something like Facebook, Instagram or LinkedIn. Now the client wants to get a look at all the recent posts. So here goes a chat between the two.", "So this is what the chat between a Client computer and a Server computer looks like. It starts when the client sends a request to access the posts. The server upon receiving the request, gets down to the database and finds all the posts available at that point of time. Each post has its relevant comments as well. It forms a list of posts with their comments and returns it to the client. Server also provides the functionality of creating, updating or deleting a post. Clients can use these functionalities whenever required.", "A computer is called a Server which provides certain functionalities as services. A computer which uses these services provided by the server is called a Client. When a system of computers are designed this way, where one of them or a group of them acts as a server responsible for maintaining any application and responds to when requested by any other computer acting as a Client, then it is said that the whole system follows a Server Client Architecture.", "The communication in the above scenario was in plain English. But computers need to have a way of communicating with some kind of codewords, or protocols that they only can understand. That\u2019s where we write APIs, which helps us to define such interactions between these computers. They define the kind of interactions that can be done between the computers, the data format to use for the communication, which language and encoding algorithm to use, the structure of the requests and the responses, and a lot more details.", "So this is exactly how a communication between a pair of computers looks like. It\u2019s also in pure English, but uses certain codewords, or protocols to define the communication. Server is offering service to return the posts with API /posts. Client is hitting the API with GET method, upon which server is sending the posts in a response.", "Okay, Nice. We saw what an API looks like. But then, what is REST? REST defines the protocols to be used while developing such APIs. It defines certain constraints to keep in mind while designing the architecture of the APIs, if the APIs follow all the constraints strictly, then they are said to be RESTful.", "A REST API follows the format shown above for the communication. Each request from the Client is done for a resource in REST. A resource can be anything, it can be a record from a table in a database, a result of some calculation, or a document/file. A resource might be a single item resource or a resource containing a collection of items.", "When a server gets a request for a Resource, it first retrieves the current state of the resource. The state can be thought of as the data available at the moment of the request. It\u2019s like a snapshot of the data at that point of time. Server sends it back in a JSON or XML representation, or any other representation as accepted by both the parties.", "These are the three main items in a REST API communication. Resource, State of the Resource, and the Representation of the Resource. The above picture demonstrates the idea. Don\u2019t worry about the codewords, the next section describes all of them. As we can see the response from the server is in JSON representation, the content returned is the resource, and it only includes the posts and comments at the current point of time, hence the current state. We can put it this way, In REST, client and server always communicate only by sending a representation of the state of the resource. Hence, the name REpresentational State Transfer.", "Let\u2019s take a request URL and analyze what it is made up of.", "URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. From the name it seems like an address of a Resource. The client can use this URL to get access to a resource. For our case, I want to see all the posts available on the server. As we can see above, the URL consists of a root endpoint and a path to the specific resource.", "It looks for the posts available currently on the server. (or for a specific post on the server with its unique id, or for a comment on a post etc. The id accessed here refers to a specific post, it\u2019s called URI, we see it in the next item).", "Client needs to indicate the type or the method of the request with the request itself. This tells the server what client actually wants to do with the request. It might be to access and read the resources, or might be to update one of them, or create a new one, or delete one. The method on the request lets the Server take appropriate action on the resources. REST allows the usage of the HTTP methods GET, PUT, POST and DELETE to perform CRUD operations. Below, we explore each of them in detail.", "Here client is accessing a post with its unique identifier - id. Actually, it can be anything which is unique for each one of them, for ex. a username, or may be a phone number. The identifier is otherwise known as Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).", "If the post with the requested ID is found, then the server creates a response including the post, in a JSON representation as shown above. It also returns the status code 200 with the response, as the resource was found. If not found it returns 404, or if identifier is not valid, it returns 400.", "A client may also ask for a list of items as a resource, without any identifier for a resource. In this case, the server creates a response including all the posts, in a JSON representation.", "Here to update the resource, the client needs to send the new state (updated content) as well. The state can be sent in the body of the request, as it would be too large to fit on the url parameters. Also, we don\u2019t want to send any sensitive information over a PUT request. After updating the resource state, it returns with a response of 200, or 204 if response has no content, or 404 if resource is not found.", "Again as in the previous case, POST comes with a content in the body of the request, except that it is a new resource that client wants to create. Upon creation server responds with 201, or 204 with no content.", "A delete operation comes again with the Unique Identifier for the resource which Client wants to delete from the server. Server returns 200 upon successful deletion, otherwise 404 if resource with identifier is not found.", "Headers in the request contain meta information about the request. It allows the client to inform the server what format of the resource it is accepting, what encoding technique for the resource it is accepting, what language it is accepting, and many more tiny details that server might need while creating and sending the response.", "There are many more header fields available. Please have a look here to get a list of all of them and their by default values.", "Body of the request is an optional field. It contains the content of the resource which client wants to update or create. This field is populated when the request type is PUT or POST.", "Let\u2019s see what a Response is made up of:", "As we already saw in Request Headers, there are some Response headers as well. They are sent along with the response to the client. Two of them we saw above, Content-Type and Content-Encoding. Let\u2019s see some more.", "Again there\u2019s a bunch of them. Please have a look here to get a list of all of them and their by default values.", "Status code in the REST API response is mainly used to indicate the result of the request to the client. The status codes are actually part of HTTP Response messages. In this post, we saw several status codes. To get the whole list of Status Codes please visit Status Codes.", "That\u2019s it for this post. The next one is surely on REST again, as I have not included the architectural constraints of the REST in this one.
