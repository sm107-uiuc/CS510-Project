The frequency of occurrences makes it rather challenging to keep up with events. I\u2019ve read several headlines and articles that paint AI in a somewhat not so positive picture.", "A world where the pipelines and processes within machine learning related projects and researches are monitored and regulated is becoming a possible reality.", "The advent of current technology and AI gave birth to the unsatisfiable demand for data, and as a result, the individuals that understand the data required to ensure AI systems function appropriately.", "This article by Seattle Times explores the trends surrounding the roles associated with data: Data Scientists and Data Analysts.", "Data Science and Analytics is a unique job role that spans across various industries and sectors. With your data science skills, you can work in both the medical industry and oil industry, really your career progression and potentials have no bounds. The article explores a fundamental fact of data-based roles, and that is every industry needs individuals that understand data.", "Apart from trends in the industrial space, the article touches on academic trends. Many individuals with technical skills will most likely head back to University and specialize in an advanced degree related to data. This statement is very true as I went back to gain an MSc in machine learning after working for a couple of years as a Web developer. And I believe more professional individuals will follow suit in the coming years.", "One trend that the article includes is the normalization of data literacy as a required skill from every professional individual. The article is focused on data science jobs, but this trend applies to every modern job role; everyone simply needs to understand the data that are produced by systems. The level of data understanding or literacy deemed normal will not complex, but a basic understanding and explainability of data can go a long way for everyone.", "The article explores and details more trends; below is a link to the original article.", "In the current global climate, for many, job security is an issue that is at the forefront of agendas. But it seems that machine learning and software development roles might be immune to the current waves of job losses.", "Insurance company Travelers is looking to hire a batch of software and machine learning professional over some time. This hiring spree aims to aid in the company\u2019s efforts at digital transformation.", "The new hires will get involved in projects that are associated with machine learning fields such as computer vision, natural processing, speech recognition and data science.", "More specifically, the company is looking to develop a system that can conduct sentiment analysis from speech, and even systems that examine property damages from images.", "Travelers is based in New-York, so for machine learning practitioners in the area, this is an excellent opportunity to either break into the AI field or make a career change.", "More information is provided in the link below:", "Many readers of this article would have trained machine learning models with a publically available dataset. One of those datasets you utilized might have been the widely used \u2018Tiny Images\u2019, a dataset created and released by MIT. The Tiny images dataset contains 80 million images, that are labelled with descriptions that define the content within the images.", "It turns out the dataset contained some rather inappropriate descriptions. MIT has taken the dataset down and has even released a statement that can be found here.", "The dataset was created in 2006 and primarily populated through the use of internet search engines with no oversight of the content contributing to the dataset. Due to the large scale of the dataset and the inability to identify all the images within the dataset, MIT has taken it offline and the dataset can no longer be utilized.", "The Tiny Images dataset is popular, and I\u2019m sure a lot of computer vision systems would have been trained on the dataset, there might even be copies littered over the internet.", "Current events have brought to light the bias that AI systems have as a result of their training data, and I believe in the future we might see a more monitored and rigorous approach to the data gathering processes within several machine learning projects and research.", "How do you slow the spread of COVID-19 in a food bank? You take an intelligent mobile robot and place four lightsabers on its head.", "Ava Robotics, in partnership with MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab(CSIL), have created a robotic system that can disinfect surfaces within the Greater Boston Food Bank(GBFB). An additional component of the robot system is aimed at eradicating COVID-19 aerosol. This robot looks as impressive as it sounds.", "The robot can navigate through its environment, guided with an internal mapping system that contains markers of areas to be disinfected.", "More information is provided over at Techcrunch:", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
