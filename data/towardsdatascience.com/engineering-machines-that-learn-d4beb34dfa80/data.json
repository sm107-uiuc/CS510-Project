In this article, we share the research motivation and approach, some initial results, and an invitation to help us by taking our 7-minute online survey on ML Engineering best practices.", "Machine Learning is key to the new wave of AI", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undeniably experiencing a new wave of attention, energy, and sky-high expectations. This wave is driven by the abundance of data that is generated in our connected, digital society, and by the low-barrier availability of enormous computational resources.", "Among various AI-techniques, Machine Learning (ML) in particular has come to play a key role.", "Machine Learning allows us to solve complex problems, not by arduously writing new code, but by letting an existing algorithm learn new behavior from examples. We are now witnessing break-through results in image recognition, speech processing, medical diagnostics, securities trading, autonomous driving, product design and manufacturing, and much more.", "Does the rapid ascent of Machine Learning mean that software systems will no longer need to be programmed? Will we need data scientists instead of software developers?", "To those that have experienced software-related project delays, system outages, and indefinitely incomplete feature sets, a world without programmers might seem attractive.", "But no so fast. There are several reasons why Machine Learning will not replace programming, but rather make the software engineering discipline even richer and more complex.", "Still, there are specific characteristics of Machine Learning that challenge traditional software development practices. The amount of data to manage is typically much larger for applications that involve Machine Learning components. The development process tends to involve more rapid-cycle experimentation, where alternative solutions are routinely attempted, compared, and discarded. And the level of inherent uncertainty in the final product is higher.", "Around the globe, numerous organizations are learning step-by-step how to develop software systems that include ML components. With an increasing number of people self-identifying as ML Engineer, the discipline of Machine Learning Engineering is emerging. This raises interesting questions:", "To investigate these questions, researchers in the fields of Software Engineering and Machine Learning have teamed up.", "We have started with an extensive review of both scientific and popular literature, to identify which practices are described and recommended by practitioners and researchers. These practices range from data management (e.g. how to deal with storage and versioning of large data sets), through model training (e.g. how to run and evaluate training experiments), to operations (e.g. how to deploy and monitor trained models).", "We then embedded the identified practices in a survey among representatives of teams that build software with ML components. This survey is currently in progress and open for new participants (see below). At the time of writing about 200 teams have participated. Early results show that larger teams tend to adopt more engineering practices.", "Also, early results tell us that some practices are widely adopted, and can be considered basic, while other practices are only applied by more experienced teams in larger organizations, and can be considered advanced.", "An example of a more advanced practice is the use of so-called automated machine learning techniques, where teams are able to do model selection and hyper-parameter optimization in an automated way. Early survey results indicate that these techniques enjoy much stronger adoption in tech companies and (academic) research labs than in non-tech companies and government.", "We are using the results of our survey to organize the best practices into a comprehensive catalogue. In the catalogue, each ML engineering practice is recorded in a uniform structure, much like design patterns and refactorings have been catalogued in the past.", "Elements of the structure include the intent and motivation of the practice, its applicability in various contexts, the interdependencies with other practices, and a short and actionable description of how to apply the practice. We also provide references to literature and supporting tools.", "Using the survey results we are also able to quantify the difficulty of each practice. This helps us to sort them into difficulty levels from basic to advanced, giving guidance to teams to prioritize their adoption.", "Our ultimate objective is that the resulting catalogue will help the formation and effectiveness of ML Engineering teams, not only in the larger tech companies where ML Engineering already enjoys strong adoption, but also in smaller and non-tech organizations.", "If you are part of a team that builds software that includes Machine Learning components, please help us by taking our survey.", "Joost Visser is professor of Software and Data Science at Leiden University. Previously, Joost held various leadership positions at the Software Improvement Group. He is the author of numerous publications on software quality and related topics.", "Joint work with Alex Serban, Holger Hoos, and Koen van der Blom.", "For more information, consult the SE4ML project website.", "An earlier version of this article was published in Bits & Chips.", "Your home for data science.
