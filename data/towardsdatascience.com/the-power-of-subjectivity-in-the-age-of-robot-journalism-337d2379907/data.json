Let\u2019s call him Bob. When you met Bob, he took your previous movie back, recommended a new one to you and finally took your money. What is interesting about the Bobs is how they lost their jobs due to technological development and artificial intelligence.", "First, only one of the Bobs\u2019 tasks became obsolete, as rewinding videotapes became unnecessary in the DVD era. But, at that time, nobody called the Bobs\u2019 ability to generate value into question. However, as broadband internet swept across the developed world, and with the emergence of torrent sites and video on demand services, it was time for the Bobs to find something else to do.", "Payment and rental processes were automated, while the specific task of Bob to recommend new movies to customers was taken over \u2014 with time \u2014 by an algorithm based on artificial intelligence. A good example of the latter is that according to Wired magazine, 80 percent of viewed content on Netflix is discovered with the help of an AI-based recommendation system.", "AI and automation are not mutually exclusive concepts. Automation can be based on both traditional programming and artificial intelligence. In the first case, the software is following a set of previously created rules, while in the case of AI, we expect the machine to imitate human thinking, learn on its own and come up with new solutions to a given problem.", "Newsrooms already apply both intelligent and non-intelligent automation. To predict how AI technologies and robot journalists will impact online news media, we will first take a broader look at the possible implications of these technologies on our society and the labor market. Following this, we will examine recently deployed technologies at news organizations and investigate business model opportunities related to AI.", "Let\u2019s try to answer the following question:", "What will the role of people be when robots can perform all work-related tasks better and cheaper than humans?", "According to Spyros Makridakis, director of the Institute for the Future at the University of Nicosia, there are four distinct visions to answer this question.", "Based on his 2017 analysis, the first group includes those who are optimistic about AI\u2019s integration into our society. They assume that with the help of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics, a seemingly utopian society will develop. Lifespan will be extended or even turned endless. Cheap materials and advanced technology will enable us to produce an unlimited amount of goods which will lead to limitless wealth.", "Moreover, probably the most appealing part to many: humans will be able to choose whether they prefer to work or not as robots will conduct the actual work.", "If you think that this prediction sounds too good to be true, you are not alone. There is another, needless to say, a larger group of thinkers and academics who believe that the optimists underestimate or neglect certain dangers related to AI when projecting the emergence of an abundant society. Bill Joy, the founder of Sun Microsystems, belongs to this group. In his widely quoted article in Wired from 2000, he described that \u201cthe most powerful 21st-century technologies \u2014 robotics, genetic engineering and nanotech \u2014 are threatening to make humans an endangered species.\u201d", "After all, if robots will be able to do everything better than humans, why would they need us? Humans might turn into computer pets, as they would neither be motivated to work nor to make decisions, as artificial intelligence will be in charge of both. \u201cIt may not be a bad world, but it will definitely be a different one,\u201d pessimists say.", "When going further, pessimists raise several other observations. For instance, could humanity cope with robots electing politicians, due to their lack of proneness to believe unrealistic promises?", "Alternately, could humans accept an Earth where they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to drive a car just because their accident rate exceeded that of artificial intelligence? According to pessimists, we have to answer tons of similar questions.", "Before selling your car, however, keep in mind that there are also thinkers who doubt, for many reasons, whether these massive changes would ever materialize and there are those who predict a more nuanced reality.", "Pragmatic thinkers mainly claim that AI will not replace or defeat human intelligence but rather augment it. They conclude that if proper regulation and adequate controls are set up, humans can continue to have power over artificial intelligence for the foreseeable future. Also, they claim, if things do not exactly go as planned, humans can still install chips into robots which make them inoperative in case of danger.", "Stanford University Lecturer Jerry Kaplan, author of the book Artificial Intelligence: What Everyone Needs to Know, also med the exaggerated atmosphere around artificial intelligence in his 2017 article.", "\u201cAI is simply a natural continuation of longstanding efforts to automate tasks, dating back at least to the start of the industrial revolution,\u201d he wrote.", "The often applied perception of they and us, the division between humans and AI in the public\u2019s eye, comes from an anthropomorphic concept which is mostly the result of Hollywood blockbusters and the unnecessary show of human-like attributes of robots, such as natural-sounding voices, facial expressions and the simulated display of human emotions.", "Naturally, when facilitating human-computer interactions, these techniques indeed hold value. However, by implying that there is something more than what we see, they create mistrust which can delay or derail practical applications of the technology and even influence legislation counterproductively.", "Kaplan also explained a moderate vision regarding the impact of artificial intelligence on the labor market. He cited the example of the U.S. labor force, 90 percent of which was working in farming 200 years ago, while in the present, this figure is just two percent. \u201cYet, everyone isn\u2019t out of work,\u201d a statement which is hard to contest.", "In the meantime, Kaplan acknowledged that technology-driven transitions in the labor market take time and may lead to significant social disruptions. Repetitive tasks, well-defined procedures, and clear-cut goals can be associated with an elevated risk of losing a job. At the same time, the risk of losing one\u2019s job is lower, if someone\u2019s tasks consist of solving challenges in rapidly changing environments or if it involves the expression of human emotions.", "If we look at recent developments in the field of news media, Kaplan seems to be heading in the right direction. Based on an article published by TechEmergence in January 2018, current AI developments do not seem to target the replacement of writers or journalists. Similarly to other industries, some jobs might also vanish in news media, like those, which mostly execute well-defined and repetitive tasks. However, when it comes to journalists, current automation solutions primarily emphasize the augmentation of their jobs and not the takeover of them.", "Newsrooms are already experimenting with automated journalism. The Associated Press estimated that AI-based technology freed up 20 percent of their journalists\u2019 time when they covered financial earnings.", "\u201cIn the case of automated financial news coverage by AP, the error rate in the copy decreased even as the volume of the output increased more than tenfold,\u201d said Francesco Marconi, AP\u2019s strategy manager and AI co-lead.", "Another existing application of automated journalism is Heliograf, the Washington Post\u2019s algorithm, which was first used during the 2016 Rio Olympics and generated 300 reports and alerts about the games. Since 2016, Heliograf published several hundreds of articles during the 2016 U.S. elections and expanded its scope of operations to high school football events in the Washington, D.C. area.", "From the perspective of automation, sports journalism is a case similar to financial earnings, as most of the reporting relies on data. In addition, the field is traditionally open to advance technological developments. As early as at the end of the 19th century, The New York Herald hired Guglielmo Marconi, inventor of the wireless telegram, to broadcast the America\u2019s Cup. Sports content was also key for Ted Turner to succeed in the development of cable television and in the internet era, the first events broadcast live in written articles were sports events.", "\u201cThe metabolism of sports and the metabolism of the Web always seemed like a good match,\u201d commented Jim Brady, one of the first sports editors of the online Washington Post to the Columbia Journalism Review. The implementation of new web-based solutions was made easier by factors from both the readers\u2019 and the writers\u2019 sides.", "First, sports fans were generally passionate about their obsessions and they were ready for more engagement. On the other hand, sports journalists found it often very frustrating how little of their copy made it into the paper, as sports pieces were the first to be cut in case there was a lack of space in an issue. The internet not only provided unlimited space for sports articles but also made it possible for print-turned-online-journalists to keep up with TV commentators and present information almost in real time.", "After the emergence of online news sites, online editors discovered that reporting on sports meant significant traffic for their websites. If we look at current data, this observation is still true. According to Similarweb, NBC News had 71.63 million unique visitors in August 2018, while NBC Sports had 36.7 million. In the case of CBS, the number of unique visitors on CBS News was 77.62 million, while CBS Sports attracted 56.22 million users.", "While sports content is essential for the news industry, how about sports journalists? Has the ever-increasing presence of automated data streams, and algorithms\u2019 ability to create narrative text out of them, brought the use of human sports journalists to an end?", "According to Yair Galily, researcher and lecturer at the Israeli higher education institute IDC Herzliya, it was reasonable to worry that automation would result in job losses for sports journalists, however, this should be placed in a broader context where changing business models might kill some existing jobs, but in the meantime, create space for new ones.", "A notable example is entrepreneurial journalism when journalists set up their own companies to produce content and develop their own distribution networks by syndicating materials over different websites and blogs. This model is naturally not specific to sports, most writers can make use of it.", "Apart from AI\u2019s expected impact on specific tasks, the emergence of automation and AI also challenges a crucial aspect of journalism, which is journalistic judgment.", "\u201cEveryday, news work is fundamentally about making judgments. Journalists decide what information is useful or irrelevant, what stories should be included or excluded, what framing should be implemented or avoided and how stories should be emphasized or deemphasized,\u201d wrote Associate Professor Matt Carlson of Saint Louis University in 2017. With automation becoming more and more present in newsrooms, algorithms can potentially challenge journalistic decisions.", "When journalists make decisions regarding the newsworthiness of a given event or a piece of information, they determine the relevancy of a given story from the perspective of the public. However, algorithms can make these decisions on a person by person basis, which means that the public character, currently defining journalistic choices, might become obsolete.", "\u201cAs a result, the question of \u2018what deserves attention?\u2019 at the heart of the professional judgment of journalism shifts to a different, personalized question of \u2018what does this person want?\u2019,\u201d claimed Carlson, which would be a significant shift from journalism\u2019s current logic.", "Carlson also assumed that if we kept measuring journalists\u2019 work by objectivity, new algorithms could beat humans, as algorithms are free from biases and limitations, which humans are generally prone to. However, human-made editorial decisions would not automatically become inferior to algorithm-made ones.", "A considerable share of news writing has shifted from descriptive to interpretive anyway; hence journalists in the future could draw their authority from making sense of the world, not solely from describing it.", "It does not mean that journalists and editors should completely abandon objectivity. They would only have to explicitly declare that both objectivity and subjectivity were necessary to make a professional judgment in news media. If this shift came hand-in-hand with more transparency on how news stories came into existence, it would allow both journalists to defend their subjectivity and the public to scrutinize the work of writers.", "In the meantime, there seems to be a room for improvement for journalists to adapt to industry changes. According to Andreas Graefe, author of the Guide to Automated Journalism, journalists believe that human writing is superior to machine writing, partially because of humans\u2019 ability to write a quality narrative of events.", "Yet, journalists tend to define their profession by skills, which machines shine at, such as objectivity, the ability to simplify and speed.", "According to Graefe, when journalists cover automated journalism, they tend to characterize the writing quality as poor. However, it might be misleading to judge the output of algorithms based on writing skills. In fields, such as sports or finances where automatic news generation is most frequently used, writing complex stories might be counterproductive. In these areas, readers are mostly looking for quick information, which potentially turns simple writing into an asset.", "We started discussing the direct impact of automation on news media with the general notion that what can be automated, will be automated. Graefe also gives us some reference points to what cannot be automated, and these might be the areas where journalists should concentrate their professional growth.", "Journalists are advised to develop the skills that make them better at in-depth analysis, investigative reporting and conducting interviews, as algorithms, at their current stage of development, cannot deliver these tasks with consistent quality.", "On the other hand, automation and technological development will not exclusively put journalists on the defensive. New opportunities will also emerge throughout the process, like the already mentioned entrepreneurial journalism and humans will also have to create automated methods in newsrooms.", "For instance, a turning point in a sporting event might be evident to a sports journalist but defining precisely to a rule-based algorithm how the importance of a specific event changes throughout the game can be challenging. When a team scores a goal in the first minute of a football game, the expected impact on the final score is very different from scoring a goal a few minutes before the final whistle.", "Online and print news media have two primary sources of income. According to figures published by the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers, revenue in 2107 for the global newspaper industry was $150 billion. $87.2 billion came from circulation and subscriptions while advertising accounted for the remaining $62.8 billion (or 41.9 percent).", "The share of advertising is considerably higher if we only look at digital platforms where the total income was $15.8 billion in 2017. In spite of the increasing number of subscribers, advertising still generated 72.15 percent of the revenue, meaning $11.4 billion.", "There is much buzz around the notion that the ad-revenue-based ecosystem of the online press industry is failing. However, there seems to be a massive reserve of ad money at tech firms, such as Facebook and Google. Facebook received $39.94 billion in ad revenue in 2017, while Google received $95.38 billion. These two figures combined represent almost 12 times the amount of newspapers\u2019 total digital ad income.", "Tech companies mainly attract considerable sums in advertisement money because they can deliver messages precisely to the right audiences. Brands do not have to carpet bomb the entire media landscape to reach their target consumers; they can precision strike thanks to ad targeting on sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram or Google.", "Although targeting already exists on news sites, their precision lags way behind the solutions of tech firms. However, with the emergence of news personalization and the automated production of articles, AI has the potential to change that. If this impact meets the ad industry\u2019s appetite for personalization, news platforms might become more competitive and attract more advertising money.", "Stakeholders in online advertising are already working to increase the efficiency of targeting with the help of AI. According to a July 2018 survey conducted by the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe and Xaxis, the primary reasons why advertisers, agencies, intermediaries, and publishers use AI is to deliver better targeting solutions and identify better-qualified users or audiences.", "\u201cGod created mankind in his own image.\u201d", "The very first chapter of the very first book of the Bible \u2014 a leading cultural reference point for Western civilization \u2014 suggests that humans resemble the divine being, and by accepting this sentiment, humanity placed itself above all other forms of existence on Earth.", "Ever since that, nothing came even close to the achievements of humankind and human intellect. Now, however, we seemed to have arrived at a crossroads. Something humanity created has the potential to solve problems we could not solve with logic we do not necessarily understand. It is natural that there are a lot of open questions and that some thinkers assume that humanity was facing an existential crisis.", "Other great minds, however, conclude that AI was just another step in the natural process of technological development. As with all significant phases, it will shape human society, but there is no qualitative difference concerning the magnitude of its influence from certain past events, such as the industrial revolution.", "The problems of the press are at least twofold. First, the public tends to turn to journalists for answers, but in topics regarding the future, they can only report uncertainty with great certainty.", "Naturally, that has always been the case, but at times of significant changes and transitions, the inability to provide clear answers can take away the sense of relevancy from the media.", "In the meantime, online news publishers arrived at this crossroads with a troubled business model and they have to redefine some of their roles and principles in an uncertain environment.", "As automation and AI has already entered different phases of news production, we can conclude that current solutions do not target the complete replacement of human journalists. Some positions, most of which are repetitive and can be defined by precise rules, might disappear, but other jobs and employment structures might emerge.", "It seems a realistic scenario that AI and automation will augment more and more newsrooms. Algorithms will execute some tasks, but humans will retain control over news production.", "Taking a more holistic approach, AI has the potential to personalize news sites which could increase the efficiency of ad targeting and reduce the gap between the ad income of news publishers and tech companies. Given that news media receives a more substantial part of online ad revenues in the future, AI has the potential of placing the online news media on a more sustainable trajectory.", "Originally published at Endless Media News.", "Cover photo by Roman Kraft on Unsplash", "Your home for data science.
