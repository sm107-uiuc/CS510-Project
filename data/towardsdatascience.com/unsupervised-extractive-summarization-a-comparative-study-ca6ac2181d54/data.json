Supervised approaches seek to learn which sentences to extract based on a large number of examples; they may be challenging to apply and deploy in practice, as they require large, high-quality training sets. Unsupervised methods do not require any training set and work solely with the corpus to summarize. Here, we explore how unsupervised methods can compete with state-of-the-art, supervised extractive summarization methods.", "Background. Extractive approaches generate a summary by selecting a subset of important existing words, phrases, or sentences directly from the source text. There is extensive scientific literature on the topic; recent surveys include (Saggio et al., 2016, Gambhir et al., 2017, Aries et al., 2019, Papagiannopoulou et al., 2019).", "Extractive summarization can be contrasted with abstractive summarization, which differs from its extractive counterpart in that it seeks to generate new sentences from scratch, as opposed to extracting them from the source document(s). Think of extractive summarization as a highlighter pen, and of abstractive summarization as a human writer. Abstractive approaches are generally harder to develop, as they require high-performance natural language generation techniques, itself an active research field, see for example (Boutkan et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2019) and references therein. Mixed strategies that combine both extractive and abstractive approaches have also been recently proposed, see for example (Peng et al., 2019).", "To date, the most advanced supervised purely extractive summarization techniques rely on neural network architectures; SummaRunner (Nallapati et al., 2018) which uses a \u201crecurrent neural network\u201d, is one of the best models representative of that category.", "As noted by (Gruski et al., 2018) on news data sets, very simple (unsupervised) baselines, such as selecting the first few sentences of a news article, are still able to beat these advanced supervised models. This may be an artifact of the data sets commonly used for evaluation: news articles tend to be written in such a way that the first few sentences give the gist of the article, which is referred to as the \u201clead\u201d in newsroom parlance; but it also points to the fact that unsupervised approaches may still have a shot against supervised ones.", "Previous work in unsupervised extractive summarization has focused on statistical, graph-based, and optimization-based approaches. Statistical methods (Saggio et al., 2016) use simple statistics such as TF-IDF scores at their core. Graph-based approaches (Barrios et al., 2016) represent text as a network linking sentences and use graph-based ranking methods to generate a summary; optimization-based methods (Durrett et al., 2016) use techniques such as sparse optimization, integer linear programming and constraint optimization.", "Data sets. In order to compare summarization algorithms, it is best to have data sets that contain \u201cgold\u201d, or reference, summaries. In our comparison, we have used both standard and less standard data sets.", "The data sets CNN and Daily Mail (DM), available here, both contain news articles, typically 1 or 2 pages long, for which the \u201cgold\u201d summaries, typically a few sentences long, have been manually written.", "To these standard data sets, we have open-sourced here two new data sets that are useful , since they contain much longer documents:", "Evaluation metrics used in the summarization field are usually based on the so-called ROUGE scores, which measure lexical overlap between extracted sentences and their reference counterpart, such as, the number of words shared with the reference summary. Many authors note the shortcomings of such purely lexical measures, especially when the reference summaries use language similar in meaning, but different in word choice. This motivated researchers to propose more semantically grounded measures, mostly to cope with synonyms better.", "The paper by (Ng et al., 2015) addresses the issue of synonymity by measuring similarity between extracted sentences and reference summaries via so-called sentence embeddings; other approaches such as ROUGE 2.0 are based on a fixed list of synonyms, and/or the use of topics.", "Results. We have compared four different methods:", "The table below shows the score corresponding to a lexical ROUGE metric, with a 95% confidence interval shown. (The metric shown corresponds to a harmonic mean of recall and precision measures; it should not be confused with the F1 scores typical in classification; for summarization overlap measures, the figures are typically much lower.)", "We observe that SummaRunner seems to be favored when the data contains shorter documents (CNN and DM, i.e. news); but in this case the simple baseline (Lede-3) does almost as well. Faced with longer documents such as reports and literature, both the baseline and graph-based method are dominated by the other two models, by a wide margin. Across the different datasets, the unsupervised method Nucleus is on par with the sophisticated supervised model.", "Other lexical metrics such as ROUGE-*, and measures such as Precision, Recall, etc., or using semantic ROUGE metrics, point to the same conclusions.", "Your home for data science.
