While standardization typically aims to rescale the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, scaling focuses on changing the range of the values of the dataset.", "As mentioned in [1] and in many other articles, data-normalization is required when the features have different ranges. For example, normalizing when we have weight and height features is important as their range of values have different scales: e.g. [~45\u2013130 Kg] for weight and [~120\u2013230 cm] for height.", "However, many articles do not mention other applications in which data-normalization is also crucial. Usually, in those applications, data-normalization may not be so obvious or easy to implement, due to the similar scales of all the features or to the relative information of each feature. Time-series in the frequency-domain are an example because, firstly, the scale of the amplitude of the frequencies is, in principle, the same and, secondly, because normalizing per frequency (feature) may cause a loss of relative information.", "So, under what circumstances is data-normalization necessary? To answer this question, this article displays an illustrative example that compares the performance of a linear classifier (SVM classifier with linear-kernel) and a non-linear classifier (SVM classifier with RBF-kernel) before and after implementing data normalization.", "As will be observed, results indicate that implementing data normalization does not influence the accuracy of the linear classifier while it affects the accuracy of the non-linear classifier drastically.", "This article starts by introducing the Python code with a brief description of what it\u2019s used for. Then, it presents the mathematical equation that explains why the scale of the data affects the non-linear classifier. Lastly, it displays the new results of the non-linear classifier once the hyperparameters are tuned, based on the scale of the datasets.", "If you are interested in SVM classifiers, it is highly recommended reading:", "Drew Wilimitis, The Kernel trick in Support Vector Machine (2018), Medium", "Further information about SVM classifiers is noted at the end of this article (Ref. [3], [4] and [5]).", "The datasets were created using the make_blobs() function, which generates blobs of points with a Gaussian distribution. Two blobs datasets with 1000 data were generated. The centers of the datasets were on (100, 100) and (200, 200) and their standard deviation was 120.", "As explained in [2], there are different ways of normalizing the data. For this article, the datasets were normalized using the Min-Max Normalization technique. This method adjusts the minimum value of each feature into a 0, and the maximum value into 1. The rest of the values are converted into a decimal between 0 and 1, according to the following formula.", "In order to study the scaling effects on the results of the classifiers, data-normalization for the original data and up-scaling (50 and 300 times) for the normalized data were implemented.", "The plots of all the data generated are:", "Declaring and running the SVM classifier with linear kernel:", "The SVM classifier with linear-kernel was created using the sklearn library on Python. Half of the data was used for training it and the other half for testing it.", "The results of the linear classifier are displayed in Figure 2. As can be seen, the scale does not affect its performance.", "Declaring and running the SVM classifier with RBF kernel:", "The methodology of the SVM classifier with RBF-kernel is similar to the one mentioned above. Firstly, the classifier was created using the sklearn library on Python. Then, half of the data was used for training it and the other half for testing it.", "Compared to the linear classifier, this non-linear classifier has two hyperparameters to tune: gamma and c. While the hyperparameter gamma was set to a constant value of 1, the classifier iterated 20 times with multiple c values.", "The results of the non-linear classifier are displayed in Figure 3. The axes of the plot are:", "As observed in Figure 3, the scale does influence the accuracy performance, obtaining higher accuracy with the normalized data.", "To conclude, the linear kernel is not affected by the upscaling and normalization of the data while the accuracy of the RBF-kernel SVM classifier depends highly on the scale of the dataset.", "This dependency, for this specific classifier, comes from the use of the Euclidean distance when implementing the kernel trick:", "For this specific kernel, the exponent increases in value proportionally to the square of the Euclidean distance. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of the datasets with larger scales, the gamma value should be inversely decreased 5\u00b2 and 30\u00b2 times when the scale is upscaled 50 and 300 times higher, respectively.", "As observed in Figure 4, the accuracy for the up-scaled data is the same as the normalized data once the hyperparameters are tuned according to the scale of the dataset.", "If you enjoyed this post, please consider subscribing.
