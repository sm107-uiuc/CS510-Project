This is such a common\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Have you ever wondered why you, a talented Data Scientist, is not an adviser or a consultant for business, but just a normal employee spending time solving other\u2019s requests?", "This is such a common complaint that I heard so many times from my friends, my fellows and especially from the junior. Years ago during the beginning of my career, I was also a victim of this trap. Now, I realized that this is a real bottleneck of Data Scientist and I want to share my experience to others so that it will help other Data Scientist achieving a brighter career.", "Whenever I meet other Data Science fellows, most of the time was spent talking about RNN, NLP, Deep learning, or Machine learning algorithms. But when I called on a question of why they used RNN instead of Deep learning or how their model supports the business, they could either provide an unconvincing reason or stay on a lengthy explanation of concept, algorithm without a comprehensive business thinking.", "It is a routine for a Data Scientist to saturate with technical models while understates the role of business mindset. However, I totally do not deny the integral role of technical work of a data scientist, I only want to emphasize the importance of understanding the business concept at first before any other activities.", "Therefore, I list out below a standard flow for starting a data science projects with key points, which I have been applying throughout 4 years working for 2 multinational companies as a data analyst and data scientist.", "This post was written based on my experience. Hence, take it as your reference and adjust to your own needs.", "During my years in analytics and data science, in addition to technological concept explanation, business question clarification is one of the most difficult tasks when a Data scientist communicates with business partner.", "I am sure that you catch this phrase everywhere, in numerous articles, warning you to clarify business question in every situation.", "Working and researching are not identical. In business, top people never stop expecting a Data Scientist to become a wise man who knows the answer for all of their questions. Therefore, digging the problem is our job and how to do that is our responsibility.", "It must be very familiar with you when a sales manager asks you \u201cI want to know why sales declined?\u201d or a marketing director demands \u201cHow to increase the efficiency of the promotion activity for brand A on our website?\u201d", "When you hear these questions, how do you imagine the approach or the answer for them? Will you be indeterminate and keep asking yourself \u201cIs that they want me to do this\u2026\u201d or \u201cI think they want to know that\u2026\u201d? And if you deliver the result based on this understanding, how much confidence you have on your delivery?", "In reality, if you keep it this way, the one and only response you will get from them is:", "\u201cThis is not what I need\u201d", "OMG! How terrible it is when you spent so much effort into this, but no one values it.", "This is because you did not truly understand problem so that you did not touch the right pain point!", "For example, the director wants to know way to improve his marketing activity efficacy, so what does Efficacy mean here? What kind of activity he points to? What are the real pain points? If these concerns are plainly clarified, the request will be interpreted as \u201cHow to optimize the budget spending on online promotion in order to increase the purchase rate and new customers vs last year\u201d. This will end up with increasing efficacy.", "One of the common advises is to ask \u201cWhy\u201d in order to dig into the real problems. However, this solution is not applicable all times because the business partners might not know why for all of your questions.", "This part is to place the methodology for the analysis.", "This step requires a broad knowledge on either statistical models or machine learning approaches. In some companies, especially non-tech savvy, a data scientist is in charge of both analytics and data science work stream.", "With a mixed role of Analytics and Data Science, the approaches for the problem will also diversified with various concepts and models. For example: Linear Regression cannot be used to segment customers or Descriptive analysis cannot predict customer churn.", "At first, choosing methodology seems to be effortless but indeed always drives you crazy. If the Sales Director asked Data Science team to forecast the sales for next year based on the amount of budget spending while putting online appearance as company\u2019s focus, then which approach/model should be used? If the business wanted the forecast based on the market movement with the outlook of maintaining the current company\u2019s leadership position, which approach is correct?", "After identifying the business questions and the approach above, set up data requirement and extract the appropriate data from the data warehouse are the next thing.", "Data selection sounds to be straightforward but indeed complicated. To solve the business questions, which kind of data is in need of. For example, is it necessary to have customer\u2019s birthday information for the task of predicting churn probability?", "Ingest sufficient data will save you tons of effort afterward. Bear in mind the unspoken truth: Garbage in is Garbage out.", "1. The unavailability of data2. The bias of training data", "This problem is very common globally in which data is unable to capture at the moment of collection due to the limitation of current digital connection. For instance, it is merely impossible to acquire the time spent in cooking at home.", "As a common sense, when the data is nonexistent, you will instantly think of way to get the data. However, you have to consider the consequences of unavailability data including cost, time, resources and if the data is indeed not too important to your model, all the effort you put into it will be down the drain.", "Therefore, the solution for this case is to defer inaccessible data at the moment and in case the model requires this data for a better result, you will have more resources and confident to invest in obtaining it in the future.", "What you can do more if you need more data:", "This problem is serious especially when the training set gets bias from the beginning. As the result, the model will learnt accordingly to that bias and returns inaccuracy prediction when comparing to the real world.", "One of the most famous flaws of bias in data is the Amazon recruiting AI tool that showed bias against women. The tool reviewed candidate\u2019s resumes in order to pick the top talents within them. The tool showed an obvious bias against women because its training data is not gender-neutral from the beginning.", "Therefore, at first hand, be careful with data and its natural distribution are critical responsibility of every Data Scientist.", "What you can do more to eliminate the bias:", "After getting all the data you need, the next step is thing that a Data scientist usually does:", "The order can be flexible and this is the standard progress that I usually do in my project and my job. Sometimes, after tuning and the accuracy does not meet my expectation, I will to go back to the feature engineering step to find other way to deal with features.", "These are the key bottlenecks beside the technical skills that I want to head up for Data Scientist who want to become more than just a Data insight extractor.", "Your home for data science.
