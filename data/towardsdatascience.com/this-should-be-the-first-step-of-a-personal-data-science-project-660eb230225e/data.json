As the number of projects you have grows, there are important steps you need to take to make sure these projects do not conflict with each other.", "Imagine you are working on two projects. The first one is something you cloned from a GitHub repo. It uses TensorFlow 1.0, pandas 0.17, and Python 3.5. You install these and work on your project, everything goes smoothly.", "You now begin your second project. This one uses TensorFlow 2.0, pandas 1.0, and Python 3.7. The issue here is that if you install all of this software it will brake your previous project that depends on the older versions.", "What you need is a virtual environment. A virtual environment will help you isolate the software of your projects so that your work in one environment does not impact your work in another environment. Creating a virtual environment should happen at the beginning of most data science projects. Luckily, this is very easy to do with Anaconda. If you haven\u2019t installed Anaconda already, I would recommend doing so now, since it is one of the most popular data science platforms and it supports VS Code, RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, and Spyder. I will walk you through creating and managing virtual environments through the Anaconda interface and through the command line.", "Once you open Anaconda this is the main screen you should see.", "Here we see the applications that come with Anaconda, which include some of the popular IDEs for data science. For each virtual environment you make, you will need to install these applications in order to use them. Once installed the button underneath will change from \u201cInstall\u201d in green to \u201cLaunch\u201d in blue.", "By default, you are working in an environment called base. Above the applications you will notice something that says \u201cApplications on\u201d followed by a drop down menu. From this drop down menu you are able to select any environment you\u2019ve made. For now you should only have base environment.", "Next click on the Environments in the left pane of the navigator.", "Here we see a list of environments, mine just has base for now. At the bottom of the list we have 4 options available to us.", "In the pane on the right we can see all the packages we have installed on the current environment and install new ones by clicking the box next to the package\u2019s name.", "Now let\u2019s create a new environment by clicking the \u201cCreate\u201d button under your environment list. Now we can choose the name of our environment, as well as the version of python and R you want to use. In my case I wanted to use python 3.7 and named my environment First_Environment.", "Now I can search for and install any package for this environment from the pane on the right. Remember whatever you install for this environment is only installed on this environment. You\u2019ll need to install packages again for new environments.", "I\u2019d recommend making an environment for almost every project you make and naming the environment after that project.", "Being able to use the command line is a valuable skill, even if you\u2019re not managing virtual environments. To access the command line on Windows search for the \u201cCommand Prompt\u201d application, on a Mac search for the \u201cTerminal\u201d application.", "I begin by typing in \u201cls\u201d into the terminal (\u201cdir\u201d on Windows) and pressing return. This gives me a list of the files and directories in the current folder you are in, this is called the working directory. Directory is just another word for folder.", "Next, I want to change directories with the \u201ccd\u201d command. Typing \u201ccd Documents\u201d would take me into the documents directory. From there I can make a new directory with the \u201cmkdir\u201d command. I made a folder called \u201cProjectB\u201d to store our new project. You should move into this directory with cd. The \u201cpwd\u201d command will print the working directory (the folder you are in). This is useful for navigating through your file system.", "To create an environment named \u201cEnvironmentB\u201d with python version 3.7 you need to type the following into the command line.", "Now to use this environment you need to type \u201csource activate EnvironmentB\u201d or simply \u201cactivate EnvironmentB\u201d if you\u2019re on Windows.", "You will notice that after activating this environment, the environment\u2019s name in parenthesis next to the command prompt has changed. This is useful to see what environment you\u2019re in. Now if you need to install an application such as jupyter, you can do that with \u201cconda install\u201d followed by the package name.", "To use jupyter now, just run jupyter-notebook. Next to install a package run pip, which will install the package for only the active environment. Using the package name followed by == to get a specific version.", "Next, \u201cconda list\u201d can give you a list of all packages you have installed on your current environment.", "Finally, \u201cconda env list\u201d gives you a list of your environments.", "All the information before this is important for organizing your work. Being able to import and export an environment is important for organizing teamwork. To save your environment use \u201cconda list\u201d but have the output saved into a txt file.", "This txt file can be shared and used to copy your environment on someone else\u2019s machine. This goes a long way in creating reproducible work.", "This concludes the basics of using virtual environments. Hopefully, this will prevent your projects from colliding with each other, and it will prevent the phrase \u201cIt works on my machine\u201d from being used around your office.", "Your home for data science.
