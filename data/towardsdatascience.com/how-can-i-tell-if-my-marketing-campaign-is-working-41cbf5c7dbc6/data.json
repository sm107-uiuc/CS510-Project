That\u2019s perhaps not how you like to report it upstairs, but how confident are you that your campaign really led to that increase in revenue?", "In this article, we\u2019ll take a brief look at a technique that might help you put some numbers behind your confidence in those statements: Bayesian structural time series analysis.", "If your company has a great deal \u2014 perhaps 25% off in January \u2014 you may well have some budget for a marketing campaign to promote that. What good is the deal if you don\u2019t tell people about it?", "The deal runs, you spend budget on radio and paid search and, sure enough, your revenue grows. But what effect did your marketing activity play? Did it drive sales, or revenue grow simply because the deal was good?", "If you spend a bit of time on the internet, you may be familiar with Spurious Correlations: a site that serves to remind us that correlation does not always mean causation. Just because our paid search spend went up doesn\u2019t mean that it led to that increase in revenue we observed.", "For more on the space where business meets data science and analytics, follow Chris on Twitter.", "Sometimes, it\u2019s not always possible to simply say \u201clet\u2019s switch off the campaigns for a few days, turn them back on, and look at the effect on revenue\u201d. If revenue looks good and marketing spend is in budget, it\u2019s a brave person who decides they want to investigate that further.", "So, if you can\u2019t perform interventional experiments and randomised controlled trials, is there a way you can get a feel for whether your marketing campaigns are effective? Well, yes, there is, and the CausalImpact package for R makes it quite straightforward.", "Regression is a very useful tool for marketers. So useful is it that, not only have I written about it here, I\u2019ve written about it here as well. And here. Oh, and here too; I\u2019m fairly convinced I\u2019ll write about it again.", "Regression is a great tool: it\u2019s incredibly straight-forward to perform, relatively straight-forward to perform properly, and it gives you results that are easy to interpret, which means results that are easy to report on and action.", "Interrupted time series analysis (ITS) is a useful extension of simple regression. Fundamentally, what it examines is whether or not an activity had an effect on your variable of interest. The output variable is followed over time, and you encode when your intervention was being performed as another variable. A great introduction to ITS can be found here.", "However, when it comes to seasonal trends or other confounding issues in the data, a straightforward dummy variable might not be sufficient, and the analysis can become increasingly complex, requiring further transformation to include some of the additional trends. Enter Bayesian structural time series.", "This is not an article that aims to discuss Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) modelling in detail. If you\u2019re interested in what\u2019s going on behind the scenes, you can start here, and head on down the prior and posterior rabbit holes.", "For now, we just need to consider BSTS as a method that looks at a historical time series and builds a prediction of its future course, allowing us to compare what actually happened following our intervention.", "The statistics might not be the most straightforward, but the rather magical CausalImpact package for R by Kay Broderson and Alan Hauser makes it easy. You can read the paper here, or head straight to the documentation, but hopefully this article covers the principle so you can decide if it\u2019s right for you.", "It would be easy to use an example of the effect of a PPC campaign on website visits, or the addition of a new marketing channel to revenue, but where would the fun be in that? If you\u2019ve read this far, I assume you have your own questions and data to work on, so all we need to do is introduce the concept with a worked example.", "And what better example than to use Buffy the Vampire Slayer?", "If you\u2019re of a certain age (like me) Buffy will be iconic. But \u2014 I\u2019m sure everyone is asking \u2014 did the success of BTVS lead to an increase in girls born in the US being named Anya? Let\u2019s use BSTS models and causal inference to find out\u2026", "The code to accompany this article is on GitHub, so I\u2019ll spare the details here, skipping to the pertinent pieces of interest.", "Using the babynames package in R, we have access to the number of children registered with a particular name each year. We\u2019re interested in how the number of children called Anya changed after the character was introduced in 1998. Let\u2019s take a quick look at that:", "Looks like there\u2019s a spike (no Buffy-related pun intended) around 1980, but things really seem to kick off in the late nineties and into the 21st century. This first plot looks convincing, but is this pattern significantly different to how we would have expected it to look had Buffy not graced our screens?", "We can investigate that using the CausalImpact package. To do this, we specify intervention start and stop dates (we\u2019ll use the year that Anya was introduced and the year the series finished), and compare this to some names that shouldn\u2019t be affected by the intervention.", "In this case, we will use ten randomly selected common girls\u2019 names that aren\u2019t lead characters in Buffy, but this is a decision that takes some thought. If you\u2019re looking at the effect of paid search spend on revenue, what do you use as your controls?", "While the CausalImpact function doesn\u2019t require them, they are useful, so it\u2019s worth taking the time to think about what you could use. You might think organic sessions might work, but do your organic clicks go up following increased PPC spend as customers get brand exposure, then search for your brand later?", "In our case, we have built an xts time series of our data, with Anya, as the first column, being our variable of interest, and the following names being those which the algorithm will use for its calculations.", "Using these data, CausalImpact will plot an output that shows the predicted number of girls called Anya in each year in a dashed line (confidence intervals shaded in blue) and the observed number of babies called Anya as a solid line. The period of intervention is shown as vertical dashed lines.", "In our case, we can see that the solid line is above not only the dashed line, but also the confidence interval. Calling summary on the output gives us this:", "Telling us that we would expect, on average, 285 girls each year to be called Anya, but we observed 489. Our upper 95% confidence interval is 400, so, with our observed 489 being above that, we have a p value of 0.00201 that the uplift of girls being called Anya is due to chance.", "Helpfully, CausalImpact includes a useful argument to summary() that we can include to give us a written report:", "Of course, this article is a quick 5 minute introduction to marketing cause and effect attribution using Bayesian structural time series models using the CausalImpact package for R.", "The R package has more strings to its bow than I\u2019ve discussed here, so it is well worth reading the paper and the documentation, as well as reading some of the other examples available online.", "However, for many marketers who want to understand whether they are spending their money in the right places, this package is a great place to start, without requiring extensive knowledge of time series analysis and Bayesian statistics.", "Indeed, I would say that the most challenging aspect to its use is not the mathematics, the syntax or the choice of function arguments, but the selection of appropriate time series that are unlikely to be affected by the intervention under study.", "Additionally, chances are that you perform a range of marketing campaigns concurrently, across different media, different demographics and different geographies. This will, of course, make your data analysis a bit more involved than the simple example given here. However, while the creation of an appropriate dataset may present more challenges, the following analysis can be quite straightforward.", "As a data-driven marketer myself, a huge thanks to the folks at Google who developed this, and now maintain this very useful R package. If you want to explore this technique and package in more detail, I recommend reading the paper and playing about with the package to get a feel for the additional options using an easy dataset like this one. There\u2019s still plenty of work to be done here, I haven\u2019t even looked at Willow or Oz\u2026", "For further introductions into how you can quickly use data science tools in your business analytics, follow Chris on Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
