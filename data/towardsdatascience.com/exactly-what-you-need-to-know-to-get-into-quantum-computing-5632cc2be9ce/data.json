Quantum computing first appeared in the 1980s. However, there are multiple reasons why the traction around this technology is rasing at the moment.", "In recent years, quantum computing has been moving from just a pure theory into being something practical. Now, there are actual quantum computers built that you can run simple programs on.", "Moreover, there has been much effort being put by different companies to increase quantum knowledge among the interested.", "Today, we live in an era of technology; it\u2019s all around us. As data scientists, we are faced with increasing amounts of data every day. This increase in the data to be processed, analyzed, and cleaned, opens up the door to how quantum technology can assist in transforming the field of data science and many other fields.", "The problem now is, whenever a person in quantum computing asks another about why they won\u2019t consider joining the filed, the answer is usually one of two things:", "In this article, I want to talk with you as a person who recently joined the field a little over two years ago. I want to show you that most concerns keeping you away from dipping your toes in the field of quantum computing are not really accurate.", "I want to show exactly what you need to get into quantum computing. And I want to propose to you that getting into quantum computing is no more difficult than getting into data science or any other technological field.", "So, what do you really need to know to start with quantum computing?", "I will try to layout the knowledge you may/may not need to enter quantum computing. Whether you will or not will depend on what exactly you want to do in the field.", "For example, if you\u2019re already a programmer or a data scientist and you would like to explore how quantum techniques can transform your work, you probably won\u2019t need to know much physics or mechanics to get where you won't go.", "On the other hand, if you want to get into the construction of qubits and how they work, you will need more physics/ mechanics than programming and math knowledge.", "To get started with quantum, you will probably need to know some programming basics. Although there are currently some programming languages that are completely designed to program quantum computers, you don\u2019t need to learn such languages when you get into the field.", "One of the most used programming languages used to program actual quantum machines today is Python.", "So, if you want to give programming a quantum machine a try, I would suggest you start with IBM\u2019s open-source toolkit Qiskit.", "Using Qiskit will not only allow you to program an actual IBM quantum machine but will help you learn many quantum concepts hassle-free. Once you are comfortable with quantum concepts, you can try and learn a quantum programming language.", "Math, probably the first thing that might drive someone away from getting into quantum computing. Well, I will not lie to you; there is some math involved in quantum computing.", "I would also argue that math is involved in all other technical fields, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing.", "In fact, some of these data science fields contain more complex math than quantum computing! I know that doesn't sound real, but it is.", "The basic maths that allows quantum computing to perform its magic is Linear Algebra. Everything in quantum computing, from the representation of qubits and gates to circuits' functionality, can be described using various forms of Linear Algebra.", "Another math field that is really involved in quantum computing is the basics of probability theory.", "That\u2019s it. Linear algebra and probability theory. Two fields involved in all sub-fields of data science and most of the current technology fields.", "That\u2019s not to say that things will not get complex as you advance in the field, but isn\u2019t that the case in all fields?", "The inner functionality of quantum computing, such as entanglement and quantum superposition, are pure physical phenomenons. They have some physics laws that control and explain why they happen.", "However, the inner functionalities of classical computers are the same thing. You don\u2019t need to know exactly how your computer's hardware works to create great things using it. You only need to know how to use it.", "This same logic applies to quantum computing. To be a quantum software developer, you only need to know how a quantum computer works and then use that to build your own applications.", "You will need to really get into the physics and mechanics of how a quantum computer works if you intend to work or get involved with building and constructing quantum computing hardware.", "Which is also the case if you want to build a classical processor or GPU. You\u2019ll need to get deep into the physics that allows this hardware to perform correctly in both cases.", "Curiosity \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 is the most important mindset you need to have to get into quantum computing. And I know curiosity is not a piece of knowledge, but it is crucial to mention this article's sake.", "I got into quantum computing because I was curious about how quantum computing can make our current technologies better. How can it take something very advanced and make it even more advanced?", "I was curious to learn more about quantum computing because, at first, it sounds like sci-fi and not something that can actually be developed.", "Most of my colleagues had the same mindset when they got into the field. As humans, we are always drawn to what makes our minds wander and go free with imagination. It intrigues us when things work in a way different than what we are used to.", "This curiosity is what led to all scientific and technological advancements we have today, and it will be what causes the creation of many advances to come.", "Quantum computer is no different than any other technological fields. It just has a bad reputation because, at some point in time, that word quantum got linked to complex. So, now every time anyone mentions quantum, the first thing that pops into your mind \u2014 and until recently, mine \u2014 is \u201coh, that must be very complex!\u201d.", "What I would like to leave with are two things. First, if you ever decide to approach quantum computing, do it with the same mindset, you do any other field. All fields have complex topics; they all have a learning curve, some steeper than others. Nevertheless, they all do.", "Second, unleash your curiosity; let it lead you to explore and experiment with new fields and aspects. I can assure you that if you have the curiosity to get into quantum computing, you have the intelligence to do so.", "You\u2019re smart enough to get into any field you want, not just quantum. So, don\u2019t let the word quantum intimidate you or stop you from jumping into this mysterious realm. I am here to tell you that now is the best time to start doing so.", "Your home for data science.
