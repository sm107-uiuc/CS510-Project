Atom-based IDE for Julia | by Emma Boudreau | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Juno Makes Writing Julia Awesome", "description": "Un less you\u2019ve been living under a rock, or don\u2019t program computers at all, you\u2019ve very likely heard of Atom. Atom is a simple, extendable, and beautiful open-source text editor available on Linux\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Un less you\u2019ve been living under a rock, or don\u2019t program computers at all, you\u2019ve very likely heard of Atom. Atom is a simple, extendable, and beautiful open-source text editor available on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. It should be noted that Atom by itself is not an Integrated Development Environment, but merely just a text editor.", "Atom is a great text editor for me because it is modern, it looks good, and it\u2019s highly extendable and tweak-able. Atom comes with all the tools you need to apply themes, extensions, and syntax highlighting for alternate languages all built into their UI and served from their extensions repositories developed by free and open-source developers. In methodology, this is very similar to the way that Linux is distributed, so it genuinely is right up my alley. Atom is highly capable alongside a terminal window for all languages without any extensions, but often installing extensions will give syntax highlighting. In the case of Juno, however, we are offered a whole lot more than just simple syntax highlighting.", "Julia is a high-level, multi-paradigm statistical language. Julia is also open-source, and hosts a plethora of advantages over other statistical languages like R. Though Julia is for the most part functional, like Lisp it can very much be used for generalized purposes. Julia is a relatively quick language for having such high-level syntax. Speeds are usually a little slower, but in some cases can actually surpass C. Of course, this is a very rare scenario, and this observation has many variables as it was tested in a Jupyter kernel using IPython magic timers, but even being close to the speed of C puts Julia at an advantage to R and Python. Additionally, Julia has excellent floating point accuracy, which puts Julia ahead of Scala as well.", "Julia can be your \u201c Big Data\u201d Language", "The final piece of the Atom + Julia puzzle is Juno. Juno transforms Atom, a simple text editor into a fully-featured IDE for Julia, which is really awesome! Juno carries with it a lot of features that make Julia the most enjoyable language I write inside of the Atom.", "Juno has something many other extensions don\u2019t have:", "You can access Julia\u2019s Read Evaluate Print Loop (REPL) through Atom, making it convenient to do includes as well as compile your program. With the addition of Julia GTK, Julia becomes super powerful even for regular software development.", "Not only can you process Julia through your regular REPL, but you can also start remote processes that interface with Julia. This is an awesome feature because it makes Atom for Julia into a modern IDE, rather than just a simple IDE with an output window.", "Juno also carries with it a fully automated formatting tool which is entirely accessible through the menu-bar inside of Atom. This is useful because it creates a consistent code-style which all Julia users can interface with and read but still allows you to initially write Julia in your own style.", "Another feature I really like out of Juno is the ability to run blocks of Julia. This can make the experience highly interactive in combination with the REPL, making the Julia programming experience feel more like working inside of a notebook.", "The Juno settings are surprisingly inclusive. From the settings menu, you can adjust paths, thread count, and Julia boot mode. Julia boot mode is a concept where you can have your IDE set up a separate run-time depending on whether you are working with remote Julia, an integrated or external terminal, and even a cycle mode to keep all three Julia processes running at all times in order to speed things up inside the IDE. Another cool thing featured is optimization level, although optimization is spelled", "The optimization allows you to choose, whether permanently or temporarily how fast you want the compilation to be, and how fast you want your code to be. This, of course, is also super useful, although I don\u2019t use it much as I don\u2019t typically run into performance problems \u2014 at all \u2014 when I work in Julia. The part of Julia that performs the worst is stale cache file recompiling, which:", "While it does make the server boot time a little slow with Genie, typically \u201c a little slow\u201d is only about a minute.", "Juno also allows you to instantly open any of your Pkg-installed packages inside of a new Window, making tweaking your packages to your liking a real breeze. The only thing I would have changed about that particular feature is to make virtual environments easier to manage without the REPL, and likely in relation to this feature. But that isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s hard to activate a virtual environment from the REPL in the first place. Activating an environment with Pkg takes only 3 commands, including ] and initializing Julia.", "Alternatively, you could also just do", "inside of the REPL in the bottom of Atom.", "Another cool feature that comes with Juno is the ability to quickly lookup documentation from within the Atom UI. This is of course nothing new, as Julia does a really great job of handling documentation in general. For most packages, using the ?() function will print out the documentation for said package \u2014 making going to the documentation website a thing for a different language to deal with.", "I really love and appreciate all of the hard work that went into Juno for Atom. I use Atom as my text editor on a day-to-day basis along with Gedit and Nano, and to have this much attention to my favorite language in a text editor that I actually use is really great. I\u2019m also really glad that they decided to go with supporting Julia on Atom, rather than building their own IDE. Which not only would\u2019ve required more resources, but also a new learning experience in terms of hotkeys and settings, a new UI to deal with, and the additional disk-space of the recycled text-editing application. Overall, I\u2019m really happy with how Juno turned out, and I\u2019m especially happy with how easy it makes Julia development!", "Your home for data science.
