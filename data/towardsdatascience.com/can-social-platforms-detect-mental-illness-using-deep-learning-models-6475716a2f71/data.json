You\u2019ve been feeling lethargic, and generally not in the mood to do anything but complain for the past few months. You write a post on Facebook to your friends venting about life once more. Suddenly, a Facebook notification pops up on your phone, recommending you to seek medical advice with a nearby therapist who specializes in Depression and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, offering a free consultation.", "This world could be one that we live in rather soon, where every social media post you upload is pre-screened to check in on your mental health: scientifically proven models and algorithms that can predict whether you are at risk of suffering from a mental illness. Is this a world that you think is possible? Would this be a world you\u2019d like to live in?", "The importance of mental health cannot be understated. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among teenagers in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A separate CDC study also found that teen suicide jumped 56% from 2007 to 2017- this rise coincides with the launch and growth in adoption of many social media platforms that we know and love today.", "As modern-day vulnerability and transparency become more common, social media users are increasingly sharing detailed feelings or emotional states in their posts. These millions of posts are being used for capitalist purposes such as online advertising, but they could equally be used for helping the health of its users.", "A recent study conducted by Kim, Lee, Park and Han (Kim et al., 2020), researchers from Sungkyunkwan University in Korea and Carnegie Mellon University, demonstrated a deep learning model that can identify a person\u2019s mental state based on their posted information. This research extends previous studies by Gkotsis et al. (2014) that used Deep Learning models to recognize mental illness-related posts for classification purposes automatically.", "By analyzing and learning posting information written by users, the proposed model by Kim et al. (2020) could accurately identify whether a user\u2019s post belongs to a specific mental disorder, including depression, anxiety, bipolar, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and autism. The model provides a foundation for detecting whether a user, based on their post, is at risk of suffering from a mental disorder.", "The research prompts us to ask fundamental questions to our social platforms of choice:", "Before attempting to answer these, let\u2019s take a closer look at the research.", "There are various posts already that cover the basics of Deep Learning. If you want a short primer on it, I recommend reading this excellent medium post by Radu Raicea. I learned a lot from it, and I\u2019m sure those that gave the 40K+ claps also agree!", "In short, Deep Learning is a machine learning method that allows us to train an Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict outputs, given a set of inputs.", "More specifically, the Deep Learning method uses a Neural Network to imitate animal intelligence by creating a neural network of data and processing actions. There are three layers of neurons for neural network processing: Input Layer, Hidden Layer(s), Output Layer.", "Inputs within a Deep Learning method can be either:", "Deep Learning combines the best of both worlds by training the AI, based on both Supervised and Unsupervised data. However, enormous datasets and computational power are needed for the models to come up with meaningful results and predictions because of the multiple hidden layers of calculations required in between.", "Kim et al. (2020) had one key research question to address:", "Research question: Can we identify whether a user\u2019s post belongs to mental illnesses on social media?", "They collected users\u2019 posts from Reddit, a popular social media that includes numerous mental-health-related communities (or so-called \u2018subreddits\u2019), such as r/depression, r/bipolar, and r/schizophrenia.", "Their method is detailed in-depth in their research paper, but in short, they employed the following:", "Kim et al. (2020) collected post data from the following six mental-health-related subreddits, each of which is reported to be associated with a specific disorder: r/depression, r/Anxiety, r/bipolar, r/BPD, r/schizophrenia, and r/autism", "Also, they further collected post data from r/mentalhealth, to analyze posts with general mental health information. From each subreddit, they collected all the user IDs who had at least one post related to mental health.", "Data cleansing and formatting were required so that the model could process the data effectively, such as tokenizing (splitting sentences into unique words) users\u2019 posts and filtering out frequently employed words (stop words). After this process, they were able to get 488,472 posts across 228,060 users for analysis.", "Create six binary classification models, each of which categorizes a user\u2019s specific post into one of the following subreddits: r/depression, r/Anxiety, r/bipolar, r/BPD, r/schizophrenia, and r/autism.", "Kim et al. (2020) found that a prior study (Gkotsis, 2017) trained a model with the posts of users who have multiple symptoms, with results suffering from noisy data. By developing six independent models, each of which using data where users suffer from only one particular mental problem, they were able to identify a user\u2019s potential mental state accurately.", "This part is rather complicated, so if you\u2019re interested in the inner workings, I recommend you dive directly into Kim et al. (2020)\u2019s research. For the data science techies out there who want to know what principles were applied to the model, here are the main headlines:", "Note that the F1-Score ranges from 0 to 1 \u2014 the closer it is to 1 (perfect) the more precise your classifier is (i.e., how many instances it classifies correctly), and the more robust the model predictions are.", "All in all, the model Kim et al. (2020) proposed shows a fair amount of promise in detecting potential users who may have psychological disorders.", "Some limitations of the study did exist around class imbalance, the influence of socio-demographic and regional differences to data, and the fact that the data is from Reddit, which may have users more inclined to express their emotions relative to other social networks. The researchers acknowledged they would re-apply the model to other social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to validate the model further.", "Data science is showing that we can predict when a user is at risk of suffering from a mental illness. But we now face a crossroads on ethics and the use of data for detecting and treating mental health conditions. Let\u2019s revisit our exam questions at the beginning of this story:", "As discussed above, an accurate Deep Learning Model is technically feasible, and with the right amount of data, a powerful prediction engine could be created. The research by Kim et al. (2020) and Gkotsis et al. (2017) showed great potential but was limited to Reddit data. Still, the models could be validated and extended to other social platform data sources, including:", "The data referred to above must be used in a way that protects the privacy of the users, but more on this later.", "Advocates for \u201cyes\u201d would probably say that these platforms should monitor our posts, so long as the user provides consent to the platform to conduct health checks along the way in an ethical non-abusive manner. After all, many users sign terms and conditions for the use of their data for capitalist marketing purposes, so using data to help save someone\u2019s life (e.g. in the case of identifying someone in severe depression at risk of suicide) seems like a good social outcome.", "Advocates for \u201cno\u201d would probably point to data privacy laws, and risks in having the data and insights further re-sold to advertisers to then sell private health solutions for mental health problems. The risk of this is no better demonstrated Cambridge Analytica \u2014 a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign \u2014 to influence user behaviour as well as their political views during that time. That said, Facebook has gone a long way to rebuilding their reputation and data misuse, discussed later.", "There are some responsibilities that social media platforms should probably pay attention to, including:", "From a product perspective, I can see various features being useful, but they hinge upon different hypotheses needing to be validated:", "Whatever the intervention is, a great deal of experimentation and safe control testing is needed to ensure the efficacy of any mental health intervention measures.", "I\u2019m keen to know whether you think social media platforms do indeed have a role to play in preventing mental health issues from occurring. When such problems do arise, I advocate for a more active role by the platforms in treating or helping the user understand what resources they have at their disposal to help themselves.", "Do you have any ideas on what interventions (perhaps features) could be delivered to prevent or treat mental health illnesses?
