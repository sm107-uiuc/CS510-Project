Many engineers truly believe that their very customized approach, built to fit the exact business case is a better idea than taking a solution from the shelf and adjusting it to the particular case.", "Cloud providers are rapidly developing ML services, treading the same path that Big Data services did before them. Ten years ago, Big Data was a pricey, easily-scalable and fault-tolerant exotic fruit. Now it\u2019s standard. The same goes for open-source instruments. In 99% of cases, you don\u2019t need to invent a new library or a database because most probably you\u2019ll find something that works on the market.", "Every technical task should bring business value. If you do research, you should always be able to provide an example of a case you\u2019re working on in real life. Usually, if you cannot quantify such a case, there\u2019s no need to spend time on it.", "ROI calculation methodology may need to be recalibrated. Compared to classical programming, machine learning is a probabilistic approach that never provides you with 100% accuracy, so you should always evaluate if increasing accuracy by 2, 5, 10, or 20 % worth of the investment made.", "The good news is that data science projects are very close to the business, so you should have a great feeling of return.", "Let\u2019s say you have hundreds of people whose work is to extract data from the documents, then adding 5% to the accuracy of the results of automated extraction may mean millions of dollars per year. But if adding 1% to accuracy costs tons of money, a popular case in computer vision projects, maybe there are more valuable tasks and we still can rely on a human operator.", "Often, business people set the question in a way: \u201cWe have tons of data, how can we make sense out of it? Can you help us find insights?\u201d", "Never start working on this without a clear hypothesis, otherwise, it\u2019s looking for a needle in a bundle. Think of machine learning as of a supermind that does one thing well \u2014 automates what you cannot handle manually due to lack of computation power. If you cannot answer what you\u2019re looking for, most probably you\u2019re doing some random things.", "Always start with the questions like:", "Integration itself is not a big deal. But be sure to factor in human perception. If the company has a rule-based system, that makes decisions and it\u2019s clear how it works, a new solution that uses ML-techniques can look like a black box to stakeholders. It\u2019s therefore vital to have a clear migration plan that addresses potential risks.", "We worked with a business travel company, which, among other things, was purchasing airplane tickets for its clients. Booking took 17 hours at which time the price could fluctuate. Fluctuation can depend on many factors: passenger flow, day of the week, time of the day, season, major sport or cultural events, weather, etc. The goal was to prove that analyzing historical data, with the help of ML, prices could be lowered to several percent on top of the existing reductions being produced by an old but proven rule-based system.", "But no one wants to rely on a black box having a turnover of one billion dollars. A migration plan was elaborated: first an ML-based predictor was set up in parallel with the production system, followed by the processing of 10% of purchases in production, then 30%, constantly measuring relative performance. When the system is proven in production, at least 10% of the tickets will still need to be purchased via the old rule-based algorithm to get the latest updates of the sales engine to avoid overfitting (the state of the ML system when it thinks it knows everything about the world around).", "It\u2019s very important to demonstrate to all stakeholders that the ML process is very gradual and reversible in case of failure.", "Every new version of your ML model is an experiment. It may be successful or not, that\u2019s why you should always have a working CI/CD pipeline to be able to reverse to an older version.", "However, you should also not forget about proper versioning of the data, the model parameters, and the results of experiments. There are specific tools to help here, such as DVC \u2014 a version control system for ML.", "It\u2019s easy to get caught by the routine of research when you start looking into one problem, then find another one and then you find yourself in a completely different place, not really important for the product.", "Stay focused on your research, don\u2019t get distracted, remember why you started and what the main goal is.", "However, if you see a low-hanging fruit that may be valuable for the user \u2014 go get it! This is especially likely to happen when you conduct visualizations to represent the insights found in data. Formally, it might not be critical at the time, but you never know what could be valuable for the business at some point.", "Remember how great it is to receive minor but lovely updates in your favorite apps.", "There\u2019s always a complicated and accurate way of solving problems with a lot of data wrangling, feature engineering, meaning days of manual routine. But can you keep it simple bringing 80% of the result with 20% of efforts?", "We have learned to apply lateral thinking on top of data. In one case, we needed to classify processes by business units in a huge chemical company. We found a workaround alternative to manual input by using publicly-available NLP models, converting the process and department phrases to vectors and finding the closest pairs.", "Once we needed to sort 20 years-worth of marketing materials containing Mastercard logos to find which materials are still actual. Tens of thousands of documents. At some point, we realized that the last logo change for Mastercard happened in 2016. Two hours to label and train the cloud-based image recognition service, and voila \u2014 we had only fresh documents left.", "We always lack data or expertise in data science projects, so creativity is an essential asset for building a working solution.", "New technology such as ML comes with a set of challenges not thrown up by more established tech. One of the main issues with technology as new as ML is ensuring that proposed solutions don\u2019t end up frustrating the management because of the inevitable uncertainty it causes.", "ML and data science are a black box for the majority of people around, that\u2019s why expectation management is more important than it\u2019s ever been. Don\u2019t forget to educate people, quantify the results of research to compare it with the goals, and think about the integration in advance both from the technical and the human point of view.", "And, where appropriate, a combination of AI, heuristic methods and manual routine is fine. When people start building an AI-based solution, there\u2019s often an intent to build something fully automated \u2014 an oracle with bells and whistles that can make recommendations with absolute certainty.", "You\u2019re lucky if this is possible, but don\u2019t forget that even if ML doesn\u2019t allow you to solve the task completely, it can be a lot of help in preparing the data required to make a decision. Taking the ultimate decision away from ML helps to avoid distrust from industry specialists, who usually prefer the final word to be a human one.", "What are your insights?
