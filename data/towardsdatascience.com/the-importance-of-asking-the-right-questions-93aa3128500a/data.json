We were taught in school to learn how to answer questions in exams, we were conditioned to go to work knowing that we need to have the answers and our society, by and large, focuses on finding the solutions rather than figuring out if we are asking the right questions. Just like most people who have been through the traditional education system and started working in a corporate job, I was trained to have the answers, I was taught that my contribution and value lie in my ability to solve problems by knowing the right answers. While I do think that problem solving and the ability to find the right answers is a valuable skill to have, I would like to shed some light on the importance of the skill that precedes it, the skill of asking the right questions.", "Questions and answers are by definition linked together but they are a very different skillset. Seeking answers is a process of elimination through research and experimentation, trying to piece together different information and narrow things down to a solution. But asking questions is a process of expansion through critical thinking and imagination. It is understandable why as a society we don\u2019t value the cost of asking the right questions because in some way the more questions we ask, the more work we need to do and the further away we are from finishing what we need to do. This creates a systemic problem that favours short term patches over long term solutions.", "This problem exists everywhere, but it is especially prominent in a solution-orientated field like data science and engineering, where the professions are built on top of solving difficult problems. Data scientists are prone to jumping right into solution mode before we even fully understand the problem because we think we have the answers. If there is a conversion problem, we can do personalised targeting. If there is a retention problem, we can build a churn prediction model. While those might all be valid solutions, they might just be addressing the symptoms and not the root cause.", "It\u2019s probably natural to think that a solution is a solution even if it only solves the symptoms. Especially in a world that favours immediate actions and quick fixes, we never seem to have the time to dig deeper. I am not going to argue that for every single issue that comes up, you need to deep dive into whether you are asking the right questions, but I will stand by the fact that if we are asking the right questions, more often than not, we won\u2019t be in situations fixing problems that shouldn\u2019t come up in the first place.", "In the context of data science, the cost often comes in two main ways, wasted resources and unintended consequences. The first one is relatively straight forward, if we don\u2019t ask the right questions, we end up wasting time and effort building a solution that is not fit for purpose. The second one is more nefarious because if we are optimising a system based on a wrong metric, we could be systemically worsening the situation. For example, if we treat a churn problem as an isolated incident and focus on improving retention without asking the question of why people are churning, we might miss problems that go back to customer acquisition, through to user experience and engagement before it becomes a churn problem.", "Every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets", "There is value in having the right answers for every question that comes up, but the cost of not asking the right questions is a bit more subtle and long term. If we always prioritise and value quick fixes, we are subconsciously encouraging problems to occur. We often recognise people who come in and fix the problems, but most of the time we don\u2019t recognise the people who asked the right questions when it comes to designing that system in the first place. So the real hidden cost of not asking the right questions is a society or an organisation that nurtures people who focus on the short term rather than the long term. We will never be able to escape from problems and the need of having answers, but what we want to strive for is the ability to prevent that from happening as much as possible by asking the right questions upfront.", "In business, people often turn towards technical resources with a technical problem. It makes sense right? However, what happens when we are sick? Let\u2019s say you feel pain and you go to the doctor and all you got was painkillers because that\u2019s your symptoms. You would feely a little short-changed because the doctor didn\u2019t diagnose you properly and try to understand why the pain exists in the first place. The difference here is our presumed knowledge, when we think we know what the problem is, we have a closed mind looking for a specific answer, but when we don\u2019t know what the problem is, we have an opened mind hoping others will help figure out the problem. Here are a few things that can help us combat the tendencies to jump into solutions before we even understand the question.", "Before we even get to ask the questions, we come to the table with a set of assumptions. Assumptions help us move forward quicker and provide the crucial context to the issues at hand and they are powerful. However, they are also dangerous as people often assume things that are not necessarily true and most of the people get to very different conclusions because they are basing their thinking off a different set of assumptions. Starting from facts and data is a good way to keep assumptions from being skewed, but we must learn to be as unbiased as possible during that process. Aligning assumptions with reality gets us to the actual starting point where a logical discussion can be had and the right questions can be asked.", "It is tempting to provide an answer to an immediate question because we know it but once we switch to solution mode, it is easy to get tunnel-visioned and lose track of what we are doing. So while it seems trivial, we should be asking ourselves why we are doing what we are doing every so often. It\u2019s important to keep an open mind and be honest with ourselves. There will be times when we invested weeks or even months into something only to realise that it shouldn\u2019t have been done in the first place. A timely critical assessment of why we are doing this can help bring us back on track and focus on the right questions.", "To tackle this issue long term, we need to set up our environment to incentivise diagnostics as much if not more than solutions. We will always be conditioned to focus on coming up with answers if we don\u2019t fundamentally change how we place value on good questions and good answers. While this might sound far fetched, it is something that we can all contribute towards. As tempting as it is to ask your colleagues or friends for a solution, ask them what they think the problem is and maybe we will gain a new perspective and reframe our situation differently.", "We face problems every day and those are great opportunities for us to practice asking the right questions. It is unintuitive and at times it might even feel frustrating to take a step back and think if we are asking the right questions. However, we must consider the consequences of not asking the right questions because at best we will be getting the right answers to the wrong questions and that should not an acceptable outcome for any of us.", "If you have enjoyed my content and share my view on the topic, sign up for more at https://jchoi.solutions/subscribe", "Your home for data science.
