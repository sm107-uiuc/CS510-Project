We all like the idea of being able to do something constructive with our time. I am so happy to be able to stay connected with my friends through this project and help them to up skill with data science.", "Even since we started just one week ago, the group has changed slightly. One person had to drop out because she has a brand new baby. It was a decision between having a shower every day and learning data science and rightfully the shower won \ud83d\ude03", "On the other hand since I published my first article in this series introducing how and why we will be learning data science while self-isolating, I had an amazing response from people. Several more of my friends asked if they could join in. So now we are a group of 8, all women learning tech skills together.", "I even had a few friends of friends asking if they could join, but I decided to just limit the group that I am working with personally to people that I actually know in person. Mostly because I didn\u2019t want the size of the group to get unmanageable with my other commitments. However, I welcome anyone and everyone to follow along with the lessons that I publish and try their hand at learning data science.", "Perhaps if you are one of those people that would like to learn, you could start up your own learning group with some of your friends. Then you will be able to help each other if you get stuck on any of the concepts and you will get the benefits of keeping each other on track. I would suggest putting a call out on your social media to see if there are any others that you know who are interested in learning with you. You never know, you might be surprised by the response you get. I know I was \ud83d\ude0a", "The first thing that I will teach the group is SQL. In this first lesson we will practice making tables and filling them with data. We will do this using the CREATE TABLE and INSERT INTO keywords. Don\u2019t worry if that doesn\u2019t all make sense yet, it will become clear throughout the lesson.", "If you are learning along with us, this is a great place to start. I will be aiming to publish our lessons weekly after we have completed them. So stay tuned!", "SQL is a language for accessing, storing and manipulating data in databases. It stands for Structured Query Language because you use it to query databases. Each SQL based language has its own little differences but have the same basic commands in common. The specifics of each language and how it is arranged is known as the syntax.", "When learning to program I think the main tip I can give people is to look for patterns in the code. Then play around with how you can modify those patterns to make the code do what you want it to do.", "When people think of data scientists, they often focus on the exciting work of machine learning. However, data scientists spend the majority of their time working to get the data they need into the format they need it in. So I think that it is important when learning about data science to start from the beginning and learn how to access data from a database.", "Many data science courses provide students with a file containing the data set that they need. In my opinion, this practice does the student a disservice. Without knowing how to retrieve the data that you want from a database, you would have to rely on data engineers to do it for you or else hope that the data set is already available in the format that you need. In my experience, that is rarely the case, especially if you are trying to use a subset of a big dataset.", "A database usually contains one or more tables. We give each table a name so that we can access the one that we want when we want to see the data within the table. You can read more about databases if you want, but for the purposes of learning SQL, we will just think of them as a collection of tables.", "A table contains data. It is used to organise the data so that it is easy to use. The data within a table is further organised into rows and columns. One way to picture a table is like a spreadsheet.", "Each row represents one record (or entry). For example, one record would contain a value for each column in the dataset, which would make up the row of the table. You can see below one record highlighted in the example table.", "Features of the dataset are stored in individual columns. For example, a column would contain a value for that feature for each record in the table. You can see one column highlighted in the table below. It is also important to note that each column contains data of a consistent datatype.", "A datatype is exactly what it sounds like, a type of data. There are lots of different datatypes that you can use in SQL but some of the most common ones are varchar, integer and float.", "varchar \u2014 a string of variable length. A string is a collection of characters that when strung together make text. A string can contain alphabet characters, numerical characters and spaces. Eg. \u201cthis is a string of 33 characters\u201d", "integer \u2014 an integer is a whole number with no decimal places. Therefore there is no fractions allowed in this data type. Eg. 6", "float \u2014 floating point number. Therefore fractions of numbers may be included in the form of a decimal point. Eg. 6.45", "When making tables you will need to specify the data type in each column. Hopefully when you see some examples this will make sense. You can look up a full range of the data types used in SQL but we will only be using varchar and integers in this lesson.", "A query in SQL is a statement that does something to a table. It asks a question of a table, hence the name query. It could be used to read record(s) from a table, insert record(s) into a table, filter a table, modify record(s) in a table, delete record(s) from a table and many other actions. Writing queries is what we are aiming to learn how to do.", "In SQL each query generally ends with a semicolon. This separates one query from the next.", "SQL is not case sensitive. I will be using caps for the SQL keywords to make them more obvious. This is fairly standard practice in many SQL style guides.", "A style guide is often used within companies or organisations to specify the style they would like to have used in all of their computer code. Each programming language would have its own style guide so that within the organisation the code would all look similar. It is also able to be easily interpreted by others within the team.", "Here is an example of the syntax of a query to create a table using SQL.", "First we have the CREATE TABLE statement. CREATE TABLE is a SQL keyword use to create a new table.", "The structure of that table is then put within the brackets that follow the CREATE TABLE statement. Within the brackets we put the name of each column and the datatype separated by commas. The query is then completed with a semicolon.", "Question 1: How many columns are in the table created by the example above?", "Here is an example of the syntax of a query to insert data into a table using SQL.", "First we have the INSERT INTO statement. INSERT INTO is a SQL keyword use to insert data into the named table. A comma separated list of column names of the named table is included within the first set of brackets.", "Then we have the VALUES to be inserted within the following sets of brackets after the keyword VALUES. Each record is a comma separated list within its own set of brackets.", "The query is then completed with a semicolon.", "Question 2: How many rows or records are inserted into the table using the above query?", "Note on datatypes: Back in the dark ages computer memory and disk space was expensive, so it was import to optimise the use of every bit (haha). The 255 in the brackets after the datatype is about specifying the character limit, which you could make smaller to conserve space. We wont worry about that too much now, other than to remember that you need to include it for varchar and integer datatypes but not for floats and that 255 is the maximum display size. If you want to read more about this you can check out this helpful resource on datatypes in SQL.", "Note on the data: This table contains data about my four friends who inspired me to write these posts about learning data science. Their names have been changed to protect their identity. They have been renamed based on the names of characters from the popular children\u2019s show Bluey.", "The Bluey aliases are from two episodes:", "Bluey\u2019s dad decided to rename Bluey and her sister Bingo as \u2018Dennis\u2019 and \u2018Sharalanda\u2019 in the episode called \u2018Teasing\u2019.", "Blue and Bingo pretend to be Grannies \u2018Janet\u2019 and \u2018Rita\u2019 in the episode \u2018Grannies\u2019.", "Just in case you were wondering \ud83d\ude1c Mum life!", "3. Click the build schema button", "4. In the right hand box put the query below", "SELECT and FROM are both SQL keywords that are fairly self explanatory. The * is used to indicate that you want everything from the table selected.", "5. You should see a table come up that contains all the data you have inserted:", "Exercise 1: Make your own table that contains 5 columns and 3 rows and includes at least one column that is an integer datatype.", "Ecercise 2: Make your own table that contains 2 columns and 7 rows and includes one column that is a float datatype and one column that is a varchar datatype.", "All of my friends grasped the concepts in this lesson quite easily. They completed all the exercises and questions correctly within the week and on their first try. Some of them even asked me a few questions that required me to go and look up the answers. I think that is a great sign!", "The group that I have been working with reported that they took between 45mins and 1.5 hours to complete the lesson. Thankfully that is the sort of time that I was aiming for. I will keep re-evaluating the lessons as I go along to make sure that I am not making them too hard or too easy. I want to keep them Goldilocks, just right.", "It was great fun seeing all the interesting tables that my friends created. There were tables about wine, tables about food and tables about exercise. I think this is a great reflection on what people have been up to while self-isolating. It just shows that there is data all around us \ud83d\ude03", "I am so pleased with how engaged my friends seemed with this lesson and look forward to getting stuck into the second one with them. If you are learning with us I hope you enjoyed this first lesson and are eager to get started on the next one.", "Lesson 2 will be about how to SELECT data from tables using SQL. We will practice selecting all of the data from a table, selecting based on column names and selecting a specific number of records. In addition, we will also learn how to use SELECT DISTINCT so that we don\u2019t get duplicate values.", "In addition to data, my other passion is painting.
