It comes with a free tier in which you can make up to 1000 call per day and 100 per hour which is more than enough for our use case.", "Head over to the login page and sign up for it. You should see the following dashboard once you have logged into the main page.", "Remember the API key as we are going to need it later on.", "Let\u2019s move on to the next section and start playing around with Rasa stack which is an open source machine learning framework to automate text- and voice-based conversations.", "Creating a virtual environment before you continue with the package installation is highly recommended. Install Rasa via the following command.", "Verify that you have installed the module by running", "Make sure that terminal is at the root of your project directory. Initialize the sample dataset by running the following:", "When it prompt for training, choose No (n) as we will need to train it again later on. You should have the following files in the directory.", "Uncomment the codes for action_endpoint in endpoints.yml", "Add a new intent called ask_weather in nlu.md. Provide a few examples inside it", "Once you are done, change the content in domain.yml to the following. You can find the complete code in the following gist.", "Append the following code in stories.md.", "Update the code in actions.py as follow. You can find the complete code in the following gist.", "You need to modify a few parameters for querystring based on your use case. I used the latitude and longitude for my current location. I have specified additional fields such as temp and humidity as well. Feel free to modify it accordingly.", "Next, we are going to train it via the following command", "It might take some time for it to train and you should see a new folder called models with a file that ends with tar.gz.", "The next step is to run both the Rasa Server and Action server. Let\u2019s start with the Action Server. In the existing terminal, run the following command to start the action server. It will be defaulted to port 5055.", "You should see the following output at the terminal", "Open a new terminal and activate the same virtual environment.

For Windows users, you need to use double quotes to ensure that CORS registered correctly.", "Let\u2019s move on to the next section to implement the UI for our weather chatbot.", "For this tutorial, I am going to use a readily available UI framework made by the team from Scalableminds. Head over to the following github repository and clone/download it into your machine. Unzip it and place all the files in a separate directory from the Rasa files.", "The instruction provided by the official github page is based on yarn but I am going to use npm for this tutorial.", "Make sure that you have installed Node.js in your machine.

If you are using other ports, you need to make changes to line 18 in index.html.", "Build the files by running the following command.", "It will create a new folder called dist and create a minified version of the required files inside it. After that, you can simply serve it by running", "You should see the following output at your console", "Open up a browser and go to the the following url", "It should load the chatbot interface for you to test it. For now, it can only answer basic questions and provide you with information on the weather.", "Congratulations for completing the tutorial. Let\u2019s recap on what you have learned today.", "We started off with signing up to get the apikey for access to weather data.", "Then, we moved on to install the necessary packages such as Rasa. We modified the dataset to include an additional intent and stories for weather. Once we have completed the training, we started both the Action Server and Rasa Server.", "For the Chatbot UI, we used a React-based component and serve it normally via npm run serve. You can easily extend and modify it based on your own preferences and use cases.", "Thanks for reading this piece. Hope to see you again in the next tutorial!", "Your home for data science.
