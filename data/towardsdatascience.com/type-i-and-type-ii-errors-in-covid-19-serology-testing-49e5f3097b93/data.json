Since the beginning of the pandemic, testing has been a huge topic of conversation. I personally have not been tested for the virus. I imagine I\u2019ll have to be tested in the future for one reason or another. This got me thinking about the efficacy of testing. Pondering test accuracy turned into an exercise on reinforcing my understanding of type I and type II errors and building functions in R. That will be the focus of this article.", "The test I will be focusing on in this article are called serology tests, which are more commonly referred to as antibody tests. According to the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security (JHCHS), the function of a serology test is to determine if a person has been exposed to a specific pathogen by looking at their immune response. Another test is an RT-PCR test. The JHCHS says the RT-PCR test will indicate the presence of viral material during infection and will not indicate if a person was infected and subsequently recovered. So, in simpler terms:", "Serology = Used to determine if a person had the virus.", "RT-PCR = Used to determine if a person has the virus.", "The measure of how well a test performs in detecting the virus is based on two values: sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is a measure of how well the test detects a true positive result. Specificity measures how well the test detects a true negative result. If a test is perfect at detecting positive and negative results, the sensitivity and specificity are both one. When these values are less than one, the test is subject to false positives and false negatives, otherwise known as type I and type II errors. So, for simplicity:", "Type I Error = False Positive", "Type II Error = False Negative", "Let\u2019s build a confusion matrix using R to reinforce this knowledge:", "Now, let\u2019s use the sensitivity and specificity values reported by the JHCHS for a specific test to add values to the confusion matrix. I chose the Elecsys\u00ae Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test by the company Roche. The specificity of the test is 99.81% but the sensitivity changes over time. The sensitivity is 65.5% between 0\u20136 days of infection, 88.1% between 7 and 13 days of infection, and 1 for 14+ days after infection. This makes sense given the purpose of the serology test is to detect antibodies. The serology test is more effective when greater time has elapsed from the moment of infection and the immune system has had time to develop the requisite antibodies. Let\u2019s write a function to capture the different sensitivity values to use for calculations later on:", "The last piece of information we need to fill in the confusion matrix is the incidence rate, which is the proportion of the population who is currently infected. I\u2019m going to use the \u201c14 Day New Cases Per 100,000\u201d for the state of California which is 306 per 100,000 as of 21 November 2020. Now that we have everything we need, let's write some code!", "There were 19 false positives (Type I errors) and 11 false negatives (Type II errors). These numbers assume the 10,000 tests were administered on people who were between 0 and 6 days of infection. In reality, there would be far more variation between the range of days since infection in the tested population. With that said, let\u2019s write a function to calculate the probability you\u2019ve been infected or not given the result of your test:", "If you receive a positive test result, there\u2019s just over a 50% chance you\u2019ve been infected. If you receive a negative test result, there\u2019s just under a 99.9% chance you\u2019ve never been infected. Remember, these results assume the entire population we sampled were within their first week of infection, so we shouldn\u2019t expect high performance given the purpose of serology tests are to determine the presence of antibodies. Let\u2019s perform the same calculation on the population from California with a higher sensitivity value:", "The test performs better when the sensitivity is higher, as expected. There are still quite a few false positives, and that\u2019s concerning. Let\u2019s see how the numbers look when the sensitivity is its highest value.", "This is the best test performance so far, but the number of false positives still strikes me as quite high. This got me wondering, how does incidence play into these numbers? I decided to use the incidence rate from Alabama, which as of 21 November 2020 is 566 cases per 100,000 people. I kept the sensitivity value at 1.", "Interestingly, the test performed better when applied to a population with a higher incidence rate. Keep in mind, these results will differ between populations with varying incidence rates and between individuals depending on the length of time since they were initially exposed to the virus. Finding a test with the highest sensitivity and specificity is paramount to limiting error when an individual is trying to determine the presence of antibodies to the virus.", "The key takeaway from this analysis is that different tests serve different functions. If you\u2019re worried you may be infected, it\u2019s not advisable to take a serology test. It\u2019s more advisable to take a diagnostic test to detect to presence of the virus (read more about that here). If you want to determine if you\u2019ve ever been infected, that\u2019s where the serology test is most effective. The higher the sensitivity and specificity values, the less error prone the test will be to Type I and Type II errors. Something I found interesting while researching for this article is that a person may become infectious well before they start to feel ill. With that in mind, it can never hurt to reduce connectivity to stop the spread.", "I\u2019d like to note I\u2019m not a medical professional. If you believe I\u2019ve misrepresented anything in this article, please let me know! Finally, I\u2019d like to thank my professor Kevin Crowston for providing the inspiration (and some code) to write this article. Check out his website.", "Your home for data science.
