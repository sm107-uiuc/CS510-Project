Isn\u2019t there anything we could do in our scrappy garage to start playing around? As it turns out, a common move in the industry is using simulators, from ad hoc physics engines to off-the-shelf video games (you can also try something in your browser!).

Talking about moving toys specifically, an honorable mention is certainly due to Vehicles, the clever book by Valentino Braitenberg, in which simple vehicles exhibit traits of \u201csynthetic psychology\u201d of increasing complexity.", "In this two-parts post, we are going to setup a Python-based development environment to send/receive messages to/from small bluetooth cars on a racing track.

Why don\u2019t we just go faster and faster? Well, it is not that trivial, as our universe is small but still physically realistic.

Yes, it would (that is, in the end, the whole scientific excuse for having so much fun with toy cars).", "There are indeed a lot of interesting data questions we could try and ask in our toy universe:", "The important thing is that we now have a basic, but functional setup to run experiments and collect data from our small cars.

When the server gets started, noble waits for the bluetooth device to be available and start scanning using Anki characteristic UUIDs. The rest of the code is just the server listening for events coming from Python and executing the bluetooth-related logic: \u201cmeta-commands\u201d come with the syntax COMMAND|PARAM (e.g. CONNECT|ba0d6a19\u20131bf6\u20134681\u201393da-e9c28f2b6743), while car commands are hex strings and go straight to the vehicles (e.g. 03900101 is what enables the SDK mode). FYI, it\u2019s also the first app I ever wrote in node (so that\u2019s my excuse if it doesn\u2019t work!).", "py_overdrive.py contains the Overdrive class encapsulating the vehicle-related logic and the communication from/to the node gateway. We leverage Python threads and queues to handle concurrent processes to write, read and handle location events in a non-blocking way. At initialization time, if a function is provided to the constructor, the system will take custom actions (\u201ca driving policy\u201d) in response to location events (see custom_policy_example.py for a simple use case). track_discovery_example.py and the companion script create_track_image.py will get you started on mapping the different pieces of a track and printing out the layout (p.s.: the code is just a quick and dirty stub that makes many simplifying assumptions).", "If you\u2019d like to help out, the repo README contains a work-in-progress list of improvements and experiments to be made.
