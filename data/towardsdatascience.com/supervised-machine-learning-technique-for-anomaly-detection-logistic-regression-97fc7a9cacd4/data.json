The following are the previous 10 articles if you want to check out, each focusing on a different anomaly detection algorithm:", "With a closer look, you\u2019ll discover that all of those algorithms are either statistical or unsupervised ML techniques. Unsupervised, but many of those algorithms are actually built around supervised classification theories (such as kNN, SVM or DBSCAN). Today I am going to take on a \u201cpurely\u201d machine learning approach for anomaly detection \u2014 meaning, the dataset will have 0 and 1 labels representing anomaly and non-anomaly respectively.", "So why supervised classification is so obscure in this domain? A few reasons are behind it but a key one is the severe class imbalance, meaning only a tiny fraction of the data represents anomaly. Anomalies are rare events and finding them is like finding a needle in the haystack. That\u2019s a big barrier for a supervised algorithm because there\u2019re not enough examples to learn from!", "In any case, below I am writing an implementation of supervised classification with publicly available data, using a popular algorithm \u2014 Logistic Regression.", "Typically in previous articles, I create a small synthetic dataset on the fly and implement the algorithms with bare minimum codes to give an intuition on how they work. It\u2019s going to be different today since it is a supervised classification problem and I have to follow all the essential steps. As you will see, data preparation alone is going to take quite a bit of space.", "We need quite a few libraries for this exercise for data wrangling, preparation of model inputs, model building and validation \u2014 all libraries coming from three big packages: pandas, nunpy and sklearn.", "I am using a popular dataset from Kaggle on credit card fraud detection. The dataset was released in the public domain by European cardholders after removing any user identifier. Let\u2019s import and take a look at the datasets and see the features.", "The dataset has 31 columns. The first column \u201cTime\u201d is the transaction timestamp, the second last column \u201cAmount\u201d is the transaction amount and the last column \u201cClass\u201d designates whether the transaction is fraudulent or not (fraud = 1, non-fraud = 0). The rest of the columns, \u201cV1\u201d to \u201cV28\u201d are unknown features and the values were scaled.", "Now check out the number of fraud and no-fraud cases.", "As I said, that\u2019s quite an unbalanced dataset, only 492 fraud cases out of a quarter of a million observations. This represents only a 0.17% fraud cases in all of the transactions.", "The dataset is pretty clean, so in the next step, we are just going to scale the \u201cAmount\u201d and \u201cTime\u201d columns to make sure they are of a similar format to the other columns.", "Now let\u2019s define the X and y input variables.", "Since this is an unbalanced dataset, we need to take an extra step to take a subsample \u2014 known as undersampling \u2014 so the machine doesn\u2019t have to find a needle in the haystack to learn from examples.", "Splitting data into training and testing sets before feeding into the model.", "As usual, the actual model building takes only 3 lines of code, to instantiate, fit and predict on the given dataset. Since this is for demonstration purposes only, we are going to use default parameters without tuning anything.", "As a standard model evaluation metric, we are producing a classification report and confusion metrix.", "The objective of this article was to demonstrate a purely supervised machine learning approach for anomaly detection. The use of supervised techniques is rare in this domain because of the severe class imbalance. Since there are only a few anomalous observations in a dataset, algorithms don\u2019t have enough examples to learn from.", "None of the 11 algorithms I wrote about so far is good or better in an absolute sense, it all comes down to the nature of the dataset and the domain it is coming from. Often a simple statistical algorithm (e.g. boxplot) is good enough to filter possible candidates and in other cases, a sophisticated algorithm can be useless.", "Hope you\u2019ve found this series useful, feel free to leave a comment below and follow me on Medium, Twitter or LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
