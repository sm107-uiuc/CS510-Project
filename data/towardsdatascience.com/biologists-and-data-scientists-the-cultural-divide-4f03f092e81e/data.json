Data scientists and biologists both analyze datasets to try to make sense of the world. Today, data science is becoming increasingly important for biology, as biologists increasingly use machine learning and AI for drug discovery, medical diagnosis, and automating repetitive tasks.", "Nonetheless, there is still a large cultural divide between the two fields. Data scientists and biologists regularly approach the same problem from very different perspectives, using different methods and different terminology.", "We chatted to Alexander Titus, Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at the Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute (ARMI) and editor in chief of Bioeconomy.XYZ. Alexander started out as a biologist, then obtained a PhD in data science, and now works towards bridging the gap between the two fields.", "Alexander first studied biochemistry and biology in college, but was introduced to computer science in his last semester. As he puts it,", "\u201cI fell in love with computer science and realized I had studied the wrong thing the whole time.\u201d", "\u201cI moved to Silicon Valley and wanted to get a job at a startup in the tech world. But I didn\u2019t have any software skills, so I was working on things unrelated to programming. Then in true Silicon Valley style, I spent all of my time hacking away in my basement: Learning how to code. Learning statistics. Eventually learning machine learning. I got good enough that I could go get my PhD.\u201d", "Now, as a strategy executive, Alexander acts as a bridge between data scientists and biologists. He helps lead ARMI towards the right big-picture decisions, making regenerative manufacturing a reality.", "[Find out more about Alexander on LinkedIn, Twitter, his podcast Titus Talks, his publication Bioeconomy.xyz, or at alexandertitus.com.]", "Alexander has seen people broadening their skillset in both directions, but he thinks it\u2019s easier for biologists to gain data science skills than vice-versa. He says:", "\u201cThe founders I talk to find it easier to take biologists and teach them math and programming than to take people with a long history in math and science \u2014 but not in biology \u2014 and try to catch them up on years of facts and information they\u2019ve missed out on.\u201d", "But either direction is challenging, and Alexander says a solid grounding in data science fundamentals is useful for anyone who wants to keep pace with the constant changes:", "\u201cProgramming changes so fast. Python was huge, and then R was integrated. Then all the statistics, then TensorFlow, then Keras. It just changes constantly. Any one set of skills are obsolete in a matter of months. But the underlying ability to learn those skills is huge.\u201d", "In fact, Alexander believes \u201clearning to learn\u201d is the most important thing college teaches people:", "\u201cI had a professor in college who always used to tell me, \u2018The only thing college teaches you is how to learn anything in a long weekend.\u2019 That\u2019s the mindset I really need from people. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is, because someone\u2019s going to invent some new back propagation algorithm, or some new framework we\u2019re going to have to use. We\u2019re always going to have to adapt.\u201d", "Learn more about applying Data Science in Biotech every week \u2014 Sign up to our weekly newsletter", "The biggest difference between how biologists and data scientists approach problems is the way they treat data and hypothesis testing.", "Traditionally, scientists look at an outcome (Patient A has cancer but Patient B does not), make a hypothesis (Maybe we can diagnose this cancer with this specific biomarker), and then test that hypothesis using data (Looking for that biomarker in two groups of patients: those who have cancer and those who don\u2019t).", "While data scientists using machine learning are guided by this same method, the focus is different. They look at the outcome and make a far looser or broader hypothesis, such as: \u201cMaybe that outcome can be explained by some of the many variables I have in this dataset.\u201d They feed their data into a machine learning algorithm, which might look at billions of potential explanations before automatically honing in on those patterns that best explain the outcome.", "This process of using broader hypotheses is foreign to many biologists and often uncomfortable for them. As Alexander says:", "\u201cIn traditional biology and chemistry, you have a very specific hypothesis, and you lay out a very specific set of experiments to test it. Then once you get there, you have your answer. It\u2019s just a couple of simple data points to show that you proved it.", "But with data science, you\u2019re often hypothesis-free. You have a loose hypothesis, but then you\u2019re doing data-driven analysis to get to an answer.\u201d", "This is not just a difference in habit. It\u2019s something people have very strong opinions about \u2014 beliefs that can border on zealotry. Alexander puts it in religious terms:", "\u201cFor biologists, it\u2019s sacrilegious to not have a hypothesis. That\u2019s so contrary to the training and the ethos of being a biologist. It\u2019s almost like making people question their scientific religion. Biologists are like, \u2018Well, you\u2019re a hypothesis-free idiot. Why don\u2019t you have a hypothesis?\u2019\u201d", "But with new tools and technology that allow us to explore data far more efficiently, machine learning is becoming more accepted. Alexander says:", "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of evidence of how good machine learning-based analysis is, and how useful it is.\u201d", "Without algorithms to help them, scientists were limited in the kinds of data analysis they could do. Traditionally, biologists would consider only a very few variables in any given experiment, looking for simple relations in the data, and they would conduct just a handful of experiments.", "So it\u2019s no wonder they sometimes find it difficult to understand the potential machine learning offers for their field. Alexander is sympathetic to this view:", "\u201cMost bench scientists from the world of biology and chemistry do small numbers of experiments. They do a basic Excel analysis with some simple charts to understand what\u2019s going on. Often they think machine learning is just a case of more data points packed into those same bars on the bar chart; they don\u2019t quite understand the dimensionality and the complexity that comes with much more data and many more variables.\u201d", "Humans often find it difficult to understand high-dimensionality. Geoffrey Hinton explains this succinctly: \u201cTo deal with hyper-planes in a 14-dimensional space, visualize a 3-D space and say \u2018fourteen\u2019 to yourself very loudly. Everyone does it.\u201d", "But machines are not limited in this way. With increasing computing power and more advanced algorithms, machine learning not only speeds up traditional analysis, but also carries out analyses that would never be possible using only manual methods. Machines can often find correlations between dozens of variables, while human scientists can usually only look at one or two at a time.", "Historically, strict hypothesis testing made sense. Gathering data was expensive, so biologists were trained to make sure they only gathered exactly what they needed and to focus on a very specific problem. Alexander acknowledges the reasons behind this narrower perspective:", "\u201cBefore, biologists had to develop a framework to make experiments work. Without computers. Without high-dimensional data. Without deep learning. You only had enough time and money to collect the very specific things that would prove your hypothesis.", "But now it\u2019s so cheap to collect data. While the first whole genome sequence cost $10 billion, the same thing now costs $800.\u201d", "The fact that it\u2019s suddenly so cheap and easy to generate data has produced two conflicting schools of thought: some scientists remain more conservative, while others are eager to take full advantage of newer technology. As Alexander explains:", "\u201cBasically, the two mindsets are: \u2018Why collect all the data you can when you don\u2019t know if you need it?\u2019 versus \u2018Why not? Because someday you\u2019re going to need it.\u2019\u201d", "Alexander thinks we still need big changes if we\u2019re going to bridge the cultural divide between biology and data science, but he\u2019s optimistic that this shift is already underway. As new graduates enter laboratories, they bring along strong opinions about how to do things more efficiently. As Alexander says:", "\u201cGrad students are going to be like, \u2018Why are we still doing this by hand? Why don\u2019t we have robots to automate this and data science to analyze it?\u2019\u201d", "And it is possible to train people to see each other\u2019s points of view. Alexander went through this shift personally:", "\u201cIt\u2019s all about the framing. In my experience from when I was a biologist, once you train and have experience on the data science side, then you can see it from both angles.\u201d", "Alexander reminds us that it\u2019s not all about machine learning superseding hypothesis testing. Instead, scientific practices need to evolve and adapt so we can unlock the benefits of tried-and-tested scientific methods combined with the potential of machine learning.", "Alexander thinks of this hybrid approach as following a \u201clight\u201d hypothesis: being guided but not limited by your assumptions. As he puts it:", "\u201cMicrobial sequencing is a good example. Instead of sequencing every microbe I find in a parking lot, I look for microbes in the area I\u2019m interested in. If I want to look for microbes that are good at dealing with gold, then I\u2019d go collect microbes from a gold mine rather than a farmer\u2019s field. It\u2019s a light hypothesis. You\u2019re still not doing things indiscriminately. But you balance it, which is useful.\u201d", "Although it\u2019s still a challenge to find biologists who understand data science \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 Alexander says the field is more heavily burdened by other factors:", "\u201cVery rarely is data science hindered by technical talent.\u201d", "Data files can be formatted in different ways. Many file types \u2014 such as PDF files \u2014 have open standards: anyone can implement software to work with PDF files and get access to the details of their internal processes.", "By contrast, biotechnology data often uses proprietary or closed data formats, which makes understanding and using this data more of a challenge. Alexander notes:", "\u201cWe\u2019re working very hard to not use anything that stores data in proprietary formats. That\u2019s the bane of my data science existence: when there\u2019s some file type I can\u2019t open with just any old computer. It drives me nuts. Normalization, standardization, and getting access to that raw data is hard.\u201d", "It\u2019s not only about accessing data; it\u2019s also about understanding exactly what preprocessing steps that data has already been through. Alexander describes the detective work that\u2019s sometimes necessary to discover this:", "\u201cIt\u2019s particularly challenging because oftentimes we don\u2019t have access. The software is all proprietary, and we don\u2019t know how the data is processed internally \u2014 from raw data to output. Not only do we need to normalize the output of a bunch of different machines, but then we have to figure out what they did to the data before it got to that stage. That\u2019s very hard.\u201d", "To help navigate this landscape of proprietary software and data formats, many teams turn to specialist software vendors for help. Alexander has tried this too, but he hasn\u2019t had good experiences. He describes how unwittingly signing a contract can lead to losing ownership of the data itself:", "\u201cWe\u2019ve interviewed and assessed a ton of software vendors. We\u2019ve asked how they would provide solutions for this \u2014 to make sure we can access the data, and to make sure they don\u2019t end up owning the data just because they stored it in their system. There\u2019s a lot of legal mumbo jumbo around it.\u201d", "We love hearing how different teams are using machine learning in tandem with biotechnology.
