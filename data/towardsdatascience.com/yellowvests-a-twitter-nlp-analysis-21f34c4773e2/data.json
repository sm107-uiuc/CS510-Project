This so-called \u201cyellow vests movement\u201d celebrated its first anniversary on November 16th 2019, but the French public opinion associated to these social protestations can no longer be described as it was one year ago.", "However, with an incoming reform on the pension system, French rail workers, air-traffic controllers, teachers and public sector staff are taking again to the streets to protest\u2026", "Are French people still feeling hope wearing these yellow vests? Are they expressing anger through or against this movement? Are they tired of it ?", "Discover the NLP Analysis below ! (bonus at the end of the article !)", "It all started in October 2018, when the French Government suddenly rose fuel prices triggering massive protests, and therefore creating the ideal populist movement for social, fiscal, democratic and economic claims.", "Everything went viral on social media, and mobs started to take on the streets each Saturday. The movement reached its top participant rate on November, 17th 2018 with more than 1.3M yellow vests.", "However, people started to get annoyed by this yellow wave. Manifestions became too violent, yellow vest activists were not able to fix a common agreement on their revendications, and finally French Government took some (very light) actions to turn this movement into a deadlock. There were bearly 40,000 of them in May 2019.", "Participation rate plummeted every Saturday and the news dropped this topic\u2026.until a new national meeting was scheduled by trade-unions on December 5th 2019. On September 2019, French Government announced a massive pension reform targeting every social class. Right away, the #YellowVests popped up on Twitter and activists re-fixed their weekly appointment on Saturday, until the nationwide strike on December 5th.", "Using the Plotly library on Python, we can visualize the yellow vests participation rate over the last year, according to \u201cLe Nombre Jaune\u201d estimations (French Facebook group trying to estimate number of participants) vs French Government estimations. Click on the \u201cPlay\u201d button !", "Why this particular date ? It was planned by all the biggest French trade-unions as a way to remember the same period when, 24 years ago, people took to the streets to protest again another reform of pensions (which aborted).", "On Thursday December 5th, many strikes are planned in public transportations, education, hospitals and electricity services. We will see through our Parts of Speech analysis a high correlation between the #5d\u00e9cembre (#December5th) and the #GilletsJaunes (#YellowVests).", "We collected 4000 tweets between November 29th and December 2nd (1000 tweets a day) at strategic hours (peak activity hours) using Tweepy library and Twitter API on Python.", "\u2026then we had to clean data in order to proceed it properly through the Convolutional Neural Network model (removing mentions, url, #..), and we were able to call that model thanks to Spacy library and its French package.", "We finally ended by visualizing the 20 most frequent words in 3 different P.O.S (Parts of Speech) categories : \u2018NOUN\u2019, \u2018VERB\u2019 and \u2018ADJ\u2019, using Plotly library.", "Given the NLP results we obtained, we decided to realise word cloud visualizations of the most frequent P.O.S, so we can better draw conclusions. (plots are interactive, so you can navigate through words if it does not display entirely on your screen)", "Well.. So what can we see ?", "Unexpectedly French people are expressing the will to take actions and install changes through verbs like \u2018Partir\u2019 (=Leave), \u2018Veut\u2019 (=Want), \u2018Mettre\u2019 (=Set), \u2018Prendre\u2019 (=Take), \u2018Agit\u2019 (=Act) and \u2018d\u00e9fendre\u2019 (=Defend). But we can also notice words like \u201cComprendre\u201d (=Understand), \u201cTravailler\u201d (=Work), \u2018Lire\u2019 (=Read) or even \u201cEviter\u201d (=Avoid) which are quite important and demonstrate the need of French people to be heard from the Government, before taking actions.", "A quick overview of top frequent adjectives obviously demonstrate nationwide concerns and a nationscale movement call, thanks to \u2018fran\u00e7ais\u2019 (=French), \u2018gr\u00e9viste\u2019 (=Striking), \u2018g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019 (=Overall), \u2018Public\u2019 or even \u2018GRAND\u2019 (=Big) in capital letters !", "Looking at the top Nouns, things become very correlated to the massive strike of december (we mentioned it above) : \u2018mouvement\u2019 (=movement), \u2018d\u00e9cembre\u201d(=december), \u2018retraite\u2019 (=pension) and \u2018reforme\u2019 (=reform) are one the most frequent words..", "French Twitter users are also directly targeting the Government and even the system itself when writing \u2018gouvernement\u2019 (=Government), \u2018R\u00e9publique\u2019 (=French Republic) or \u2018police\u2019 (=Police forces). Last but not least, the top noun analysis also reveal the French nationalism trough nouns like \u2018peuple\u2019 (=Nation) , \u2018Pays\u201d\u2019(=Country) or even \u2018Rue\u2019 (=Street).", "Finally, we have to mention the lexical field of the time through the following words: \u2018Jour\u2019 (=Day), \u2018Mois\u2019 (=Month), \u2018\u00e8re\u2019 (=Era) and \u2018vie\u2019 (=Life), highlighting the will to persue this movement, and perhaps create a new era for French society ?", "Now let\u2019s dive into Twitter Sentiment analysis and try to interpret people\u2019s feeling regarding this massive social movement.Using Textblob library and its sentiment estimation model, we can estimate the \u201cpolarity\u201d of each tweet in a Pandas DataFrame : that is to say a numerical value between -1 (very negative) and 1 (very postive).", "Given our sample of 4000 tweets, we chose to decrease our number to 2733 tweets by deleting non-relevant tweets for sentiments analysis (for instance, strings with too many \u2018stop words\u2019 aka not relevant words, or with a string length <4).", "Below is the distribution of tweets\u2019 length : it takes a wide range of values but Textblob but we can see length is usually between 30 and 230 characters.", "If you would have asked anyone to classify or describe #YellowVests tweets, it would have been \u201canger, fury, hate, revolt\u201d or any word relating to negative comments (so let\u2019s say a value from -1 for high negative comments, to -0.01 for soft negative comments).", "But guess what, TextBlob model is showing us an opposite trend ! If you take a look at the polarity mean, it is postive and equal +0.05, when you could have expected a negative value !", "We choose to apply a simple and easy classifier after getting the polarity of each tweet :", "Therefore it was easy to plot an histogram to show sentiment distribution and present the main trends : majority of tweets were classified as \u201cneutral to positive\u201d, minority were linked to the negative category.", "Unfortunately, 766 tweets were unclassified by the model, as TextBlob is not that clever for French language.", "Note: We could have used the NaiveBayesClassifier from Texblob models to cateogrize each tweet as \u201cpos\u201d, \u201cneg\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d, but again, it is not that performant on French language", "Thanks for making it to the end :) We hope you\u2019ve learned something or got surprised through this text mining !
