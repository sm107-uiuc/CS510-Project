I\u2019ll also show you how to find the R-squared value of your ML model. Let\u2019s begin\u2026", "It acts as an evaluation metric for regression models. To understand it better let me introduce a regression problem. Suppose I\u2019m building a model to predict how many articles I will write in a particular month given the amount of free time I have on that month. So, here the target variable is the number of articles and free time is the independent variable(aka the feature). Here\u2019s the dummy data that I created.", "In this case, a simple linear regression model should be enough. The equation of the model is\u2026", "The parameters of the model(w_1 and b) can be found by minimizing the squared error over all the data points. This is also known as the least square loss function.", "After this optimization step, we found the red line as our model(best-fit line).", "Now we want to know how good our model is. This can be done in many ways but R-squared uses a statistical measure called variance. Variance denotes how much the values are spread out around its mean. Mathematically,", "R-squared finds how much of the variance of the target variable is explained by the model(a function of the independent variables). But to find this we need to know two things. 1) variance of the target variable around mean(avg variance), 2) variance of the target variable around the best-fit line(model variance).", "The average variance can also be seen as the variance of a model that outputs the mean of the target variable for every input. We can visualize this model as a horizontal line that cuts the y-axis at the mean of all the y coordinates of our data points. See the green line in the plot.", "Ignoring the factor 1/n, we can write\u2026", "The formula for model variance is\u2026", "Now we at a position to understand the formula of R-squared.", "As I mentioned earlier R-squared value denotes the proportion of variance of the target variable that can be explained by your model. The more proportion of variance explained the better your model is. So an R-squared value close to 1 corresponds to a good model and a value close to 0 corresponds to a bad model.", "Let\u2019s say the R\u00b2 value of our model is 0.78. This statement means that our model explains 78% of the variance of the data corresponding to the number of articles. It is close to 1 so we can say this is a good model.", "R\u00b2 = 0 when our model is the same as the average model. R\u00b2>0 means our model is better than the average model. The maximum possible value of R\u00b2 is equal to 1. Although it has a square in its name it may take a negative value. R\u00b2<0 means our model is worse than the average model. This case does not occur in general as the optimization step will produce a better model than the average one.", "At first, it seems all fine but as we add more features, R\u00b2 shows a huge problem. R-squared can never decrease as new features are added to the model.", "This is a problem because even if we add useless or random features to our model then also R-squared value will increase denoting that the new model is better than the previous one. This is false because the new features have nothing to do with the output variable and only contribute to the overfitting.", "To understand this let\u2019s introduce a new feature to our model which has no relation with the number of articles written by me(output variable). I am taking the average temperature of a month as our new feature. Let\u2019s call it x_2. So our model becomes\u2026", "After the optimization two cases can occur for w_2:", "Almost always the second case occurs as it is very easy to find a small correlation in randomness. But this small correlation overfits the model. To tackle this problem we use adjusted R-squared.", "The idea behind adjusted R-squared is to penalize the score as we add more features to our model. Let\u2019s look at the formula of adjusted R-squared.", "The denominator(n-m-1) increases as we increase the number of features. So if we don\u2019t find a significant increase in R\u00b2 then the value of the whole expression does not increase(may even decrease). That\u2019s how adjusted R\u00b2 is somewhat resistant to the problem that we were facing with the ordinary R\u00b2.", "Statsmodels library offers a simple way to perform many statistical tasks. Firstly, I\u2019ve created a fake dataset and build a linear regression model. After that, I\u2019ve printed the R\u00b2 and adjusted R\u00b2 values by calling the summary() function. Here\u2019s the code\u2026", "Now focus on the selected portion of the output.", "I hope you enjoyed the reading. Until next time\u2026Happy learning!", "Your home for data science.
