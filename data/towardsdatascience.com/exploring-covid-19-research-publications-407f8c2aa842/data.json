Recently, the White House and a group of leading researchers published the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), which is available on Kaggle. The goal is for the global research community to apply recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing to generate insights into the infectious disease.", "As is true of most text mining efforts, generating summary statistics and visually representing the content of text information is a very important part of exploratory data analysis.", "In this post, we will perform exploratory data analysis on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We will use python libraries such as \u2018seaborn\u2019, \u2018matplotlib\u2019 and Pandas to explore and visualize the categorical and text information provided in the data set. The specific file we will be using is called \u201call_sources_metadata_2020\u201303\u201313.csv\u201d.", "First, let\u2019s read the data into Pandas data frame:", "Next, let\u2019s print the first five rows of data. Let\u2019s also relax the limit on the number of columns displayed (the output is suppressed here):", "There are many places we can start with our analysis. The easiest first step would be to look at the list of columns and its length:", "We can also look at the number of rows in the data set:", "Next, we can look at the frequency in journals across all publications. We can use the Counter method from the collections module to achieve this (output is suppressed here as well):", "We can see that this is quite the list of journal names and frequencies. We can narrow this down by removing the missing values (\u2018nan\u2019) and limiting our output to the most common 10 journals:", "We can then visualize the most common journal publications using \u2018matplotlib\u2019 and \u2018seaborn\u2019. Let\u2019s do so for the five most common publications:", "It is also worth noting that if we look at the total number of journals:", "there are 1732 journals in this data set.", "Just out of curiosity, I looked up the impact factors for each of these journals. For those who don\u2019t know, journal impact factor is an index that measures how frequently a journal is cited. The more prestigious or harder to publish in journals typically have higher impact factors. The most common five journals had the following impact factors in 2019:", "Since Emerging Infectious Disease (Emerg Infect Dis) has the highest impact factor and the second highest number of publications, it may be interesting to analyze the text content of papers published in this journal.", "Another interesting project would be to find the impact factor of each journal and augment the existing data with impact factor information. Augmenting our data with this information would allow us to filter and search for high impact COVID-19 research publications. In order to find the journal with the highest impact factor and relative number of publications, we\u2019d need to map 1732 journals to impact factor values.", "For now, let\u2019s assume that Emerging Infectious Disease is a good journal with a large number of publications related to COVID-19. Reinforcing this assumption, SJR, a journal ranking website, ranked Emerging Infectious Disease 8th on their list of infectious disease journals, which is pretty good.", "Moving on, let\u2019s filter our data to include only data from Emerging Infectious Disease and print the data frame length for verification:", "And we see that the data frame length is 941.", "Now let\u2019s look at some abstracts. Let\u2019s look at the first 5 abstracts just to get an idea of the content in the text:", "The next thing we could look at is the sentiment scores of the abstracts. Maybe we can assign sentiment scores to each abstract and see if the score are associated with positive results.", "In order to get sentiment scores, we need to import a python package called textblob. The documentation for textblob can be found here. In order to install textblob open a command line and type:", "We will use the polarity score as our measure for positive or negative sentiment. The polarity score is a float with values from -1 to +1.", "For example, let\u2019s consider the 1991 publication on the cancer drug taxol, Taxol: a new and effective anti-cancer drug. The abstract has a postive sentiment sentence:", "\u201cClinical trials indicate that taxol is effective in the treatment of patients with refractory ovarian cancer, breast cancer, malignant melanoma and probably other solid tumors.\u201d", "if we define a textblob object and pass in the sentence above we have:", "If we change the word effective to ineffective in our sentence:", "\u201cClinical trials indicate that taxol is ineffective in the treatment of patients with refractory ovarian cancer, breast cancer, malignant melanoma and probably other solid tumors.\u201d", "and pass that into our textblob object we have:", "We see that textblob is capable of capturing negative and positive sentiment in scientific statements. Let\u2019s apply this to the abstracts in our COVID-19 data:", "Let\u2019s also limit the columns in our data frame to include \u2018abstract\u2019 and \u2018sentiment\u2019 and print the first five rows:", "We can also count the number of positive and negative sentiments:", "Just to be safe, let\u2019s increase the polarity threshold to >0.5 for positive sentiment and print a few positive sentiment abstracts:", "We see that textblob does a decent job assigning positive scores to abstracts. Let\u2019s do the same for the negative sentiment abstracts, where we will decrease the negative sentiment threshold to -0.1:", "These results are less conclusive. Ideally, we\u2019d want abstracts with negative sentiment to contain statements like the following:", "\u201c There was no evidence of horizontal transmission to other cats because only 2 cats developed antibodies against H5N1 virus.\u201d", "It would be interesting to apply this sentiment score method across all journals and compare negative and positive sentiment between journals.", "I\u2019ll stop here but please feel free to continue the exploration process with this data. It may be worth looking into other text classification methods like BERT which may be used to classify journals reporting negative and positive results.", "To summarize, in this post we performed a simple exploratory analysis of the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We generated frequency counts for the number of journals, visualized the most common journals, filtered our data to restrict our analysis to a high impact journal with a large number of publications, and performed sentiment analysis on the journal abstracts.
