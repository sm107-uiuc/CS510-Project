This post is a review of my experiences with the Springboard Data Science Curriculum, based on my personal experience. For a TL; DR version, feel free to jump to the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s listed at the end.", "These days, there are several options, both free and paid, available online for working professionals who want to make a career transition toward data science or just want to develop an additional skill set. I am hoping that this article will help those considering enrolling in a formal data science curriculum to get an overview of what they can expect from Springboard program. This should help those considering a formal program to better compare Springboard to other programs and make an informed decision about whether it aligns with their learning goals. Note that this review is based on my personal experience with \u201c Springboard Data Science Career Track\u201d program which I took during late 2019/ early 2020.", "Before diving into the course overview, I will start off with a little background about me and my motivation for enrolling in the program. Hopefully, this puts my observations in perspective. When I enrolled in the program, I have a PhD in Mechanical Engineering and was working as a process engineer in semiconductor manufacturing for around two years. At this point, I completed a few projects which introduced me to machine learning and made me realize the vast potential for AI based improvements in manufacturing. So, I decided develop my data science skill set and get more exposure to the field. I chose Springboard because it is more rigorous and holistic than completing various MOOC\u2019s or learning from tutorials online while not as big of a commitment as a full time degree (and less expensive, too), Furthermore, I was able to complete it at my own pace while working full time. With this context, lets get into the overview of the program", "The first thing that happens once you enroll in the program is that you will be given access to the program curriculum in your Springboard account. You can access the initial learning modules (except those that belong to the Specialization) right from the beginning. You will also be able to access the course tracker and other useful information like community forums, mentor call notifications and other student resources. The program has multiple resources and tools available to help you make the most out of it.", "Throughout the program, the curriculum is designed to ensure that you are making progress on technical modules, career development modules and capstone projects simultaneously. Finally, one-on-one mentor support is one of the strongest selling points for springboard. Let\u2019s go over each of these separately next.", "For technical curriculum, springboard does not develop its own material but organizes and provides access to other resources on the web, both free and paid. I felt the units to be logically organized and material to be well curated. Material start off with basic data science skills including data parsing, data manipulations, visualization and basic statistics before moving on to different machine learning topics.", "I found that the material on machine learning gives a good overview of different types of models and helps build an intuitive understanding of how the model works. In general, the material seems to be aimed at introducing the various models, developing an intuition about how they work and making you use the model libraries in python. However, if you are looking for in-depth mathematical theory or implementation details about specific algorithms, you may not find that in the curriculum.", "Being a career track program, the curriculum does a good job of covering additional skills required for data scientists by including modules on good coding practices, testing and debugging your code as well as productionizing data science models.", "Finally, the program gives an option to choose between three specializations, each of which will have different modules for about the last 30% of the course. The specializations available are for Data Science Generalist, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. I chose NLP as my specialization and did not look at the quality of the material in other specializations first hand. However, based on talking to other students, I understand generalist track covers models like recommendation systems in more detail. My observations are based on NLP specialization I chose.", "I found the capstone projects to be very helpful to apply the skills I learn as a part of the technical curriculum. These are a good opportunity to develop a data science portfolio, which can be very helpful during job search, especially if you are planning to transition to data science jobs from a different field.", "You are expected to select the first Capstone project early on and make progress on the projects alongside the technical curriculum. In addition to the code, you will also be required to document your findings as a report and a presentation as a part of final submission.", "If you are interested in applying data science to a particular domain, projects will let you pick a dataset from the same domain so you can get familiar with the data and common strategies for data wrangling and feature selection in that domain.", "One of the main selling points of Springboard is their one-on-one mentoring. When you enroll in the program, Springboard will pair you with a mentor based on your preferences and what you are looking for in the course. You will have regular 30-minute check-ins with the mentor for the duration of the course. Mentor is your main resource for keeping track of your progress, getting help understanding topics if you get stuck and for grading and providing feedback on your assignments and capstone projects.", "Based on mentor profiles on the Springboard website, I found that the mentors can have varying backgrounds, including those with advanced degrees in data science related fields as well as those with non-STEM backgrounds who successfully transitioned to data science. I suggest that you think about your career goals and what you are expecting to get out of your mentor before giving your mentor preferences. Technically, you do not get to select your mentor directly. Instead, Springboard assigns you a mentor based on your preferences and availability. However, I found the Springboard team to be helpful in trying to understand my preferences and changing the assigned mentor early on in the program.", "In addition to the assigned mentor, you will also get unlimited one off mentor calls. I found these to be helpful if you need someone else to give you a different perspective on a topic or if you find yourself stuck midway during the week and don\u2019t want to wait till the next scheduled mentor call to get unblocked.", "Career Development Module and Career Coaching Calls", "The program has career development curriculum modules interspersed between technical modules and you are expected to work on them simultaneously. Material included is related to common career development topics like updating Linkedin profile, resume writing and informational interviews. As a significant part of job search is networking, you will be encouraged to develop your network through informational interviews, participating in meet-up\u2019s and reaching out to other contacts in your chosen company or job profile.", "You will also be scheduling calls with one of the career coaches who can review your job search materials and strategy to give personalized feedback. As a part of the program, you will have access to career coaching and can schedule mock interviews up to six months after the end of your program, as long as you are actively searching for jobs.", "In addition to those mentioned before, you can also attend weekly office hours to watch Capstone project presentations by other students or ask general questions. You will also have access to discussion forums or participate in peer study groups, which are a good resource for networking with other students and brainstorming project ideas. They also conduct Springboard Rise, an in-person conference/ networking event in SFO bay area.", "Finally, to summarize, Springboard offers a holistic and well-curated program for anyone wanting to develop their data science skill set and pivot to a data science career. You can take advantage of multiple resources for professional development and networking while developing your technical skills and creating a project portfolio. However, the expected time commitment is obviously higher than a typical MOOC and you need to pass an initial skills assessment to be admitted to the program.", "Your home for data science.
