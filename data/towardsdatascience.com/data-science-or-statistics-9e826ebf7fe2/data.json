As I wade into this debate, I can\u2019t help but feel a little silly for focusing on the semantics and titles of it all, rather than something of seemingly more substance.", "However, it has become clear to me that in many workplaces and even in academia, the vagueness has led to quite a bit of confusion and misunderstanding.", "Ultimately, I don\u2019t believe it is important to \u201cget it right\u201d for any reason other than to be clear with what our definitions are so that we aren\u2019t talking past each other. This article is my attempt to follow the best practice of \u201cdefining my terms\u201d with the hope also provides useful signposts for organizations and leaders.", "One of the most common pitfalls that needs to be avoided, is to understand that data science does not, and should not, always mean machine learning or artificial intelligence solutions.", "The science of data, like other scientific fields, should be precise in identifying and applying the correct tools to a problem. Sometimes the best tool for a use-case is statistics, or exploratory data analysis, or a simple yet understandable visualization of descriptive statistics.", "In Donoho\u2019s (2015) paper, 50 Years of Data Science, he tackles the question of defining the term \u201cData Science\u201d in a meaningful way in order to better understand what it is, and how it differs from other disciplines, namely statistics.", "He begins his comparison with reference to the field of statistics and other fields such as computer science and social sciences, which all seem to have a claim to the techniques and methods.", "Donoho makes the case that what John Tukey began, and others championed such as William Cleveland and John Chambers, was really an expansion of statistics to include what we know today as data science.", "From this perspective, they view statistics as mainly focusing on the theory of statistics which allowed someone to build an inferential model when you had data to know something about your population of interest.", "These early proponents of \u201cdata science\u201d thought that contemporary statistics left out the importance of gathering and cleaning in the data process.", "Additionally, we are also seeing a focus on the predictive power of applying models to data in addition to modeling for the purpose of making inferences from the data, rather than using the data to test a theory-built model.", "Donoho points out how clear this is in machine learning sector of data science, but also in many other use cases. Instead of reliance on statistical theory \u2014 which necessitated one model of truth existing in the data \u2014 now there was a paradigm shift that focused on finding patterns and multiple potential models from the data themselves.", "Donoho asserted that this expansion was made possible by the advent of computing power and visualization changes that were achieved over the past 40 years.", "As seen through the popularity of statistical software such as SPSS, SAS, and finally R that began to dominate the field in the 1990\u2019s, the reliance on and prominence of these programs became synonymous with \u201cdata analysis\u201d and the methods spread to many academic and commercial uses.", "In a sense, these programs helped democratize and expand statistics beyond the formal \u201cStatisticians\u201d by training. Additionally, practitioners in almost every setting began tackling \u201cbig data\u201d and \u201cdata mining\u201d rather than classical statistical techniques previously used.", "The next most important development was the Common Task Framework (CTF) which is a methodology for competition. The CFT requires:", "The CFT allows for data science competitions but also has built a culture of open sourcing scientific problems with data because there are clear measurable answers and agreed-upon goals.", "The CFT and the move towards open source data science technologies (R, Python, Github, ect.) have been an imperative push for the data science paradigm.", "Clearly something beyond statistics, data science now encompasses programming, engineering, mathematics, design, and scientific methodology knowledge in almost all the applications.", "Additionally, there is a focus on implementing solutions, to include interfaces for products and services or simply providing data visualization for presenting results of the data science work.", "This is clearly something more than any one field was focused on previously, but it is also universal in the sense that many fields can adopt and benefit from these techniques and knowledge being applied to their specific problems.", "As declared by John Tukey in the 1960s, the science of data is becoming more and more important in our world, and is quickly spreading through nearly every facet of our lives.", "I personally do not care for the term \u201cdata science\u201d if only because it tends to confuse more than it clarifies. However, the actual practice of data science is something more than statistics.", "Data science as (ideally) practiced in some respects is statistics, but it also includes a rigorous exploration of data sources and data quality.", "Layered on top of this are programming methods and open-source technologies which amplify the scientific rigor of the data sourcing.", "These are then leveraged along with simple and complex statistical theories and methods to explore, infer, and predict \u2014 depending on the use case.", "And finally, there is equal attention paid to telling the story of the data. Data science as a practice values visualizations and subject matter expertise that allows the story of the journey and results be made easy to understand by varied stakeholders.", "This is not to say that statistics or statisticians never combined these ideas previously. However, the culture of data science that has extended beyond the statistics departments, and from formally trained statisticians, has ingrained the science of data throughout other disciplines and contexts \u2014 leading us in a search for data-driven decisions and evidenced-informed policies.", "Or at the very least, pushing us towards a mindset where we want to see the data behind our assumptions and beliefs. Hopefully.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Doctoral candidate, integrating Data Science in the public sector.
