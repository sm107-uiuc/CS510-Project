Or if you already are a data scientist and just want to hear your profession be showered with compliments and words of fascination.", "Data science is an awesome area of work because:", "Yeah. Seriously!When doing data science you feel like a detective or an explorer searching for clues and hints. For me, that is extremely thrilling. You know that the data in front of you contains useful information, and it is up to you to find out what it is. Take the introductory Titanic data set from Kaggle for example and then think about the following scenario which fits your situation (on mobile you might scroll a bit):", "The data set contains data about the poor souls on the Titanic. For each passenger there is data about gender, ticket price, age, number of parents and siblings aboard and whether the passenger survived. At first glance at the data it is not easy to realize exactly what factors will determine if a passenger survives, and this is where the exploration step takes place for you as a data scientist. Now it gets exciting!", "You can now twist and turn the data, flip it upside down, try different combinations, think about it logically and critically, use your common sense. Do all these things, just like a detective trying to solve a crime, and you will be able to make sense of the data and obtain valuable information.", "Try to remember the feeling you got when you first realized that a model which distinguishes only between male and female passengers has an accuracy rating of almost 77%. Did that surprise you? Did it make you go: \u201cwhat?\u201d", "Or maybe you just laughed calmly, shook your head and thought to yourself \u201cOf course. Of course they would save the women first\u201d.", "Anyway, almost no matter what kind of reaction this realization sparked in you, I am sure that it gave you a positive feeling. This is what makes data science fun and exciting in my opinion.", "You are a curious person! I dare say that because you are reading here on Medium which almost by definition classifies you as someone who has a hunger for learning and exploration. Data science is the perfect field for curious people like you and me. You have the opportunity to learn about all corners of the world as a data scientist. Most of my life I wanted to become a psychologist because I found it interesting why we humans behave as we do, but I also think that social science and politics are super interesting topics. Actually I am curious about everything in this world and apart from data science there is no other profession which lets you work with everything this world has to offer. That is truly an amazing opportunity.", "One week you might be working with data from a big company. You try to predict what customers should be given more love to keep them as happy customers. The next week you might work with data about dolphins in the oceans, sports statistics, cancer patients or image recognition of cats and dogs. You get the point now. I just want you to think about how lucky you are as a data scientist that you get to have insight in just about anything. This makes data science very valuable to me.", "Do you like solving puzzles and riddles by thinking logically about the information at hand?If your answer to that question is yes then data science could be a good fit for you.", "Maybe you are already familiar with programming and code, and luckily data science includes this as well!", "I love to code. Especially the structure and logic of it all. Every time you make a data science project you get to structure a new system. You start by importing the basic libraries that you will definitely need: Pandas, NumPy and seaborn for example. Then you preprocess the data and assign it to different variables, you visualize the data, tweak a few things and when everything is ready you train a model and test how well it performs.", "If it performs poorly then you grit your teeth", "if it performs well then you smile", "This whole work process can be set up as a well organized system. This is indeed pleasing for us logical thinkers.", "You can earn a pretty good salary as a data scientist. Of course, the exact amount differs from country to country and your level of expertise. To find out what you can earn as a data scientist where you live, try to Google your area and data science salary.", "Freelancing is also a strong option. As a data scientist, you have an opportunity to work with a lot of different companies in a multitude of countries and you can be stationed wherever in the world you want. As long as you have a computer and an internet connection.", "I am not saying that it is easy to freelance, and also note that there are a lot of benefits of having a position at a company that you will be missing out on.You will probably have a hard time in the beginning when starting out as a freelancer, because you have to show potential clients that you are worth their money and interest. When that has been said it is still amazing that you have the option, the opportunity, the freedom to decide where and how you want to work. This freedom means a huge deal to me!", "You want to make a difference in the world?You want to help cure the world of dangerous diseases like Covid-19?You want to provide value for companies and real people?", "And this world could use more people like you. Because we need to keep making the earth a better place to live for everyone. There are many things wrong with this world and we have a duty to work towards a brighter future! If not for ourselves, then at least for future generations.", "You can play a part in making the necessary changes as a data scientist!Data science has been used to make models that help doctors detect cancer tumors earlier. It is used to better understand how viruses like Covid-19 has spread. It allows us to make self driving cars and so many other cool things. The possibilities are endless! And you can make a difference.", "Data science is fun, challenging and rewarding in so many ways.", "I hope this article inspired you to look into the field of data science. Or if you are already a data scientist, that your fascination of data science now burns a bit brighter.", "Keep learning! \u2014 Jacob Toftgaard Rasmussen", "Your home for data science.
