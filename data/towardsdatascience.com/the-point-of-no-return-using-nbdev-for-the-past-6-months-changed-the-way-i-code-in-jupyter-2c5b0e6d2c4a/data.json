Let me know, I would love to hear about your experience.", "\"nbdev is a library that allows you to fully develop a library in Jupyter Notebooks, putting all your code, tests and documentation in one place. That is: you now have a true literate programming environment, as envisioned by Donald Knuth back in 1983!\u201d \u2014 quoting nbdev repository.", "As a researcher and data science enthusiast I work with data on a daily basis. We humans can\u2019t live without air, water and food. For data scientists, data should be part of that list.", "I use Jupyter notebooks on my daily life, it\u2019s the environment where I code, solve problems and experiment new ideas. However, Jupyter notebooks alone have an important limitation. When it\u2019s time to move the code to production and create a python package, it\u2019s necessary to copy all the code to Python modules. Countless times I spent many hours to restructure and clean the code. A process characterized by a lot of copy paste and debugging.", "I could live with that working routine, it was not ideal but I didn\u2019t know best. This changed on my last birthday. In that same day, Jeremy Howard announced the new nbdev library. The day was certainly a coincidence but it felt like a birthday gift. After reading about what it promised I immediately knew this was something big.", "In the next three sections, I will cover the top nbdev features, how to get started with nbdev and how it changed the way I code over the past 6 months. I will then conclude with a few final remarks. Let\u2019s dive in.", "In my view, the most exciting features of nbdev are the following:", "Getting started with nbdev is very straight forward. After I read the description on the GitHub page I started using it right away. Any questions are usually answered in the documentation of the package or checking fastai2 notebooks as an example. The basic steps are:", "The first cell of the notebook should include #default_exp module_nameto tell how the Python module auto-generated from that notebook should be called. Each notebook will be a different python module. To tell nbdev how to handle each notebook cell there are a few comment tags that you write on the top of the cell. Mostly you will use:", "There are several commands you can run on the command line. They start by nbdev_ , you can use tab completion to find all the existing commands but most of the time you will need nbdev_build_lib to build the library and nbdev_build_docs to build the documentation.", "It is worth mentioning that nbdev also makes very easy to create console scripts for your package!", "Once everything is ready the package can be installed locally with pip install -e . but you may want to upload it to PyPi. In that case, you simply run make pypi and nbdev will take care of everything provided that you have followed the configuration steps.", "Using nbdev on most of my projects over the last 6 months made a significant difference in the way I code. Not only because of nbdev functionality itself but also because it made me think more about how I should structure the code. The code needs to have some organization in order to get the most out of nbdev.", "Writing code for humans is a concept that needs to be embraced in today\u2019s world. Jupyter notebooks can be a great way to share ideas and knowledge. Ideas and knowledge are the building blocks for a brighter future. If we can share the building blocks more efficiently we will be accelerating progress. It takes time to polish the ideas into a simple and elegant form. But that\u2019s so important. Because otherwise all people trying to build upon such ideas will have to individually polish them, for their own understanding. In some way, nbdev makes it easier and less time consuming to share the ideas in a simple and elegant form. nbdev takes care of what can be automated giving more time to the developer to focus on the presentation of the notebook.", "I hope this story was useful and inspiring to you!", "Thanks for reading!
