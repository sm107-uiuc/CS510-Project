I was an econ major at the time, only realizing very late in the game that I wanted to pivot from PhD economist to data scientist\u2014 but I did it, and that means you can too.", "Oh, and did I mention the one school that rejected me was Michigan, my alma mater? Yeah, that one hit right in the feels.", "As you may be able to tell, I was suffering somewhat of a coding deficit (as in I didn\u2019t know how to code, or what Github was, or that the Python being referred to wasn\u2019t a venomous creature), so I did two things here: I enrolled in the introductory CS class at my university and I found someone to hire me doing data visualizations for them. I also enrolled in a course that taught R, which was my personal favorite (for some reason I am fiercely protective of R for no reason. Fight me, bro).", "Frankly, the job was quite lucky; I expressed my enthusiasm in learning how to code and that I would pick up the slack as much as needed. I also sent a very thoughtful thank-you note after the interview (like a tear-out-your-hair-for-an-hour whether to say \u201csincerely\u201d or \u201crespectfully\u201d) and was immediately hired in the response to that email. Thank-you\u2019s go a long way, folks.", "By the end of the intro CS class, I had learned up to creating basic machine-learning algorithms in Python. My final project created new Christmas music from old Mariah Carey, Michael Bubl\u00e9 and Bing Crosby, and I also successfully implemented a web scraper program to do it. Even though I had mainly been taught C++, I quickly found these skills were transferable and was able to pick up a lot of Python for the final project.", "I highly recommend taking computer science classes if you are currently in undergrad. Otherwise, there\u2019s a lot of MOOCs that will teach basically the same thing. For example, MIT offers its Intro to Computer Science and Programming Using Python class for free online (it looks super hard and useful).", "My grandfather lives in a secluded Florida condo, so I went there for break with my mother (oh, the days before coronavirus!). Most of the day, I hunkered down in a corner of the place, only to come out for a coffee refill or for my mother to read over my newest draft. In the evenings, I facetimed my S.O. and asked him to be brutal with me \u2014 more than one tear (and imposter syndrome-related meltdown) was shed over getting my SOPs workable.", "Still, I knew that where I was weak in other places, I could shine through a well-written letter.", "Writing in Florida gave me a nice sunny place to feel super inspired and fresh. If you can, write from someplace that makes you happy \u2014 whether it be a coffee shop, a library with high, stained-glass windows, or a condominium smelling of mint and moth balls (like me!).", "This also meant that I studied all the programs, usually for about an hour. I wrote down the faculty members, their areas of expertise, and the classes they taught. In my SOPs, I wrote about my interests and how those faculty members aligned. Colleges won\u2019t accept someone they don\u2019t think is going to attend (it worsens their ranking on U.S. News and World Report), so it\u2019s extremely important to be as specific as you can.", "I was applying to 12 schools, finishing an honors thesis, taking two advanced math classes and an econ class, holding a job and teaching taekwondo once a week my final semester. I was short on time, so I would complete applications in the order they were due \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t think about the one after or before that one application, and that honestly helped me focus on each application in and of itself.", "In gist: If you\u2019re short on time, its ok to not spend 10+ hours on each application. Focus on pinpointing 2\u20133 faculty members you can talk about, a few classes that excite you, and one other thing you cool about the university that shows you did your homework.", "For one, they ask you what other schools you\u2019re applying to; this part is either neutral or a negative depending on how you manage it. I tried to make it so each school would look like my \u201creach\u201d out of those that I listed, while also only listing the schools that were close in proximity and program type (it\u2019s a truly annoying and imperfect art).", "Often, schools will ask for a \u201cbig\u201d essay, and then maybe some small ones on the side. They might also leave some room to explain away your deficits, which you should use if you have (like me and getting a C- in Calc 1).", "Lastly, a statement of purpose and a personal statement can be similar. In fact, I basically turned in the same essay for each school I applied to.", "For example, here\u2019s my personal statement for Tufts School of Engineering:", "And here\u2019s the statement of purpose I wrote for the University of Michigan:", "Focus on one good, high-quality piece and then rework it to fit each each university. Do not, and I repeat, do not just write a million different essays because you think you need to; for one, I didn\u2019t.", "The \u201cbig\u201d essay is the most important, so it was the one I always made sure I had at least one (or three) sets of eyes on. Prioritize the big essay and focus on the small with the remaining time you have in your schedule.", "I hope this article helped someone worried about applying to graduate school. If you have any questions about programs or how I can help you get into a masters, please comment below. You can also reach me at my personal website or Twitter. Thanks for reading!", "P.S. If you\u2019re wondering, I decided to go to UVA. \ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9c", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data Scientist & M.S. from UVA.
