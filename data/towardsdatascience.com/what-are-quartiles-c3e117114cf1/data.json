With these, specifically, we will understand what is called central tendency or :", "\u201cA measure of central tendency is a single value that attempts to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that set of data\u201d", "Ok, let\u2019s come back now. We have a businessman that asks us to help him better understand this northern region where he wants to open a farm. His main question is: \u201cWill I be in the top 25% of farms considering tractor count if I open a farm with 43 tractors?\u201d", "As we can see in Figure 1 above, I have already split data into 4 quadrants.", "I know. I took it took fast. Let\u2019s look below to see how we actually calculate these values.", "Before doing any calculation of Quartiles we need to order the sequence from lowest to highest. [already did that in Figure 1]", "Next, let\u2019s look below at Figure 2.1 and 2.2 below for some clarification.", "Further, let\u2019s calculate the position of these quartiles before calculating them.", "These represent the position of quartile\u2019s values in this sequence of numbers.", "In figure 2.1 in blue, I have written the index of each number. For Q1 for example, its position is 3,25 so somewhere between 3 and 4. Closer to 3rd index number than to 4th. We can now intuitively state that Q1 is equal to something between 16 and 17 (index 3=16, index 4=17).", "What we can do is apply the average of these two numbers and we will end up with the value of our Q1.", "For Q2, the value is somewhere between the 6th and 7th index so we average the 6th and 7th values of our sequence, thus Q2 = (32+40)/2 = 36.", "Now, here if you would add my numbers you would get slightly different results. Why? Because precisely Q1 in our case is 3.25 which means the very accurate value is right on the first quarter of the distance between 16 and 17. The website above shows us the value 16.25 and that is calculated as (16*3+17)/4. The value is 3 times closer to 16 than it is to 17.", "Ok, now moving to python. For this calculation, we will use NumPy.", "Ok. Not going to boil you too much. The problem relies on the default setting of np.quantile, more on it here.", "A simple solution to this and to stick with our reasoning from this article, add interpolation=\u2019midpoint\u2019 and we\u2019re all set.", "In Figure 1 I wrote \u201cInterquartile Range\u201d and that represents the midspread or the middle 50% of our data. This also helps us understand which values can be considered outliers, I wrote a few things about this here.", "In the end, let\u2019s not forget our business man. Let\u2019s reply his question. Will he be in top 25% of businesses if his farm will own 43 tractors?", "The answer is no, for him to be in top 25%, he will need at least 51 tractors.", "We\u2019ve looked on what quartiles are, when we can use them and how they\u2019re calculated. I hope it is a bit clearer now.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Believes every organization can achieve better performance through data.
