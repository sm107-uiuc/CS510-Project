Researchers from Stanford University are studying mRNA vaccines as these could quickly provide a candidate solution. One challenge to these types of vaccines is their stability: they tend to spontaneously degrade unless kept under intense refrigeration. In order to find a stable mRNA sequence, the people from Stanford University reached out to the Kaggle community in the OpenVaccine: COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Degradation Prediction competition. The competition launched on 11 September and lasted for only 26 days, which is unusually short for Kaggle due to its urgency. There was a prize-pool of $25,000 for the top three competitors. Bram Steenwinckel, Michele Tinti and I were able to achieve the fourth position, missing out on the money by an inch! In the hope that we could even have the slightest contribution in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine, we are publishing this blog post that discusses our solution.", "The goal of this competition was to predict, for each of the bases (A, C, G or U) in the provided RNA sequences, the reactivity and degradation under certain circumstances such as incubation with or without magnesium in high temperatures or high pH. In summary, we have to predict three continuous values (i.e. regression) for each of the bases in the sequence (i.e. sequence-to-sequence).", "The training set consists of 2400 sequences of length 107, the public test set contains 629 sequences of length 107 and the private test set consists of 3005 sequences of length 130. There is thus a difference in the sequence length in the private test data. It is therefore of great importance that the model has built-in invariance to the sequence length. Moreover, the sequences are only partially scored. For the train and public test set, only the first 68 of 107 bases are scored while for the private test set, the first 91 out of 130 bases are scored. An example of the targets for one of the training sequences is provided below:", "We can also display these target values on the RNA sequence graph directly as done for the reactivity in the example below:", "By looking at the targets, it is clear that a certain value is correlated with its neighbouring values in the time series. Recurrent Neural Networks are a perfect fit for these kinds of situations, as their built-in memory takes into account the nearby predicted values. We learn a representation for each of the bases in our sequence and pass these through 2 (bi-directional) RNN layers. The representation for each node is learned by using both information of the node itself and relationship or edge information. As can be seen in the introduction, the RNA sequence can be represented by a graph, and relations between certain bases in the sequence are present. We use Graph Layers to aggregate this relationship information. Our final solution consists of a blend of 4 different models, in which we vary the RNN layers (LSTM+LSTM, LSTM+GRU, GRU+LSTM and GRU+GRU). Some details are left out from this high-level overview. One important detail is that we pre-trained the network until the RNN layers as an Auto-Encoder. This allowed us to train on the unlabeled test data as well.", "ARNIE is a software package that wraps around 6 different libraries which can be used to generate extra information for each of the sequences:", "For a provided RNA sequence, ARNIE is able to calculate a Base Pairing Probability (BPP) matrix. Based on that BPP, a potential structure can be predicted and from these structures, the loop type can be inferred for each of the bases in the sequence.", "We used different libraries in ARNIE to generate extra information. This often required a bit of bash magic in order to get everything installed. We provide a notebook to demonstrate how to generate this information. We experimented with all 6 libraries, but only found CONTRAfold to be the most useful, followed by RNAsoft, RNAstructure and Vienna.", "From our high-level overview, we can see 2 types of inputs are required for our network: node information and edge information. The node information is a NxLxV matrix with N the number of RNA sequences, L the length of the sequences and V the number of features per node. We use V=25 features in total:", "The edge information is captured in a NxLxLxE matrix, with N the number of RNA sequences, L the length of the sequences and E the number of edge features. In total, we have E=5 features for each edge:", "Our pipeline was an adaptation from this great notebook by mrmakr. Make sure to give that notebook an upvote! We did make a few modifications to the original notebook:", "We tried many things that did not work:", "I really enjoyed this competition. I especially liked the fact that it only lasted for a rather short period of time. It was a neck-to-neck race on the public leaderboard for the course of the entire competition. Very stressful, but fun! This kind of \u201cblitz\u201d competitions could perhaps be considered as a separate format by Kaggle?", "While we just missed out on the money (by 1 position), we are still very proud of our result! With this result, my two teammates: Bram and Michele have also become Kaggle Competition Masters. So a huge congratulations to them!", "We provide the code of our solution on both Kaggle and Github.", "As usual, if anything is unclear or requires some more explanation: do not hesitate to leave a comment or contact me!", "Keep an eye open on this post, as it may receive some updates in the nearby future!", "See you in the next competition!Gilles, Bram and Michele", "Your home for data science.
