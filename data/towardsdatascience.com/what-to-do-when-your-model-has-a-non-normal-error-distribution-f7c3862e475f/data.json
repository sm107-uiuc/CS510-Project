The model predicts A and B to have the same expected 1-year return of 10% but shows these error distributions", "Even though both opportunities have the same expected return, the error distribution shows how different they are. B is tightly distributed about its expected value with little risk of losing money; whereas, A is more like a lottery. There\u2019s a small probability of a high payout (~500% return); but the majority of the time, we\u2019ll lose everything (~-100% return).", "A point prediction tells us nothing about where target values are likely to be distributed.

With the right function f, it may be possible to achieve normality when we replace the original target values y with f(y). Specifics of the problem can sometimes lead to a natural choice for f. At other times, we might approach the problem with a toolbox of fixed transformations and hope that one unlocks normality. But that can be an ad-hoc process.", "Warping turns the transformation step into a maximum likelihood problem. Instead of applying fixed transformations, warping uses parameterized functions that can approximate arbitrary transformations and fits the functions to the problem with the help of an optimizer.", "Through the transformation function, warping can capture aspects of non-normality in error distributions like skewing and fat tails.
