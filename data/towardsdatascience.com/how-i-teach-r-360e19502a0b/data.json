I thought long and hard about how to teach R. Here\u2019s what I came up with.", "I wanted a course that beginners could take. Most people learning R via a course aren\u2019t computer scientists or experienced hackers, but doctoral students in the sciences, analysts who currently use Excel for their work, or those just starting to pursue career in data science. They might have basic coding experience, but maybe on shaky foundations.", "(I did also want an experienced Python programmer to be able to come in and just focus on R syntax and what makes it different too, though.)", "I knew I needed to cover basic programming concepts, like loops, data structures, and functions. But people learn R to do practical work with data, not to generally learn computer science. Thus, I really didn\u2019t mention any theory, or talk about algorithm design, or anything like that. All of our examples and problems were about data (instead of how to write a sort function, for instance, like you might do in an intro C or Java class).", "I was also determined, though, to incorporate actual programming and not just script writing. That distinction mostly came down to having students write their own functions. This teaches them about abstracting problems and thinking about corner cases, reusing code and building their own tools, as well as debugging.", "I didn\u2019t want to have any students finish my class who couldn\u2019t write a simple function and apply it over their data. I say this because I\u2019ve met many people who think they\u2019ve learned R but can\u2019t write a function, can\u2019t index an array, and can\u2019t use a loop. Those are fundamental to me: if you can\u2019t do those tasks, why bother even using a programming language? So my courses focus on programming skills, not just script writing.", "If students start with high-level tools, they\u2019ll never understand what\u2019s going on under the hood; and they\u2019ll never be able to write customized solutions to trickier problems (that the high-level tools can\u2019t handle). So I start basic, and build up their knowledge. We begin with vectors and spend a lot of time on them. Before we do aggregations on a data frame, we hand split a list (which a data frame actually is), compute the statistics, and then re-assemble it. That\u2019s not a procedure you\u2019re going to want to do every day; but it\u2019s useful to have done it once.", "Because of the focus on fundamental skills, I decided to stay very minimal with packages used.", "We use reshape2 for some data transformations. This has the \u201cmelt\u201d and \u201ccast\u201d workflow (for long and wide transformation, respectively) which is conceptually pretty simple, and shared with the more advanced data.table, should they ever learn that.", "I use base graphics when possible, and introduce ggformula for more sophisticated plots. It\u2019s a wrapper for ggplot2, but uses formula notation, which students have already seen in aggregations, and will see in model specification. I do mention other plot methods, like for decision trees.", "In particular, I don\u2019t teach anything from the tidyverse. I\u2019m not a fan generally. But worse, the tidyverse works against most of my goals. It introduces a myriad of functions to learn, which try to elide the more basic operations in R. It actively discourages the use of subscripting and formulae \u2014 while instead encouraging pipes and the unusual syntax of ggplot2 instead.", "Students who learn tidy seem to be good at quickly writing high-level scripts to handle certain common data tasks. But their core programming abilities often seem very weak. Many students in my classes had already tried learning R with the tidyverse, but couldn\u2019t do things like index a vector! That\u2019s not just a hole in their skills: it\u2019s a hole in their mental process when they try to tackle problems.", "We don\u2019t just learn programming to tell a computer what to do: we learn programming to understand and approach problems in a different way; to become better thinkers. We can\u2019t learn that approach if we don\u2019t focus on the real tasks of programming, starting with what\u2019s basic, and building up from there.", "Of course, there\u2019s a limit: R users shouldn\u2019t worry about memory addresses, like you would in C. But they should worry about how a computer loops over the rows of a data frame as it executes an apply. It might not seem necessary for most problems: but when a harder problem arises, you need that more basic understanding so you can craft your own, custom solution.", "I also discovered there\u2019s limits on how much you want to build up to in an introductory course. The first term I taught, I concluded with a unit on data.table. What a mistake! The alternate syntax and little tricks of its use were too clever by half \u2014 the students were merely confused. They needed to solidify the basics more instead.", "Ultimately, I teach R because I remember what a challenge it was for my colleagues in graduate school to learn it. They weren\u2019t programmers. They weren\u2019t computer nerds. So even though they were (very) smart, it was a struggle, because programming is a new way of thinking. I was lucky, since I\u2019d been hobby programming for a while, and picking up R was comparatively easy. But for everyone else, there were few good resources, made for the kinds of people who need to learn R (early-career scientists, researchers, and analysts).", "I think I\u2019ve been able to fill that void with my courses. Not because I\u2019m the best R programmer in the world, or because I have the most advanced understanding of R\u2019s inner workings. But because I learned R like a lot of people did, on my own, and have been using it for more than a decade solving real problems. Even after all that, I still like R! It\u2019s a weird mongrel of a language, and it\u2019s not always easy to learn \u2014 but we can make it easier.", "Jasper McChesney is a senior data analyst, with a background in natural science and data visualization. He has worked in non-profits, human-resources, and higher education. He currently teaches an R course at the University of Massachusetts, and on Udemy.", "Your home for data science.
