This past Monday (the 18th) he announced further reductions in restrictions. Gyms, child care centers, office buildings, youth clubs, nonessential manufacturing, massage care centers, and work offices are allowed to reopen immediately. On May 22nd, restaurants will be allowed to go from 25% capacity up to 50% capacity. At the same time, Bars, wine tasting rooms, and craft breweries will be allowed to open at 25% capacity.", "With all of these restrictions being listened, it\u2019s important to consider what effect the prior stage of reopening has already had.", "The Texas Department of Health reported on Saturday more than 47,000 total confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state and over 1,800 new cases on Saturday alone (see the chart below).", "In this chart, you can see the number of new cases per day steadily increasing. This may grow more rapidly as the reopening began around two weeks ago, which is thought to be the incubation period for new COVID-19 cases.", "However, that long incubation period makes the existing upward trend hard to attribute to the reopening itself.", "The large peak on May 16th is the spike that the Governor has attributed to increased testing.", "Gov. Abbot has said that Texas is increasing the number of COVID-19 tests they are conducting \u2014 especially in high-risk facilities such as nursing homes, jails, and meatpacking plants. And that this is the source of the recent increase in reported confirmed cases.", "Although medical experts have repeatedly stated the importance of conducting more tests, it does make the data more difficult to interpret. Are the numbers going up because of the reopening or because of the increased testing?", "As the Governor has pointed out, the percentage of positive test results in the state does seem to be trending downward. Whereas in early April it was around 10% positive cases, it is now showing around 5%.", "However, this may not actually be an indicator of a decrease in true numbers of infections as many seem to imply. Previously in most states, people getting tested were people displaying the most severe symptoms. As states do more and more testing of the general population, it is expected that the percentage of those infected would decrease because the people you are testing are not only those displaying the most obvious symptoms of COVID-19.", "As you can see in the heatmap above, the largest number of COVID-19 cases in Texas are in the two largest counties: Dallas County and Harris County. Not surprising considering Harris County includes the city of Houston. More than 2,100 of Texas\u2019s cases are in Potter County and there are more than 600 known COVID-19 cases in Randall County. A smaller number of cases are diffusely spread throughout the state.", "Officials in El Paso have even asked that they be excluded from the next phase of re-opening.", "Here I\u2019ve presented a quick overview of the data related to Texas\u2019s COVID-19 cases. I don\u2019t think there is enough information to make any clear predictions about what\u2019s going to happen or even about what is happening right now. But I do think that the argument that the percentage of positive cases going down shows a reduction in danger is logically flawed and may be misleading people, potentially including Governor Abbott.", "Your home for data science.
