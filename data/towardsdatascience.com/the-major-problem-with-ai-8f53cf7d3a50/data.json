While I appreciate Rafay\u2019s effort to show that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is more than \u201cjust\u201d Machine Learning, his post contains another idea that worries me to my core. This idea is the following: the thought that computers and robots are going to take over the World is irrational. He even states it\u2019s never going to happen. Keyword: never. This is an incredibly strong statement (that is not backed up anywhere in the post), and it seems to reflect a larger sentiment: AI is a positive force, and worries about negative future scenarios are fear mongering. Since I see too many statements with this kind of sentiment, I decided to write this post to explain the major problem of advanced AI and why we definitely shouldn\u2019t neglect it.", "\u201cIntelligence measures an agent\u2019s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.\u201d", "For the purposes of this post, I will define intelligence as Legg and Hutter did it here: \u201cIntelligence measures an agent\u2019s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.\u201d Artificial Intelligence or AI is simply any intelligence that is not biological. One can think of the World champion defeating chess computer Deep Blue, but the more recent self-driving cars might be an even more interesting example of AI. The idea is that AI has seen a lot of progress over the years. Given our definition of intelligence, progress means a better ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments. This would mean that either the ability of AI to achieve goals in the same environment has grown, or AI can now achieve the goals in more environments. Both are true: for example, AI is now even better at chess than Deep Blue was in 1997; also, thanks to a technique called Deep Learning, AlphaZero is one AI program that can play the board games chess, shogi AND go. Given the progress in the past, it is expected that AI will see more progress in the future; at some point, many experts expect, we will have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): AI that is roughly as intelligent as humans are in all their intellectual domains.", "Your AGI doesn\u2019t know that killing your competitors in order to maximize your profit is not allowed.", "Now, what is going to happen if AI is that intelligent? This is clearly very hard to predict. However, we can make some educated guesses about this scenario. The major problem I and many others foresee is that, although AGI is by definition as intelligent as we are, it will not by default share our morals. Let me give an example to illustrate this. Imagine you run a company. At some point, your company has enough money and other resources to create the World\u2019s first AGI. Marveling at your creation, you give the AGI its first goal: to maximize your company\u2019s profit. After all, you want your investment to earn you some good money! As expected, over the next months, you see your profit increase. You are, however, shocked to learn that in order to achieve this, your AGI has hired assassins to kill your competitors. You see, your AGI has a very good understanding of what actions lead to its desired outcomes; it, however, does not share your morals. Your AGI doesn\u2019t know that killing your competitors in order to maximize your profit is not allowed. Why and how would it know this? We humans know (or at least most of us do), and we know that when someone asks us to maximize profit, that person implicitly means that killing competitors is not allowed. But we have a shared understanding of what is and isn\u2019t allowed; an AGI will not by default have this. To assume it will is to anthropomorphize. An AGI could have this understanding, but we would have to program it that way.", "\u201cThe AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.\u201d", "So an AGI might very well not share our morals. In fact, by default, it will not. Where does the major problem I hinted at earlier come from? It comes from a basic drive an AGI might have and the side effects of this drive. You see, in order to achieve its goals, an AGI might realize that having more intelligence will help. At first, it might achieve a higher level of intelligence by rewriting its own source code. After reaching this next level of intelligence, it might realize that even more intelligence is desirable (see Seed AI: The Most Disruptive Force Ever). To have more and more intelligence, it will eventually need more and more computing power. In order to acquire this, it might transform more and more of Earth\u2019s materials into computing material it can use, until eventually, the whole Earth and with it all humans are transformed into a big computer. In this scenario, it\u2019s not that the AGI hates humanity: it\u2019s just that we are made of atoms that it can use to build computing matter for its own purposes. AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky put it very well: \u201cThe AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.\u201d", "Where is the off switch of the Internet?", "But, you might think, will humanity not resist the AGI transforming the Earth? Well, we might try, but an AGI becoming more and more intelligent will by definition become more intelligent than we are and therefore, again by definition, be extremely good at reaching its goals. Assuming we will be able to defend ourselves is dangerously ignorant. If you think we can just shut the AGI off, think again: where is the off switch of the Internet?", "By default, you should probably assume that an ASI can convince you to do anything it wants you to do.", "Another concern you might have is how the AGI will transform the Earth into computing material. Wouldn\u2019t humans have to design it with a robotic body capable of doing this to begin with? Not necessarily. You see, the AGI might be intelligent enough to convince humans to give it more existing computing power at first. Eventually, it might find ways to convince humanity to create factories producing nanorobots capable of transforming ordinary matter into computing matter. Remember: once the AGI becomes just a bit smarter, it is smarter than humans are, and is by definition an Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). By default, you should probably assume that an ASI can convince you to do anything it wants you to do. Since it is by definition smarter than you, it could deceive you or otherwise convince you to do the stuff it wants you to do.", "In short, advanced Artificial Intelligence is going to have a major impact on humanity. Whether this impact is positive or negative depends on us: if we do it right, it could easily cure our diseases and invent all kinds of new technologies to let humanity thrive like never before. If we do it wrong, it could easily lead to our extinction.", "Your home for data science.
