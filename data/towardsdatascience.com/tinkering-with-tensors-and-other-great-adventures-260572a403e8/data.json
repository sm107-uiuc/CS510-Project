What follows is an account of the motivations and expectations of tackling a project like this.", "Join me if you too dare to venture into the deep (pun intended).", "\u2026as Ilya likes to say, you need to be prepared to suffer: expect hours of debugging models that refuse to learn, many passes restructuring your code, and building up your own conventions for changing various hyperparameters. But each time you suffer, know that you\u2019ve built a little bit of skill that will be invaluable for the future.", "Why implement a research paper? And why NLP?", "Assuming you want to create beneficial AI for the sustained good of humanity (and I mean, who wouldn\u2019t?), you\u2019d necessarily have to create a system capable of advanced reasoning, and which could preferably explain the contents of its consciousness to a human being. Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a subfield of AI which deals with these fundamental issues, and is itself nested within the larger discipline of NLP.", "Stated more simply, teaching a machine to understand language is crucial to safely unlocking the mysteries of intelligence itself.", "Additionally, if you followed along with the flurry of papers released in 2018, you know that while computer vision has long held the public\u2019s attention with its breakthroughs and applications in deep learning, the age of NLP has arrived. This, and my role as a machine learning engineer for a conversational AI startup in Silicon Valley, significantly motivates my interest in this field.", "So, here are two compelling reasons to try and implement a research paper:", "If any of this sounds even remotely interesting, then you\u2019re in the right place. Roll up those sleeves, slap on some sunscreen, and let\u2019s hit the road.", "But first, as with any adventure of this nature, we\u2019ll want to make sure we are aware of any dangers that lie ahead\u2026", "Your experience of replicating a research paper will be influenced by how successful you are in achieving your personal goals. Consequently, the most important thing to remember as you start your journey is to set reasonable expectations for yourself, and of course, to stay hydrated.", "Even after reading the experience of others, I was still surprised to find that implementing a paper disproportionately teaches you more about engineering than research.", "Many online courses will create beautiful environments in which you can play around with deep learning concepts. These can run the gamut from cloud instances with pre-loaded libraries, to fully integrated playgrounds in the browser (think fast.ai vs. Udacity). This is necessary to lower the barrier of entry for newcomers, allowing them to bask in the full glory of AI early in their careers.", "Unfortunately, much like the children of over-protective, but well-intentioned parents, this coddling makes little Johnny unprepared for the real world. It\u2019s up to us young\u2019uns to fill in the gaps with practical knowledge.", "Not only did I grossly underestimate the overall time this project would take, but I also miscalculated the distribution of effort. I initially assumed I\u2019d knock out the implementation over the weekend, and spend about five days testing out different hypotheses, with a 20/80 split of my time.", "In reality, roughly 40% of my time was spent fussing about with operational overhead, 40% with implementing, debugging, and testing the model architecture, and a final 20% with experimentation.", "Spread out over a two and a half week period, coding before and after work, and on the weekends, this project took me about 60 hours in total. I spent an additional 20 hours wrestling with model deployment, but more on that later.", "For your first paper implementation, this distribution and time commitment profile is not unreasonable, assuming you\u2019ve chosen a somewhat challenging paper in a discipline with which you have a measure of familiarity.", "In short, plan well, smell the roses, and take lots of pictures.", "The replication crisis is a disease that often afflicts the social and medical sciences because of the risky business of doing human subject research. When academics are unable to reproduce the results of their peers, the engine of scientific discovery itself can grind to a halt.", "You can\u2019t very well stand on the shoulders of giants if they\u2019re slouching.", "This can happen for a number of reasons, including limp research standards, \u201cpublish or perish\u201d incentives, and in the limit, downright fraudulent activity. Even when good science is conducted with the best of intentions, it isn\u2019t always smooth sailing. In artificial intelligence research, this often takes the form of algorithmic papers with under documented code (if published at all), and whose performance can fluctuate with sensitive training conditions.", "What this means for you, intrepid traveller, is that you must not be discouraged if your results don\u2019t look EXACTLY like those of your chosen paper\u2019s. I discovered rather quickly that authors will often leave out details because they aren\u2019t important (they are) or because they\u2019re incredibly obvious (they are not).", "In order to overcome this, you simply cannot limit your study of a research paper to the source text alone. You\u2019ll have to marshal external resources (GitHub, StackOverflow, your neighbor), and develop a good intuition for critical concepts which influence every paper, but aren\u2019t always made explicit. This will help you intelligently fill in the gaps to ultimately replicate, and hopefully even surpass the performance of deep learning algorithms.", "Here are the most common questions authors leave unanswered, but which you\u2019ll have to grapple with nonetheless:", "In any given layer, you don\u2019t want your weights to be the same, too big, or too small. If all the weights were identical to one another, your updates (learning rate times derivative w.r.t each weight) would have the same direction and magnitude.", "Different \u201cneurons\u201d need to change differently in order for your network to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs \u2014 this is known as \u201cbreaking symmetry\u201d and is the reason a single layer neural network has the potential to approximate any continuous function. In essence, this is why deep learning is so useful.", "Too big or too small values for your weights will result in exploding/vanishing gradients, which ultimately make the training process unstable, slow, or altogether ineffective. If you\u2019re driving on the highway, with large gradients you would be hurtling along at 120 mph, and with small gradients, you\u2019d be inching forward at an excruciating 5 mph.", "You\u2019ll either miss your exit, or die of boredom...and in both cases, you\u2019re getting a ticket.", "So, in order to have the perfect weights, we\u2019d have make sure they were sampled from a suitable probability distribution. Because of how important this particular insight is, a lot of really smart people have written entire dissertations on this topic. As a result, current best practice is to use either He or Xavier initialization for ReLUs (rectified linear units) or tanh/sigmoid activation functions, respectively.", "Unfortunately, these initialization schemes are inherently stochastic, since weights are randomly selected from a distribution. This means that even though neural networks can be deterministic with fixed initial weights and inputs, the replication of a paper becomes NON-deterministic. Your weights, and subsequently your results, will be slightly different, and for now, we\u2019ll have to live with that.", "Using the above intuition however, you\u2019ll at least know not to blame the weights if your results are radically different from that of the paper\u2019s. You also won\u2019t be stranded if the authors fail to mention any initialization procedures.", "There are quite a few hyperparameters which play an integral role in bringing a deep learning algorithm to life, the vast majority of which you\u2019ll have no trouble discovering.", "Descriptions of the size and number of hidden layers, regularization coefficients, and other architectural landmarks are seamlessly intertwined with a compelling discussion of theoretical underpinnings in most research papers.", "These design hyperparameters give you the blueprints for a successful implementation, but will take you no further. In order to match the performance of the paper, you\u2019ll have to hunt for a different species of training hyperparameters.", "This is where you\u2019ll start to sweat.", "Where are the learning rates? The batch sizes, the epochs? Moving beyond traditional hyperparameters, what optimizer was used? What was the training and test split in the dataset?", "To those satisfied with merely keeping up with recent advances in the artificial intelligence world, these details are insignificant. \u201cI\u2019ll just read the paper and move on!\u201d they\u2019ll say, \u201cBetter yet, is there an abstract I can take a look at?\u201d", "But to the grizzled few that want to chase the madness and bend reality to our will, these features are crucial. Your goal is not simply to understand these papers, but to re-imagine them all together, and perhaps even build on their successes.", "One approach is to scrounge for these training hyperparameters on the internet. You could find a related implementation on GitHub and pluck out relevant values. Unfortunately, wading through internet code can be extremely frustrating and misleading.", "A better strategy is to start with first principles, identify best practices, and hone your intuition for these recurring themes:", "Batch Size: Start with around 32. Using fewer training examples to update your weights generates a \u201cnoisy\u201d gradient signal. Counterintuitively, this noise exerts a regularizing effect on your network, allowing it to generalize well to unseen test data.", "Number of Epochs: This one is easy. Start with a sufficiently large number of epochs (a full pass through your data) and stop training when the validation error starts to get worse. Assuming you\u2019ve been saving your weights at regular intervals, pick the ones that give you the lowest validation loss \u2014 this is known as early stopping.", "Training/Validation/Test Sets: A good rule-of-thumb is to split your dataset 80/10/10. The fewer data points you have however, the more of them you\u2019ll push into training, so this ratio can be fluid. Being paranoid about how data are distributed in these different sets is not a bad idea, but if your paper is using a well-known benchmark, the details will most likely have been handled for you in advance.", "Optimizer: Go with AdamW, a better variant of Adam. The basic principle is to choose an optimizer which updates individual parameters according to their \u201cneeds\u201d, using some fraction of the gradient signal. Think socialism. AdamW combines this adaptive update with momentum, a moving average of previous gradients. This intelligently shifts parameters, while protecting against wild fluctuations in the loss from the current batch.", "Learning Rate: This is a coefficient that optimizers multiply with the gradient to dampen the error signal (adaptively in AdamW\u2019s case). First, use any learning rate (lr) finder to get a max and min value. Then use a 1cycle policy to modulate both your learning rate and your momentum. The intuition here is that network will rapidly explore solutions in the beginning, before slowly converging on the optimal parameters.", "Reproducibility is incredibly important to scientific progress, so it\u2019s a shame when artificial intelligence researchers make it harder for others to follow in their footsteps. Mastering these above concepts will give you the confidence to push forward, even if your paper\u2019s authors aren\u2019t explicit about training procedures.", "What\u2019s more, instead of just reading a paper and thinking, \u201cthat makes sense\u201d, you\u2019ll notice a shift in perspective towards, \u201cI agree with this\u201d or \u201cI would\u2019ve done this differently\u201d. Implementing a research paper will evolve from a purely educational activity into an exercise in peer review.", "While this will undoubtedly be an interesting experience, there are a few things you can do to make sure things go smoothly on your first implementation adventure.", "Should you dive in head first and learn on-the-go, or should you learn everything you can before attempting to implement a research paper? The answer really depends on why you want to do this, and what you hope to get out of this experience.", "Regardless of your strategy, the important thing is to realize is that the answers to your questions are not always going to be in the paper itself, and that a conceptual understanding can help fill-in-the blanks when authors are less than explicit. Perhaps then, a middling path that equips you with the basics before you embark, gives you the best shot of emerging unscathed.", "Up until this point, I\u2019ve refrained from referencing my actual implementation, since this discussion is largely about motivations and expectations. However, if you are interested, I implemented the Bilateral Multi-Perspective Matching model from IBM for my first attempt at reproducing a deep learning algorithm. You can find my experiments, code, and tests on GitHub. Everything is heavily documented, and I\u2019ve made things really easy to understand. Happy digging!", "There is certainly more that can be said about replicating the performance of a deep learning paper (tools, debugging strategies, measuring experiments, etc.), and perhaps I\u2019ll go into some of these in a future article. But for now, hopefully you found this piece instructive in planning your adventure, and understanding some of the surprises (pleasant or otherwise) that await you on your journey.", "So then, bold traveller, stay safe but curious, pack light, and remember to take it all in!
