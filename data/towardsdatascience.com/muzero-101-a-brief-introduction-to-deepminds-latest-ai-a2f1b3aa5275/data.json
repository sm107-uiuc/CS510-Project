The games between Lee Sedol (18 Go world titles) and AlphaGo were even immortalized in a documentary, available now in Youtube.", "Why was AlphaGo so relevant? Until then, computer programs were only able to play Go at an amateur level, as traditional Machine Learning methods such as search trees were simply not capable of evaluating all possible moves, board positions strengths, etc. Actually, Computer Go is described as the field of artificial intelligence (AI) dedicated to creating a computer program that plays the traditional board game Go, and Go programs exist since 1968.", "AlphaGo combined search trees with deep neural networks, with the intention of capturing the intuitive aspect of the game, as its creators confirm.", "AlphaGo is based on two deep neural networks:", "By using reinforcement learning, AlphaGo began learning from its own mistakes while playing against different versions of itself, until finally being able to beat the world champion 4 games to 1. Also, it demonstrated that by using those two deep neural networks, AlphaGo was able to come up with policies that seemed bad when watched from a human perspective, but turned out to be maximizing the value, as in the famous move 37 against Lee Sedol:", "In order to achieve its performance level, AlphaGo was feed with human data, domain knowledge and a known set of rules.", "Following Deepmind research results, AlphaGo Zero (2017) and AlphaZero (2018), improved the original algorithm by learning to play on its own, without any human data or domain knowledge, or even by mastering three different games (Go, Chess, Shogi) with only one algorithm being only provided with the known set of rules.", "Now, December 2020, Deepmind has presented its latest paper in the Nature journal which they present their latest computer program, MuZero, capable of mastering four games (Go, Chess, Shogi, Atari). So, what is the big difference between AlphaZero and MuZero? It might seem like a simple evolution of the former which has been able to \u201cjust learn\u201d another game, but there is one big difference. MuZero has learnt to master these games without being provided known rules.", "DeepMind claims that MuZero is a big step forward towards general-purpose algorithms. And they think so because they have introduced a novel method to approach planning in unknown environments, a very relevant problem to AI.", "AI planning is defined in the Wikipedia as \u201ca branch of artificial intelligence that concerns the realization of strategies or action sequences, typically for execution by intelligent agents, autonomous robots and unmanned vehicles\u201d.", "Several techniques have been developed to approach AI planning, which we will not be covering in this article. You can find very good free resources online to explore AI planning into detail, such as the AI planning MOOC by the University of Edinburgh below:", "Researchers at DeepMind discuss two different approaches to AI planning, and how MuZero uses a different approach to overcome their limitations.", "The first approach is Lookahead search. We can simplify a lookahead problem as follows:", "This kind of problem is easier to understand if we translate it into a well-known problem as chess. In a game of chess:", "For every problem that can be defined in this way, a tree exists that the lookahead search has to explore to find the best planning strategy (going back to chess, one that allows the player to reach a check mate position while avoiding his rival to do so). When these trees become complex (high depth, high branching, or both) a bounded version of lookahead search can be applied. Alphazero uses lookahead to master games like chess, poker or checkers, but as DeepMind researchers say, it depends on the ability to provide the algorithm with a clear set of rules for the game, or a good simulator for the environment dynamics. This is not always possible for real world problems.", "In model-based planning, a model of the environment is either known or acquired. Based on this model, the algorithm plans its actions and might update the model based on the results obtained. This kind of planning becomes very complex when requiring to model rich environments (Deepmind researchers mention Atari gaming as an example), and that is the reason why model-free systems have emerged. These kinds of systems do not use a learned model, but estimate what is the best next action they can take.", "DeepMind\u2019s MuZero was created in order to overcome limitations by the two previous planning methods. In order to do that, MuZero focuses on modeling only the aspects of the environment that are relevant for the algorithm to make its decisions. Specifically, and according to DeepMind, MuZero models three elements that are key to the planner:", "Compared to previous DeepMind\u2019s algorithms such as AlphaGo or AlphaZero, MuZero is not feed with known rules for the games/ problems it is challenged to solve, making it, according to the researchers, \u201ca significant step forward in the pursuit of general-purpose algorithms\u201d. Everything from values to policies to rewards are completely learnt by the algorithm, not fed as previous knowledge.", "Is MuZero showing us the way to next level AI? It seems like there is now a clearer consensus than one year ago around the need for a convergence between Deep Learning and other fields to capture causality or reasoning in AI. Nevertheless, applying some of these techniques coming from previous research, DeepMind has demonstrated (not without concerns in the AI community) that their algorithms can solve relevant problems like protein folding, potentially leading to new disease treatment developments in the future.", "If you enjoyed reading this piece, please consider a membership to get full access to every story on while supporting me and other writers on Medium.", "Your home for data science.
