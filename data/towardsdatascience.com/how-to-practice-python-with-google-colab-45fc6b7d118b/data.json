I still use flipped instructions as I did in China.", "In the last several weeks, we have finished the foundation of Python part.", "Each week, the students were asked to read the assigned chapters in the two textbooks, and try the codes out with their own modifications before coming to the class.", "They are also asked to try to fix their codes if running into error. They can post the problem in Discussion Board on Canvas if they had exhausted all the methods yet still could not solve it.", "Since most of the students were new to Python, they could run into the following practical problems easily.", "The problems mentioned above are the main pain points for Python beginners.", "If they cannot be solved efficiently, the students will waste lots of their time on a lot of trivial and useless work. The more possible situation is their confidence will be shattered and they will lose motivation and interest for study.", "To help them, I have found a suitable tool for beginners to practice Python. Here, I would like to share the tool with you too.", "It\u2019s called Google Colab. I used it in the article \u201cHow to Predict Severe Traffic Jams with Python and Recurrent Neural Networks?\u201d to show you the source code, as well as providing you the deep learning environment.", "In this blog article, I will introduce how to use Google Colab to solve the above pain spots and provide assistance for your Python exercise.", "The most common problem for Python beginners is that accumulating interest in learning is not easy, and soon you will encounter errors.", "In fact, the errors Python beginners make are always related to the environment of configuration.", "For instance, when trying to download Anaconda, you may not know which version to choose.", "Someone got stuck after the installation, for they cannot shoot up a Jupyter Notebook server because of the wrong Path settings.", "When you try to import a package, there will be an error message telling you \u201cI don\u2019t know the module you asked for!\u201d", "Google Colab can help you with all of those things.", "Just open a browser\uff08I recommend Google Chrome or Firefox), and input the following URL:", "You will see the following webpage.", "Just choose to create a new Python 3 notebook.", "Then you can see a fully configured Python running environment.", "Although you did not go through any installation processes, it still contains almost all the modules you need for data science analysis.", "These tools include but are not limited to Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, etc. Even deep learning frameworks, such as Tensorflow, Keras and Pytorch are also included.", "Google Colab\u2019s deep learning environment support isn\u2019t limited to software side. Google has generously offered you GPU, and even Cloud TPU for free.", "By default, these cloud computing hardwares are not enabled. You need to choose \u201cruntime\u201d in the menu bar, and then \u201cChange runtime type\u201d.", "In this way, you can see the options for hardware accelerators.", "Some sample codes, or even Python components from the textbooks require Python 2.x environment to run. Don\u2019t worry. When you choose to create a new notebook, you can specify different versions of Python.", "If you are careful enough, you may have already figured out that you can change the Python version at any time in the \u201cChange runtime type\u201d tab.", "As a beginner, it\u2019s quite normal to encounter error messages and problems.", "Fortunately, Python has got a strong community, which can help you a lot.", "But if you have tried, there may be an illusion that these \u201cPython masters\u201d are unfriendly, for you have posted questions long time ago, yet nobody gave you any reply.", "In fact, It\u2019s probably because of the wrong way you asked those questions.", "Imagine that you described an error message, there may be dozens, or even hundreds of reasons which can lead to it. Who can have that kind of patience to help you examine and exclude them one by one?", "You may argue that sometimes you also included the code, or even the screenshot of the error message with the question, yet still nobody came to help.", "It may due to that your information is still not sufficient.", "For example, what kind of Python environment did you install locally? What are the versions of the modules you imported? What are the contexts when you got the error message? Could it has something to do with a previous code chunk? Does your operating system fully support the framework you are using?", "These possibilities are endless. Again, no one wants to waste the time to examine them one by one.", "With the help of Google Colab, however, the efficiency can be improved significantly when you try to ask questions, for the potential respondent can repeat your problem easily.", "You can achieve that by sharing your notebook.", "As it is shown above, you may click on the share button on the top right corner.", "In the dialog box, you need to pay attention when selecting permissions. My suggestion is to choose \u201cAnyone with the link can view\u201d.", "Then, choose \u201ccopy link\u201d, and the link will be saved in your clipboard. Put the link and the problem description together, and post them on Python\u2019s official forum or the course discussion board.", "People just need to click the link and they will be able to see all your codes and error information, and even better, they can run the copy of your notebook easily.", "Though you two may use different operating systems and/or different browsers, your Python computing environments are completely identical, thanks to Google Colab.", "When somebody solved the problem, he or she can share the complete notebooks via a link, and it\u2019s done.", "Please notice that asking question is only one of the methods to get help.", "You\u2019d better to try to solve the question independently before you post it on the forum. People will not want to help you if you refuse to think about it yourself and only rely on others.", "Google Colab provides you a very useful function to find possible answers. Whenever you encounter an error message, you can see a \u201cSearch Stack Overflow\u201d button.", "Hit the button, and Google Colab will use Google search engine to find similar problems and potential answers on the Stackoverflow.com website.", "In most cases, you will find corresponding answers in the first several links.", "In our example, you are lucky this time, for the answer explained that the issue was related to the difference of Syntax between Python 2 and 3.", "Now you only need to follow the instructions and modify the codes a little bit (adding parenthesis), and everything would be fine.", "Have you ever tried to write codes with others together?", "In my course, some assignments are group tasks. Students are required to work in groups to solve problems with Python.", "Some students tried to collaborate like this:", "Write a piece of code and send it to another member. When the other finished his/her part, the new source code file is sent back. It goes on and on.", "Of course. You can continue to use the sharing function we have introduced.", "This time, however, when selecting permission, give the other party \u201cAnyone with the link can edit\u201d permission.", "We still use the problem where the print command comes with \"no parenthesis\". But this time, in addition to seeing your problems, other people can also edit your codes directly.", "You partner can create a new code chunk, and input the correct statement.", "On your side, the change will be synced, and you see this.", "Your partner\u2019s avatar will appear next to the corresponding modification, and he or she can also choose to add a comment.", "For example, a comment like the following can be made.", "The comment will be synchronized to your notebook instantly, too.", "In this way, team collaboration can be much more efficiently.", "Make sure to limit the \u201cedit\u201d permissions to the collaborators you trust.", "If you intent to show your work to the public, you can use Github integration functions provided by Google Colab.", "You can choose to save the copy in Github.", "Then, select the Github project you want to save to.", "After that, the corresponding Github page will be opened automatically, and ready for preview.", "The preview can contain all the texts, pictures, codes, and output information. Pay attention to the top of the notebook, there is a link to \u201cOpen in Colab\u201d.", "Click on it and you can open the Google Colab environment and run the the copy of the notebook on this Github repo directly.", "When you try to modify your codes a lot of times, it may lead to chaos and things could get worse. At this time, you may need a \u201ctime machine\u201d to go back to a previous copy.", "And Google Colab provided you the machine.", "Click on the \u201cRevision history\u201d in the menu, you can see all the historical versions saved in current notebook.", "Modification time, users who made changes, and the size of the document, etc, are all shown here. If you want to go back to any version, just click the \u201cRestore\u201d button.", "Additionally, you can also download Google Colab notebooks directly into .ipynb file and save a copy locally.", "Make sure to choose the storage path carefully, or you may not be able to find it later.", "When students need to submit assignments, I usually ask them to submit both the Google Colab sharable link and a .ipynb file.", "I\u2019ll leave it to you to think about as an assignment. Hope you can get the correct answer instantly.", "You can open the .ipynb file by start a Jupyter Notebook server in command lines. However, it would be more convenient to use a cool app called nteract to view the content of an .ipynb file directly.", "In this article, I introduced Google Colab to help a Python beginner to practice Python programming more efficiently. In summary, it can handle the following pain points you may run into:", "In this case, you can spend more time on practicing and understanding Python, not on configurations.", "I recommended the classical yet famous textbook \u201cLearn Python the Hard Way\u201d to my students and readers a lot of times.", "It has provided the beginners an effective way to learn Python Programming Language. Actually, you can try to use other good textbooks as well. Just remember not only you need to read the content, but also you need to try the code line by line carefully. It may seem tedious, yet I can assure you that \u201clearn by doing\u201d is the right approach.", "If you are interested in this blog article, you may also want to read the following ones:", "I would like to thank Xiaojun Yang, my master student, for helping me to translate my original Chinese version article into English.
