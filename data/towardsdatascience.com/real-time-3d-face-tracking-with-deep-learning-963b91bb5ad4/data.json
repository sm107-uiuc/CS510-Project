I am in the digital visual effects industry so I am familiar with that magic.. and the desire to understand how it works behind the scene.", "Modifying people faces is routine work in Hollywood visual effects, it\u2019s a well understood craft nowadays, but it typically requires tens of digital artists to achieve a photorealistic face transformation. How can we automate that?", "Here\u2019s a simplified breakdown of the steps these artists follow:", "Automation of steps 2 and 3 is not very different from what happens in video games, it\u2019s relatively straightforward. Compositing can be simplified to 3D foreground over live background, easy. The challenge is the tracking, how can a program \u2018see\u2019 the complex motion of a human head?", "The Computer Science community has been trying to track faces automatically for a long time and it\u2019s hard. In the recent years, Machine Learning came to the rescue and many Deep Learning papers are published every year on the topic. I\u2019ve spent a while looking for the \u201cstate of the art\u201d and realised doing this in real-time is VERY HARD! A good reason to try and tackle the challenge (and that would work nicely with the AR beauty mode I have implemented).", "\u201ctrying to track faces.. it\u2019s hard.. doing this in real-time is VERY HARD!\u201d", "Convolutional Neural Networks are popular for visual analysis of images and commonly used for applications such as object detection and image recognition.", "For a deep neural network to be evaluated in real-time (at least 30 times per second), a compact network is desired\u00b9. With the popularity of Machine Learning and smart phones, new models are discovered every year that push the limit of efficiency \u2014 offering a trade-off between computational precision and overhead. Among such models, MobileNet, SqueezeNet and ShuffleNet are popular for applications on mobile devices, thanks to their compactness.", "ShuttleNet V2\u00b9 was recently introduced and offers state of the art performances, coming in various sizes to balance between speed and accuracy. It ships with PyTorch, one more reason to pick that model.", "Now I need to find what features the CNN should learn. A common approach is defining a list of anchor points for different key parts of the face, also called \u2018facial landmarks\u2019.", "The points are numbered and associated strategically around the eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth and jawline. I want to train the network to identify the coordinate of each point, so I can later reconstruct masks or geometric meshes based on them.", "Because I want to augment videos with 3D effects, I looked for a dataset with 3D landmark coordinates. 300W-LP is one of the few dataset that comes with 3D positions, it\u2019s pretty large and as a bonus offers a good diversity of face angles. I want to benchmark my solution against the state of the art, recent publications test their models on AFLW2000\u20133D so I go for 300W-LP for training and test on AFLW2000\u20133D for comparison.", "A note on these datasets, they are meant for the research community and generally not free for commercial use.", "Dataset augmentation improves the accuracy of the training by adding even more variations to the set that it already has. I apply the following transformations to each image and landmark, to create new ones, by a random amount: rotation up to -/+ 40\u00b0 around the centre, up to 10% translation and scale, and horizontal flip. I apply a different random transformation in memory on each image and for each learning pass (epoch) for additional augmentation.", "It\u2019s also necessary to crop the input image close to the bounding box of the landmarks for the CNN to recognise the landmarks at their relative locations. That\u2019s done as a preprocess to save on load time from disk during training.", "Typically an L2 loss function is used to measure the prediction error for landmark positions. A recent publication\u2074 describes a so-called Wing loss function, that performs better for this application, which I could verify. I parametrise it with w=10 and \u03b5 = 2 as suggested by the author and sum the result over all landmark coordinates.", "Training a deep neural network is a very expensive operation that requires powerful computers. Using my laptop would have taken weeks, literally, for one training phase and building a decent setup costs thousands of dollars. I decided to leverage the cloud so I can pay just for the compute power I need.", "I chose Genesis Cloud, that offers very competitive prices and $50 free credit to get started. I build a Linux VM with a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, prepare an OS and storage image where I setup PyTorch and upload my code and the datasets, all through ssh. Once the system is setup, it can be started and shut down on demand, creating a snapshot allows to resume the work where I left it.", "The inner training loop processes mini-batches of 32 images to maximise the parallel computation on GPU. A learning pass (epoch) process the entire set of about 60,000 images and takes about 4 minutes. The training converges around 70 epochs so I let it run overnight for 100 epochs to be safe.", "I use the popular Adam optimiser that automatically adapts the learning rate, starting with a rate of 0.001. I found that setting the initial learning rate right is critical, if it\u2019s too small the training converges too early in a sub-optimal solution. If it\u2019s too large it has difficulties converging at all. I found the value through trial and error, which is time consuming.. and actually costly when paying the cloud per use!", "All these efforts paid off, with the bigger network ShuffleNet V2 2x, I obtain a Normalised Mean Error (NME) of 2.796 on AFLW2000\u20133D. That\u2019s better than the state of the art model\u2075 on that dataset and its NME of 3.07, by a good margin, despite that model being much heavier! \ud83d\udcaa", "A comparison of the predicated landmarks with the ground truth confirms the theoretical result, the landmarks find their way with precision even for large angles (though AFLW2000\u20133D contain challenging cases with extreme angles where my model fails).", "I don\u2019t have a big CUDA GPU for inference (evaluation of the model) on my MacBook Pro. To maximise the utilisation of hardware resources I convert the model to the portable format ONNX and use the library ONNX Runtime from Microsoft that can infer the model much more efficiently on my machine (yes it runs on OSX!). The inference time is under 100ms on the CPU, which is pretty good, despite not real-time. But I keep in mind I use the biggest version of ShuffleNet V2 (2x) here for maximal precision and I can opt for a smaller one for speed (e.g. the 1x version is 4 times faster). I could also get better numbers running on GPU.", "All was set for a robust facial tracking system.. or so I thought.", "I finally get to plug the trained network to a video stream. An additional step is required in using a separate model to detect the face bounding box, so we can crop the image close to where the landmark will be, like in the training dataset. After a good amount of research, I opt to use this lightweight face detector that is very fast to evaluate yet precise (I did try others).", "Despite all my efforts, with great sadness, I find that the result on videos is not robust at all: the markers shake a lot, drift over time and don\u2019t detect eye blinks. \ud83d\ude31", "After digging further, I realised what it is. The training dataset are still photographs, not videos frames! It does seem to work well on stills, but videos are different. They represent an additional challenge: temporal consistency (and motion blur).", "As noted in this work\u2076 from University of Technology Sydney and Facebook Reality Labs, the ground truth markers from the training dataset are annotated manually on each photo, which is not very precise. Different annotators position the landmarks at slightly different locations, as illustrated above.", "Our network actually learns imprecise landmark locations \u2014 which result into random jittering in a small zone during prediction rather than exact location.", "A common approach to address this issue is to stabilise the predicted markers after the fact. To that effect, as suggested by this other publication\u2077 from Google Research, I use the 1\u20ac filter\u2078 is to smooth the motion noise. I found it gives better result than the traditional Kalman filter and is simpler to implement. I also use it to stabilise the box returned by the face detector, because it shakes a lot as well and that is not helping.", "The motion filter makes a big difference. But it\u2019s not perfect, specially with a low quality webcam like my laptop\u2019s that produce noisy videos, which the model doesn\u2019t seem to like very much.", "The paper from UTS and Facebook RL mentioned above suggests to fine-tune the trained model essentially as follow:", "I haven\u2019t tried it myself but the demo video looks promising.", "The trained network suffers with eye motion, it doesn\u2019t see eye blinks and can\u2019t fully \u2018close\u2019 the eye landmarks. The eyebrows landmarks also seem stiff in their motion compared to what they are tracking.", "My model became pretty good at predicting profiles, because there is a ton of them in the dataset (it\u2019s actually perfectly balanced in terms of face angles), but did not learned eyes that well. A CNN can perform better if the features it learns tend to live around a consistent location, that\u2019s why we have to detect the face bounding box before inference and crop around the landmarks during training: that puts the face at the centre every time.", "As the face angle varies, the features inside the face \u2014 eyes, mouth and nose \u2014 change shape and position in the frame and can even disappear at wide angle. This makes its more difficult for the model to recognise them well every time. I tried augmenting the dataset for extreme eye poses (closed, wide open), but that had little effect.", "This project was fun but costly in time and money ($15 from my pocket on top of the initial free credit of $50). It was a great opportunity to learn but I don\u2019t intend to reinvent the wheel. Since I started this journey, Google has open-sourced MediaPipe, that offers a cross-platform implementation of their model. Though initial demos of MediaPipe show some drifting, stiffness and shaking, which validates my outcomes.", "Still, I have some ideas to improve my approach (starting with the optical flow based fine-tuning mentioned above).", "To be able to build an app like Snapchat, we actually need more than a couple of 3D points. A common approach is to use a 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM) and fit it on the annotated 3D points. The dataset 300W-LP actually comes with such data. The network could learn all the vertices of the 3D model instead of a small amount of landmarks, such that a 3D face will be predicted directly by the model and ready to use for some AR fun!", "In order to improve overall precision, the aforementioned Wing loss paper, as well as the work from Google Research, suggest to predict some landmarks with a first lightweight model. Thanks to the initial information, we can crop and align the face vertically to help the second model deal with less variation of poses.", "I believe we can push that concept of specialised models further to involve multiple networks. We could train different CNNs for specific face angles, say one network for large angles (60\u00b0+), one for intermediate angles (30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0) and one for frontal angles (0\u00b0 to 30\u00b0), and somehow combine them.", "Alternatively, different networks could learn different face parts, one for the eyes, one for the mouth, etc.. with the hope that simplifying the work of a model will increase precision. A first pass could detect the rough position and orientation of the head as above then crop and align the area of interest for the relevant expert networks.", "Application of deep learning for face tracking is an active area of research where a lot of progress was made in the last couple of years. There is still room for improvement, in particular for tracking videos. The temporal coherence of predicted facial features and the precision for key areas like eyes and mouth remain a challenge.", "I am excited to see what the future holds on that topic!", "[1]: N.
