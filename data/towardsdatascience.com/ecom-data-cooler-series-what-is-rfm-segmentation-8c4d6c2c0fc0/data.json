However, most ecommerce brands today prefer applying data science to develop behavioral segmentation based on purchase behaviors. For example, what products are they viewing/buying \ud83d\uded2? What path(s) did they take to get to your website \ud83d\udccd? (awareness vs. intent). Furthermore, what is their level of engagement\ud83d\uddb1\ufe0f (usage/opens/clicks/views)?", "What\u2019s the benefit of segmentation? While there are many, I\u2019ll list my top three here:", "Grouping customers based on behavior allows contextualized marketing instead of email blasts, which in turn lowers marketing costs. By targeting a focused subset of customers (a segment!) with similar attributes, you will likely get better open rates, higher conversions, and return-on-ad-spend (ROAS). Best of all you can cater future products to your customers\u2019 tastes.", "RFM is a data modeling method used to analyze customer value. It stands for recency, frequency, and monetary, which are just three metrics that describe what your customers did. Recency measures the time (usually in days) between when your customer last ordered to today. Frequency measures how many total orders the customers had, and Monetary is the average amount they spent from those orders.", "RFM started in the days of direct marketing and remains one of the simplest and most effective tools in retail and ecommerce today. To create RFM, you need to transform your data and assign a score from high to low. Here\u2019s a simple example with three levels (High, medium, low) \u2014 sort your customers\u2019 orders in a column, and assign a score of 3 for customers with zero orders, a value of 2 for customers with one order, and 1 for customers with 2 or more orders, or repeat customers. This gives you your frequency metric. Then you repeat this process for recency and monetary. In the end, you will end up with three values, one for each pillar of RFM that describes how valuable each customer is, with one being the best.", "RFM is essential because it allows you to sort and arrange your customers from best to worst quickly, and it\u2019s highly effective in describing customer behavior. With RFM scores, you can create lots of useful customer segments. We start with MVPs that are your best customers with top scores on all three dimensions. High spending new customers that score high on recency and monetary, but low on frequency because they\u2019ve purchased only just recently. On the opposite spectrum, you have high-value churn customers who haven\u2019t purchased in a while. They will score high on recency and monetary, but low on recency. Lastly, low-value customers who get low scores on all three dimensions, and are unlikely to be worth anything. You can save money on marketing by suppressing these users AND improve open and click rates.", "Why should you care? We have seen that the top 5% of customers on average spend 10x than everyone else, and represent a third of your total revenue. Top customers tend to have higher average order value, and more likely to become loyal fans of your brand. Loyal fans tend to generate word of mouth and referrals, in term making them more valuable.", "In short, you should spend more time on making your top customers happy, and RFM can help you figure out where to focus and what to do.", "If you haven\u2019t already, start utilizing RFM to create customer segmentation for your marketing campaigns and start optimizing. You can:", "There are many more use cases for RFM. You\u2019ll be able to create more relevant, contextualized campaigns that target different customers differently. Segmentation works to improve opens and clicks, as well as bring in more marketing dollars. If you\u2019re not doing it yet, you absolutely should be. One of our customers found 20% more high-value customers to target during her annual planning thanks to RFM.", "In summary, RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary, with recency being the most important. Why? That\u2019s because online shopping is a non-contractual commercial act, with people free to come and go as they please. You can only assume a customer is \u201calive\u201d and interested in you when they\u2019ve told you so with a recent purchase.", "Find your RFM.
