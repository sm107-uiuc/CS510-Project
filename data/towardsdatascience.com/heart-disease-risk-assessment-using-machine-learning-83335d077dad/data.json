According to the WHO, an estimated 17.9 million people died from heart disease in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths. Over three quarters of these deaths took place in low- and middle-income countries.", "Of all heart diseases, coronary heart disease (aka heart attack) is by far the most common and the most fatal. In the United States, for example, it is estimated that someone has a heart attack every 40 seconds and about 805,000 Americans have a heart attack every year (CDC 2019).", "The silver lining is that heart attacks are highly preventable and simple lifestyle modifications(such as reducing alcohol and tobacco use; eating healthily and exercising) coupled with early treatment greatly improves its prognosis. It is, however, difficult to identify high risk patients because of the multi-factorial nature of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, et cetera. This is where machine learning and data mining come to the rescue.", "Doctors and scientists alike have turned to machine learning (ML) techniques to develop screening tools and this is because of their superiority in pattern recognition and classification as compared to other traditional statistical approaches.", "In this article, I will be giving you a walk through on the development of a screening tool for predicting whether a patient has 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease(CHD) using different Machine Learning techniques on the Framingham dataset .", "The code for this article can be found in my Github repository or forked directly from its companion Kaggle notebook", "The data set is publicly available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The data set provides the patients\u2019 information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors.", "2. Education: no further information provided", "5. Information on current medical condition:", "10 year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) \u2014 (binary: \u201c1\u201d, means \u201cThere is a risk\u201d, \u201c0\u201d means \u201cThere is no risk\u201d)", "The full code for this article can be found here. It is implemented in Python and different classification algorithms are used. Below is a brief description of the general approach that I employed:", "There were no duplicate entries in the data set but some had missing values and the table below gives a summary of these:", "At 9.15%, the blood glucose entry had the highest percentage of missing data. The other features have very few missing entries.", "The missing entries accounted for only 12% of the total data and could, therefore, be dropped without losing a lot of data.", "The first step was to check the distribution different attributes and this was best visualized by histograms", "It is easy to pick out the categorical and continuous variables from the distribution plots. Also, it can be seen that none of the respondents had prevalent stroke and very few were diabetic, on blood pressure medication or hypertensive. These distributions also raised the suspicion that the data set might not be properly balanced and to confirm this I compared the number of positive and negative cases and true to my suspicions there were 3179 respondents without CHD and 572 patients with CHD.", "To gain more insight into the data I checked the proportions of positive and negative cases in each category.", "Due to the imbalanced nature of the data set it was difficult to make conclusions but based on what is observed but these are the conclusions that could be drawn:", "Another interesting trend I checked for was the distribution of the ages of the people who had CHD and the number of the sick generally increased with age with the peak being at 63 years old.", "The final step was to check the correlation of the different features with the target variable and with each other as this would not only give a good estimate of the strength of the features as predictors of coronary heart disease but also reveal any co-linearity among the features.", "From the matrix, there are no features with a correlation of more than 0.5 with the 10-year risk of developing CHD and this shows that the features are poor predictors. However, the features with the highest correlation are age, prevalent hypertension and systolic blood pressure.", "Also, there are a couple of features that are highly correlated with one another and it makes no sense using both of them to building a machine learning model. These include: blood glucose and diabetes (obviously); systolic and diastolic blood pressures; cigarette smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked per day.", "The results from the correlation matrix prompt the need for feature selection. To do this I employed the Boruta Feature Selection algorithm which is a wrapper method built around the random forest classification algorithm. It tries to capture all the important, interesting features in a data set with respect to an outcome variable.", "It works in the following way:", "After running the algorithm for 100 iterations the top selected features were: Age, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, heart rate and blood glucose.", "I then calculated the odds ratio of the top features and the ten year risk of developing CHD and these were the results:", "Holding all other features constant, the odds of getting diagnosed with heart disease increases with about 2% for every increase in age an systolic blood pressure.", "The other factors show no significant positive odds.", "It is not advised to train a classifier on an imbalanced data set as it may be biased towards one class thus achieve high accuracy but have poor sensitivity or specificity.", "To address this problem. I balanced the data set using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). This is how it works:", "SMOTE first selects a minority class instance x\u00b9 at random and finds its k nearest minority class neighbors. The synthetic instance is then created by choosing one of the k nearest neighbors x\u00b2 at random and connecting x\u00b9 and x\u00b2 to form a line segment in the feature space. The synthetic instances are generated as a convex combination of the two chosen instances x\u00b2 and x\u00b9. \u2014 Page 47, Imbalanced Learning: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications, 2013.", "This procedure can be used to create as many synthetic examples for the minority class as are required. It suggests first using random undersampling to trim the number of examples in the majority class, then use SMOTE to oversample the minority class to balance the class distribution.", "After using this technique, the resultant data set was much more balanced with 3178 negative cases and 2543 positive cases", "After balancing the data set, I scaled the features to speed up the training of the classifiers and then split the data into a training and test set at a ratio of 0.8 to 0.2 respectively", "Using the training set, I trained four classifiers, i.e.,:", "2. K-nearest neighbors: Which attempts to determine what group a data point is in by looking at the data points around it. For example, given a data point C, if the majority of the points around it are in group A, then it is likely that the data point in question will belong to group A rather than B, and vice versa.", "3. Decision trees: Which is based on a tree-like graph with nodes representing the place where we pick an attribute and ask a question; edges represent the answers the to the question; and the leaves represent the actual output or class label. Decision trees classify the examples by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf node, with the leaf node providing the classification to the example. Each node in the tree acts as a test case for some attribute, and each edge descending from that node corresponds to one of the possible answers to the test case. This process is recursive in nature and is repeated for every sub-tree rooted at the new nodes.", "4. Support vector machine: Which is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data, the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples based on which side they lie in relation to it. In a two dimensional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lies on either side.", "After training each model and tuning their hyper-parameters using grid search, I evaluated and compared their performance using the following metrics:", "The support vector machine was the best performing model across all metrics. It\u2019s best parameters were a radial kernel, a C value of 10 and a gamma value of 1. Its high AUC and F1 score also show that the model has a high true positive rate and is thus sensitive to predict if one has a high risk of developing CHD , i.e., getting a heart attack within 10 years.", "This model can then be used as a simple screening tool and all that we need to do is to input ones: age, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate and blood glucose levels after which the model can be run and it outputs a prediction.", "Like all good scientists, I decided to test the tool on myself by feeding it with my personal data and here are the results:", "I can say, with 84% confidence, that I don\u2019t have a risk of developing CHD within the next 10 years \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89. I trust these predictions because I do work out, at least once in a while.", "However, as a sanity check, most of the data on the positive cases were artificially synthesized using SMOTE and as such they may not be a true representation of the actual population data thus more data, especially on the positive cases, is needed to build better models and much more potent screening tools.", "Thank you for reading.
