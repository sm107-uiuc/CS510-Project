We sometimes use them interchangeably. People usually get confused between these two terms. But there is a subtle difference between these two. And that\u2019s where the interviewer takes the step and boom! you are doomed. In this article, I\u2019ll explain what normalization and standardization are in a simple language as possible without using much of technical jargon. Their application in real life using examples, and the difference between them. So bear with me for five minutes it will be worth your time.", "It is a scaling technique method in which data points are shifted and rescaled so that they end up in a range of 0 to 1. It is also known as min-max scaling.", "The formula for calculating normalized score:", "Here, Xmax and Xmin are the maximum and minimum values of the feature respectively.", "Since numerator will become Xmin \u2013Xmin, which is nothing but 0.", "In this case, both numerator and denominator will be equal and cancel each other to give us the value of Xnew =1.", "It\u2019s too complicated, isn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s take an example and clear this out.", "In CAT (an aptitude test conducted by IIM\u2019s for the selection in top B-schools in India)too many applications are received. So they can\u2019t examine all candidates at the same time, therefore the exam is conducted in shifts or even on different days. In different shifts, the question paper set is different. Although the questions are set in such a way that the difficulty level of each shift remains the same but still there might be a possibility that difficulty level of shift varies. So it will be unfair to the candidates who got a difficult set of questions. To make it fair for all candidates the score of candidates is normalized.", "Let\u2019s say the exam is conducted in two shifts shift A and shift B and questions in shift A were relatively easy as compared to that of shift B. Because questions were relatively easy in shift A maximum marks scored by a candidate out of 300 in shift A is 280 and minimum is 80 on the other hand maximum and minimum marks scored by a candidate in shift B is 250 and 50 respectively.", "So we cannot compare the score of a candidate who scored 150 in shift A to a candidate who scored the same in shift B.", "The normalized score of a candidate who scored 150 in shift A will be calculated as follows", "For simplicity sake let\u2019s name it Xa", "The normalized score of a candidate who scored 150 in shift B will be", "For simplicity sake let\u2019s name it Xb", "If you want to compare out of 300 then", "I think now it will be clearer to understand what normalization is and why we need it.", "All right, let\u2019s jump to the second one", "Standardization is another scaling method where the values are centered around mean with a unit standard deviation. It means if we will calculate mean and standard deviation of standard scores it will be 0 and 1 respectively.", "\u00b5= mean of the given distribution", "\u03c3 = standard deviation of the given distribution", "This Z is called standard score and it represents the number of standard deviations above or below the mean that a specific observation falls.", "i.e. If Z=2, it means that the observation lies two standard deviations above the mean.", "If we plot these standard scores it will be a normal distribution with mean at 0 and the standard deviation equals to 1.", "The standard deviation with mean = 0 and \u03c3 =1 is also known as standard normal distribution and is denoted by N(0,1).", "Let\u2019s solve an example for better understanding.", "Let\u2019s assume you and your friend study in different universities where the grading system is different. You get your score of 85 in a test. The mean grade of the class is 75 and a standard deviation of 5. Your friend got a grade of 615 and the mean grade of the class is 600 with a standard deviation of 50. How you are going to say who is performing better? As grade 85 can\u2019t be compared to 615.", "Here comes the role of standardization as it allows us to compare the scores with different metrics directly and make a statement about them.", "It means you are 2 standard deviations above the average grade.", "It means you are 0.3 standard deviations above the average grade.", "By looking at standard scores you can clearly say that you are performing much better that he or she is the class.", "Wasn\u2019t that easy? I promised you.", "Which is better normalization or standardization?", "Well, that depends on the type of data you are using.", "Normalization is preferred over standardization when our data doesn\u2019t follow a normal distribution. It can be useful in those machine learning algorithms that do not assume any distribution of data like the k-nearest neighbor and neural networks.", "Standardization is good to use when our data follows a normal distribution. It can be used in a machine learning algorithm where we make assumptions about the distribution of data like linear regression etc", "Point to be noted that unlike normalization, standardization doesn\u2019t have a bounding range i.e. 0 to 1.", "It\u2019s also not influenced by maximum and minimum values in our data so if our data contains outliers it\u2019s good to go.", "I hope you got a good idea about normalization and standardization.
