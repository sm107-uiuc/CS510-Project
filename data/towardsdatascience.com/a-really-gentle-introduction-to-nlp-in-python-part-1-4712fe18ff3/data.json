NLP is a thing that everybody talks about, and it seems like everyone is doing it, besides yourself, who are lost and sad in the middle of the crowd. No worries, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a hard thing to learn, even if few people would admit it.", "In this tutorial I\u2019ll cover the basics, step by step, without long explanations (as the goal here is just to introduce the subject), also making available all the code behind (the notebook is here waiting for you), so you can follow along with me through the whole process.", "Data comes from customers reviews from an online store in Brazil, and the original datasets are available on OLIST repository. The transformed file I\u2019ve created for NLP analysis is available here. Let\u2019s check the first lines to see what is about:", "The first column is the text from reviews left by customers, and in the second column tells if it is a positive review or not, with the values of 1 in case it is, and 0 in the case it is not. You can check more details about how I merged different datasets and how the target feature was created checking this notebook.", "In this first tutorial, I will cover:", "Let\u2019s first think about the possibilities of NLP. Understand what people say about something can be a powerful tool, but language is a tricky thing to learn. Think about our own process of learning a language, how long does it take to fully assimilate it, with all different words in the vocabulary and the combination among them, doing it in a meaningful way? And, after that, we need to develop the skills to discover the subtle emotions that are hidden behind the words, the sentiment, in order to classify something as sincere, arrogant, true, false, sarcastic, etc. If it\u2019s hard for us, for a computer is way more complicated, as it just doesn\u2019t understand any word!", "Yes, it is correct, a computer understands just numbers, not words. So, how make them get what we\u2019re saying or writing? In simple terms, we need to transform words in numbers. When we do that, computers can process the information and generate powerful insights based in calculations, hence the need to this transformation prior to run any Machine Learning an algorithm in textual data.", "After we make a computer understand words, we can use Machine Learning to make predictions about these words, like building translation applications, suggestions of next words while one is typing, and also more sophisticated application, like understanding the sentiment of a text.", "The first step to make text computer friendly is to clean it. We do that so the learning process will be smoother and faster. As this article doesn\u2019t have the intention to be a comprehensive study of preprocessing techniques, I will present you the most basics ones:", "1- Punctuation: as the punctuation by itself has no meaning.", "2- Stop Words: they are the common words that appear frequently, like \u201cthe\u201d, \u201can\u201d, \u201che\u201d, \u201chimself\u201d, etc. Removing these words reduces the amount of data the algorithm needs to handle, making it faster.", "Lemmatization is the process of transforming a word on its base form. We can think the base form as the way it should appear in a dictionary, for example, in English the words \u201cwalked\u201d, \u201cwalking\u201d and \u201cwalks\u201d all came from the same root \u201cwalk\u201d, what is called the lemma for that word.", "It\u2019s interesting to note that lemmatization also is used to transform words based on its meaning, not just on the spelling. One example is \u201cbetter\u201d, which has \u201cgood\u201d as its lemma. This is a powerful tool as it helps to reduce the number of words that will need to be processed later.", "Remember when I mentioned that computers understand numbers only? Well, tokenization is precisely this process of transforming a word into a numerical representation, or a token. Tokens are very useful as they make possible the application of Machine Learning models in textual data, and there is few ways to do that.", "In python, there\u2019s a library called spacy, which comes with some very handy functions that help us to perform all this preprocessing with few lines of code. I\u2019ve created the example below so you can check it in action:", "We can see that the tokens separate each word and punctuation in individual tokens, and that the lemmas reduced the words for theirs base form. If you are a Portuguese speaker you will notice that it doesn\u2019t work that well, like converting \u201cantes\u201d (before) as \u201cantar\u201d, which has no meaning. It also didn\u2019t remove some common words like \u201ce\u201d and \u201cok\u201d. It seems that the Portuguese library is an ongoing project, so pay attention if you are going to use any package other than English, but it was a nice first approach. Please feel free to try the code with other texts and see how it works.", "So, that\u2019s it for today, I hope it helped you understand how to start with NLP.
