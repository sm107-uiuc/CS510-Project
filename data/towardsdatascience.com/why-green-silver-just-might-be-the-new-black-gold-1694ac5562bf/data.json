The paste is used within solar cells in order to collect and transmit electrons whose movement is induced by sunlight through the photoelectric effect. In effect, silver helps conduct the electrons so as to create an electrical current; and this electricity can then be stored or consumed. The superior resistivity of silver increases the potential sunlight captured, energy conducted, and ultimately the total power that is generated in a solar cell \u2014 the efficiency of solar cells is thus somewhat proportional to their silver content.", "Given the need for the global pursuit of more sustainable power sources in the face of climate change, the future of solar power and therefore solar cell production is indeed a bright one.", "Two factors provide a definite threat to the unbridled increase in Silver demand due to solar: namely, thrifting and other-technology-related efficiency increases.", "Thrifting is the process by which manufacturers try and cut down the amount of silver used so as to cut costs.

What it looks like, if that graph is to be trusted, is that we are at a turning point for the solar Silver demand. If there is indeed a physical limit to the amount of silver that will continue to be used in solar panels, then it seems that \u2014 assuming an increase of solar consumption equal or similar to our forecast \u2014 the demand for silver from the solar industry will begin to climb relatively rapidly in the future, particularly when it reaches this limit.", "What it looks like, is that we are at a turning point for the solar Silver demand.", "The above graph also seems to correspond with the past CPM Silver Yearbook data (as seen on GoldSilver\u2019s blog post):", "A biocide is defined in the European legislation as a \u201cchemical substance or microorganism intended to destroy, deter, render harmless, or exert a controlling effect on any harmful organism\u201d.", "Silver is a well know, and broad-spectrum biocide, proving to be effective in quashing a growing list of bacterial threats, including legionnaire\u2019s disease, E.
