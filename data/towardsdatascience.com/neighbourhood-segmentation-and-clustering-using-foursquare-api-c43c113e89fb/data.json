Property developers are also taking advantage of this trend to build more shopping malls to cater to the demand. As a result, there are many shopping malls in the city of Hyderabad and many more are being built. Opening shopping malls allow property developers to earn consistent rental income. As with any business decision, opening a new shopping mall requires serious consideration and is a lot more complicated than it seems. Particularly, the location of the shopping mall is one of the most important decisions that will determine whether the mall will be a success or a failure.", "The objective of this project is to analyze and select the best locations in the city of Hyderabad, India, to open a new shopping mall. This project is mainly focused on geospatial analysis of the Hyderabad City to understand which would be the best place to open a new mall. Using data science methodology and machine learning techniques like clustering, this project aims to provide solutions to answer the business question: In the city of Hyderabad, if a property developer is looking to open a new shopping mall, where would you recommend that they open it?", "To solve the problem, we will need the following data: \u2022 List of neighbourhoods in Hyderabad. This defines the scope of this project which is confined to the city of Hyderabad, the capital city of Telangana, which is in South India\u2022 Latitude and longitude coordinates of those neighbourhoods. This is required in order to plot the map and also to get the venue data \u2022 Venue data, particularly data related to shopping malls. We will use this data to perform clustering on the neighbourhoods.", "This Wikipedia page is a list of neighbourhoods in Hyderabad, with 200 neighbourhoods. I have used web scraping techniques to extract the data from the Wikipedia page, with the help of Python requests and beautifulsoup packages. Then we can get the latitude and longitude coordinates of the neighbourhoods using Python Geocoder package. After that, I have used the Foursquare API to get the venue data for those neighbourhoods.", "Foursquare API will provide many categories of the venue data, and we are particularly interested in the Shopping Mall category in order to help us solve the business problem. This is a project that will make use of many data science skills, from web scraping (Wikipedia), working with API (Foursquare), data cleaning, data wrangling, to machine learning (K-means clustering) and map visualization (Folium).", "The Foursquare API allows application developers to interact with the Foursquare platform. The API itself is a RESTful set of addresses to which you can send requests, so there\u2019s really nothing to download onto your server.", "On the left, you see all the cafes and their name, category, address of every venue in Hyderabad. On the right, you see the map of the venues on the left.", "If you click on the first one which is The Coffee Cup, then you are redirected to this page where you see all the information in the Foursquare dataset about The Coffee Cup. This includes its name, full address, working hours, tips and images that users have posted about the cafe. So similarly you can explore the shopping malls in the city of Hyderabad.", "To explore the Foursquare click here", "Perform scraping using Python requests and beautifulsoup packages to extract the list of neighbourhoods data.", "This is the data frame created after scraping the data. We need to get the geographical coordinates in the form of latitude and longitude in order to be able to use Foursquare API. To do so, we will use the Geocoder package that will allow us to convert the address into geographical coordinates in the form of latitude and longitude.", "We have obtained the latitude and longitude coordinates for all the places, so we need to merge the coordinates into the original data frame.", "This is the combined data frame which contains all the neighbourhoods along with the geographical coordinates.", "After gathering the data, we have to populate the data into a pandas DataFrame and then visualize the neighbourhoods in a map using Folium package.", "Use the foursquare API to explore the neighbourhoods", "After extracting all the venues, we have to convert the venues list into a new DataFrame.", "To know more about Foursquare documentation click here", "Here we apply one hot encoding to all the venues. So now the number of columns becomes 175", "Next, let\u2019s group rows of neighbourhood by taking the sum of the frequency of occurrence of each category.", "There are 66 shopping malls in Hyderabad which is very high. So now we have to select a suitable location where the number of shopping malls is less so that our chances of setting up a shopping mall at that location should be good.", "Now we need to cluster all the neighbourhoods into different clusters. The results will allow us to identify which neighbourhoods have a higher concentration of shopping malls while which neighbourhoods have a fewer number of shopping malls. Based on the occurrence of shopping malls in different neighbourhoods, it will help us answer the question as to which neighbourhoods are most suitable to open new shopping malls.", "We set the number of clusters to 3 and run the algorithm. After applying the K-Means clustering algorithm, all the neighbourhoods get segregated and form different clusters.", "Here the Shopping Mall column represents the number of shopping malls in that particular area and Cluster Labels represents the cluster number (either 0 or 1 or 2)", "Now here we can clearly see all the places which belong to the 1st cluster(cluster number 0). Similarly, we see all the cluster numbers in the sorted order that is 0,1,2.", "There are 132 places in cluster 0 which is the highest among the 3 clusters, and cluster 0 contains all the places which do not have a shopping mall. Cluster 1 contains 51 places and all of them contain exactly 1 shopping mall, while cluster 2 contains 15 places where all the places contain 2 or more shopping malls.", "The results from the K-means clustering show that we can categorize the neighbourhoods into 3 clusters based on the frequency of occurrence for \u201cShopping Mall\u201d:\u2022 Cluster 0: Neighbourhoods with very less number of shopping malls \u2022 Cluster 1: Neighbourhoods with a moderate concentration of shopping malls \u2022 Cluster 2: Neighbourhoods with a high concentration of shopping malls We visualize the results of the clustering in the map with cluster 0 in red colour, cluster 1 in purple colour, and cluster 2 in mint green colour.", "A good number of shopping malls are concentrated in the central area of Hyderabad city. Cluster 0 has a very low number of malls. This represents a great opportunity and high potential areas to open new shopping malls, as there is very little to no competition from existing malls. Meanwhile, shopping malls in cluster 2 are likely suffering from intense competition because of oversupply and a high concentration of shopping malls. Therefore, this project recommends property developers to capitalize on these findings to open new shopping malls in neighbourhoods in cluster 0 with little to no competition. Property developers with unique selling propositions to stand out from the competition can also open new shopping malls in neighbourhoods in cluster 1 with moderate competition. Lastly, property developers are advised to avoid neighbourhoods in cluster 2 which already have a high concentration of shopping malls and suffering from intense competition.", "So we can apply the same approach for large datasets and can easily distinguish the venues based on the category. Suppose if there are 400 restaurants in a city then we can easily segregate them into different clusters. We can apply this method not only for shopping malls but restaurants, coffee shops, and much more. In this project, we only consider one factor i.e. frequency of occurrence of shopping malls, there are other factors such as population and income of residents that could influence the location decision of a new shopping mall.", "But for setting up a shopping mall we need to consider other factors such as the cost of rent, the surroundings around the shopping mall, the kind of people in the locality-if it's a luxurious area many people prefer going out, their lifestyle will be different from others and therefore spend a lot. If we decide a place where the competition is less, then we need to consider the people living in that locality as well. If the people in that area spend a lot and love going out then it\u2019ll be a success. If the people staying near the mall don't prefer going out, then it's better to consider some other place with less competition and a good crowd.", "You can always refer to my GitHub Repository for the entire project.", "\u201cWe used to build civilizations. Now we build shopping malls.\u201d -Billy Bryson", "I hope you found the article insightful.
