As the wolves chased the deer and moose away from the rivers and valleys, the vegetation began to grow back. Smaller animals like birds and beavers began to settle next to the water, thanks to a much richer habitat. So, as in the case of Romulus and Remus, wolves can be considered as life bearers.", "Population dynamics can exhibit counter-intuitive behaviour.", "Today, the number of endangered species is on the rise. Both identifying and protecting them without jeopardizing the entire eco-system is a real challenge. This is why it is crucial that we derive the right action from early warning signals.", "\u201cTo every action there is always opposed an equal reaction.\u201d Newton\u2019s 3rd law", "Just like Newton wrote an equation explaining the relation between action and reaction, we can rely on mathematical equations to describe population dynamics. This intrinsic modelling approach reveals mechanisms at work inside a population such as the reaction to vanishing resources.", "In intrinsic models, noise terms capture environmental uncertainties", "To measure repeating patterns in population data, it is natural to seek a method like topological data analysis (TDA) that is stable and universal. Our post explores how topological features can be used to classify aperiodic and stable regimes of population growth.", "With just a few topological features, we find that it is possible to boost the performance of a simple baseline model even when significant noise is included.", "The approach we follow is inspired by the work of Pereira and de Mello. We provide code to replicate our results using the open-source library Giotto-learn.", "The farming industry suffer damage from an infamous beetle \u2014 the Tribolium flour beetle. It is so small that hundreds of samples can be found in less than a few grams of flour. When it lacks resources, this beetle relies on cannibalism to restore balance in its population. Thus, they can act as both predator and prey, making them a self contained eco-system.", "The flour beetles self regulates its population with cannibalism.", "As an attempt to reach a stable population, the beetles self-monitor the ratio of available resources per adult beetle. However, the success of this monitoring operation is not fail proof. Without any external stimulation, the adult beetle population can fluctuate endlessly by order of magnitude without ever reaching a stable population.", "First introduced in 1928 by Royal Norton Chapman, the growth model we use to simulate the population dynamics can be found in the 1970\u2019s article by Constantino et al.. We use their difference equation modelling the Tribolium flour beetle population. Our goal is to determine whether the adult beetle population is in its stable or aperiodic state.", "We show that the TDA approach separates the two cases better than in a baseline model. TDA features are highly predictive to distinguish between stable and aperiodic states in the beetle population. Furthermore they remain predictive even when the conditions in the environment are highly uncertain.", "The flour beetle is a well studied case in population dynamics exhibiting two distinct behaviours: stable and aperiodic. For many other species, such insight is not given, and finding an adequate model for their evolution is tedious.", "However, we can rely on data-science to gain insight on different modes of the population dynamics. We design an agnostic approach to cluster population time series based on similarity measures. The baseline approach is to look at each population time series as a high-dimensional vector and perform the clustering on them.", "Our approach relies on TDA to reduce the dimensionality of the problem in a way that compresses and preserves the essential patterns contained in the time series. The pipeline involves the following processing steps:", "The idea behind Takens\u2019 embedding is to embed a one-dimensional time series y(t) into a d-dimensional space. In the case of continuous data, we discretize the time series (any method will do), and we apply a sliding window method by selecting d points at \u03c4 distance from each other. These values become the coordinates of a vector representing the time window in a d-dimensional space.", "By progressively sliding the time window over the time series, and repeating this operation, we obtain a new representation of the data in dimension d.", "The Takens\u2019 embedding gives us a new perspective revealing otherwise hidden patterns.", "This embedding requires tuning parameters such as the embedding dimension d or the time delay \u03c4. Both can either be found experimentally or by minimizing a problem specific loss function.", "In giotto-learn, the time delay \u03c4 is obtained from the built-in minimization of the time-delayed mutual information.", "We study the shape and connectivity of this point cloud using the Vietoris-Rips (VR) algorithm. The VR algorithm connects two points when two balls (centered at each point) of increasing radius intersect. Such a procedure lets us observe the merging of connected components, as well as the creation and collapse of a hole (the circle). The following GIF illustrates the concept in a 2D setting:", "The persistence diagram summarizes the topological information contained in the sequence of graphs produced by the VR algorithm. This summarization consists in a couple (b,d), where b and d denote the radius at which the topological features (component/hole/void) appear and disappear, respectively.", "Persistence diagrams provide qualitative information about the point cloud, but they are not vectors! This is why we cannot use them directly as features. There are many ways to turn persistence diagrams into feature vectors, for example using the distance between two persistence diagrams (which there are many examples of). We use", "We apply k-means clustering with k=2 on the resulting TDA features.", "TDA features contain performance boosting information not available in the intrinsic model.", "The TDA approach, using only the described features, always outperforms the baseline made with 120 features. The homogeneity score of the baseline continuously decreases with the addition of noise to the environment. Once the mean of the standard deviation of the noise reaches 0.5, the baseline approach only finds a single cluster.", "The TDA approach also suffers an early decrease in performance, which can be explained by the increasing similarity between the two cases. When further increasing the noise, the performance recovers, which indicates that looking through the TDA lens, the two cases become distinct again. We can verify this by looking at the persistence diagrams of three sample cases:", "TDA features are performance boosting and noise resistant", "To understand how we can identify different clusters in an ensemble of time series, TDA offers relevant features to compress the main characteristics of the time series while remaining robust to noise. In our case, nine features sufficed to boost the performance by orders of magnitude.", "Your home for data science.
