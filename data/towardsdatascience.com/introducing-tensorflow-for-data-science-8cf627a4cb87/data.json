Actually, we all use TensorFlow so often without realizing it\u2019s use: Google Photos or Google voice, you are using TensorFlow models indirectly, they work on large clusters of Google hardware and are powerful in perceptual tasks.", "TensorFlow has over 150K GitHub stars and about a whopping 83.2K GitHub forks.

So, let\u2019s first understand what TensorFlow is made of:", "Data for machine learning generally requires computation in some form and therefore, we often see data representation done numerically. To define a tensor: it is a container that can house data in N dimensions.", "In a nutshell, tensors are mathematical objects used to describe physical properties like scalars and vectors. In fact, from what I learned, tensors are merely a generalization of scalars and vectors; a scalar is a zero-rank tensor, while a vector is a first-rank tensor. You can determine the rank of a tensor by the number of directions required to represent it. That also signified by the dimensionality of the array.", "Now that we know what a tensor is, let\u2019s understand the Flow part of TensorFlow:", "A computational graph is an entity defined as a directed graph where each node corresponds to certain mathematical operations. Basically, computational graphs are a mean of expressing and evaluating some mathematical expression at each node.", "Machine Learning is the call of hour and so, various companies from a wide range of industries need tools and resources to implement ML and solve their biggest problems. From healthcare to social networks and e-commerce, TensorFlow is used by everyone and for many things!", "When I started learning more in-depth, the first thing I researched is the prevalence and usage of TensorFlow in the world, and the perfect webpage for case studies, use cases, and popularity is https://www.tensorflow.org/about/case-studies.
