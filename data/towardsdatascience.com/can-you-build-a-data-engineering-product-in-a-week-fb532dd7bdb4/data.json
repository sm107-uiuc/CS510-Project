As you\u2019ll see below, I got lots of value from their Summer Camp. I hope this posts helps others to benefit from the value that Peter & Daniel are trying to bring to the world.", "I know Peter from my time at Data Science Retreat, where he combined business acumen with a genuine care for the success of students. I\u2019ve only met Daniel online, and it was clear from the Summer Camp that his combination of technical expertise, experience and teaching approach will be massively valuable to new data engineers.", "It\u2019s an exciting team, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing Pipeline establish themselves in Berlin \u2014 consider me a fan.", "The Summer Camp was a one week course in data engineering, held online in May 2020, when much of the world\u2019s population was in lockdown.", "The effects of corona have been felt worldwide \u2014 yet there is opportunity in this crisis. Pipeline have shown already they are capable of seeing opportunity in a crisis.", "It\u2019s not easy to teach online \u2014 the last few months at [Data Science Retreat] were spent developing a coronavirus strategy for the school, including how to deliver classes online. The course content (mainly lectures over slides) was delivered skillfully and technically relevant. Students all felt comfortable enough to ask questions, which is a sign of a well delivered class.", "The course is a great example of a lean approach \u2014 a minimum viable product with lots of customer feedback. It\u2019s great to be a part of, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing Pipeline expand their offering in data engineering education.", "The course was delivered remotely via Zoom & Slack \u2014 roughly half teaching time, half project work. The goal of the course was simple \u2014 build a data engineering product in a week.", "Yes! During the week we had a simple data product running locally, built from:", "Later on, technical debt was repaid and the app was deployed:", "You can see the deployed app on PythonAnywhere \u2014 you can also see the source on GitHub. You can see me deploying the app on PythonAnywhere below:", "As someone who has taught data science for a while, the most impressive thing was the simplicity of the stack. It is very easy when teaching to complicate things for students, or to teach complex tools that confuse more than help.", "It can\u2019t be understated the power of leaving after five days with a working product. The value of being able to see and interact with your data is huge, for spotting problems with your data pipeline to showing off to customers (or employers!).", "The use of SQLite was a highlight for me \u2014 I had no idea how widespread it is (that it is available at /usr/bin/sqlite3, or runs on many mobile phones). Technology that has no setup/install cost is great. SQLite isn't the best database choice for all problems, but it's great to know it is a defensible choice for new projects.", "Another was the usefulness of Makefiles to build DAGs. I was familiar with the idea of DAGs from Airflow & Tensorflow \u2014 it\u2019s great to know that I can do something similar semantically using make & Makefile.", "There were a few other tools taught on the course, including Datasette & GitHub Actions \u2014 playing with these is on my TODO.", "I\u2019ve also been able to use lessons & learnings in other projects such as the climate-news-db. It\u2019s also given me a stack (Python, Flask, SQLite, PythonAnywhere, Jinja & Bootstrap) that allows full stack, agile data science.", "Alongside the project work was more traditional tutorial content. The technical content was opinionated (without being religious), and full of useful perspectives on data engineering:", "A particularly useful insight was enriching data to make it valuable to the business \u2014 including a brilliant example of converting a UNIX timestamp to data with semantic meaning and value:", "There was also a strong emphasis on being pragmatic, avoiding absolutes and realizing there aren\u2019t one size fits all solutions:", "If you are someone considering transitioning into a data professional (especially as a data engineer), consider data engineering with Pipeline Data Engineering Academy.", "Your home for data science.
