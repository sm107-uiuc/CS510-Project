We are unsure how to make heads or tails of either macro- or micro-economic factors confronting us. At a personal level, people are dealing with a lot of issues such as lay-offs, pay-cuts, lockdowns and risk of infection (especially for all those who are now engaged with medical and other essential services in this period, thank you!).", "At the same time, we cannot help but ponder about the macro-factors such as the government measures to flatten the curve, resurgence of stock-markets ( see Fig1) and worst of all, whether there is any follow-on recession looming in the near future.", "Lately, there are quite a few forecasts and scenarios on how the events will unfold in India. An important and a common denominator in most of the forecasts and scenarios is the consumer sentiment during the lockdown and post-lockdown. While most of those reports relied on surveying individuals about specific consumption choices, I wanted to form a point of view on the pulse of sentiment in India by tapping into one of the best social media platforms available- Twitter", "When I logged into Twitter, I saw the text box with the prompt asking me \u201cWhat\u2019s happening\u201d. Appreciating the irony, I thought to myself..", "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I wanted to know\u2026 what\u2019s happening on Twitter\u201d?", "Millions of Indians are tweeting every day to express themselves to the world. Not just individuals, but organisations, media companies, government offices and celebrities are all using Twitter to voice their opinions to the world. With just 280 characters, we try to use them judiciously to say what we want. So the tweets from the users would depict a crisp, accurate and specific representation of how they feel and what they think. So that was my motivation behind this article\u2026to build an extensive dataset of tweets related to COVID and India to get a sense of the current zeitgeist.", "Just after I wrote my first article exploring the content strategy of Netflix using NLP, I decided to apply another NLP technique \u2014 sentiment analysis to map what\u2019s the current sentiment and how has it been evolving in the recent few days in India. The cumbersome part of the entire exercise, as you can already guess, was collecting the data- it involved creating an app on Twitter Developer platform to request the necessary API tokens and permissions for extracting tweets. Using those APIs, I extracted 20,000 tweets every-day since the last 11 days, from April 5, 2020, to 15th of April, 2020. I have anchored my search around two main key words \u201cCovid\u201d and \u201cIndia\u201d.", "After downloading 220,000 tweets in the last 11 days, I removed all the stand-alone retweets to avoid double counting and use only original tweets. I am left with 35,311 original tweets containing about ~500,000 words. Each original tweet has its total corresponding count of retweets. These 35,311 original tweets as of 15th April, 2020 have 1,52,756 retweets. I have bifurcated the analysis into a) based on what people are posting (original tweets alone) and b) overall sentiment prevalent in India ( weighing in the corresponding retweets of the original tweets). The first thing that I wanted to know is the same thing all of us check after posting a tweet or status on Facebook\u2026", "How many retweets did I get for a tweet(in the dataset)?", "After removing stand-alone retweets, I plotted the following distribution which shows the original tweets and their corresponding retweet count in the dataset.", "On average, every original tweet has been retweeted 4 times in the last 11 days.", "7th and 8th April have the highest retweet ratio- every original post has been retweeted 7 times on an average.", "13th April has the highest count of original tweets in the sample but lowest retweet ratio in the last 10 days. On 13th April, it seems that the people were busy typing in more posts and retweeting less compared to other days. Quite a few of those tweets were about speculating about the lockdown announcement on 14th Morning 10:00 am. Here are a couple of examples from the tweets on 13th April 2020.", "\u201cThere is speculation that the Centre may extend the #lockdown, scheduled to end on 14 April\u201d", "Now let\u2019s look at the content of the texts that people type to create an index to measure overall sentiment. In the spirit of creating something along the lines of \u201cVolfefe index\u201d, I used the AFINN lexicon with 2477 words and sentiment score on a scale of -5 to +5 against each word. For example, words such as \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cawful\u201d have a score of -3, and words such as \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201cmotivated\u201d have a score of +2.", "Using the text of the tweets to extract words as tokens and cleaning the https links out of the data, I computed the overall sum of sentiment scores to arrive at the \u201cOP-sentiment-score\u201d. OP is a common term used on Reddit to refer to the original poster. It measures the sentiment of those who are posting these tweets.", "For considering the overall sentiment on Twitter, I weighted each observation in the original tweet by the(1+ retweet count )*. I weighted the OP-sentiment-score with the corresponding retweet count and the original post itself to calculate the \u201cPrevalent-sentiment-score\u201d. The latter indicates the overall sentiment as it measures to what extent the sentiment is retweeted by all the other users.", "Interesting findings from sentiment scores in Fig 3:", "If we view Twitter as a market where sentiments are exchanged, the market seems to reward negative sentiment more than positive sentiment in the last 10 days", "If you are wondering if it is a bit too reductionistic to convert a complex human sentiment into a unitary value, then I concur with you. So I wanted to use a lexicon that deconstructs those sentiments into emotions and look at how the emotions are changing every day. I downloaded the NRC (National Research Council Canada) lexicon* which has 13,901 word-emotion and word-sentiment associations. The emotions in the dataset are fear, anger, trust, sadness, disgust, anticipation, joy and surprise. A word can have multiple emotion associations.", "I extracted the tokens as words from the 35,311 original tweets and mapped the word-emotion associations and sentiment (positive or negative) associations to every word in those tweets. Similar to the index approach, I mapped the emotions of all the original tweets to get the OP-emotional undercurrent and weighed it by its corresponding retweet count to get the Prevalent Emotional undercurrent in India.", "So what\u2019s going on in the minds of people who are posting these tweets in the last 11 days? Adding up the count of times an emotion repeats across all the tweets in a given day, I arrived at the emotion score for the day. The following figure plots the various emotion scores of all the posts in the last 11 days.", "The following pattern emerges in terms of commonly observed emotions in tweets posted: Trust > Fear> Anticipation > Anger > Sadness > Joy > Suprise > Disgust ( in descending order)", "After weighing the count of emotions with retweet count, I computed the weighted emotion scores for all the emotions.", "I have attached the emotion and also sentiment scores for both OP and prevalent tweets based on NRC lexicon in the appendix. Those of you who are interested can check it out in the end.", "The words associated with trust , fear and anticipation (in that order) are more common in both posted and also their corresponding retweets, compared to other emotions \u2014 anger, sadness, disgust, joy and suprise", "I have plotted network map of bigrams connected at common words as nodes to identify top theme by classifying the bigrams into a few themes. This is similar to the approach I used in my previous article.", "What are the top themes in tweets posted?[OP]", "What are the top themes that have been retweeted more?[Prevalent]", "In this network map, I have weighed the count of bigrams with count of retweets to identify top bigrams.", "(1) While the people are posting tweets with positive sentiments, the twitter audience seems to reward negative sentiment much more than positive sentiment reversing the overall polarity to negative.", "(2) Overlaying the emotion analysis with the network of bigrams, it appears that the tweets posted and retweeted in the last 11 days reflect mainly a sense of trust in the government and medical institutions. But, fear and anticipation about the COVID and the future, are also very common.", "As individuals posting tweets or opinions, each of us seems to have a positive outlook even in this dire situation. McKinsey report on consumer sentiment during the coronavirus crisis, also indicates a majority (56%) of surveyed members are optimistic about economic recovery when asked to rate their confidence level on economic conditions.", "If we are posting positive tweets and report an optimistic outlook on economic scenario when asked individually, then why do we retweet tweets with negative sentiment much more than positive tweets? I can only surmise that the tweets with negative sentiment are more likely to get our attention and evoke a response (retweeting) within us.", "From what I observe, it seems although we are faced with fear and anticipation about the Coronavirus and the future, the trust in the Government of India to address the Corona crisis supersedes all such fears and anticipation emotions. At this point, I hope that the same level of trust transcends to optimism and confidence about the economic recovery post the crisis.", "Disclaimer: All views expressed in this article are those of Srinivas Vadrevu, hereby referred to as \u201cauthor\u201d, and do not represent the opinions of any entity whatsoever with which the author has been, is now, or will be affiliated.
