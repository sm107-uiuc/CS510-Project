I am eternally grateful for the hard work done by the folks at Hugging Face to enable the public to easily access and use Transformer models. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done without you guys!", "I believe it\u2019s fair to say that the success of Transformer models have been nothing short of phenomenal in advancing the field of Natural Language Processing. Not only have they shown staggering leaps in performance on many NLP tasks they were designed to solve, pre-trained Transformers are also almost uncannily good at Transfer Learning. This means that anyone can take advantage of the long hours and the mind-boggling computational power that has gone into training these models to perform a countless variety of NLP tasks. You don\u2019t need the deep pockets of Google or Facebook to build a state-of-the-art model to solve your NLP problem anymore!", "Or so one might hope. The truth is that getting these models to work still requires substantial technical know-how. Unless you have expertise or at least experience in deep learning, it can seem a daunting challenge. I am happy to say that my previous articles on Transformers (here and here) seem to have helped a lot of people get a start on using Transformers. Interestingly, I noticed that people of various backgrounds (linguistics, medicine, and business to name but a few) were attempting to use these models to solve problems in their own domain. However, the technical barriers that need to be overcome in order to adapt Transformers to specific tasks are non-trivial and may even be rather discouraging.", "This conundrum was the main motivation behind my decision to develop a simple library to perform (binary and multiclass) text classification (the most common NLP task that I\u2019ve seen) using Transformers. The idea was to make it as simple as possible, which means abstracting away a lot of the implementational and technical details. The implementation of the library can be found on Github. I highly encourage you to look at it to get a better idea of how everything works, although it is not necessary to know the inner details to use the library.", "To that end, the Simple Transformers library was written so that a Transformer model can be initialized, trained on a given dataset, and evaluated on a given dataset, in just 3 lines of code! Let\u2019s see how it\u2019s done, shall we?", "A quick look at how to use this library on the Yelp Reviews dataset.", "(Bash users can use this script to download the dataset)", "Nothing fancy here, we are just getting the data in the correct form. This is all you have to do for any dataset.", "With the data in order, it\u2019s time to train and evaluate the model.", "For making predictions on other text, TransformerModel comes with a predict(to_predict) method which given a list of text, returns the model predictions and the raw model outputs.", "For more details on all available methods, please see the Github repo. The repo also contains a minimal example of using the library.", "The default args used are given below. Any of these can be overridden by passing a dict containing the corresponding key/value pairs to the init method of TransformerModel. (See example below)", "To override any of these, simply pass in a dictionary with the appropriate key/value pair to the TransformerModel.", "For an explanation of what each argument does, please refer to the Github repo.", "Update: See docs for current args.", "That\u2019s all folks! The easiest way to use Transformer models that I know of.", "Your home for data science.
