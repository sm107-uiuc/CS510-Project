Luckily for you, there are tons of online resources that will help you achieve these goals.", "Many machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) frameworks exist, but in this article I will only consider the four most recurrent ones that use Python, namely Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch. Some of them serve different purposes, some are more useful than others depending on your goals and your personal investment, some are better for result interpretability, etc. Let\u2019s review together the major points that will help you answer this important question:", "As a beginner, which ML framework should I use?", "Each framework is open-source, and other frameworks are of course available, some of which you can get acquainted with in this article.", "You will read this a lot as you learn more about ML, but the framework and models you end up using to perform a task should depend on that task\u2019s nature. If you want to predict people\u2019s opinion in movie reviews, then a deep learning approach using Keras or PyTorch makes sense, and if you want to predict the price of future NBA game tickets, then scikit-learn\u2019s ability to crunch structured data is all you need.", "If you are into academic research and want to dive into complex modeling, then TF and PyTorch are made for you, go for it! In contrast, building minimalist yet sturdy architectures codable in 5 minutes, trainable in 2 minutes and deployable in 10 minutes is possible with Keras and scikit-learn. This brings me to my next point:", "When I first started learning about ML and AI in a university course, the assignments were using PyTorch and we were asked to code regularization functions, which at the time seemed insanely complicated and made me naturally switch to something simpler to build neural networks: Keras.", "The point is that not all frameworks are equally easy to pick up. For instance, you can build and train a simple model in about three lines of code with scikit-learn:", "This will not give you the best results, but starting simple is the key to a proficient learning curve. You will then capitalize on your basic knowledge and explore other models, tweak parameters, and perhaps move on to something more complex and challenging.", "In contrast, starting by implementing an end-to-end TensorFlow or PyTorch model can be a bit tricky and overwhelming at first.", "This point may seem obvious, but believe me, it is rather common for beginners to think that they need to thoroughly examine each framework\u2019s source code in order to be hired as an ML engineer or data scientist. Flooding your brain with too much information will likely impede your capacity to solve problems, which is not what we want, is it?", "A far more interesting way of spending your time is to learn fundamental concepts that will help you get a better understanding of which specific parts of a framework you should be familiar with in order to solve your problem. For example, you will at some point use scikit-learn\u2019s metric functions to evaluate your models\u2019 performance, however it does not mean that you should know all available metric functions by heart to do good.", "Thank you for reading, I hope this was informative to you and that I managed to guide you in the right direction!", "Your home for data science.
