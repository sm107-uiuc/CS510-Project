It suggests that words are an inefficient form of communication when in fact the opposite is true. When humans use language to communicate, so much is left out because the speaker and listener share experience of the same world, which makes explicit statements about that shared world unnecessary in everyday speech. For example, if I say to you \u201cthe vase is on its side, rolling along the table,\u201d I don\u2019t need to also tell you that the vase is made of fragile stuff (it\u2019s a reasonable assumption that it is), or that the table doesn\u2019t have edges that will stop the vase\u2019s rolling, or that as a result the vase will likely roll off the table, or that gravity will make the vase to fall to the floor, which is hard and will therefore cause the fragile vase to shatter. It\u2019s enough for me to say \u201cthe vase is on its side, rolling along the table\u201d for you to know the vase will likely smash to pieces unless someone intervenes.", "What we leave out of our talk is all the knowledge that we can reasonably assume that our listeners also possess. Quite literally, an entire world is left out, and that\u2019s what makes Natural Language Processing (NLP), the field concerned with getting machines to make sense of language, so difficult. While a picture may be worth a thousand words, they are mostly words that nobody would ever bother to utter. Imagine a picture of a dog running for a ball in a park. If you were looking at such a picture and were asked to describe what you saw, would you mention that the grass is green? That\u2019s the kind of information that comes for free in image recognition tasks, but is totally absent from the data used for NLP tasks.", "To my mind, these facts make NLP by far the most interesting area in Artificial Intelligence. Currently, machines have no knowledge at all of the world, and as a result no ability to truly understand language. So all the incredible advances in NLP recently, such as the great leaps in Machine Translation capability, have happened in spite of this lack of understanding. This raises two interesting questions:", "We can\u2019t know the answer to the first question, although it\u2019s an interesting one to explore. Does imbuing computers with knowledge of the world, i.e., commonsense knowledge, amount to creating so-called Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)? Or are there ways of supplying such knowledge that stop short of AGI but are sufficient to the task of Natural Language Understanding (NLU)? Perhaps knowledge graphs are the key? Or maybe it\u2019s something else entirely. DARPA recently launched the Machine Common Sense program to tackle exactly this problem. It\u2019s also a primary focus of the Allen Institute for AI. While I agree that such research is immensely important for getting a handle on the scope of the problem and how to measure progress towards solving it, I must confess to being skeptical about practical or useful outcomes here. And as someone who works in industry and is looking to solve current business problems using NLP, I can\u2019t help finding the second question much more compelling. We need to be able to recognise the limits of NLP in the absence of true understanding, because that\u2019s the actual state of play on the ground today.", "Looking at current NLP applications, Machine Translation (MT) is one that is widely used. Google Translate translates more than 100 billion words per day right now, so it\u2019s clearly providing useful translations. But it\u2019s not going to take over completely from human translators any time soon (in fact, the US bureau of labor statistics predicts much higher than average employment growth for translators and interpreters between now and 2026). Formal translations, where the text in the target language must be of as high quality as the input \u2014 as in the case of legal documents, or literature \u2014 still require human translators. There are certain types of blunders that are commonly made by MT systems and without NLU these can\u2019t be reliably guarded against. One example is pronouns (\u201che\u201d, \u201cshe\u201d, \u201cit\u201d, \u201chis\u201d, \u201chers\u201d, \u201cthey\u201d, \u201ctheir\u201d, etc.), which are notoriously difficult for MT. Cognitive Scientist Douglas Hofstadter wrote last year about what he called the \u201cshallowness\u201d of Google Translate, pointing to its inability to \u201cunderstand\u201d what it\u2019s translating. Many of Hofstadter\u2019s examples involve mistranslations of pronouns. The reason these cases are so difficult for MT is that to translate a pronoun correctly, you have to know what it\u2019s referring to. We humans perform this task so easily using our knowledge of the world that we hardly even notice we\u2019re doing it. But that\u2019s precisely the skill that machines lack.", "Gendered pronouns make the problem especially clear. In some languages, there are no gendered pronouns at all; in others, such as French, the gender of a possessive pronoun agrees with the noun, not with the possessor as in English: the correct translation of the French \u201csa maison\u201d into English could be either \u201chis house\u201d or \u201cher house\u201d, depending on whose house we\u2019re talking about. While some simple heuristics can help in many cases (e.g., assuming that the pronoun refers to the last mentioned noun), decades of AI research have revealed the general inadequacy of rule-based approaches to natural language. Furthermore, gendered pronouns are probably the most obvious place where bias shows itself in MT applications. You may have seen examples of Turkish sentences translated into English where a genderless pronoun becomes gendered according to what the noun is: \u201che\u201d for a doctor, \u201cshe\u201d for a nurse, and so on. Even giving a massive hint as to what the correct gendered pronoun should be, Google Translate today still defaults to biased guesses:", "Seen as an AI problem, this pronoun problem is difficult to solve. Progress to date has mostly come in the form of establishing ways to measure progress on it (see e.g., the GLUE benchmark and the Winograd Schema Challenge). But seen as a software application problem, the pronoun problem is actually easy to solve. In this case, the software application in question is a translation app, and the solution is simply to offer the user a choice of translations in the UI: either \u201che is a doctor\u201d or \u201cshe is a doctor\u201d. To the human user, the answer is obvious and simple. So why not let the user decide? As it happens, that\u2019s exactly the change Google announced recently in their post, Reducing gender bias in Google Translate. But from the screenshot above it\u2019s clear that the solution has only been partially implemented. If you just enter a sentence like the Turkish \u201co bir doktor\u201d, you\u2019ll get the two gender-specific options, but it seems that if you provide any context at all, the system still trusts itself, so to speak, to guess the correct pronoun from the context. But that\u2019s precisely what it can\u2019t be trusted to get right, for the reasons outlined above.", "Something interesting to note about this example is that when there\u2019s no context given, multiple answers are correct, and if a system makes a guess and picks one of them it might simply show off its bias, but it won\u2019t be incorrect. But when context is provided, there\u2019s really only one correct answer, and choosing the other answer will not only (in some cases) show off bias, it\u2019ll just be patently wrong. So it seems to me that it\u2019s actually more important for the system not to guess when context is provided, because in that case it risks a bad translation. And yet Google chose only to implement the fix where just one problem is solved, i.e., the problem of perpetuating gender stereotypes. But it left the problem of mistranslations unaddressed.", "Certainly with longer pieces of text it becomes less feasible to offer separate translations, but in these cases problematic pronouns could at least be flagged in some way for the user to handle. In the case of an API call, the caller could specify how they should be handled. The important point is that a straight-up engineering solution is what\u2019s required here, not an AI solution (because currently there isn\u2019t one).", "Yoshua Bengio, a core figure in the history of Deep Learning (and in particular, Deep Learning for NLP), was recently asked in a survey of NLP experts about the current direction of the field and the biggest unsolved problems. In response, he spoke about the need for \u201cgrounded language learning\u201d and \u201ccommonsense understanding\u201d and was critical of current purely data-driven approaches that attempt to make progress without these key elements. He even claimed that attempts to train models that really understand language will be futile \u201cif we do not also solve the harder problem of building world models, i.e., models which understand how our world works, with humans and other agents in it. We need instead to bite the bullet and go for the bigger prize of solving AI altogether with NLP.\u201d", "While academic researchers may start to aim for this bigger prize, those of us in industry looking to solve business problems with NLP today need to make do with the techniques that we already have at our disposal, limited as they may be. Neural Network based approaches to NLP have proven to be an enormous step forward when it comes to tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and of course machine translation. These methods learn useful numeric representations of words and phrases by consuming vast amounts of text data. The architectures involved in training these systems are getting ever more sophisticated, and pre-trained representations and models are being made available for general use. This is all great, but the sophistication of these models and architectures cannot overcome their inherent limitations: the lack of understanding remains and will inevitably produce errors. Designing applications that use these techniques must include designing for the mistakes they\u2019ll make, even if it means providing a UI that is upfront about the application\u2019s lack of intelligence. I\u2019m betting users will value that honesty, not to mention the improved usefulness of the application.", "Your home for data science.
