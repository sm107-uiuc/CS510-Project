That article can be found here.", "The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is a group that follows a jihadist doctrine of Sunni Islam. ISIS grew to fame in 2014 when it took over key cities in Iraq. Since then, the monitoring and prevention of ISIS influence have been a key goal of the United States and others.", "Over the years ISIS has been using social networks to spread its message and recruit advocates for its cause. From pro-ISIS content to graphic materials such as executions, the use of the internet has been a prime tool of the terrorist group. These social networks have even been used to recruit members from Western countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.", "Understanding the network of pro-ISIS Twitter accounts can help uncover who the primary actors are, how content propagates through the network, and improve the monitoring of ISIS activities.", "The dataset used and data preprocessing measures are identical to those used previously. This process is outlined again below.", "The data used for this analysis was provided by Data Society on the website data.world. The dataset was collected from 2015 to 2017 and contains 17,000 tweets from over 100 pro-ISIS accounts. Features collected include:", "name, username, description, location, number of followers at the time the tweet was downloaded, number of statuses by the user when the tweet was downloaded, date and timestamp of the tweet, and the tweet itself", "The dataset can be found here.", "In order to build a network graph of the Twitter accounts, a node list and edge list must be created. The graph will visualize connections between accounts through mentions. Twitter mentions are embedded in the text of a tweet using the @ symbol followed by a user\u2019s username. In order to generate the node and edge lists a Python script was used to extract mentions from a tweet and create edges between the user who tweeted and the mentioned user. Both the node and edge list were then fed into the network graphing program Gephi for analysis.", "In order to identify different subcommunities within the pro-ISIS Twitter community a community detection algorithm within Gephi was used. The algorithm was set up to use weights and randomize. In addition, a resolution of 1 was used, which determines the number of communities.", "The community detection algorithm classified nodes in one of seventeen communities. In order to visualize these communities, the nodes were color-coded based off their classified community. The graph was organized using the OpenOrd layout function. The resulting graph can be seen below.", "As can be seen in the above graph, there appear to be a couple of communities that make up a substantial portion of the network. Let's take a look at these communities individually.", "Community 5 is the largest community in the network containing 43.15% of nodes. The community is denoted by the teal color and can be seen in isolation below.", "Community 11 is the second-largest community in the network containing 14.68% of nodes. The percentage of nodes contained in this community is much less than the largest community \u2014 community 5. This means that the network is made up of a dominant community with the inclusion of many smaller communities linked to it. Community 11 is denoted by the color orange and can be seen in isolation below.", "Removing the largest community in the network (community 5) allows for easier analysis of the smaller communities. This graph can be seen below.", "Even with the removal of community 5, the smaller communities still seem relatively well connected. However, several communities are completely separated from the graph, known as connected components. These are communities 15, 8, 13, 10, 17, and 16. A graph showing only these communities can be seen below.", "Understanding which communities are most influential in the network can help aid in limiting the ability for information to propagate through it. Targeting nodes that belong to the small connected components, for example, would likely have little effect on the network as a whole. This becomes more powerful when combined with the node centrality analysis from part one to identify key actors from within important communities to target for removal from the network.", "Your home for data science.
