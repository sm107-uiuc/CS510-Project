We share four key tactics for turning your remote data team into a force multiplier for your entire company.", "It\u2019s month 6 (or is it 72? It\u2019s hard to tell) of the global pandemic, and despite the short commute from your bedroom to the kitchen table, you\u2019re still adjusting to this new normal.", "Your team is responsible for all the same tasks (handling ad-hoc queries, fixing broken pipelines, implementing new rules and logic, etc.), but troubleshooting broken data has only gotten harder. It\u2019s difficult enough to identify the root cause of a data downtime incident when you\u2019re all 5 feet away from each other; it\u2019s 10 times harder when you\u2019re working on different time zones.", "Distributed teams aren\u2019t novel, in fact, they\u2019ve become increasingly common over the last few decades, but working during a pandemic is new for everyone. While this shift widens the geographic talent pool, collaborating at this scale entails unforeseen hurdles, particularly when it comes to working with real-time data.", "Your daily standup only gets you so far.", "Here are 4 essential steps to managing a great distributed data team:", "Information about which tables and columns are \u201cgood or bad\u201d breaks down when teams are distributed. One data scientist we spoke with at a leading e-commerce company told us that it takes 9 months of working on a team to develop a spidey-sense for what data lives where, which tables are the \u2018right\u2019 ones, and which columns are healthy vs. experimental.", "The answer? Consider investing in a data catalog or lineage solution. Such technologies provide one source of truth about a team\u2019s data assets, and make it easy to understand formatting and style guidelines for data input. Data catalogs become particularly important when data governance and compliance come into play, which is top of mind for data teams in financial services, healthcare, and many other industries.", "It\u2019s important to ensure alignment not just among data team members but with data consumers (i.e., marketing, executives, or operations teams), too. To do so, we suggest taking a page out of the site reliability engineering book and setting and align clear service level agreements (SLAs) and service level objectives (SLOs) for data. SLAs for expectations around data freshness, volume, and distribution, as well as other pillars of observability, will be crucial here.", "Katie Bauer, a Data Science Manager at Reddit, suggests distributed data teams maintain a central document with expected delivery dates for important projects, and review that document weekly.", "\u201cInstead of pinging my team for updates throughout the week when questions arise from stakeholders, I can easily visit this document for answers,\u201d she said. \u201cThis keeps us focused on delivering our work and avoids unnecessary diversions.\u201d", "Investing in self-serve data tools (including cloud warehouses like Snowflake and Redshift, as well as data analytics solutions, like Mode, Tableau, and Looker) will streamline data democratization no matter the location or persona of the data user.", "Similarly, self-serve versioning control systems helps everyone stay on the same page when it comes to collaborating on larger workflows, which becomes extremely important when it comes to leveraging real-time data across time zones.", "Industries that are responsible for managing PII and other sensitive customer information, like healthcare and financial services, have a low tolerance for mistakes. Data teams need confidence that data is secure and accurate across their pipeline, from consumption to output. The right processes and procedures around data reliability can prevent such data downtime incidents and restore trust in your data.", "For many years, data quality monitoring was the primary way in which data teams caught broken data, but this isn\u2019t cutting it anymore, particularly when real-time data and distributed teams are the norm. Our remote-first world calls for a more comprehensive solution that can seamlessly track the five pillars of data observability and other important data health metrics tailored to the needs of your organization.", "We hope these tips help you accept and even embrace the data world\u2019s new normal.", "On top of this more tactical advice, however, it never hurts to remember that it\u2019s OK to not be OK. Emilie Schario, GitLab\u2019s first data analyst who is now an internal strategy consultant, put it best: \u201cThis is not normal remote work. What it takes to be successful during a period of forced remote work in a global pandemic is different from what it means to be remote-as-usual.\u201d", "We\u2019d love to hear your advice for leading distributed teams!
