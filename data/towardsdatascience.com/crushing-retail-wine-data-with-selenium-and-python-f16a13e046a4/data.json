We\u2019ll approach it in simple investigative terms (Who, What, Why, Where and How), as setting a strategy for your scrape will help you get through the process that much faster.", "We\u2019ll also share some tips for using Python, and the Selenium package, to gather your data and press it into a DataFrame you can manipulate.", "Before you begin, you will need to be certain you have your Selenium package installed in Python, and ChromeDriver set up to perform hand in hand with Selenium. Follow these links for more information on setting up Selenium and ChromeDriver.", "Three key things to consider when you are looking at a website to scrape:", "As mentioned above, we rely on Google\u2019s Inspect feature and Elements panel window to check out what elements you will have access to scraping. Right click any item on the page (pictures or text) that you are interested in, and in the menu that pops up, scroll down to \u201cInspect\u201d and click (see picture above).", "This will bring you into the Elements panel so you can review the Document Object Model (DOM) tree of the site and find the correct identifier(s) for the element(s) you are looking to extract.", "Every element on the page will be referenced to a node on the DOM. The challenge is to find the most effective and most reliable locator for each element you need. Luckily, Selenium gives you a tool box full of tools to choose from so, no matter the website, you have a great chance of finding what you need using these commands:", "You will likely need to experiment with a few of these locator types to get your desired result, and you may find that accessing the elements you wish to scrape is best served by using more than one locator throughout your code. There are plenty of suggestions across the internet for the best methods of deploying each of these find commands. For this example, we\u2019ll work with \u201cFind Element By Class Name\u201d which looks like this:", "(You can access the above code snippet here at GitHub Gist)", "With Python and Selenium, there is an easier method to pulling all of information into a list \u2014 but the result is very lengthy, cumbersome, and difficult to manipulate.", "To be able to work with the data more effectively, however, and to eventually place it into a Python Pandas DataFrame that we can manage, we will use a two step process that will allow us to locate the individual elements, and then access the associated text.", "These Elements are found throughout the DOM tree of the site. So for our two step process, our first step is to identify all of the elements, and our second step is to run a simple for/loop to iterate through each element and let selenium do its job of picking the finest text for our review.", "In the code above we established five separate lists to house our collection of elements. As we loop through each individual list of elements, we will create five new lists of text, all corresponding with each other. So, in this specific example, we harvested our winery elements, and crushed our winery_list with the finest data Selenium handpicked for us.", "We now have five great lists providing the data we scraped, and we are just a simple Python dictionary away from pressing our lists together to form a DataFrame we can clean, analyze, add to, then serve up and share our insights with our colleagues.", "(You can access the above code snippet here at GitHub Gist)", "As you can see, the resulting DataFrame assembles our data in a way that we can analyze and get more value out of, not to mention that we\u2019ve established a relatively simple program to update our information when we need to.", "Overall, web-scraping can provide us with great automated access to data, which in turn helps us harvest the insights to drive our business forward. Establishing our scraping strategy (and thinking through the Who, What, Where, Why and How) before we even start writing code, is immensely helpful to getting the results we want.", "Your home for data science.
