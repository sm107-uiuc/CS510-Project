This is just one technique, however. The types of pre-processing mitigations can range from simple data preparation methods such as sampling, massaging, reweighing [1] to more complex methods like optimized data transformation which reduces bias and the predictability of the protected or sensitive attribute [2\u20133].", "In this post, instead of going in-depth on any one technique, I want to discuss the options a data scientist may have when attempting to address bias at the pre-processing stage. That is, what are the differences between these techniques, and how can each of them be beneficial to the data scientists and ML practitioners? Before I can begin discussing them, it is important to understand the source of AI bias.", "As I mentioned in my first post of the AI bias series, bias can creep into the ML pipeline and be amplified by model predictions from various sources. Insufficient data, inconsistent data collection, and bad practices that are present in the data can result in bias in the model\u2019s decisions through various mechanisms. For instance, a model may be unable to provide predictions with high certainty for underrepresented groups. Or it may learn discriminatory behavior from existing bias in the historical data, and as a result, perpetuate or even increase the level of bias in its predictions.", "Below are two examples of data deficiencies that can cause models to show bias towards certain groups:", "When presented with skewed, imbalanced data or data that lacks diversity, such as the facial recognition dataset mentioned above, a model\u2019s tendency to exhibit discriminatory behavior towards the underrepresented groups is reflective of the model\u2019s inability to perform equivalently for different groups. In these cases, techniques such as sampling and reweighing can reduce the bias by adjusting the balance of the different groups present in the data and therefore increasing the learning opportunity for the models.", "On the other hand, if historical bias and discrimination is the root cause of the bias in the data, like the hiring example, relabeling or data transformation is more likely the best approach to decrease the bias. Even if you\u2019ve made sure that no feature in the data acts as a proxy to the sensitive attributes, biased labels may cause models to still present bias through errors in performance, such as a significant difference in false positives or negatives between groups. Due to models\u2019 inability to find meaningful patterns for records that are otherwise similar but belong to different groups and have different labeled outcomes, models can behave with uncertainty. These unstable predictions can result in bias for certain groups.", "For example, consider two candidates from different groups (e.g. race, gender) that have the same set of feature values \u2014 they went to the same university, have equivalent work experience, and identical skill-sets \u2014 and who have had any protected or sensitive attributes and their proxies removed from the data, but they each have different target values, one hired and one not. The models will have a hard time learning when similar records lead to different labels and thus will be unable to predict the outcome with high certainty. By using techniques that change the labels for similar records, you will, therefore, improve the learning process of the models and reduce the bias in predictions.", "In different circumstances, in addition to biased labels, if the presence of proxy features is suspected, transforming the data to significantly reduce or eliminate the correlation between sensitive attributes and other features as well as the target is more applicable. When proxy features are included in the data, models built on feature lists that exclude sensitive attributes can still indirectly infer the association of individual records to different groups within those sensitive attributes. For example, if Zip Code or Sports are part of the features, models can infer race or gender from the records. This inference enables models to learn discriminatory behaviors from the data and encode it in the predictions. To mitigate such scenarios, the simultaneous features transformation and labels are essential to reduce the models' capability of inference.", "As we have discussed here and in the previous blog, these techniques have the potential to reduce bias in the training data. For situations in which data scientists cannot have access to sensitive attributes due to company policies or legal constraints, these techniques can be shared with the data owners to apply to the data before sharing them with data scientists.", "Unfortunately, due to the blindness of these techniques to models\u2019 inference of the data, some level of bias still can creep into the model predictions. In the next entries in this series soon to follow, I will address this issue by performing the same overview of techniques for the in- and post-processing modeling stages, in which the model\u2019s inferences are directly accessed.", "[1] Kamiran, Faisal and Calders, Toon.
