Python is in its thirties. C is almost fifty years old. Fortran is in its sixties. And still in use!", "There\u2019s another computer language dinosaur that\u2019s used intensely. One that you\u2019ve probably never heard of. Meet sixty-odd COBOL.", "Used in 80 percent of all in-person transactions and 95 percent of all cash machines, COBOL is the programming language of money. More than 200 billion lines of COBOL are still in use today, and all that needs to be maintained.", "Now more than ever. As unemployment claims are going through the roof, the ancient \u2014 and COBOL-based \u2014 social security systems are overloaded. So governors are willing to do anything to get their hands on COBOL programmers.", "So if you want to get a few big paychecks and do something to help those who are affected by this crisis, COBOL is the way to go.", "First of all, because COBOL \u2014 COmmon Business Oriented Language \u2014 is a language for business people, not for programmers. It\u2019s designed such that a businessperson with no knowledge of code understands what\u2019s going on. Which means that the wellbeing of the programmer behind the code isn\u2019t a priority.", "COBOL has a bunch of syntactical oddities that make it palatable for business, but not for hardcore nerds. Like the fact that it doesn\u2019t have any functions or subroutines \u2014 instead, there are divisions, sections, paragraphs, and statements. Very much to the disgust of systems programming pioneers in the 1970s.", "\u201cThe use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense.\u201d \u2014 Edsger W. Dijkstra", "But by that time it was too late. The core codes of banks and bureaucracy had already been built.", "Given the odd structure of COBOL, you might think it was built by people who had no idea what computer code is. Far from that. It was a kick-ass team around the legendary Grace Hopper that made its development possible.", "Compared to the programming languages that were around in the fifties, COBOL was a revolution. It was easy to use and understand, portable, machine-independent and capable of change. And all of that for a fraction of the cost. It was a language that came straight from the future.", "So it was adopted everywhere: Banking, insurance, federal government agencies, you name it. By 1970, there was hardly a system that was not written in COBOL.", "Paradoxically, it was the fact that newer languages were emerging \u2014 such as Fortran & Co. \u2014 that cemented the legacy of COBOL. The business-computer-language was proclaimed dead in the eighties, and the trend went so fast that new programmers didn\u2019t even bother learning it. And so, while there were enough older programmers left to maintain the existing code, there were not enough qualified people to transform it into newer languages.", "Fast-forward to 2020: While the code-maintainers have done incredible work in keeping the federal systems rock-solid for decades, nobody had anticipated such a surge in demand. And suddenly we need a lot more hands-on deck to keep on top of this crisis.", "\u201cSo many of our Departments of Labor across the country are still on the COBOL system. You know very, very old technology. [\u2026] Our Department of Labor had recognized that that was an issue and had initiated modernization, and, unfortunately, that\u2019s something that takes time. This (virus) interfered and they had to cease the transition to a much more robust system. So they\u2019re operating on really old stuff.\u201d \u2014 Laura Kelly, governor of Kansas", "With unemployment rates going through the sky, governors of several states are scrambling for help right now. Suddenly, they need to ramp up systems that take years to modernize in normal times. Suddenly, everything is out of control.", "The governor of New Jersey even made a television appearance to spread the word. IBM has been trying to help by publishing their calls for COBOL programmers, but the search remains difficult.", "People who know how to code are in big demand right now. Specifically, people who know how to COBOL.", "This isn\u2019t your cool-ass hot new programming language. This isn\u2019t even Python \u2014 people who read my articles know that I have a love-hate relationship with the latter. This isn\u2019t some sexy data science, or freaky artificial intelligence, or both.", "If you choose to do COBOL, you\u2019re likely doing maintenance work. You\u2019re sucking up business logic of decades ago instead of developing cutting-edge algorithms. You\u2019re working in the stone age of computer science with a technology that still looks like it\u2019s designed for one of those antiquated hole-punch cards.", "But right now you can\u2019t do anything more important. Millions of people have already lost their job. And although a number of states are already re-opening, a bounce-back of the economy is unlikely.", "Which means we\u2019ll see another few million people losing their jobs. Many, many people will need those state benefits to get by. And the current situation \u2014 some people have literally called their bureaus hundreds of times \u2014 is more than desperate.", "So if you can do anything to help, you should. COBOL ain\u2019t sexy \u2014 but helping fellow humans is, let\u2019s face it, goddarn sexy. In that sense: happy coding!", "Your home for data science.
