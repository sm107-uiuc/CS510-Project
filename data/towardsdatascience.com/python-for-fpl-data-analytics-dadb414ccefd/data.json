But first, credit to David Allen for the helpful guide on accessing the Fantasy Premier League API, which can be found here.", "To begin, we need to set-up our notebook to use Pandas and Matplotlib (I\u2019m using Jupyter for this), and connect to the Fantasy Premier League API to access the data needed for the analysis.", "Then, we can set up our Pandas DataFrames (think data tables) which will be queried for valuable insights \u2014 hopefully. Each DataFrame (_df) we create relates to a JSON data structure accessible via the FPL API. For a full list of these, run json.keys(). We\u2019re interested in \u2018elements\u2019 (player data), \u2018element_types\u2019 (positional references), and \u2018teams\u2019.", "By default, elements_df contains a number of columns we aren\u2019t interested in right now (for an overview of each DataFrame, see David\u2019s article). I\u2019ve created a new DataFrame \u2014 main_df \u2014 with columns I might want to use.", "It\u2019s important to note that elements_df uses keys to reference things such as a player\u2019s position and team. For example, in column \u2018element_type\u2019, a value of \u201c1\u201d = goalkeeper, and in column \u2018team\u2019 a value of \u201c1\u201d = Arsenal. These are references to the two other DataFrames we created (element_types_df, and teams_df)", "If we preview element_types_df, we\u2019ll see that each \u2018id\u2019 number here corresponds to a position:", "And in teams_df, \u2018id\u2019 corresponds to each team name:", "At this point we can also see that none of the team stats are updated, which could be a problem later on \u2014 I particularly want the games played by each team. In the interests of time and/or lacking a more elegant solution, I added the data manually by (1) creating a new dictionary, (2) turning this into a two-column DataFrame, (3) overwriting the \u2018played\u2019 column in teams_df with the data I created.", "For the purpose of our analysis, we are going to want to use the actual position and team names, rather than the number identifiers. To avoid referencing data from different places later on, we can merge our DataFrames together now to form a sort of \u2018master\u2019 table. We\u2019ll use main_df as the base for this, using pd.merge to perform a join to the other DataFrames, elements_types_df, and teams_df.", "2. Use of df.drop, to remove unwanted columns post-merge. Whilst we need to use the \u2018id\u2019 columns to join on, we don\u2019t want them in our final DataFrame. We also no longer need our original \u2018element_type\u2019 and \u2018team\u2019 columns, since we have now merged the user-friendly data into main_df. The use of \u201caxis=1\u201d specifies we are dropping a column rather than a row.", "3. Use of df.rename, to clean up our DataFrame. In element_types_df, position names are stored under \u2018singular_name\u2019. We\u2019ll rename that to \u2018position\u2019 to make it more intuitive.", "To merge the teams_df data across, we can just tweak the above:", "Finally, we pre-emptively convert some existing columns to floats, to avoid potential issues running calculations and sorting values, and we create a new column \u2018total_contribution\u2019 (sum of goals and assists):", "main_df set up, we can use .loc() to filter out all players with < 0 value, to avoid our results being skewed by those not getting game-time:", "Now, using the groupby() function we can take a quick look at the data by position. The first argument \u2018position\u2019 chooses the column to group on, and \u201cas_index=False\u201d prevents that column from being removed and used as an index instead. Using aggregate functions we can find the mean value and total points scored per position. I\u2019ve wrapped it in a roundby() to limit decimals to two.", "Per \u00a3 spent, Goalkeepers are currently returning the most points, but they also make up a much smaller fraction of a teams points total. As a lot of goalkeepers in the game play 0 minutes, they won\u2019t be accounted for here (as their value = 0). Many outfield players will pick up 1 point returns if subbed on with 5 or 10 minutes to go, pulling average value down.", "Team-level stats can give a broad indication of which teams are playing well, or where players could be under/overvalued.", "I personally wouldn\u2019t have thought West Ham and Brighton assets would be top-5 in terms of value at this (or any) stage. However, we know that some teams \u2014 including Man Utd and Man City \u2014 have played a game less than everyone else. Let\u2019s adjust for that by creating some value-per-game and points-per-game metrics:", "Even after adjusting for games played, Man Utd and Man City don\u2019t break into the top 5. Not too surprising given their recent performances against Spurs and Leicester. Arsenal and Liverpool are both picking up a good amount of points per game, but their value score shows you have to pay for it.", "Let\u2019s use Matplotlib to create some nicer graphical representations of this data. Using the subplot function, we can plot two graphs side-by-side for easier comparisons. We\u2019ll compare team \u2018value\u2019 and \u2018total_points\u2019 to the adjusted figures we created based on games played.", "Aston Villa stand out even more after adjusting for the fact they\u2019ve only played three games. Looking at their results it\u2019s not hard to see why: 1\u20130 (v Sheff Utd), 3\u20130 (v Fulham), and 7\u20132 (v Liverpool!). Obviously, we\u2019re looking at tiny sample sizes, but before we decide to load up on Villa assets, maybe consider that two of their wins and clean sheets came against the two sides that have had the worst start to the season by points per game. And how much significance can we attach to that result against last year\u2019s Champions Liverpool?", "Team-level data can only tell us so much \u2014 we are capped at three players per team after all \u2014 so let\u2019s narrow our focus. We\u2019ll use .loc again to filter on each position and create some more DataFrames:", "Starting with goalkeepers, we\u2019ll plot a simple scatter graph showing cost v points (the \u2018value\u2019 metric). Matplotlib allows us to easily customise things such as plot transparency (alpha=), size (figsize=), and line-style (ls=). For the purpose of this article I\u2019m going to keep everything consistent.", "Early on in the season, there is zero correlation between a goalkeepers price and points total. McCarthy was a pre-season value pick for a huge number of players, and that\u2019s paid off so far. Martinez was undervalued pre-season because he was Arsenal\u2019s second choice \u2014 his late move to Villa has rewarded those who brought him in*. Newcastle\u2019s Darlow is currently scoring the highest of the \u00a35.0m picks, which is surprising given they\u2019ve only kept one clean sheet in four games. What else explains it? Knowing that Goalkeepers also score one point for every three saves, we can re-plot using \u2018saves\u2019 data.", "Looks like Darlow has made over twice as many saves than most goalkeepers, which helps explain his total points. It also suggests that he\u2019s not being offered much protection by his defenders. In any event, clean sheets will generally return more points than saves, so I\u2019d rather opt for a goalkeeper with more potential there. Martinez and McCarthy offer more balance for less cost. New Chelsea signing Mendy didn\u2019t need to make a single save for his debut clean sheet, and at \u00a35.0m there is long-term value if you have faith that their defensive line will continue to improve.", "*His move didn\u2019t reward those who brought him in and left him on the bench. I\u2019m sure those people will be kicking themselves even harder if they started Pickford instead \u2014 a keeper who has done everything in his power to help the opposition team put the ball in his own net.", "As for Defenders, we want clean sheets or attacking threat \u2014 ideally both. Alexander-Arnold and Robertson set defensive expectations through the roof last year, but shipping three goals to Leeds and seven to Aston Villa suggest problems. So which defenders have started the season well?", "A lot of people have picked up on Castagne\u2019s fantastic start to the season (now in 19.2% of teams). West Ham\u2019s Cresswell still largely ignored on the other hand \u2014 despite his total points return for just \u00a34.9m. His ICT index score is also high at 27.7, which for anyone unfamiliar, stands for Influence, Creativity, and Threat. It\u2019s essentially a measure of a players involvement in important moments at either end of the pitch. It\u2019s useful for assessing whether a player is creating good chances for others, or getting into positions where they might score themselves.", "For a quick view of the highest performing defenders in relation to price, I\u2019ll make a new DataFrame topdef_df, selecting only defenders with a value > 3 and at least 1 goal contribution (goal or assist).", "Players with high ICT scores but low total points might be on the bad side of luck, where those \u2018underperforming\u2019 from a points perspective now might still be valuable additions to a team if chances are converted sooner rather than later. Can we tell if there any \u2018unlucky\u2019 defenders out there? We can try, by creating a DataFrame for defenders with an ICT score > 10, and see who has been rewarded and who hasn\u2019t.", "Alexander-Arnold (\u00a37.5m) and Robertson (\u00a37.0m) didn\u2019t make it into the previous plot because we filtered on value > 3. Given their slow start to the season, players owning either of the two will be pleased to see that they are still amongst the most threatening in the game and should be held onto \u2014 despite their cost. Chelsea\u2019s James made his way into a lot of people\u2019s teams given his attacking value, although he has recently fallen behind Azpilicueta in the pecking order. Digne isn\u2019t cheap (\u00a36.1m) but he\u2019s serving Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin in a strong Everton side going forward \u2014 expect his assists to keep tallying up. On the \u2018unlucky\u2019 side, Fredericks (\u00a34.4m), Ayling (\u00a34.5m) and Dallas (\u00a34.5m) have all been fairly heavily involved in their matches so far, without the points to show for it. All three make good bench candidates at those prices.", "Conclusion: Both Digne and Chilwell look like better options than my current pick Doherty (\u00a35.9m). I also brought in Strujk (\u00a34.0m) as a bench option on the bad advice of a friend \u2014 any one of Fredericks/Ayling/Dallas would be an affordable upgrade.", "Onto midfielders: probably where most of a team\u2019s points will come from. To focus on the high-performers right away, we can do what we did with the defenders and create another new DataFrame \u2014 this time, selecting only midfielders with an ICT score > 25 and points total > 15.", "Salah (\u00a312.2m) and Son (\u00a39.0m) are the only big-name assets to justify their price tag so far. De Bruyne and Sterling have a game in hand but not too much to show from their first three fixtures. Grealish (\u00a37.1m) and Rodriguez (\u00a37.8m) are the middle-tier value picks at the moment, and you\u2019d expect that to continue given how much of Aston Villa\u2019s and Everton\u2019s attacking play goes through them. Bowen (\u00a36.3.m) and Jorginho (\u00a35.2) look like good value picks, although the latter has scored three penalties in four games to inflate his early-stage points return.", "But which midfielders have FPL players gone for (or ignored)? I\u2019ve kept the >15 total points parameter the same, but plotted the results by overall selection %, rather than cost.", "Again, Bowen stands out \u2014 less than 2% of players have selected him after a pretty strong start to the season. In FPL-speak he is effectively a \u201cdifferential\u201d pick. Someone with a low enough ownership % that he would help you gain leaderboard positions should he return well (because very few others will also be gaining those points). There\u2019s a lot of people hoping premium assets Aubameyang and De Bruyne start firing soon.", "Judging by ICT, De Bruyne holders can relax a bit knowing he\u2019s started brightly \u2014 injuries mean Man City have lacked an out-and-out striker that could have rewarded his chance creation. If you opted for Sterling, you might be slightly more concerned to see he\u2019s about as threatening as Townsend or McGinn (for double the cost). At the other end, Son and Salah look like must-have\u2019s.", "Conclusion: Salah and De Bruyne are probably holds for the rest of the season. I\u2019ll get Son back in as soon as possible after transferring him out over a non-existent injury. Bringing Barnes and Pereira in hasn\u2019t worked (yet) \u2014 if their contribution doesn\u2019t improve quickly I\u2019ll make a move for Grealish/Rodriguez depending on my budget.", "At the top of the pitch, there is some more surprises looking at where the value is coming from early on. I\u2019ve ruled out everyone yet to contribute to a goal to tidy up the plot:", "There still isn\u2019t much correlation between price and points. Middle-value players like Ings and Jiminez have done okay, not great. Most of the points seem to be coming from either the \u00a36.0-\u00a36.5m mark, or \u00a310.0m+. Calvert-Lewin\u2019s impressive start to the season has seen his value steadily increase from \u00a37.0m to \u00a37.6m. Unlike Vardy, Wilson, and Maupay, none of Calvert-Lewin\u2019s goals have come from penalties either. 48% of players now have him onboard \u2014 the other 52% won\u2019t admit they\u2019ve got it wrong, even if it\u2019s going to cost them (I\u2019ve seen this before\u2026).", "Elsewhere, even at \u00a310.6m, Kane is still providing a lot of value \u2014 directly contributing to the most goals so far this season (9). Martial and Werner perhaps the biggest disappointments, with Werner somehow being out-scored by Abraham, the striker he was signed to replace.", "To end with something slightly different, we can look at how FPL players are reacting to player form. Everybody refers to in-form strikers that \u201ccan\u2019t miss at the moment\u201d. In theory, people will want to catch in-form players whilst they are on their good run. In FPL, form = average total points per game within the thirty days.", "There is a degree of correlation in a small sample size of in-form players (where form > 5). Kane\u2019s low transfer-in number might just reflect the fact he started the season in a lot of teams already. A lot of people are picking up Bamford, Vardy, and Wilson based on the first few fixtures, but still not a lot of love for West Brom\u2019s Callum Robinson \u2014 despite his two goals against Chelsea. The people have spoken on Calvert-Lewin, added to almost 3,000,000 teams in the past few weeks.", "Conclusion: I\u2019ve been stubborn and hung onto Richarlison, but clearly the smart money is on his partner. Jiminez has a nice run of fixtures so he can stay, for now. Brewster (\u00a34.5m) will probably make his way onto my bench if he starts well for Sheffield Utd. Otherwise, I\u2019ll consider re-balancing my team to bring in Watkins or Bamford.", "To finish, here\u2019s a view of the top-5 value (value = points/cost) players by position. Although it\u2019s worth remembering that a team of the highest \u2018value\u2019 players won\u2019t top many leaderboards \u2014 it\u2019s all about maximising points subject to the overall budget constraint. Finding good value allows you to spend more money on those players (Salah, Kane) that can hit the biggest scores.", "To plot this, I made a top-5 DataFrame by position using nlargest()", "before layering each DataFrame on the same graph by defining our first plot as \u2018ax\u2019, then referencing \u2018ax=ax\u2019 in the second, third and fourth:", "The \u201cs=top5_gk_df[\u2018value\u2019]*10\u201d argument makes the size of each scatter bubble a function of the \u2018value\u2019 column. In other words, the larger the \u2018value\u2019, the bigger the bubble. However, the result is pretty negligible above given the small scale.", "The above has largely been an exercise in getting to grips with DataFrame creation, manipulation, and graphical representation using Python, but there\u2019s still a lot more that can be done in terms of visualisation and customisation. From a data perspective, there\u2019s no denying that three or four games into a season is too early to make long-term projections, but the tools/methods for analysing the data will remain largely consistent. It\u2019ll be interesting to keep re-running the code to see how things develop as the season goes on. It takes less than 1 second to re-run all of the code that produced everything here \u2014 sure saves a lot of time on the FPL app.", "Your home for data science.
