The runtime interpretation of Python code makes it a slower programming language. Python also doesn\u2019t support multithreading, the reason being an internal lock mechanism preventing it from running multiple tasks concurrently. But these limitations can be overcome by using Python implementations like CPython or Jython, better architectures, and load balancing mechanisms.", "Node.js naturally offers scalability as it is built into the runtime environment and comes with a cluster module that is capable of handling the full power of your machine.
