How I went from a reinforcement\u2026 | by Robert Clark | Towards Data Science", "h1": "From Zero to Flagpole Hero", "description": "Two weeks ago, I was a complete newbie to reinforcement learning.

I\u2019m not talking \u201cyou know nothing Jon Snow\u201d levels of ignorance on the subject, but understanding the basic principles of trying an action, getting a reward, and committing that event to memory was about the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Conceptual ideas are great and all, but I had absolutely no inclination on how I could actually put these thoughts to code and write something that would actually work. Fast forward two weeks, and I have written a program which sees Mario successfully reach the flagpole at the end of the first level of the original Super Mario Bros. How\u2019d I pull that off you ask? Well, read on to find out!", "Before I dive into the meat of this article, however, I should point out that while my aim is to help others learn so they can build reinforcement learning applications on their own, I will not go in-depth describing the code or theory involved in my work in this article. My plan is to write follow-ups which will describe the actual code and how I designed it at a later time. With that being said, I believe it is best to take a step back when diving into AI, and first learn how to learn. In this article, I hope to convey a process that was successful for me.", "Chances are you\u2019ve heard the phrase \u201cyou need to learn to crawl before you can walk\u201d sometime in your life before. This humbling expression is a reminder that no matter who we are or where we came from, we all had to learn how to crawl before we learned how to walk. It also offers a lesson that none of us can immediately master a given task or subject without first understanding the domain\u2019s basic foundation. Artificial intelligence is certainly no different, as it is outrageous to expect someone to become an instant expert in the field after a couple of hours or simply reading a single article. In order to get a good grasp of artificial intelligence, one must learn the core basics to be successful.", "I am no different when it comes to reinforcement learning. With no advanced degrees in AI or a twenty-plus year dedication to the practice, I had to start at the very beginning to understand just what IS reinforcement learning beyond my rudimentary background.", "In one of the many ironies of my life, I\u2019m actually a poor reader, despite frequently reading and semi-frequently contributing to a large blog site. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I can read just fine, but I do so at a relatively slow pace and often get distracted while doing so, making it difficult to walk away with fresh concepts.", "Despite this limitation, I chose to being my journey by reading some books. Fortunately, my employer is partnered with O\u2019Reilly Learning (formerly Safari Books Online), so I get \u201cfree\u201d access to their complete library of books. If you haven\u2019t heard of them before, I encourage you to look them up as they have plenty of great resources, especially for those working in the technology field.", "The first book I picked up was \u201cHands-On Intelligent Agents with OpenAI Gym\u201d by Praveen Palanisamy which can be found on O\u2019Reilly Learning or just about anywhere you can purchase O\u2019Reilly books.", "I chose this book as it focuses on PyTorch which I\u2019ve used at work, and also promised a hands-on approach as its name implies. I find that I learn best when I actually get my hands dirty and play around with code instead of purely reading theoretical snippets without any tangible examples. Without turning this into a full book review, I recommend this book to anyone else looking to dive into reinforcement learning. The first half in particular did a good job of breaking down the key principles of reinforcement, such as explaining key terms, giving straightforward examples, and demonstrating how an environment can actually be configured.", "After reading the first half of the book, I felt I had a good understanding of how reinforcement learns on a basic level and some ideas on how I could write a program which would be able to learn to play and eventually beat a game by itself. With this newfound knowledge, I decided my next step should be to put it to the test.", "OpenAI, the AI research firm co-founded by Elon Musk a few years ago, developed a common benchmark for reinforcement learning models and techniques known as the Gym. This tool provides dozens of unique environments which can be used by developers and researchers to quickly and easily iterate on a particular model without needing to worry about configuring a testing suite. Not only does this speed up the testing and development process, it also allows a standard for developers and researchers across teams, organizations, and around the world to duplicate work. With a common testing environment, we can begin to make apples-to-apples comparisons between various models in determining which ones can achieve higher scores on particular games, or can adapt to a wide variety of games, or even converge quicker than its peers.", "The environments I mentioned are mostly a series of mini-games, each with their own set of rules, boundaries, rewards, and success criteria. Gym even supports games produced for the Atari 2600, such as Pong, Breakout, and Ms. Pacman, allowing developers to easily test their models in real video games.", "After gaining some experience from the book I read, I decided to try my luck at creating a simple Q-Learning model which could solve some of the more trivial Gym environments, such as CartPole-v0 and MountainCar-v0, both developer by the OpenAI team as a good entry-point into the domain. Fortunately, the book I followed provides a great example on creating a Q-Learning model to solve MountainCar-v0 which successfully converged in a matter of minutes. Due to the flexibility of both the Q-Learning model as well as Gym, I was also able to test out the algorithm on CartPole-v0 while only changing a single line of code.", "While these demonstrations were cool to follow, I knew it wouldn\u2019t be extendable as I wasn\u2019t using any deep learning techniques, and I read the internal environment\u2019s state directly as opposed to reading the raw images. This felt like cheating as the model was able to get information about the environment that human players are unable to (such as positions, velocities, and angles). After seeing many examples in the book as well as online, I modified the code to use a Deep Q Network (DQN) and take advantage of convolutions to allow me to process the actual images on the screen, rather than read a magical state. This way, the model would learn to play the game in the same way as a human would by reading the screen, providing an action, and responding to the outcome of that action on a repeating basis until an end criteria is met.", "With this new model, I was able to solve both CartPole-v0 and MountainCar-v0 much faster when compared to my prior simplistic Q-Learning model, and also achieved higher scores once converged. While this was exciting to see, these environments are logically simple as there are a comparatively small amount of possible states and the action space was also small as you could either go left, right, or stay put in both scenarios. As a result, I wanted to test the models out on a more complicated environment before attempting my ultimate goal of training Mario to beat a level. Luckily, the Atari environments I mentioned earlier are wonderful sandboxes to test models on games with more complex rule sets.", "Much to my initial surprise, without changing any of the core code I was using, I was able to deploy my model to several Atari games and they successfully converged at a point where they were able to master a game, such as consistently winning a game of Pong 21\u20130.", "The fact that my code was able to beat these games with very minimal modifications really is a testament to the robustness of the original DQN model. It quickly became evident that the model would be able to adapt to various environments and learn how to properly handle them.", "Being the professional software engineer that I am, I created a repository on GitHub containing all of the code I used to train my model to beat Pong as well as other Atari games and included several parameters to easily test changes and adapt to new environments without modifying any code. Care to try this out for yourself? Check out the link below for more details.", "I was on a roll solving multiple games without tailoring my software for new scenarios, but I still had that burning question \u2014 can an AI really learn how to beat a level in Mario?", "For those still reading, the answer to the question I posed above is obviously \u201cyes\u201d as I wouldn\u2019t be posting this article if everything failed miserably.", "Gym doesn\u2019t natively support games from the NES, so I had to setup an environment for Super Mario Bros in order to test my model against it. Luckily, some wonderful people on GitHub have created gym-super-mario-bros (available from PyPI) which takes care of everything for us, allowing us to setup our environment with just a few lines of code as with the other supported Gym environments.", "With everything setup, I ran the same code I used for the Atari games but instead targeted the first level of Super Mario Bros. and\u2026 nothing happened. I waited an hour, but Mario only figured out that he gets killed by the first Goomba in the level, and he generally doesn\u2019t like getting killed, so a better tactic is to just stand in place and safely wait for time to expire.", "Obviously, this is not what I intended to happen as I was hoping Mario would be able to complete the level, so it was back to the drawing board.", "As is the case with any data science project, it is crucial to first understand what the problem is that you are trying to solve, including any success criteria and constraints. My excitement got the best of me as I tried to solve Mario without actually thinking about the problem.", "By today\u2019s standards, both Mario and the Atari games would be considered extremely basic and simple in their complexity, so I naively assumed the model would handle both cases with ease. After taking a step back, however, it\u2019s obvious that Mario is orders of magnitude more complex than games like Pong given the various states that can be encountered. With Pong, you have the two paddles that move up and down, and a ball that floats across the screen. A neural network really only needs to learn how to move up and down and understand that hitting the ball is good, and letting it float behind you is bad, while also only needing to worry about a singular screen. With Mario, however, you only see a tiny portion of the level at once, and there are many different objects and enemies that he needs to properly study and understand.", "If you think back to the very first time you played Mario, did you intuitively know that Goombas and Koopas were bad, mushrooms were good, warp pipes can lead to new places while also spawning enemies, and question marks give power-ups and coins? If so, you were way more intelligent than I was as a child when I first picked up the game. Chances are that you didn\u2019t know all of this information immediately, though. Just like how us mere mortals didn\u2019t understand all that Mario encountered during his journeys through the Mushroom Kingdom, my DQN wasn\u2019t learning how to properly progress through the level.", "As I find is often the trickiest part of reinforcement learning, I had to custom tailor a rewards system for Mario so he could positively respond to the environment. To do this, I again had to think about how I would complete the level. I usually like to get to the end as fast as possible while stomping on enemies, getting power-ups, and collecting coins if they are convenient to access, but otherwise not bother. Of course, I also want to avoid death at all costs as that just restarts me at the beginning. With this understanding, I created a custom reward system that gave Mario a bunch of extra points when he made it to the flag, and the faster he moved to the right (towards the end of the level), the more points he would get. I also deducted several points anytime he got hit, died, or ran out of time to encourage him to avoid any of these situations.", "After adding my custom rewards, it was time for round two! I kicked off the script and\u2026 still nothing. I watched Mario fail miserably over, and over, and over again. After what seemed like endless trials of frustration, I eventually saw Mario stomp on his first Goomba and continue on with the level for the first time. Maybe, just maybe I was on to something, and my lack of patience would need to take the back seat here.", "After letting Mario run all night (pun partially intended), I awoke to a beautiful site:", "He did it! Not only did he learn how to make it through the level, he also figured out several techniques which enable him to finish even faster than I can while stomping on Goombas along the way. While I was absolutely thrilled with the outcome, I also had the sudden realization that I will very likely never be this good at beating the game. But, watching Mario effortlessly fly through the level again quickly erased my sadness, knowing that I checked off one of my goals.", "Before I conclude, I want to quickly summarize my journey and provide some additional resources.", "As a brief recap, in the span of two weeks, I went from being a complete novice at reinforcement learning to writing a program from scratch which solved the first level of Super Mario Bros. For me, reading a book proved vital as it helped me quickly understand the core concepts of reinforcement learning, and enabled me to apply them. I personally feel reading is an often overlooked source of knowledge which goes a long way in understanding a new topic, especially in an era where we are surrounded by technology.", "After reading the book (or rather, the first half), I put my knowledge to the test and created programs which actually implemented the topics I read about. Just as reading is crucial to understanding a new topic, actually getting your hands dirty and attempting it yourself is the only way to truly cement that knowledge.", "Lastly, take a chance! If you have a goal that you are chasing, go for it! Preparation is always crucial, but eventually you have to attempt it, and learning from the experience can only help in the end.", "Of course, since I posted the link to my Atari repository above, it\u2019s only fair that I provide a link to my Mario repository here too. Feel free to take a look, or even help me solve some of the more challenging levels in my quest to beat the entire game using reinforcement learning. You can find the repository below:", "As mentioned in the beginning, I will provide future articles with more details on how I actually implemented this program on a more technical level for those that are interested, so stay tuned! Otherwise, go hop, skip, and jump into a new adventure in reinforcement learning! Wahoo!", "Software engineer passionate about sports and artificial intelligence and, apparently, a blogger by night."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
