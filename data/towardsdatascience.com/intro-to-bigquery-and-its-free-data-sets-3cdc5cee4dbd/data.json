However Google\u2019s BigQuery has a huge bank of databases which are freely available and couldn\u2019t be simpler to access. The queries for accessing the databases are in SQL, however, the interface is so user friendly, you only really need a basic understanding to start accessing the data.", "Currently, there are nearly 200 public datasets on BigQuery, with new ones added all the time. Most of the databases are kept fully up to date, with new data available every day. For instance, in the last 3 months, 22 new datasets have been added around COVID-19 which are updated daily in order to help increase the availability of data and aid research. To peruse these datasets, simply head over to datasets in google marketplace. The range of data is huge, from NOAH extreme weather data to historical cryptocurrency volumes and prices. The datasets have been categorised to make it easy to filter for the type of data you are interested in.", "Once you have decided on a dataset, click on it, then on view dataset \u2014 this will take you directly to the google cloud console. Please note that you do need to sign in with a google account or set up an account in order to access the console. If it is your first time, you will be given a year free trial with $300 (or equivalent in your home currency) worth of free credits for accessing data. Once here, you should set up a new project on the top left of the screen. This allows you to keep track of your datasets and queries, allowing you to save queries and look through all of your past jobs.", "Click through to the New Project screen and set up the project with whichever name you fancy \u2014 you will get a warning letting you know how many more projects are available on your free account. Once you have set this up \u2014 you are ready to go!", "Once in the console, you are able to explore the datasets in more detail. The main section for navigating datasets is in the resources tab at the bottom left of the console. This allows you to explore a number of the public datasets, add additional public datasets, or even link an external data source.", "From the Add Data screen \u2014 you are able to search through all of the same datasets from the marketplace and add it to your pinned datasets in this resources tab. It makes it simple to have all datasets in one place for any given project.", "In addition to this, BigQuery has brilliant and simple summary screens for all of the data tables. In order to access this, navigate the resources through the databases and simply select the data table you are interested in seeing more details on.", "The first data screen is the Schema screen, which gives you more information about the field names and the data types for each field in the table. Some of the datasets even have detailed descriptions of what the field name means or what it represents. Policy tags allow the database owner to set permissions for specific fields (e.g. for sensitive data), however, this is not used in most of the public datasets, as, well, they are public.", "The second tab is the Details tab, which gives you summary information about the table. Namely around the size and length of the dataset (25 billion rows of data for the Wikipedia 2020 page views table!), but also about how old the data is, and how often it is updated. In addition, some of the public datasets are only released for a certain period of time, and you can see when the table is due to expire (this is quite rare though).", "And if the first two weren\u2019t enough, there is even a preview tab, which will allow you to view the first few rows of data, so you can see an example of the format of the data. This makes it super easy to picture your database, see how it fits together and decide exactly which information you want to query!", "Once you are ready to start accessing the data, BigQuery has also made it incredibly simple to build queries and amend them. Obviously, if you are an SQL wiz, you can just start writing your queries in the query box, but even then, it is much quicker to start by using the BigQuery shortcuts. Select the table that you want to query and then simply click on the Query Table button in the bottom right.", "This will automatically populate your query with an almost fully built query. You will initially see a syntax error, and that is because it doesn\u2019t automatically fill the fields to be queried. In order to make a selection, you can simply click on the field names from the Schema menu, and it will populate the query for you (of course, if you want all fields, you can simply type in a \u2018*\u2019 after SELECT to select all fields).", "Note that they automatically populate the query with a LIMIT. Don\u2019t remove this unless you are 100% sure what you are doing. This is not only good practice, but also means that you don\u2019t accidentally use all of your free usage limit by trying to return a terabyte of data on the back of a simple typo. Most of these datasets are massive and so mistakes are easily done. Once you have your query ready to go, you will get a green check mark telling you that the query is valid, and also you get information on the size of the search as an additional sanity check in the bottom right hand corner of the query screen. This is an upper estimate, and most often if you have a limit the actual process will be much less.", "From here, you can easily build multiple queries and save them before actually running anything. It couldn\u2019t be simpler to keep the queries organised. Simply click on save query when you are done. Saved queries can then be accessed again from the menu on the left hand side. You can even schedule queries to be run at a certain time!", "This isn\u2019t a post on SQL, but have included a few simple additional commands which might be useful when building your queries:", "Select unique values from fieldSELECT DISTINCT field1 FROM tableGroupby a certain field and aggregate other fieldSELECT field1, sum(field2) FROM table GROUPBY field1Join tables together (can be Left, Right, Inner or Outer)SELECT f1 FROM table INNER JOIN table2 ON table.f1 = table2.f1Select with conditionsSELECT f1 FROM table WHERE f1 = \"legend\" or f1 LIKE \"%leg%\"Order your outputsSELECT f1 FROM table ORDER BY f1 DESCSelect date portion and rename fieldSELECT date_part('year', my_date) AS year FROM table", "This only scratches the surface, but with this you can get quite far!", "To run the query once you are happy with it press the run button, and the query will run and then populate the bottom menu with the results. Also note, once run, the query results will be available in the Query History menu on the left, there is no need to re-run.", "You can see the results in table format in place (though the max rows you can see at once is 100), or even go directly to exploring the data using data studio. If you click on the Explore Data button, it will automatically link to a data studio sheet so you can play around with visualisations and EDA. Within seconds you can see useful summaries of your data.", "The finer workings of Google\u2019s DataStudio is a story for another day, but generally speaking it is very user friendly and can help to quick analysis on queries to make sure they were run correctly or that the data makes sense, so that you can tailor your queries as needed.", "Once you are happy with your query, you may want to extract the data for further analysis or modelling. You have quite a few options here \u2014 and if you click on the save results button it will give you a detailed description of all of the options, as well as the limitations.", "Simply put \u2014 if you keep the results on google drive you can save up to 1gb, but if you want to store it on your computer, the download limit is 16k rows. Saving the file to google drive means that you can save bigger queries, and from google drive the csv is very easy to access from google colab and pretty easy to access from a jupyter notebook, you just need to set up an API key.", "So there you have it, you have access to hundreds of terabytes of for free \u2014 ideal for your next data science project!", "Your home for data science.
