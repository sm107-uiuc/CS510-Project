Now, let\u2019s talk a little bit about other worlds. We can train machines to identify candidates for exoplanets with real datasets provided by NASA and Caltech. How cool is that? Thus, I decided to go on an adventure through the mysteries of the universe. My idea is to create a machine learning model that can predict if an observation is a real candidate for an exoplanet or not. The data was collected by the Kepler mission that revealed thousands of planets out of our Solar System. Unfortunately, the Kepler mission ended in 2018. However, it gave us thousands of observations, so we can train our machines to find planets as well.", "And how did the Kepler telescope find planets so far from us if no one can take a clear picture of Pluto from Earth? Well, Kepler was able to find planets by looking for small dips in the brightness of a star when a planet transits in front of it. It is possible to measure the size of the planet based on the depth of the transit and the star\u2019s size.", "For this article, I downloaded the most recent dataset from the Caltech website. However, if you feel adventurous, you can use NASA\u2019s API and do some web scraping out of the fountain. I know I want to explore that soon, but for now, let\u2019s keep things a little easier and use NASA\u2019s and Caltech dataset. You can find a similar dataset on Kaggle, the problem is that the dataset was uploaded three years ago and it\u2019s not up to date. The best prediction on Kaggle got a 95% accuracy. To make things more straightforward, I will skip a few exploratory data analyses, but I shared the notebook\u2019s complete version on my Github. You should be familiar with Python and its main packages prior to running the following code. However, if you are not familiar with Python and its main packages, you should be able to reproduce the same results running the notebook in full.", "First things first, let\u2019s import some packages, print the shape of the dataset and a DataFrame of it. If you want to know more about the imported packages, you can search for it on Google. They contain very resourceful documentation that you can explore.", "We have 9,564 observations and 49 features. The features have some very technical names. Thus, I renamed the columns with more meaningful names. This is an optional step, and you do not need to do it. Since it\u2019s an extended code, you can get it in full on my Github.", "Now, let\u2019s understand what data we have. We can take a look at the DataFrame and use .info() method. I identified a few categorical features that we will take care of soon.", "Let\u2019s choose the targets we want to predict: Exoplanet Archive Disposition and Disposition Using Kepler Data. Since we are focusing on data collected by the Kepler mission, let\u2019s use our second option. We also need a continuous target. Let\u2019s transform our target into a binary feature using lambda.", "Cool! We have multiple categorical columns we won\u2019t need for this model. Let\u2019s drop them as well. I would not drop rows with null values in other circumstances, but since we have a dataset with a decent size, let\u2019s drop all the rows with null values. This is the right time to assign our features and target variables.", "This dataset contains infinite values. We can fix that with the code below. Don\u2019t worry too much about it. I also added an evaluation function so that we can make our final cell cleaner. This function is optional, and running individual evaluation metrics should return the same results.", "Now, let\u2019s run our model. First, we should create a train and test set using Sklearn. We will assign 60% of the dataset to the train set and 40% to the test set.", "And here is where all the fun begins. We will now run our algorithm. Since we are trying to classify if we have a possible exoplanet or not, we will use a Random Forest Classifier for this model. We will use 100 estimators and the Gini Impurity metric. We will analyze a few metrics for this model, but our main focus is Accuracy. We will also look at Recall, F1 Score, Precision, and Confusion Matrix because it doesn\u2019t hurt. I will add the code and a screenshot of my notebook below. Let\u2019s see what results we get.", "Wow, that\u2019s quite impressive! We were able to predict with a 96% accuracy whether our observations is an exoplanet or not. For a model that is quite simple and quick to set up (for you, perhaps, mine took hours!), we were able to accomplish a lot. Now you can occasionally let your friends know that you worked on a project with a dataset provided by NASA that could find exoplanets \u2014 details aren\u2019t necessary. I ran other models just for fun, and you can see it in my Github repository if you want to try tuning their hyperparameters.", "Apparently, we can all try to find a few new worlds out there.
