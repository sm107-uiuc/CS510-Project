It is a great platform being free and all but it doesn\u2019t solve my main use case.", "I want my audience which is mostly business users to see my analysis rendered properly.", "And run it themselves if they like(On Google Colab, any new user will have to use his/her own Google API key and that is a blocker for some)", "Also, I really don\u2019t want to restrict myself to limited computation as is the case with most free offerings.", "And that is where I got to know about Saturn Cloud. Now it is a product made by one of the co-founders of Anaconda, Hugo Shi.", "Yes, the same Anaconda you use to create data science environments in your systems.", "So I had to look into it.", "Anaconda itself solved a particular use case. Downloading and managing Python environments.", "Saturn cloud solves managing Python environments in the cloud.", "Keep Tuned as this is what this article is about.", "So let me specify first of all what Saturn cloud is about.", "I bet most of us have tried installing Python on our machine. And got in trouble with installing Jupyter notebooks/lab.", "It is only after a lot of fiddling around, we get to start with the real work that is data science.", "Or you might have faced difficulty when you needed a large compute and you went to AWS(Amazon Web Services)/GCP(Google Cloud Platform). The way these systems are created seems cryptic to a lot of us.", "Yes, you are not alone. I myself tried getting started with GCP. And actually, I wasn\u2019t able to.", "Now we data scientists love automation. Why don\u2019t we get rid of this menial process of setting up Data Science tools?", "And, that is what SaturnCloud is about.", "It provides us data scientists who are not much interested in setup but are very much interested in data science an easy way to get started.", "So let us get started. You can get started with the free tier.", "You first need to sign up at SaturnCloud and go to the Dashboard.", "Now Creating a notebook/Lab for a project is as simple as selecting the disk Space and selecting the size of your machine and clicking on the Create button. There are different options that SaturnCloud provides when it comes to configurations.", "These configurations can actually cover requirements for a lot of practical data science projects.", "And setting up a machine with a GPU is a breeze with the last config option. So you can say bye-bye to the long processes of AWS/GCP to acquire GPUs.", "You can also define an auto Shutoff Duration for your project. This is a functionality I particularly like with SaturnCloud. I have already been stung a lot of times with my Google Colab notebook server shutting off after an hour of inactivity.", "Here I can just set up my notebook Shutoff Duration time to be 1 hour, 6 hours or never. Never is what I prefer.", "You also have an option of choosing default configurations using apt-get, pip, and conda using the Advanced options. But mainly I don\u2019t worry about that at the start as it comes preloaded with the scientific python stack.", "And I can download any new packages I require using the terminal itself once I create the notebook/lab.", "So, once you have created a Jupyter Notebook/Lab you should see this on your dashboard:", "Here you can click on Go To Jupyter Lab. And Voila you are up and running.", "This is yet another functionality provided by SaturnCloud that is very much valuable to me.", "I am a Data Scientist and I need to share reports with my business partners. Also, I am a technical blogger and I need to share code with my readers.", "Now the reports I share with my need to be rendered properly on the web.", "And the code I share to my readers needs to be executable.", "Saturn Cloud solves both use cases for me.", "Let me start with an example here. I aspire to share analysis on Football data with my readers. I am going to take code from one of my most liked blog posts \u2014 3 Awesome Visualization Techniques for every dataset", "First of all, I code as normal with Jupyter Lab. I create a folder named visproject for my project there. I upload the data there and create and write code in my jupyter notebook within that folder", "Now to share my work, All I need to do is open a terminal right in the Jupyter lab and run the command:", "Now go to the publishing section. You should see:", "Now here I have different options. I can keep my notebook secret(private)/public and I can also click on \u201cI\u2019ll pay for others to execute this notebook\u201d.", "Once you click on I\u2019ll pay for others to execute, you should see something like:", "I have made this notebook public and executable with resource allocated as above. Once you are satisfied with the settings you can click the Save button.", "This is how it looks. The result:", "I loved the way the code blocks and all the visualization get rendered without any clutter as we see with the Google Colab notebooks. It looks just like a report as it is intended to be.", "I also like the \u201cRun in Saturn\u201d option provided where user can just go and click over to run this code by themselves without any need of an explicit login.", "Do try to run it HERE yourself. I am sure you are going to love it.", "One thing I liked about SaturnCloud is the cost associated.", "And that is not a statement I make for a lot of paid products.", "I get all the functionality with SaturnCloud without any hassle and for the Basic Plan which I currently use, I only pay the cloud provider cost plus a very little overhead.", "Now it is a matter of personal taste but I am willing to pay this very small overhead for the quality of service provided and the hassle avoided.", "And actually, I recoup most of these costs as while stopping servers on AWS/GCP is a little bit of a hassle, it is a piece of cake with Saturn Cloud.", "Here is the list of costs to see for yourself.", "SaturnCloud makes life much easier for a data scientist by taking care of a lot of redundant work one has to do at almost no cost.", "I am not saying I won\u2019t create a custom server ever, but I will avoid doing it as long as I can use SaturnCloud.", "And even when I do need to create a custom server, I might look into the enterprise account provided by Saturn Cloud if my company lets me.", "As they say on their website:", "Having spent time doing data science as well as building data science tools, we are all too familiar with the friction and pain points at the intersection of data science, technology, and developer operations.", "We can\u2019t do your modeling for you \u2014 but we can take some of the pain away.", "So what are you waiting for? Just get started with Data Science with your own server. It definitely has its benefits.", "You can try to run the published SaturnCloud notebook HERE yourself.", "I am going to be writing more of such posts in the future too.
