However, are you attracted enough by the offer to come to your nearest Starbucks shop and spend your money?", "The dataset used contains simulated data from Starbucks that imitate customer behaviour on their rewards mobile app. Starbucks sends out an offer once every few days, which can be either an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). However not every users get the same offer, and every each offer has a validity period before the offer expires.", "By combining demographic data such as age and gender, with transaction and offer data, there are two goals that we would like to achieved:", "Imagined yourself as a young adult female with average income and while you check your mobile phone, you see an ad: a BOGO promotion from Starbucks that will expired 3 days from now. Will you used the promotion?", "Or imagined if you are a wealthy busy middle-aged adult male. Will you even have the time to see that ad from Starbucks? Or maybe turns out you will used the BOGO promotion directly within your nearest Starbucks shop?", "This model aimed to predict whether particular customer within certain demographic group will viewed or/and completed the offer that Starbucks sent.", "How effective is the offer that Starbucks gives to you in relation to the average transactions? If you received and viewed certain offers from Starbucks, how much amount of transactions that you would spend in Starbucks? This model aimed to know in average how much money members will spent after they see the offers until the validity period expired.", "Rather than demographic attributes, promotion variables (types, rewards, difficulty) influence more people to view the ads based on correlation graph above. Offer type like BOGO seems very attractive. More than 70% of offers are viewed by members. It is a very significant number compare to another types of campaign that only have a successful rate of 57.9%.", "However the story is different with other type of campaigns like informational campaign that will inform you if there are new type of drinks. Only 55% members viewed the ads.", "The most correlated demographic attributes with offer viewed is the age group. As the graph below shows, 41.6% of member in the young adult age group (17\u201325) would not even bother to see the offer, while other age group reach 63.1% of successful rate.", "Why is that? It seems that the young adult age group only responding well to the BOGO promotional campaign. While 68.2% viewed the BOGO campaign, only 52% of them seeing another types of campaigns.", "Now, let\u2019s proceed to the relation of offer completed to other variables. Noted that an offer is categorised as completed is when member exceed the minimum spend before the validity of the promotion expired.", "One of the interesting notes to be found is that member who joined in 2018 (newest member at the dataset) have failure rate of 71.5%. It is nearly 20% more compare to another members!", "But how about the type of offer? While BOGO campaign is the most successful in offer to be viewed, the discount campaign having more influences to the offer completed rate.", "Gender proves to be crucial here. Men is 14% more to tend not completed the offer compared to women.", "We know that men is unlikely to complete an offer compared to women. Now, which type of men would completed an offer and which type of offer that attracting enough to be completed by them? By combining another insights above, we could see that discount is proved to be much popular which completed by 59% of men that joined as member before 2018.", "Let\u2019s proceed to model. As there are two classes as label, offer viewed and completed, MultiOutputClassifier is used which means there will be four different type of outputs, customer who not viewed and not completed an offer (0,0), customer who not viewed and completed an offer (0,1), customer who viewed and not completed an offer (1,0), and customer who both viewed and completed the offer (1,1). Two ensemble learning models, gradient boost and random forest are used along with grid search.", "The best model that return with the best mean test score of 54% in the training dataset is gradient boost with hyperparameters of learning rate 0.25 and n_estimators 100.", "Why gradient boost is performing better than random forest? Gradient boosting performing better than random forest for unbalanced datasets like the training dataset used for this model (only 8% of the label is customer who not viewed and completed an offer). Boosting focuses step by step on difficult examples that give a nice strategy to deal with unbalanced datasets by strengthening the impact of the positive class.", "Let\u2019s see how the model perform the test dataset.", "Demographic group attributes like income, gender and age group dominate correlation to the average spending of members after they view the offers during validity period of the offer.", "Members that categorised as member with high income most frequently spend around 30 dollars, medium income mostly spend 20 dollars and low income mostly spend around 5-10 dollars.", "Male and female behaves differently in spending after seeing an offer. While female spending most frequently around 25\u201330 dollars, male mostly only spend below 10 dollars.", "Most interestingly is comparison between elderly age group (more than 60 years old) and other age groups. Elderly group spend most frequently around 30 dollars while other age groups around 10 dollars.", "Let\u2019s proceed to model. Gradient boosting and random forest are used along with grid to search the best model and hyperparameters.", "The best model after running grid search is random forest with hyperparameters of number of estimators of 300, max depth of 10 and minimum samples split of 10. The mean absolute error and mean squared error on the training dataset are 5.52 and 186.80.", "The reason why random forest perform better than gradient boost for this regression problem is because of the outlier that presents on the data (see graph above). Outliers can be bad for boosting because boosting builds each tree on previous trees\u2019 residuals/errors. Outliers will have much larger residuals than non-outliers, so gradient boosting will focus a disproportionate amount of its attention on those points.", "Let\u2019s see how it performs in the test dataset.", "On the test dataset, the mean absolute error and mean squared error are 6.33 and 279.52.", "Compared to the range value of average spending in the dataset, from 0 to 600, the mean absolute error of 6.33 is sound astonishing, however we should take account of the mean value of the dataset which is only around 15.", "Full credit to Udacity and Starbucks in providing the datasets.
