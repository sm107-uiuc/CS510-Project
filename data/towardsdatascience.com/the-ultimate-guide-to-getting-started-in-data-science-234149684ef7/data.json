All things being equal, higher education is the most reliable way to start working in data science.", "But it isn\u2019t the only way, it probably isn\u2019t the best way, and that way definitely doesn\u2019t work for everyone.

Take advantage of that!", "With or without a degree, the first thing you should do is look at the specific area of data science that interests you.", "It\u2019s not as straightforward as you might think.", "The term \u201cdata science\u201d as it relates to job opportunities covers a pretty fluid and extensive area of expertise and possible career options right now! (It\u2019s a safe bet that finding a job in a new field is the reason you\u2019re reading this article.

Make sure you find companies where you\u2019d be excited to work! Research previous job postings that they\u2019ve created and tailor your learning path to fit those requirements. You\u2019ll likely see that you\u2019ll need to learn Python or R, SQL, possibly AWS, Spark, Hadoop, and so on. You\u2019ll want to learn about data visualization techniques and tools. Depending on what interests you, you may need to learn concepts like natural language processing, image recognition, machine learning techniques, and so on. You might also find that the job you want requires that candidates have a Masters or a PhD in a specific area of study. That\u2019s essential information! If the company you want to work for uses an algorithm to screen candidates and your resume doesn\u2019t match their specifications, no human will ever set eyes on it.", "If you want to work for one specific company, learn what they require from successful candidates, make a list, and start checking off everything you learn as you go. And never, ever forget the power of domain knowledge! It won\u2019t be in the job post, but learn about the specific issues and challenges that the industry you\u2019re looking at faces. Pay attention to soft skills too! They can seriously set you apart from the competition. If you already have experience communicating, presenting, managing, speaking, and so on, you\u2019re ahead of the game.", "If you\u2019re feeling brave, reach out to someone at the organization where you want to work with an email that says that you\u2019re entering the field and you want to work there more than anywhere else. Ask them what would make you the ideal candidate for a future position! Maybe they won\u2019t respond, but I\u2019ll bet some of them do.", "If you get a response, no matter what that response is, send them a note saying how grateful you are that they took the time to respond.", "If you can get a graduate degree, do it! There\u2019s no substitute for high-quality education and the networking possibilities that it offers.

That\u2019s okay! A PhD is a great thing to have and it can, without question, open doors for you. But having a degree is not a guarantee that you\u2019ll get a job or that you\u2019ll be great at your job. Having an advanced degree does not, in any way, guarantee that you\u2019ll be a successful candidate for a particular job. Here\u2019s a really good perspective of what makes a great data scientist.", "There\u2019s also nothing that says that you need a specific level of education to become a data scientist. Would it help to have it? Of course! But more and more, people are finding that having completed great online courses plus having a fantastic portfolio of projects that you\u2019ve thought through and developed on your own combined with additional experience (previous work experience and open source contributions, for example) can be as effective (if not more) than simply having a certain degree.", "You can find countless excellent articles from writers who have taken a slightly less traditional path and from writers who argue that having an advanced degree isn\u2019t preparation enough for the real world. We\u2019ve also published articles from authors who have taken an in-depth look at the skills required to become a data scientist (the author wrote this one for 2018 and has an update for 2019) and specifically at whether or not you need a graduate degree to work in data science.", "For a long time, data scientists truly were scientists. Education was crucial! Now, however, with the rampant and overwhelming increase in available data and the necessity for businesses to process that data in meaningful ways (as well as the availability of technology, tools, and libraries that didn\u2019t exist ten years ago), the field of data science has changed.", "Today, there are a ton of business who have read that they need to have data scientists but don\u2019t have a specific plan or specific expectations for a data science team. A number of businesses who are looking for data scientists are really in need of a data analyst or a business analyst. Some companies just need help making sense of the piles of data that they\u2019re sitting on and might ask you to create basic predictive models. Some businesses are really looking for data engineers or machine learning engineers. Because the field is in a time of evolution and fluidity, an advanced degree is no longer an absolute requirement. Having the ability to deal with a company\u2019s data, analyze it, and communicate your findings in a meaningful way does not necessarily require a PhD anymore.", "But if you want to get a real head start on the process and you can make it happen, get that education! It can only help you.", "If, for whatever reason, the Masters/PhD thing doesn\u2019t work for you, take a look at the huge number of online courses out there! They aren\u2019t all good, of course. You\u2019ll want to look at which courses teach what you want to know, which courses are popular and have great reviews, which courses successful people in the field have taken, and so on.", "If you can focus on this path and dedicate yourself to it, there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t be in a fantastic position to get hired in data science before the end of this year.", "First and foremost, think about your learning style! Some people learn best by reading, some by listening, some by watching videos, some by working through exercises. Some people need to find answers on their own, and some need to have the answers provided so they can see them and work backwards. Whatever your style, there\u2019s a fleet of courses out there for you! (No matter what you choose, though, make sure you type through every single line of code yourself. There\u2019s no substitute. Making your fingers do the work gets that information in your head in a shockingly effective way!)", "I\u2019d highly recommend getting started for free, just to make sure that you enjoy the work and not only the hype. You can find fabulous free resources across the web. Here is a great compilation of free resources!", "If you don\u2019t have any coding experience, you might want to take a look at some online courses that teach the programming language that interests you. Python and R are the most popular choices for data science. There are a number of reasons for picking one over the other, but Python has been leading the field for a number of years now and it remains the smart first choice (unless, of course, you already know that R is a requirement for the positions that interest you). Choose the language that\u2019s right for you!", "Obviously, that\u2019s what worked for my learning style and I chose to learn Python. If you have courses you\u2019ve liked, share them in the comments!", "If you want to start learning to code, you could check out:", "Make sure you\u2019re reading at least one or two articles and/or listening to a data science podcast or watching data science videos every day. You can read articles in the bathroom or listen to podcasts in bed if you need to, but do it. Take advantage of the incredible wealth of knowledge that\u2019s out there to stay current and get comfortable with the language of data science. Of course, I recommend the articles here on Towards Data Science, our podcast, and our YouTube channel, but you have a lot of options!", "We recently published this great list of the top 20 data science podcasts.", "Now buckle down and get on those math skills. You want to be comfortable with statistics, linear algebra, and basic calculus at the very least. Don\u2019t be afraid of math! Math skills are critical if you\u2019re going to work in this field. Brush up on your skills at Khan Academy or maybe take advantage of some free courses on Udacity.", "This article does a great job of outlining necessary data science math skills and how to start learning data science for free!", "Once you\u2019ve started getting comfortable with your chosen programming language and you\u2019re getting a little cosier with statistics (at the very least), start checking out data science courses! You don\u2019t need to be an expert programmer to get started with introductory online courses. But a basic familiarity will help you avoid feeling overwhelmed. You might want to check out Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, and edX, or you might be interested in Datacamp, Dataquest, Springboard, or Elite Data Science. Also, Coursera allows you to audit courses for free! You won\u2019t get an official certificate, but you will get the information without spending a dime. (You can also apply for financial aid with Coursera).", "Are you someone who learns well by reading? Did you know that you can learn on Towards Data Science? We\u2019ve curated some of our best articles by topic to help you learn more at your own pace!", "Still interested in working in data science? Start looking for scholarships, challenges, and competitions! You wouldn\u2019t believe the information available out there through scholarship programs and challenges. I\u2019ve done the Bertelsmann Data Science Scholarship challenge through Udacity, the Facebook AI PyTorch scholarship challenge, and the Secure and Private AI scholarship challenge and there are a lot more out there. Each of these challenges teaches truly useful information and puts you in contact with an incredible community of people for free.", "Make sure you connect with the amazing people in your courses and challenges on LinkedIn! While you\u2019re at it, make sure your LinkedIn profile looks good. Fill out your education section, certificates, skills, and add any projects you\u2019ve completed. Write a quality \u201cabout me\u201d section that showcases who you are and how you can help other people. (You\u2019d be surprised what a difference changing \u201cI am experienced with data visualization techniques\u201d to \u201cI can help you use your data to tell great stories\u201d can make!) Endorse the skills of some of the people that you\u2019ve gotten to know well and they might just endorse some of your skills in return.", "Once you start getting comfortable with these concepts, you\u2019ll see that you need to start adding a few more tools to your toolbox. SQL is incredibly important. You definitely want to start getting comfortable with data visualization techniques too. There are, of course, tools that you\u2019ll have been using in your online courses, and you might also want to get familiar with Tableau if you haven\u2019t already. It\u2019s a popular tool, and it does a great job of visually communicating data analysis in a way that\u2019s effective for beginners on both sides of the table. You definitely want to be familiar with the workings of Git and GitHub, and there are a lot of online courses available. (This is a decent free course for beginners. This one deals specifically with version control and tends to be more highly recommended.)", "Start looking at Kaggle! Not everyone uses Kaggle or participates in competitions, but they\u2019re an incredibly helpful resource for people who are interested in putting their skills to the test. Also, doing well on Kaggle can propel you into some interesting situations and brand new careers. There are a lot of people who have worked hard putting together their best tips and tricks for Kaggle success, so don\u2019t feel like you have to figure out everything on your own.", "Are you interested in hackathons? We\u2019ve heard some amazing stories from people who have gotten ready for and participated in hackathons and had some pretty astounding experiences.", "Still going? It might be time to start looking at paid courses. I\u2019m a fan of the Udacity Nanodegrees, but you may want to invest in Coursera or edX courses. You might even decide that a Bootcamp is right for you.", "You might want to do Udacity\u2019s Data Science Nanodegree or their Machine Learning Nanodegree. You might also be interested in programs like:", "We\u2019ve published great stories from people who have attended Bootcamps at:", "Now it\u2019s time to focus on your projects! Clean up your GitHub profile. Make sure you\u2019re pushing commits every day if you can and feature the best of your projects. At this point, you will have put together some projects in your courses and should be comfortable enough to start working on a project of your own. Find a topic that genuinely interests you and build something amazing or look at something in a new way! Solve a problem! Really get in there and make this project your own. You never know where a personal project might take you.", "Working on something you care about will give you something that you can talk about in a new way at a new level. This will help you when you\u2019re networking and when you\u2019re interviewing!", "Now start contributing to open source organizations! Make some meaningful contributions to organizations on GitHub. GitHub has a section devoted to projects that are great for new contributors! You can search for projects that are tagged specifically for first-timers or are beginner-friendly. There\u2019s also a solid GitHub repo dedicated to excellent first PR opportunities that\u2019s worth checking out.", "Find an organization that you can really help or one that seriously interests you and get involved. Most open source organizations are operating with little to no budget and appreciate all the help they can get. They want you to succeed! I\u2019ve worked closely with the incredible people over at NumPy, and they honestly want to help people understand the process of contributing to NumPy so that they feel comfortable contributing long-term. They don\u2019t want you to give up! It\u2019s not a simple process, but they want you to succeed and keep contributing.", "Help with known issues, help with documentation, help with whatever you can! If you find an organization that clicks with you and your interests, make helping them a priority. You may find yourself on their team before you know it!", "(Head\u2019s up! You\u2019re now building experience that will make your resume stand out!)", "Also, I\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again. Start writing!!!", "Write about what you learn. Write to share your information and help other people. You\u2019ll be astonished by the difference between understanding a concept and understanding a concept well enough to write about it. Also, the tech community is heavily invested in helping others (just look at everything from open source organizations to Quora, Stack Overflow, and so on) and you want to add your voice to the community.", "On a personal note: writing is hands-down the best way I\u2019ve found to get noticed as a beginner! The opportunities I\u2019ve been offered as a result of my articles are mindblowing. I\u2019ve been offered positions as a consultant, speaking engagements, writing and editing work, teaching and mentoring positions, data science positions, and more based solely on these articles.", "So now you have great projects that you can talk about in-depth, a series of articles that demonstrate what you know and what you\u2019ve learned, a solid GitHub profile, several certificates to your name, you\u2019ve been contributing to open source organizations, and you may have even completed a Kaggle competition or two or participated in a hackathon. You have an optimized LinkedIn profile that showcases your experience, your skills, and your connections. You\u2019ve also (I hope) been fleshing out your resume with projects, skills, and open source experience and it\u2019s ready to go.", "Get out there and start connecting with people! As much fun as it is to just blindly send out your resume to hundreds of organizations that are advertising jobs and using algorithms and recruiters to screen candidates, you might find that the quickest (and least painful) way to get hired is to have an actual conversation with someone at an organization!", "Remember those emails you sent out at the beginning of the process? Reach out to those people again and thank them once more for their help. Remind them who you are and let them know what you\u2019ve accomplished in such a short time. Mention how excited you would be to talk to someone in the company. Demonstrate your communication skills, your ability to follow advice, and how self-motivated you are. See what kind of response you get!", "Talk to the people from your scholarships and courses who have found great jobs and see what they\u2019ve learned. You might also want to have a conversation or two with the people you\u2019ve connected with in that open source organization. You never know, they might even be able to recommend you for a cool position. That\u2019s basically what LinkedIn is all about!", "For those of you out there who are introverted, have low self-esteem, and are suffering from a massive case of imposter syndrome\u2026never, ever, ever forget that there are many companies out there that offer a referral bonus to people who successfully recommend a candidate for a job opening. One or two of your connections might just be interested in earning a little money\u2026", "Also, remember that people don\u2019t know the things that you haven\u2019t told them. Do you know which of your LinkedIn connections are looking for work? Do you know how many of the other people at that open source organization are actively trying to find jobs? Probably not! We like to assume that people know everything about us, but they don\u2019t. Speak up! You might be amazed at how many people out there would love to lend a hand if they can.", "Stop procrastinating! Get out there and start working in data science!", "Thanks for reading!
