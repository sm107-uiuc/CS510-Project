I studied everything from Bahasa Melayu to Zulu, so I know the rich variety of grammars and syntaxes that exist in human languages.", "Yet although the capacity for linguistic fluency is our shared human birthright, one of the highest barriers to entry for aspiring data scientists is acquiring the language needed to talk to computers \u2014 the language of code. Consider the following:", "Someone who speaks English but isn\u2019t trained in computers would not immediately intuit what this code is doing.", "What\u2019s interesting to a linguist is how programming languages fall on a spectrum, from the extremely rigid and opaque to the nearly conversational. JavaScript (above) is on the decidedly non-natural end of formal languages; pure Python falls more towards the other side:", "Even someone with very little programming experience could at least take an educated guess at what\u2019s happening here and not be entirely wrong.", "Both for loops produce the same output. Both languages are Turing-complete. But one is intuitively more accessible to beginners from a purely linguistic standpoint than the other.", "In a world dominated by data and computers, the ability to manipulate both is an increasingly vital skill. There\u2019s a growing knowledge gap \u2014 and, consequently, an income gap \u2014 between those who can and those who can\u2019t.", "Programming languages that allow non-programmers to access the tools of computer science are therefore hard to overvalue. Take R, for instance. As a programming language, it is an oddball. You can achieve the same ends using many different strategies (violating the Zen of Python, which states \u201cThere should be one \u2014 and preferably only one \u2014 obvious way to do it.\u201d).", "But this provides a great advantage to statisticians, research scientists, and others who need to analyze data on the fly: \u201cIt allows statisticians to do very intricate and complicated analyses without knowing the blood and guts of computing systems.\u201d", "It\u2019s also free and open-source, which means anyone with a computer and some moxie can download it, learn it, and connect with its considerable user base. That\u2019s great news for populations who are traditionally underrepresented in tech, especially women, for whom the R community has proven a bastion of gender diversity. It also means you don\u2019t need to spend money or have any specialized education beyond basic computer literacy to get started learning it.", "Human brains can do things computers cannot do \u2014 like recognize that ewes, does, lionesses, hens, and sows are all female animals. Our cognition means that our language can afford to be less literally precise and more metaphorical. (A computer would need, say, explicit XML tags and attributes to achieve the same categorization.) At some point, then, every serious programmer will need to learn things like regular expressions and formal syntactic conventions.", "But why start with those? Breaking into tech is hard enough as it is, especially if you\u2019re not well-off, white, and male. Google\u2019s 2019 diversity report revealed a decline in women and minorities in leadership positions, down from an already low 29.4% to 25.7% for women. Only 25.7% of new tech hires in 2018 were not men. Eighty-three percent of tech executives are white. Accessibility to computer science education is a serious problem even for the relatively privileged \u2014 colleges are capping computer science majors due to high demand, further widening the inequality gap.", "Once someone has acquired the patterns of algorithmic thinking that underlie computer programming, they\u2019ll be able to apply them to any programming language. So why not start with a language that makes it easy and natural to learn those concepts, rather than frustrating?", "The founder of Flatiron School underscores this point, noting that what\u2019s important isn\u2019t the first language you learn, but learning how to learn, acquiring universal ideas, and learning to apply them to all kinds of different contexts. The language is almost immaterial; coding can even be taught using blocks and real-world objects.", "In truth, all programming languages are abstractions that allow people to indirectly write machine code, which is syntactically and semantically incomprehensible, by providing an interface that is more or less like natural human speech. It\u2019s not farfetched to think that machine learning might enable us to code directly in English. For a beginning programmer, the closer to one\u2019s native tongue the programming language, the better. Anyone can learn the hard things eventually, but it\u2019s crucial to level the playing field for those starting out. Providing a bridge from plain English to computer-speak via hybrid languages that share characteristics of both seems a natural consequence of the growing ubiquity of coding as a required job skill.", "Your home for data science.
