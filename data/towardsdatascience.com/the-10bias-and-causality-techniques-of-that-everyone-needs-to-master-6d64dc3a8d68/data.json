Machine Learning is about prediction and causality about real effects, do these two themes have something in common? Yes, a lot in common and this series of posts tries to bridge these two sub-areas of Data Science.", "I like to think that Machine Learning is just a Data Grinder, if you put good quality data, you get good quality predictions, but if you put garbage, it will keep grinding, but don\u2019t expect good predictions to come out, it\u2019s just ground garbage, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll talk about in this post.", "Index:Basic Definitions;Causality in Data Science;1 \u2014 Simpson\u2019s Paradox;2 \u2014 Validity Term, External Validity, and Granger Causality;3 \u2014 Ecological Fallacy;4 \u2014 Omitted Variable Bias;5 \u2014 Counterfactuals;6 \u2014 Intervention and Design of Experiments;7 \u2014 Selection and Survival Bias;Conclusion and next steps.", "What is Machine Learning? Quite simply, it is the set of techniques that look for patterns in the data to fulfill a given goal without having to explicitly pass instructions. For example, Netflix\u2019s movie recommendation system.", "What is Data Science? Multidisciplinary area that brings together statistics,Machine Learning and Computing to solve data-intensive problems, analysis and insights. A more detailed description can be found below:", "Here it begins to get a little harder (and philosophical) to define. Great thinkers of the past have made such advances as Aristotle, Decartes, Spinoza, Kant, Mill, Hume, and many others with nothing definite, and I will not define it. For us, for now, it will simply be the real effect of a variable, iehow much the variable will affect a target if it occurs. For example, smoking (our variable) increases the likelihood that you have lung cancer (our target) by + x% (our causal effect).", "It sounds simple, but the problem is that by placing variables that have no effects but that are only correlated with the variables that cause them, the latter capture the effects of the former and there is no good method of knowing if this is happening. For forecasts this is great, because often we do not have causal variables but by placing a series of variables that are correlated with causal variables the model can better understand and predict.", "If you\u2019re concerned only with forecasting, such as a Machine Learning engineer, maybe causation is really a minor detail, but if your predictions are not inert but generate some action on whoever uses them, perhaps you should start worrying about causation. If you are a Data Scientist and are not concerned with causation, you may not be a Scientist but an Engineer. To do science is to discover (or, more commonly, try to refute) causal effects. Of course in many models we will only be concerned with making simple predictions and we may not need scientists to do so.", "In addition, an increasingly intense concern in the Machine Learning world is about bias of choice. We already have several countries (especially in Europe) that allow users to know the reasons for a possible algorithmic decision (such as borrowing, insurance or job vacancy), so think carefully about bias,Discrimination and causation are not only important but can free you from committing a crime. We talked a little about this in Interpreting BlackBox\u2019s Algorithms:", "In Data Science, we often train machine learning models to predict a target, such as predicting whether or not a customer will repay a loan, and we have best practices for doing so, such as balancing the complexity of the model so that it doesn\u2019t get stuck very simple, that doesn\u2019t understand the complexity of the problem, and no more complex than necessary producing overfitting. But in fact, what we want is for it to generalize very well, and for that, it is ideal that it understands the causal effects, ie how the variables affect the target and how they relate to each other.", "As we said, A major advantage of the Machine Learning model is that it does not necessarily have to capture true effects to improve its prediction, any side effects, or proxies for these real events also work and this makes life much easier for those who are creating this modeling. But not everything is perfect,This facility starts to generate some problems as well. Let\u2019s go to the examples:", "Simpson\u2019s paradox is that by measuring the correlation between two variables they display the wrong value, which is corrected by controlling for a third variable that causes confusion.", "A trend or result present when data is placed in groups that reverse or disappear when data is combined. Edward Hugh Simpson", "Simpson\u2019s Paradox was originally not exactly an inversion of the effect signal, but merely a change in magnitude when controlling for the variables that were \u201cconfusing\u201d the effects, but this has become so normal in analysis that lately we have only considered a true Paradox of effect. Simpson when the effects are reversed, and yet it is more common than you think. One way of thinking is that it is not a true paradox, but a puzzle that we do not know all the pieces but need to assemble to trust their effects.", "A famous example occurred at the beginning of the 1973 school year when comparing the gender ratio in UC Berkeley graduate school, the ratio of 44% men and 35% women was noted. Peter Bickel and his team examined the data and noticed something quite curious, there was discrimination (which the college feared so much) but in favor of women in 4 of the 6 departments (and indifferent in the other 2). It turns out that the departments women tended to apply for were much smaller, and this variable that was \u201comitted\u201d in the analyzes reversed the result of discrimination against women to discrimination against men.", "To solve this problem, we need to understand whether our analysis or prediction is not going through a Simpson paradox, that is, if we are forgetting some confounding variable, and unfortunately, there is no scientific way to prove that there are no effects. tracked, but there are good practices that we\u2019ll see in upcoming posts.", "Simpson\u2019s paradox happens all the time, but it\u2019s hard to diagnose without having enough intuition about the data you\u2019re working on. Below is a post that explains how to control effects with linear regressions:", "Imagine that we have a model to predict the probability of the sun rising over the next 10 minutes and we add several variables in this model, such as temperature, hour and minute of day, luminosity and others. When I train my model I notice that the most important variable is called \u201cRooster Song\u201d and when I take this variable the model loses a lot of performance. In the Machine Learning criteria I should keep the variable, because a few moments after the rooster crows the sun rises.", "When we think beyond correlations with our causal lenses, we know that the Rooster is not causing Sunrise and even if it has a high correlation, as this effect is not causal, there is a risk in using it. It may be that one day the rooster will sing earlier and obviously the sun will not rise sooner, or it may be that the rooster wakes up unwell, not singing, and yet the sun will rise (I hope) and in all these cases the model will err miserably because it relied on a non-causal correlation.", "In this case our model will have a short shelf life because the variables used are not the causal variables, so the effects are not true. Or in the econometric wording, we say that this model has no external validity since if we use it somewhere other than a bump, it will not work.How to solve? We can remove the \u201cCrowing Rooster\u201d variable, our model would seem to get worse (the metrics will decrease), but it will be more stable (and more generic with external validity) in the medium term as it will not depend on a volatile variable ( with high variance).", "Of course this is an unrealistic example, but it happens very often in Real Machine Learning projects. Think about whether your variables have an expiration date. If they are causal they will last much longer.", "Ecological fallacies are a bit more generic than our Simpson Paradox (its like our Simpson's paradox was a specific case of ecological fallacy). Here the problem arises when analyzing *aggregate* variables and making assumptions about the disaggregated data, ie looking at the macro and deducing the micro. Let\u2019s illustrate this example with the likelihood that we will find a rich individual in a US state. The first thing we think about is to take the average wealth per state that is summarized below:", "I would say the chance of meeting richer people is higher in richer states than in poorer states, it seems to make sense, but that\u2019s where the mistake is! This hypothesis is not necessarily true because when analyzing the aggregated data (by state) we are referring to the averages and when we are talking about the probability of finding a rich individual we are referring to the median and the probability would only be higher in a symmetrical distribution (or, in this specific case, asymmetrical to the right) which is quite rare in these cases.", "A second related example would be the famous tendency of the richer (individually) to vote more often for Republican candidates, and when we analyze aggregate data (by state) this effect is reversed. To illustrate, in 2004 J.W.Bush won the election in the 15 poorest states while John Kery won in the 11 richest states. However, Bush\u2019s vote among the richest (> 200k / y) was double that of Kery, again because distributions are quite asymmetrical beyond the average being heavily affected by outliners.", "Another way to understand Simpson\u2019s Paradox (and which economists prefer) is by biasing the omitted variable. Imagine now that our model should predict ice cream sales on the beach and when we look at the correlation between explanatory variables, One of the most positively correlated is the sale of coconut water and we added in the model and are happy with our predictions. But does selling more coconut water actually cause more ice cream sales?", "On closer inspection, these two products are substitutes, meaning they play similar roles for those who are buying (freshening up) and that increasing the sale of one should, to some degree, actually decrease the sale of the other already. that bathers\u2019 money is limited. This happens because, again, we have a third variable causing both ice cream sales variation and coconut water sales variation and when we control this variable (which may be the number of bathers, the average temperature or if it is a holiday) the sale of coconut water starts to decrease ice cream sales in our model, even with a correlation, positive individual, its partial correlations (by controlling the temperature) become negative.", "This is yet another example of how important it is to have good intuitions about data and not just run machine learning blindly.", "\u201cI don\u2019t believe in astrology, but I really wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m Gemini, so I\u2019m skeptical. \u201d", "When we try to deny (or prove) the effect of a variable with statistical tests we basically want to know if adding that variable causes any change. A classic example is the signs. When you measure people\u2019s performance (generically in this example) against their zodiac signs, We reject the hypothesis that they make a difference as in Nature\u2019s publication with CEOs of the top 500 companies, we accept that they make a difference (in numerous studies). Here I want to discuss some of these experiments that claim that the Zodiac Signs influence your personality and potential.", "The difficulty here is not having a counterfactual, but what is a counterfactual anyway? For us a counterfactual will be an individual exactly the same in everything, with only one variable different between them, in our case, the sign. When we do chemistry or physics experiments, it\u2019s reasonably easy to create counterfactuals, for inanimate objects can be repeated, like two exactly the same chemical experiments, where we put one reagent different from the other and the differences are attributed to the reagent. In social science or economics, this is much harder, imagine thinking of a counterfactual of countries? Hard right? So we expect \u201cnatural\u201d events like Korea\u2019s separation into two. But how would we make a counterfactual for signs? We would need a person with and without a sign, impossible. In this case we need to resort to statistical modeling as synthetic control or propensing score matching.", "Our example is from a study that investigates the sign of American super athletes. When we look at the distribution of players who can get into this high performing group, we see that there is no random distribution in their signs. Apparently some signs take advantage over others. One possible explanation is that stars really change their personality and their chances of becoming a sports star. Another possible explanation is that signs are capturing some effect from another variable, but what would it be? Well, each sign comprises a time interval at birth, and the signs that are associated with the end of the school year have an advantage over the beginning, because children spend all their childhood and adolescence being the oldest in the class, this gives extra confidence throughout education, making them the most confident which in turn is a super important attribute for high performance in sports and business. Knowing this, a tip, become more confident!", "Returning to counterfactuals, how could we have a twin \u201cbrother\u201d with a different sign? The idea here is to compare is to look for a counterfactual, may be a second country that is very similar but that the school year begins 6 months later, or even seek some state that changed the rule in some year. And when we do that, the effect is reversed! discarding the hypothesis that signs make a difference.", "This example is very important as it can be generalized to dozens of other Machine Learning applications. When training our model, we do not pay attention to the small print, for example that data has to be produced in an unbiased way to be used to train a model. I have seen pricing cases (and other intervention cases) more than once that use historical prices / discounts to train a model that will predict future prices / discounts. But what we want is not to predict any price, But the best price! And who said those historical training prices are the optimal prices? If in company policy, it has always been thrifty when practicing discounts for example, all the algorithm will do is repeat that thrift that may be very far from the ideal price / discount.", "This case illustrates the intervention effects that are central to causal modeling. If your Machine Learning algorithm predicts and doesn\u2019t affect reality (how will it rain tomorrow?), Intervention is not a concern, But if your algorithm produces input for the business to generate an action such as altering the discount that a customer will be entitled to to maximize their probability of buying, you have to take into account the customer\u2019s reaction when training your model.", "There are many examples and ways around this problem, from training a model where prices were randomly priced to produce a good experiment design and hence a reliable training dataset (as suggested by Fischer in 1936) to more modern approaches like multi armed bandit that is able to take an A/ B test (C/D /etc\u2026) while optimizing your business metrics.", "Our next post will be exploring this topic further.", "Here are the most legal and difficult problems to solve. Selection bias has to do with designing well-done experiments, because once you\u2019ve collected the skewed data, it\u2019s very hard to correct or even know it\u2019s there.", "Let\u2019s go to the first example. Imagine that we want to measure how much data science training increases the productivity of a company\u2019s employees. Our first approach is to send an email to every company saying that there are 50 vacancies and the first to register will take the course. We do the training and measure productivity before and after training. Can we say that this observed difference is the fault of training? Unfortunately not, because probably the first people to sign up for the program are not random, they are probably the most attentive, faster and even harder to take an extra course and when measuring the outcome of the experiment we would have to randomly choose their participants.", "The second example is the classic case of Dr. Wald helping in the efforts of World War II. The story is about where we should reinforce aircraft armor.If we reinforced everything, it would be very heavy and its autonomy would be damaged, if it did not shield anything, it would be very vulnerable.", "The image above is a compilation of where the bullet holes of the aircraft returned from the war were. The obvious strategy at the time was to reinforce exactly where it gets the most shots. When he arrived at Wald\u2019s office for further analysis, he suggested just the opposite. Instead of strengthening the wings, would reinforce the engines and fuselage. But why would he do that if there is no hole in the planes ??", "Selection bias, or in this case survival bias. Wald said there are no holes in these places exactly because the planes that have been damaged in these regions. They just haven\u2019t returned to the statistics and the regions that get damaged and come back are the places that don\u2019t need that much reinforcement as they can get shot and still get back to base. Simple and great, they reinforced the right places and the statistics helped save thousands of lives.", "This series of examples is clearly not intended to be exhaustive on the subject, but it is an attempt to begin the provocation that training Machine Learning models without a good understanding of the data and some causal modeling techniques can produce bad results even. even in simple modeling,even if the metrics are good in the short run.", "In addition, this collection of examples are demonstrations that intuition about business data and understanding is as important (or more) than the application of Machine Learning techniques themselves.", "The text was a quick introduction, now, Comment on the excerpts that you had doubts to make more complete and detailed posts.", "In the next posts we will go back to these examples in more depth and explore some of these techniques to try to solve them (or at least mitigate them) by illustrating with examples and code in python.
