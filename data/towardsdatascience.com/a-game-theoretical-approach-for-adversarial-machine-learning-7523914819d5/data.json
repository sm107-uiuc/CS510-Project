They are increasingly used for different purposes, including high-stake ones.", "And yet, they are not infallible.", "In fact, most of these algorithms are trained on data that can be deliberately manipulated by an adversary looking to misguide it into making errors.", "Let\u2019s take a simple example: email spam detection. At first, standard classifiers such as na\u00efve Bayes were extremely efficient in terms of accuracy. However, spammers learned quickly how to fool them by changing \u201cspam\u201d worlds by their synonyms and adding more \u201cnon-spam\u201d worlds. Consequently, spam filters were changed to detect these tricks. But spammers responded by using new ones. Therefore, this leads to an endless game between the defender and the attacker until an equilibrium state is reached.", "In this context, Game Theory can be very useful as it provides the mathematical tools that are needed to model the behaviors of the defender and the adversary behaviors in terms of defense and attack strategies.", "More specifically, game theory-based models enable us to take into account:", "Thus, game theory-based models can determine what suitable strategy is needed to reduce the defender\u2019s loss from adversarial attacks.", "Spam filtering is not the only case for which these models can bring valuable information. This perspective can be used to describe many other situations with higher stakes: computer intrusion detection, fraud detection, aerial surveillance.", "In this article, I will share with you my key findings of how to use Game theory for Adversarial Machine learning.", "After reading this article, you will learn:", "Let\u2019s start with a simple example: spam detection.", "The following section describes the game-theoretical model developed for adversarial learning by W. Liu and S. Chawal in the paper.", "It can be modeled as a 2-player game between the Spammer (S) and the Defender (D).", "We will assume that the Spammer will be the one to make the first move.", "There are 4 possible outcomes as shown in the graph below. It is possible to associate each scenario with a payoff for both players to reflect the relative ranking in terms of the final outcome.", "For instance, the scenario 2 is the worst scenario for the Defender and the best for the Spammer as his attacks on the non-retrained classifier will lead to a high number of misclassified spam mails.", "The situation can be modeled as a Stackelberg game, i.e. a sequential game where there is a leader (the Spammer here ) and a follower (the Defender D).", "Stackelberg games are usually used to model strategic interactions between rational agents in markets on which there is some hierarchical competition.", "In this context, each player reacts to the other\u2019s move by choosing an action among a set of possible actions U and V for S and D respectively. These sets are assumed to be bounded and convex.", "Each outcome is associated with a payoff function Js, and Jd. Payoff functions Ji are twice-differentiable mapping Ji(U,V) \u2192 R where R is a reaction.", "Therefore, it is possible to anticipate the reaction Ri of a player i as the one that maximizes his payoff i.e. :", "Moreover, the first to make a move can anticipate how the follower would rationally react and take it into account in his first decision. This is known as the rollback or the backward induction.", "This means that the first action of the spammers is the solution of the following optimization problem:", "And therefore, the Defender will choose the optimal solution:", "This solution (u,v)is the Stackelberg equilibrium.", "Note that it is different from the Nash equilibrium where the two players of the game act simultaneously and the solution of the simultaneous equation is (0,0), i.e. no reaction from both players.", "Now that we have defined the general setting, we still need to determine the players\u2019 payoff function in the particular case of a classification problem.", "To simplify, we will first consider only one attribute. It can be then easily generalized to multiple attributes assuming they are conditionally independent given their class label.", "First, what is the impact of the players\u2019 moves?", "with \u03bc\u2019<\u03bc, as there are more non-spam emails than spam emails", "Second, what are the payoffs of the players?", "In order to evaluate the importance of a transformation u on the data, it is possible to use the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence KLD (also called relative entropy). It measures how a probability distribution is different from another reference probability distribution.", "Spammer\u2019s payoff: Since his goal is to increase the number of spam mails wrongly classified, his payoff can be expressed as follows:", "where FNR is the increase of the False Negative Rate. Thus, \u03b1 represents the strength of the cost penalty.", "Defender\u2019s payoff: Since his goal is to increase the accuracy of the classification, his payoff can be expressed as follows:", "Where TPR and TNR represent the increase of True Positive and True Negative rates. Thus, \u03b2 controls the strength of the cost of retraining the classifier.", "In this context, the equation below can be solved using a Genetic algorithm:", "The authors of the paper applied this methodology to find an equilibrium between synthetic and real data. Depending on the importance of the costs incurred to generate an attack and to retrain the classifier (modeled through \u03b1 and \u03b2), they find different equilibria.", "The previous example relies on a set of assumptions: it models a game where the attacker and the defender compete sequentially one against another. It assumed the attacker is the first to make a move. It also supposes that the two players are aware of the benefits and the costs of their respective adversaries.", "Nevertheless, these assumptions don\u2019t always hold. Fortunately, a wide range of models relying on a game-theoretic approach exists. They can be classified as follows.", "In a 2-player zero game, the gain of the attacker is equal to the costs of the loss of the defender and vice-versa. This means that the players\u2019 utilities sum to 0. This assumption can very pessimistic as the utility loss of the defender can be inferior to the utility of the adversary.", "In simultaneous move games, players choose simultaneously their strategy without observing each other\u2019s strategy. In sequential games, they choose their move one after another.", "Adversarial learning has mainly been modeled as a sequential game, the defender being the leader. In fact, it is often assumed that once the defender chooses a classifier the attacker can observe it and decide on his own strategy.", "The model described in the previous section is one of the few models that consider the attacker as unable to observe the classifier before choosing his strategy.", "Bayesian Game models a game in which players have incomplete information about other players. This is more likely as the defender might not know the exact cost of generating adversarial data and the attacker might not know the exact classification cost for the defender. They only have beliefs about these costs.", "John C. Harsanyi, the well-known economist who made a major contribution in Game Theory specifically in incomplete information contexts, describes a Bayesian game in the following way:", "Each player in the game is associated with a set of types, with each type in the set corresponding to a possible payoff function for that player. In addition to the actual players in the game, there is a special player called Nature. Nature randomly chooses a type for each player according to a probability distribution across the players\u2019 type spaces. This probability distribution is known by all players (the \u201ccommon prior assumption\u201d). This modeling approach transforms games of incomplete information into games of imperfect information.", "Adversarial learning techniques that rely on a game theory-based framework can be relevant as it models behaviors of the learner and the adversary based on the benefits and costs incurred for retraining the model and generating an attacker.", "But, what if the initial model was already robust to adversarial attacks?", "One of the most common approaches to increase this robustness is to model malicious data that can be generated by the adversary beforehand and include it in the training phase.", "In this section, we will consider 3 main techniques used for generating adversarial data: Perturbation techniques, Transferring adversarial examples, Generative adversarial networks (GAN).", "The idea is to produce synthetic adversarial data that can be used by potential adversaries. To do so, it is necessary to understand and anticipate how the adversary creates his attacks.", "Most of these techniques rely on adding a small amount of noise or perturbation to a valid example. Let\u2019s take a look at some well-known examples :", "It the goal of the attacker is to generate an example that is misclassified a l, he has to solve the following optimization problem:", "This can be done by performing a line-search to find the minimum c > 0 for which the minimizer r of the following problem satisfies f(x + r) = l :", "Note that this optimization problem does not have a closed-form solution for complex models such as deep neural networks. However, iterative numerical methods can be used which can make the generation slower. Nevertheless, its success rate is high.", "The method generates adversarial perturbations by increasing the value of the loss function, as follows:", "Note that adding a perturbation in the direction of the gradient enables the observation to be intentionally altered so that the model misclassifies it.", "This method is fast and computationally more feasible to implement than the previous one. However, its success rate is lower.", "Goodfellow et al. paper that describes this method have also lead to interesting observations such as:", "It is also possible to apply FGSM several times with a small step size and clip the total while making the distortion between the clean and the adversarial example is lower than \u03f5.", "Most of the techniques described above assume that the attacker knows the model used. They belong to what is called White-box attacks as opposed to Black-box attacks. However, in real-life situations this is not always the case.", "So, to what are the techniques to which the attacker usually resorts?", "The adversary can reconstruct the model by probing, i.e. sending valid and adversarial examples to the model and observing the output. This enables him to form a dataset that he can be used to train a substitute model. The generation of adversarial examples can be then achieved using White-Box algorithms.", "However, in some cases, probing can be limited by a maximal number of queries accepted or in terms of cost incurred by the adversary. To deal with this issue, the adversary can generate adversarial examples to fool a classifier and train, in parallel, another model. He can then reuse those same adversarial examples to fool multiple different classifiers.", "Note that using adversarial examples generated via a model to fool a Black-box model is possible and relies on the transferring property.", "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) entirely rely on a Game Theory approach. In these models, perturbed examples are generated from an adversary and simultaneously used to train the learner\u2019s model, as shown in the graph below.", "As shown in the figure above, the function used by the learner is called the discriminator while the function used by the adversary function is called the generator.", "The discriminator and the generator interact through a zero-sum game as they are both looking to optimize a different and opposing objective function, or loss function.", "In this context, the discriminator and the generator continuously adapt their prediction and data corruption mechanisms respectively.", "Nowadays, as individuals and businesses are embracing the digital revolution, Artificial Intelligence algorithms are increasingly used to solve complex problems in multiple contexts, some of which can have high stakes.", "Therefore, it is important not to underestimate their weaknesses when they can face adversarial attacks in hostile environments.", "The examples are as numerous as they are revealing: image recognition systems used for accessing private spaces or valuable information, fraud detection algorithms protecting individuals and companies\u2019 wealth, etc.", "In this context, Game Theory provides useful tools to model the behavior of the adversary and the learner as it includes, on the one hand, the benefit for the adversary to attack and the cost to generate the adversarial data and, on the other hand, the costs of the learner to update the model.", "Thus, game theory-based approaches cast light on the tradeoff adversaries and learners both made and can be used to assess the risks of implementing a specific technology.
