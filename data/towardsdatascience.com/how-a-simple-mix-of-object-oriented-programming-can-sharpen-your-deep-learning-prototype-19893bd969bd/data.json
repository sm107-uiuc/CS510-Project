That is the true test of the merit of what you produced. Not for yourself. But for others.", "In fact, data scientist Will Koehrsen just wrote a wonderful piece on this idea.", "To top it off, the hundreds of popular MOOC or online courses on data science and AI/ML also do not emphasize this aspect of coding, because it feels like a burden for a young, enthusiastic learner.

Consequently, this aspect remains neglected.", "You can avoid the initial pain of using OOP principles, but that, almost always, renders your Notebook code non-reusable and non-extensible.", "I am not a software engineer, never had been in my life.

Fashion MNIST consists of 60,000 training images of 28 x 28-pixel size \u2014 of objects related to fashion e.g. hat, shoe, trouser, t-shirt, dresses, etc. It also consists of 10,000 test images for model validation and testing.", "But what if there is a higher-order optimization or visual analytics question around this core ML task \u2014how the model architecture complexity impacts the minimum epochs it takes to reach the desired accuracy?", "It should be clear to the reader, why we even bother about such a question. Because this is related to the overall business optimization. Training a neural net is not a trivial computational matter. Therefore, it makes sense to investigate what minimum training effort must be spent to achieve a target performance metric and how the choice of architecture impacts that.", "In this example, we will not even use a convolutional net, as a simple densely connected neural net can accomplish reasonably high accuracy, and, in fact, a somewhat sub-optimal performance is required to illustrate the main point of the higher-order optimization question we posed above.", "So, we have to solve two problems -", "To achieve the goals, we will use two simple OOP principles,", "Here we show some code snippets to illustrate how simple OOP principles have been utilized to achieve our solution. The snippets are marked with comments for easy understanding.", "First, we inherit a Keras class and write our own subclass adding a method for checking training accuracy and taking an action based on that value.", "This simple callback results in dynamic control of the epochs \u2014 the training stops automatically when the accuracy reaches the desired threshold.", "We put the Keras model construction codes in a utility function so that a model of an arbitrary number of layers and architecture (as long as they are densely connected) can be generated using simple user input in the form of some function arguments.", "We can even put the compilation and training code into a utility function to use those hyperparameters in a higher-order optimization loop conveniently.", "Next, it\u2019s time for visualization. Again here, we go by the practice of functionalization. Generic plot functions take raw data as input. However, if we have a specific purpose of plotting the evolution of training set accuracy and showing how it compares to the target, then our plot function should just take the deep learning model as the input and generate the desired plot.", "A typical result looks like following,", "And, now we can take advantage of all the functions and classes, we defined earlier, and bring them all together to accomplish the higher-order task.", "Consequently, our final code will be super compact but it will generate the same interesting plots of loss and accuracy over epochs, that we show above, for a variety of accuracy threshold values and neural network architectures.", "This will give a user the ability to to use a minimal amount of code to produce visual analytics about the choice of performance metric (accuracy in this case), and neural network architecture. This is the first step towards building an optimized machine learning system.", "We generate a few cases for investigation,", "Our final analytics/optimization code is succinct and easy to follow for a high-level user, who does not need to know the complexity of Keras model building or callbacks classes.", "This is the core principle behind OOP \u2014 the abstraction of the layers of complexity, which we are able to accomplish for our deep learning task.", "Note, how we pass on the print_msg=False to the class instance. While we needed basic printing of status for initial check/debug, we should execute the analysis silently for the optimization task. If we did not have this argument in our class definition, then we would not have a way to stop printing debugging messages.", "We show some of the representative results which are automatically generated from executing the code block above. It clearly shows, how with a minimal amount of high-level code, we are able to generate visual analytics to judge the relative performance of various neural architectures for various levels of performance metrics. This gives a user, without tweaking the lower-level functions, easily make a judgment on the choice of a model as per his/her performance demand.", "Also, note the custom titles for each plot. These titles clearly enunciate the target performance and the complexity of the neural net, thereby making the analytics easy.", "It was a small addition to the plotting utility function but this shows the need for careful planning while creating such functions. If we had not planned for such an argument to the function, it would not have been possible to generate a custom title for each plot. This careful planning of API (application program interface) is part and parcel of good OOP.", "So far, you may be working with a Jupyter notebook, but you may want to turn this exercise into a neat Python module, which you can import from any time you want.", "Just like you write \u201cfrom matplotlib import pyplot\u201d, you can import these utility functions (Keras model build, train, and plotting) anywhere.", "We showed some simple good practices, borrowed from OOP, to apply to a DL analysis task. Almost all of them may seem trivial to seasoned software developers but this post is for budding data scientists who may not have that background but should understand the importance of imbuing these good practices in their machine learning workflow.", "At the risk of repeating myself one too many times, let me summarize the good practices, again here,", "Who knows, you may be able to release a utility package on the Python package repository (PyPi server) when you accumulate enough of useful classes and sub-modules.
