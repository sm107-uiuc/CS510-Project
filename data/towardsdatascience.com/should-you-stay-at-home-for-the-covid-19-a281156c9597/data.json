There is no one that hasn\u2019t heard about it. In this situation of social distancing and confinement, some people are just thinking of themselves and ignoring the government\u2019s recommendations or even restrictions. Probably you are not one of these people if you are reading this, but, should you warn the people you know that matches the previous description? Let me try to convince you.", "One of the most simple and well-known models of epidemiology is the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model, which is a set of differential equations describing the evolution of these three states in a population.", "(Don\u2019t be afraid with the following equations, they are just to introduce the model, you will understand the whole article with no need of deeply understanding these equations)", "In the differential equations written above, S is the stock of susceptible population, I is the stock of infected population and R is the stock of recovered population. Clearly, the dynamics of the system are related to the probability that a susceptible agent becomes infected and that an infected one gets recovered. Thus, in the differential equations, \u03b2 stands for the rate of infection and \u03b3 for the rate of recovery. Finally, V accounts for the volume where the individuals are spread. This is a more technical detail but it is easy to understand that the larger this volume is, the less contact among individuals there will be, so that less infections will take place leading to slower dynamics.", "Summarising, these are the parameters of the model", "Despite this model can be solved analytically, we can use a numerical approach to solve it based on the Gillespie algorithm. Let\u2019s do it!", "As we can see, with the parameters considered there is an outbreak for the disease and the peak of infections reaches nearly the 50 % of the population in about 30 days. In this model we are not taking into account the mortality of the disease, but what should be emphasised is that for sure the health system would collapse, as we see this huge amount of infected people in consecutive days. In order to avoid this situation, that for sure would be catastrophic, the governments take measures to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019, a so heard concept these days. Basically, the goal is to reduce the peak of the infected population so that the health system doesn\u2019t collapse. As we will see next, this decrease on the peak of the infected population is linked to a delay of the end of the epidemic. For these two reasons (decreasing the peak and delaying the end of the epidemic) this is known as \u2018flatten the curve\u2019.", "Now we can model the restriction measures applied by the government as an effective decrease on the infection rate, \u03b2, at a certain point in time. The following results are obtained when considering that restrictive measures are applied at t=25, 5 days before the epidemic reaches the peak obtained in the previous simulation, with an effective decrease of half the infection rate, \u03b2\u2019=\u03b2/2.", "The effect of the restriction measures, modelled in this way, is clear. By reducing the infection rate at half of its original value the peak of the infection reaches the 25% of the population, which corresponds to also the half of the value obtained without confinement measures.", "To adress this question, we can run different simulations and apply the confinement measures at different times. For instance, I have considered applying the measures at t=30, 25, 20 and 15 and that their effect is, as before, reducing the infection rate to half of its original value. Now we focus on the evolution of the infected population, so there is no need to plot the susceptible and recovered fraction of the population.", "As we can see in the figure presented above, the longer it takes to apply the confinement measures the less effective they will be. However, although the measures are taken quite late (orange line) the effect of the measures is remarkable, reducing the peak from a nearly 50% to around 35%. On the other hand, if the measures are taken early enough the peak of the epidemic can be drastically reduced and shifted in time. Nevertheless, it can also be observed that the measures, besides decreasing the peak of the infection, delay the end of the epidemic. This is an unavoidable situation, but we must keep in mind that our priority is to flatten the curve in order to not saturate the health system. However, this delay is like it is because the rate of recovery is kept constant, but by reducing the peak and not saturating the health system we could hope that this rate increased (new advances in the treatment of the disease, more experience of the sanitary staff, etc).", "As a more technical detail, it can be observed that if the measures are applied quite early, the epidemic will develop as a new epidemic with the new infection rate (purple line).", "We have considered that by applying these confinement measures the effective infection rate of the epidemic would decrease to half of its original value, which could be more or less realistic. The aim of this article is not to present a realistic model to predict the evolution of the model but illustrate the importance of the confinement measures.", "A step further in this illustration is to consider that, by taking the measures extremely seriously, very little people would go out of their home, so that the effective infection rate would tend to zero. Thus, we can study the influence of taking more seriously the measures applied by running a simulation with the effective infection rate after the measures set to \u03b2\u2019=0.", "The results show a fast drop of the infected population after the application of the measures. As before, it is observed that the earlier the measures are applied the smaller will be the peak of the infected population. Moreover, we can see that the end of the epidemic is advanced rather than delayed, which was the case of the previous situation. Nevertheless this extreme case of no new infections after the application of the measures can\u2019t be reached in real life, as it would require a complete and perfect confinement of all society.", "Apart from the information spreading through the media and social networks there are available data sets in the EU open data portal. By doing a proper treatment of this data the evolution of daily new cases and total cases can be estimated. Here I will show the evolution in Spain, fourth country in the world with more total infected cases.", "As we can see, the newly detected cases in Spain are increasing exponentially at a constant rate, concretely of 0.35. In fact, the logarithmic scale helps us to visualise this tendency as it is a straight line. This tendency is exactly what we want to avoid as, if it continued like this for some days, the health system would collapse.", "We can also take a look at the evolution of the total cases, which should end up saturating like a sigmoid curve.", "It is clear that we are already far from the saturation point. In this case, a proper exponential fit can not be performed due that, as it can be clearly seen in the logarithmic scale, there are zones with different growth rates. The good news about this is that the current growth rate is smaller than the initial one.", "First of all, recall that the aim of this article is not to present a realistic model of the COVID-19 epidemic or a tool to predict its evolution. The purpose of the article is to show one of the simplest models to study epidemics and, with it, illustrate the importance of the confinement measures that are taking place all around the world.", "Having said that, as a first conclusion we have seen that considering a proper epidemic (this means that with the given infection and recovery rates an outbreak exists) the fraction of infected population increases exponentially. Then, if no measure is taken, this exponential growth will continue until a large fraction of the population gets infected. In a practical situation this would collapse the health system leading to a high mortality event.", "Then, we have incorporated confinement measures in the model in order to study their effects and how they depend on two features: the time until the measures are applied and the strength of the measures (that can be understood as the restrictiveness of the measures or the amount of people that accept them). The results for the first case show that for an early application of the measures the infection peak obtained is remarkably reduced, although the end of the epidemic is delayed. In the second case, we see that stronger measures, besides decreasing the infection peak, advance the end of the epidemic.", "So, as a final conclusion, the best option is to apply the strongest possible measures the earliest possible.", "I would like to finish with a thought: the time of application of the measures concern the work of scientists and politicians, but the strength of the measures relies in part on the whole society. Maybe the confinement measures have been taken a little bit late, but it is in our hands to make them more effective.", "Your home for data science.
