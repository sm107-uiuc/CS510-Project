In the past, we mostly used encoders such as one-hot, term-frequency, or TF-IDF. However, the semantic and syntactic information of words were not captured in these techniques. The Word2Vec models allow us to encode words in more meaningful ways and much more! In this article, I want to describe the Word2Vec model and its beautiful applications. Plus, I explain why Word2Vec models are simple yet revolutionary.", "I decided to write this article, after receiving many positive feedbacks on my previous article titled How to Compute Sentence Similarity Using BERT and Word2Vec where I shared some insights to prevent common mistakes in computing sentence embedding.", "Vectors are a powerful mathematical tool to represent and organize data. One of the first steps in building an ML model is to vectorize the data, such as word vectorization. The Word2Vec model is a famous ML model used in natural language processing or NLP.", "When you represent data in vector formats, you can efficiently use linear algebra tools for various purposes such as model training or data augmentation. For example, it would be easy to compute the distance of a vector from hyperplanes when you represent data in a vector space. It also would be easy to compute the distance between two vectors using the well-accepted Cosine distance metric. Linear algebra is the mathematics of vector spaces.", "In short, Word2Vec refers to a word embedding methodology (i.e., a numerical representation of words in a new high-dimension space) published by Mikolov et al. in 2013. The word2vec is a methodology representing words by numerical vectors spanned in a high-dimensional space, while the semantic and syntactic relationships of words are maintained. These vectors are used as features in many natural language processing and machine learning applications.", "To compute these vectors, Mikolov et al used two main neural architectures in the Word2Vec library: [a] continuous bag-of-words and [b] continuous skip-gram. Read More: Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality.", "A novel representation of complex data such as textual data while preserving a \u201cspecific geometry of data\u201d such as semantic relatedness is a classic approach. For example, there were a lot of interests in manifold learning from 2000 to 2010. They were focused on introducing techniques such as Isometric Mapping or Locally Linear Embedding to represent images in lower dimension spaces while preserving a specific geometry of data. Their attempts were not that successful. However, their legacies were passed on to Word2Vec models.", "The Word2Vec model is used to extract the notion of relatedness across words or products such as semantic relatedness, synonym detection, concept categorization, selectional preferences, and analogy. A Word2Vec model learns meaningful relations and encodes the relatedness into vector similarity. The main applications of Word2Vec can be summarized in knowledge discovery and recommender systems.", "Word2Vec models can be trained over a large number of documents and find hidden relations among elements of those documents. In 2019, a paper published in Nature introduced a novel Word2Vec model to discover a new chemical compound with specific properties. They trained a Word2Vec model on over three million abstracts from scientific papers published in a hundred years, across a thousand journals. The model helped them to extract relations and analogies among chemical compounds.", "Word2vec models are not limited to textual data and they work for any data type that comes in a sequence such as users\u2019 click sessions, search history, and purchase history. You can use this data to build powerful recommender systems that can increase online business profits by enhancing the CTR and conversions. You can create a fixed-sized vector representation for different items such as places or products that capture human-like relations and similarities between them. Airbnb trained Word2Vec models on user click and conversive (the final session in a booking procedure) sessions and use them to create business values. Note that humans don\u2019t jump randomly from item to item, without having an objective in mind. Items, products or places, that a user checks during a visit are somehow related to each other and the Word2Vec model capture that relatedness. It is so cool, isn\u2019t it?", "A revolutionary solution does not need to be complex. Most of the time, a revolutionary solution is one with innovative problem formulation. If you can formulate a problem well, other downstream steps become superbly simple.
