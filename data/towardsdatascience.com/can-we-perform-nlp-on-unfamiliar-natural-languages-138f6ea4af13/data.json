I will try to explore the data and at the end try to generate some Bulgarian sentences by using a machine learning model incorporating BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long and Short-term Memory) layers.", "To make this experiment enjoyable for me, I will be using the lyrics written by Krisko, one of the most famous Bulgarian singers/rappers as text data. Here you can see Krisko\u2019s recent song, called \u201c\u0414\u0410 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u041d\u0415\u201d \u2014 means Yes or No.", "The codes for this post is available on my GitHub page.", "*All the lyrics were obtained from Lyrics Translate.", "Bulgarian is one of the South Slavic languages and mainly spoken in Bulgaria. Bulgarian is written in Cyrillic (in fact the only language written in Cyrillic in the EU official languages). Cyrillic was invented by Saints Cyril and Methodist at 893 in the First Bulgarian Empire.", "I personally like Bulgarian and listen to Bulgarian songs quite often although I don\u2019t really understand the meaning of them. Bulgarian music is quite interesting - of course the music is good but also there are heavy influences from neighbour countries like Turkey, Greece, Serbia, etc, especially the genre called \u2018Chalga\u2019, which is a folk-pop, you can enjoy a nice mixture of those different musics. Here you can listen one of Emilia\u2019s song called \u0410\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430 as an example.", "As I don\u2019t know how Bulgarian grammar work or even many basic words, I will try to explore the dataset (Krisko\u2019s lyrics) without doing any preprocessing.", "First, I will check what are the words used frequently in his songs.", "And we can create the word cloud from this for visualisation.", "This looks nice, right? Unfortunately, all of them look like a stop word like \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018and\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, etc\u2026 To understand the dataset, I need to remove those stop words. We will see how this process has done and will make a difference.", "I found the list of stop words in Bulgarian in spaCy, let\u2019s use this and remove those stop words from this exploration.", "After removing those words, we can create the top words list.", "Now, this list looks better than before. Seems like all of the words here have some meanings. The most frequent word is \u2018\u0434\u0430\u0439\u2019 (second-person singular imperative form of \u0434\u0430\u043c), which means \u2018to give, to allow\u2019. The second one is \u2018\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043c\u2019 (first-person singular imperative form), which means \u2018to want\u2019.", "An interesting point here is the ending of words changes depending on the subject. As I mentioned above, \u2018I want\u2019 is \u2018\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043c\u2019, \u2018you want\u2019 is \u2018\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0448\u2019, she/he/it wants\u2019 is \u2018\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u2019, etc\u2026, so we can actually see the difference between \u2018I want\u2019 and \u2018you want\u2019 without knowing the subject unlike in English.", "Here is the word cloud after cleaning the data. Looks much more informative than the previous one. So what I could see in this image is like \u2018\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043c\u2019, \u2018\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043c\u2019, \u2018\u0440\u044a\u044a\u043c\u2019, \u2018\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u2019,\u2026 So basically, Krisko sings something like he wants and loves rum (?) - which totally makes sense.", "After cleaning the data, we can see the relations among the words by using word2vec algorithm. Word2vec algorithm is a model that produces word embeddings (vectors) given input corpus. Taking advantage of this, we can see, for example, similar words, prediction of next words, words distance among them.", "Below you can find how I built my model.", "There are a few parameters in the word2vec; min_count is a minimum frequency of words in the input words - in my model, I set it as 1 so includes all the words. Size is a number of dimensions and window is Maximum distance between the current and predicted word within a sentence.", "Let\u2019s use this model to explore the dataset. First, we can see the similarity between the words. As an example I can take the words \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019 to see their similarity.", "Their similarity and -0.0267, which means those two words are not similar to each other as we expected. Now we can see similar words to man and woman to see if there are also some difference between them and also possibly the context of usage. Below you can see lists of similar words to man and woman. The list contains three columns, similar word, its translation, and similarity range between -1 and 1. As I don\u2019t know many Bulgarian words, I used google translate to create a translation column. As some of the translation looks a bit weird, I suspect some of the similar words might not be correct.", "Well, as I haven\u2019t done de-biasing the gender stereotype ([1] Bolukbasi et al., 2016), we could still see it. But at the same time, this blog post\u2019s main purpose is exploring the dataset and generate Krisko-ish sentences in Bulgarian so I think it\u2019s better not to do de-biasing to get more of Krisko taste.", "So in Krisko\u2019s lyrics, the word \u2018man\u2019 is often used in \u2018masculine\u2019 context like \u2018chief\u2019, \u2018household\u2019, and \u2018tiger\u2019 and the word \u2018woman\u2019 is similar to a little bit negative words like \u2018noisy\u2019, and \u2018ashamed\u2019.", "Now move on to the similarity between \u2018I want\u2019 and \u2018you want\u2019. As I mentioned above, we can see the different context in those two words in Bulgarian.", "As I expected, those two words are quite different despite the only difference is the subject of the verb. Now we can explore what kind of words are used around those two words. As the similarity of those two is quite low, I would expect the words around them also should be quite different.", "Opposing my guess, we didn\u2019t really observe a huge difference between them. To be fair the lists are only 10 words and probabilities are the same so if I extended the lists, we might see some clear differences.", "One thing I could feel is that the words for \u2018I want\u2019 is more masculine like \u2018I want chicks\u2019, \u2018I want to smoke\u2019 (grammatically incorrect tho) and \u2018I want to fuck\u2019. So I\u2019m guessing Krisko is often referring himself when he uses \u2018I\u2019. And also guessing \u2018you\u2019 often refers to a girl as I can see many girls in his music videos (can\u2019t really tell from the word list).", "Now, we can plot the word embeddings of his song titles to see their distances among themself in 2 dimensions. The titles I use here are limited to those titles contains only one word.", "There are three pieces of lyrics not sung by Krisko in this title list, namely \u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0430 (Antilope), \u0424\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0448\u043e\u043f (Photoshop) and \u041a\u044a\u0441\u0430\u0439 (Tear). Those lyrics are written by Krisko but sung by Tita. Surprisingly, those three songs are not really similar to each other, especially \u041a\u044a\u0441\u0430\u0439 is far away from all other songs. Also \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430 (Gorilla) is a song sung by 2BONA and Krisko but doesn\u2019t seem like to be very different from other songs. \u041c\u044a\u0440\u0434\u0430\u0439 (Wiggle) is towards the right-hand side, which makes sense as this song is sung by multiple singers (Krisko, Dim and \u0411\u043e\u0440\u043e \u041f\u044a\u0440\u0432\u0438).", "Now we will see if we can generate some sentences in Bulgarian by building a model from Krisko\u2019s lyrics data. The model will be including embedding and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) layers.", "LSTM is one of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) architectures. While normal RNNs only have long-term dependencies in the input sequences, LSTM has an input, forget and output gate and these gates enable to have stochastic short-term dependencies. BiLSTM unlike a normal LSTM (unidirectional), runs input data from both back and forward. Thus, it helps to understand the context of words not only from the past.", "To build a model, first, we need to prepare the input sequences.", "Here\u2019s how I built the model. This model below is the first one I built. This one is a single layer BiLSTM model. First, create the word embeddings then put them through the BiLSTM layer, in the end, use softmax to compute the probability of the output class.", "These are the results from the models. To understand the sentence, I used google translate (some translations seem very off tho).", "Single BiLSTM layer with 128 units - 500 epochs", "This model didn\u2019t learn much as we can see the predictions are all same for those seed text. Now increase the number of units.", "Single BiLSTM layer with 256 units \u2014 500 epochs", "We can see some improvements (at least the predictions are not the same for all the seed texts). But still not something we can say these are actual sentences. Continue to train until 1000 epochs.", "I feel the model is getting better. Some sentences kinda make sense. Now put one more BiLSTM layer and train 1000 epochs.", "It\u2019s hard to tell if these are better than previous predictions but this model also generated kinda understandable sentences.", "So the answer to this experiment would be: It is possible to generate sentences in an unfamiliar language, however, you won\u2019t probably understand the sentences the model generated obviously. And as unfamiliar with the language, it\u2019s difficult to use some techniques like n-gram.", "It was quite a fun experiment. This post went through", "Hope you find this post interesting.
