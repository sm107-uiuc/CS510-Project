Today, as COVID-19 is strongly showing, that prevention is better than cure. Most of them could realize this phrase very well with the current situation. Yes, People are trying to prevent themselves from others to stop spreading the virus. Indeed, Social distancing and wearing N-95 masks widely followed by people.", "People have their hypotheses and perception of every topic. Many people have common questions that represented as Frequently asked questions. In today\u2019s scenario, COVID-19 cases increases quickly. Everyone seeking to know about the exact truth of the COVID-19 virus. Also, most of them have common questions like below,", "In this article will discuss how to build automatic COVID-19 FAQ bot to retrieve answers for FAQ questions.", "Data collection is gathering relevant information from various available sources. I found below references when I searched about COVID-19 FAQ based questions from online.", "I\u2019ve chosen https://www.un.org website COVID-19 FAQ data for building our QA similarity system. It has 39 different FAQ based questions for COVID-19. It is always very important to know about what kind of format in which data is available. It\u2019s a PDF unstructured document. Let\u2019s download the file using programmatically, as shown in the below code snippet.", "Prepare the data in the desired format to solve the problem is the next task. As, we need to extract every question and respective answers from an unstructured document and store it structured file. The best and simple way you could extract information from a text file is by doing parsing. Parsing can help to retrieve specific information on the following assumptions.", "In the pipeline, it involves the below tasks.", "The COVID-19 FAQ data after prepared looks like below,", "We will not use the data as it is. Pre-processing is another very crucial step to fine-tune the data in NLP.", "We apply these techniques for FAQ questions and user query question.", "Why I chose lemmatization over stemming?", "Stemming and lemmatization are both is to reduce inflectional forms. Lemmatization minimizes text into proper vocabulary but, stemming reduces to the prefix or suffix from the word. Lemmatization converts all words having the same meaning but different representations to their base form.", "In this section will be discussing on multiple ways of representing FAQ questions.", "The first approach we will use for semantic similarity is leveraging Bag of Words (BOW). TF-IDF transforms the text into meaningful numbers. The technique is a widely used feature extraction in NLP applications. TF (Term Frequency) measures the no of times that words appear in a document. IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) measures low value for words that has high frequency across all the documents.", "COVID-19 FAQ TF-IDF questions representations as below picture,", "The code snippets for generating TF-IDF representation as below code snippet,", "GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. It trained on the global word-word co-occurrence matrix. I downloaded a pre-trained word vector from Glove for our analysis. The code snippets for generating word embedding representation as below code snippet,", "Let us see how embeddings are close to each other for semantic information.", "BERT is a transformer-based model attempts to use the context of words to get embedding. BERT broke several records in NLP tasks. The following search query is an excellent way to understand BERT. \u201c2019 Brazil traveler to the USA need a visa\u201d. We observe that the relationship of the word \u201cto\u201d to other words in the sentence are important to decode the meaning semantically. Returning information about USA citizens traveling to Brazil is not relevant since we are talking about Brazil citizens traveling to the USA. BERT can handle this well.", "We represented COVID-19 FAQ questions to multiple representations. Let\u2019s evaluate each representation for the user new query. How are we finding similarities of FAQ questions with new user queries?. One of the best techniques to find a similarity score is cosine similarity. We will use cosine similarity for comparing each representation now. How to calculate cosine similarity as shown in the below code snippet,", "We will evaluate the FAQ question similarity based on the following query questions.", "We achieved the best results through embedding and BERT embedding representation. Drawbacks of TF-IDF cannot semantically represent the question. The entire code can be available in GitHub. You can reach me at LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
