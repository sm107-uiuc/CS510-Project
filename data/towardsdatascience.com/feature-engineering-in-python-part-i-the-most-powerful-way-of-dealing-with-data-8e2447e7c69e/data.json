It\u2019s a world where having tons of data, understanding it and knowing what to do with data is power. Understanding your data is not one of the most difficult things in data science, but it is time-consuming. Interpretation of data is effective when we know about the source of data.", "\u201cIn God we trust. All others must bring data.\u201d \u2014 W. DemingFirst, we need to understand our data. There are 3 types of data:", "Machine learning fits mathematical notations to the data in order to derive some insights. The models take features as input. A feature is generally a numeric representation of an aspect of real-world phenomena or data. Just the way there are dead ends in a maze, the path of data is filled with noise and missing pieces. Our job as a Data Scientist is to find a clear path to the end goal of insights.", "Mathematical formulas work on numerical quantities, and raw data isn't exactly numerical. Feature Engineering is the way of extracting features from data and transforming them into formats that are suitable for Machine Learning algorithms.", "It is divided into 3 broad categories:-", "Feature Selection: All features aren't equal. It is all about selecting a small subset of features from a large pool of features. We select those attributes which best explain the relationship of an independent variable with the target variable. There are certain features which are more important than other features to the accuracy of the model. It is different from dimensionality reduction because the dimensionality reduction method does so by combining existing attributes, whereas the feature selection method includes or excludes those features.The methods of Feature Selection are Chi-squared test, correlation coefficient scores, LASSO, Ridge regression etc.", "Feature Transformation: It means transforming our original feature to the functions of original features. Scaling, discretization, binning and filling missing data values are the most common forms of data transformation. To reduce right skewness of the data, we use log.", "Feature Extraction: When the data to be processed through an algorithm is too large, it\u2019s generally considered redundant. Analysis with a large number of variables uses a lot of computation power and memory, therefore we should reduce the dimensionality of these types of variables. It is a term for constructing combinations of the variables. For tabular data, we use PCA to reduce features. For image, we can use line or edge detection.", "We start with this data-set from MachineHack. We will first import all the packages necessary for Feature Engineering.", "We will load the data using pandas and also set the display to the maximum so that all columns with details are shown:", "Before we start pre-processing the data, we would like to store the target variable or label separately. We will combine our training and testing data-sets, after removing the label from the training dataset. The reason why we are combining train and test data-sets is that Machine Learning models aren\u2019t great at extrapolation, ie, ML models aren\u2019t good at inferring something that has not been explicitly stated from existing information. So, if the data in the test set hasn\u2019t been well represented, like in training set, the predictions won\u2019t be reliable.", "This is the output we get after data.columns", "To check the first five rows of the data, type data.head() .", "To see the broader picture we use data.info() method.", "To understand the distribution of our data, use data.describe(include=all)", "We would like to analyse the data and remove all the duplicate values.", "We\u2019d want to check for any null values in our data, therefore, data.isnull.sum() .", "Therefore, we use the following code to remove the null value.", "Let\u2019s check the Airline column. We notice that it contains categorical values. After using data['Airline'].unique() , we notice that the values of the airline are repeated in a way.", "We first want to visualize the column:", "This visualization helps us understand that there are certain airlines which have been divided into two parts. For example, Jet Airways had another part called Jet Airways Business. We would like to combine these two categories.", "This is how our values in the column will look now.", "The same goes with Destination. We find that Delhi and New Delhi have been made two different categories. Therefore, we\u2019ll combine them into one.", "We check this column, data['Date_of_Journey'] and find that the column is in this format:-", "This is just raw data. Our model cannot understand it, as it fails to give numerical value. To extract useful features from this column, we would like to convert it into weekdays and months.", "And then to get weekdays from it", "And from Date_of_Journey, we will also get the month.", "The time of departure is in 24 hours format(22:20), we would like to bin it to get insights.", "We will create fixed-width bins, each bin contains a specific numeric range. Generally, these ranges are manually set, with a fixed size. Here, I have decided to group hours into 4 bins. [0\u20135], [6\u201311], [12\u201317] and [18\u201323] are the 4 bins. We cannot have large gaps in the counts because it may create empty bins with no data. This problem is solved by positioning the bins based on the distribution of the data.", "We fill the null values with \u201cnight\u201d in the \u2018Departure_S\u2019 column.", "Our duration column had time written in this format 2h 50m . To help machine learning algorithm derive useful insights, we will convert this text into numeric.", "The result we will now get is continuous in nature.", "After visualizing data, it makes sense to delete rows which duration less than 60 mins.", "We will drop the columns which had noise or had texts, which would not help our model. We have transformed these into newer columns to get better insights.", "We have engineered almost all the features. We have dealt with missing values, binned numerical data, and now it\u2019s time to transform all variables into numeric ones. We will use, get_dummies() to the transformation.", "We will have to divide the dataset back. Feature engineering helps extract information from raw data, i.e., it has created a lot of features. This means we need to find the main features of the whole lot. This is also known as the Curse of Dimensionality.
