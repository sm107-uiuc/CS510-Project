I touched upon how data normalization impacts clustering, and unsupervised algorithms generally.", "But I felt that I missed the opportunity to go into more details. But of course, that wasn\u2019t the focus of that article, so today I want to pick up on that.", "Let\u2019s first define what exactly is normalization.", "Let\u2019s say we have a dataset containing two variables: time traveled and distance covered. Time is measured in hours (e.g. 5, 10, 25 hours ) and distance in miles (e.g. 500, 800, 1200 miles). Do you see the problem?", "One obvious problem of course is that these two variables are measured in two different units \u2014 one in hours and the other in miles. The other problem \u2014 which is not obvious but if you take a closer look you'll find it \u2014 is the distribution of data, which is quite different in these two variables (both within and between variables).", "The purpose of normalization is to transform data in a way that they are either dimensionless and/or have similar distributions. This process of normalization is known by other names such as standardization, feature scaling etc. Normalization is an essential step in data pre-processing in any machine learning application and model fitting.", "Now the question is how (on earth) exactly does this transformation help?", "The short answer is \u2014 it dramatically improves model accuracy.", "Normalization gives equal weights/importance to each variable so that no single variable steers model performance in one direction just because they are bigger numbers.", "As an example, clustering algorithms use distance measures to determine if an observation should belong to a certain cluster. \u201cEuclidean distance\u201d is often used to measure those distances. If a variable has significantly higher values, it can dominate distance measures, suppressing other variables with small values.", "Several methods are applied for normalization, three popular and widely used techniques are as follows:", "Here, z is the standard score, \u00b5 is the population mean and \u03ed is the population standard deviation.", "Let\u2019s do an experiment, it\u2019s always good to see an algorithm in action. The example is not going to be dramatic, I\u2019m just showing it as an illustration to give an intuition.", "Let\u2019s import some libraries \u2014 pandas for data wrangling, matplotlib for visualization and preprocessing and KMeans from the sklearn library.", "Let\u2019s also import data from a GitHub repo as a csv file. That\u2019s the Iris dataset, already cleaned, so you can import and follow along right away.", "I\u2019m going to use two features \u2014 petal_length and sepal_length \u2014 for clustering of data points.", "After importing libraries and data, first we\u2019ll implement the KMeans clustering algorithm without normalization. I\u2019ve annotated each line of code so you know what\u2019s going on.", "The outputs are the count of data points in each cluster and the visualization of those clusters.", "Now let\u2019s re-run the model, this time after normalizing the inputs using preprocessing from the sklearn library.", "In the following are the outputs before and after the normalization of data. First, if you compare the value counts there are some changes \u2014 for example, counts cluster 0 is reduced by 4 members.", "If you closely examine the data points in the left and the right figures you might be able to see which data points shifted from pre-normalized to post-normalized model. These changes are often at the boundaries rather than at either end of the spectrum in the distribution. Again, as I said, it\u2019s not too dramatic, but you get the point.", "So far we\u2019ve got the impression that normalization is absolutely a great thing to happen in data science! Not really, it does some good things but creates some bad side effects along the way.", "Normalization compresses data within a certain range, reduces the variance and applies equal weights to all features. You lose a lot of important information in the process.", "One example is what happens to outliers \u2014 normalization lease absolutely no traces of outliers. We perceive outliers as bad guys and we need to get rid of them ASAP. But remember, outliers are real data points, once you lose that just to get a better model, you lose information.", "In the process of normalization, the variables lose their units of measurements too. So at the end of modeling, you can\u2019t really tell what are the key differences between the variables.", "I hope this was a useful article. If you have comments feel free to write them down below.
