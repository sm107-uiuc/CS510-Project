AI and automation will be present at our workplace doing tasks we thought only human intelligence was capable of.", "This can sound like an argument to prioritize human sciences and emotional intelligence for the future of work. However, I think we still have many other building blocks to mold until we get there. It would be wise if we did not assume that functional knowledge and technical skill will simply be pushed into machines that will magically make things work automatically.", "My view is: all professions (office workers, factory operators, sales clerks, teachers, CEOs\u2026) need some level of digital literacy to learn how we can build this new reality in a way that we, as a society, don\u2019t experience the daunting disruptive change we fear.", "Our ability to test ideas and tell stories is much more effective when we do it with data. For some professionals, digital literacy in the future might come in the form of learning some programming skill to work with and make sense of complex and messy data sets.", "In this post, I want to explore a snippet of this population using the 2019 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey. For those who are unfamiliar, Stack Overflow is the largest online community for developers to learn and share their programming knowledge.", "What is the non-professional developers\u2019 profile, job satisfaction and compensation?

The median age at the first coding experience is 15 years old. However, the respondents have been coding for 8 years (median), so there is a gap.", "What is their highest educational level and field of study?", "64.18% of the population has at least a Bachelor\u2019s degree.", "The most common field of study is computer science/engineering (35.40%), followed by another engineering discipline (15.99%).", "This population snippet is predominantly male (86%). Women represent 8% and other classifications, 6% of this population.", "Here are the questions we will be looking into:", "In order to give these qualitative answers a score, I did the following classification for \u201cjob satisfaction\u201d and added the results:", "Both the overall population and the non-professional developers have the same median score (3.00), however the average for the non-professional developers was lower (2.50 compared to 2.85).", "In order to do a salary analysis, I selected the top ten countries with highest response frequency with compensation information:", "There are some details we have to take into account when preparing salary information for visualization, for more details please check out my code here.", "Let\u2019s compare the compensation from respondents who are professional developers and from those who are not. For better visualization, the compensation was normalized into multiples of the country\u2019s minimum wage and it was log-transformed.", "The database contains a significant number of outliers, represented by the dots plotted above the maximum and below the minimum (probably dummy entries). We can perceive some differences on salary distribution comparing the countries:", "It seems that comparing the two groups (professional developers and non-professional developers) the distributions are similar. Let\u2019s take a look at the absolute information of the median.", "It seems that this small non-professional developer community is comprised of a majority of people who had some exposure to coding during their formal education. Also, they code as part of their work.", "As for job and career satisfaction, comparing this population to the overall respondents, there isn\u2019t any significant discrepancy we could notice.", "The same goes for the compensation distribution of non-professional developers and professional developers. We could observe some different behaviors between the countries, but, overall, not significant discrepancies between the professional and the non-professional developers.", "These were only observational findings. I am very interested to see how this population will evolve through the years.", "Will you join the digital transformation?", "To see more about this analysis, see the link to my Github.", "Your home for data science.
