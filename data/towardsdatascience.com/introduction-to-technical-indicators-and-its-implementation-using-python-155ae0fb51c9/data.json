And these signals are in turn used to predict the future price movements. Technical analysts look for indicators in the historical data and use them to look for entry and exit points to conduct their trades. Technical analysts differ from fundamental analysts who evaluate a stock\u2019s performance by looking at the fundamentals and the intrinsic value.", "Technical indicators broadly follow under two major categories:", "1. Overlays: They use the same scale as the prices and are plotted over the top of the prices on a stock chart. Examples: Moving averages, Bollinger Bands", "2. Oscillators: These technical indicators oscillate between local maxima and local minima and are plotted above or below the price chart. Examples: MACD", "Some basic examples of technical indicators which we will cover are:", "4. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)", "Moving averages is one of the widely used technical analysis indicators. It is a concept that would have been heard of, if not with respect to stocks, in some or the other form of daily life. Moving average smoothens the curve by filtering the various noises in it. As moving averages are based on historical prices than the actual prices, one might observe a lag in the curve emerging out of it vs the real equity prices curve. The commonly used moving averages are 5, 10, 20, 50, 200 day moving averages.", "Amongst the moving averages, the further categorisation is in into Simple Moving Average (SMA), Weighted Moving Average (WMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA).", "Simple moving average (SMA) is the very basic averages or the arithmetic mean of all the stock prices which implies sum of all the stock prices divided by the number of periods.", "In a weighted moving average (WMA), varying weights are assigned to each price points. And after multiplying the various weights with the respective stock prices, the sum of these are divided by the overall number of periods. In case of a simple moving average, equal weights are assigned to the stock prices.", "Exponential moving average (EMA) is a 3 step process. For it we calculate the first EMA using the simple moving average. Secondly, we calculate the smoothing factor of the multiplier. And thirdly we apply this multiplier on the EMA of the previous day. In this process, we are assigning higher weightages to the latest prices.", "Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is an oscillating technical indicator. It displays a momentum followed by the stocks by spotting the relationships between two moving averages of a stock\u2019s price. It is generally calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A lot of traders use that for an entry signal and interpret in ways to give them insights into their trading decisions.", "MACD Line: A 9 day EMA of the MACD is called the signal line, which is obtained by running the EMA on the MACD line. And now this line is plotted on top of the MACD line which is helpful in analysing the crossovers, divergences, and steep slopes. Through this line, the analyst is able to decipher the buy and sell signals. If the MACD crosses above its signal line, traders may end up buying the stock and sell it if it crosses below the signal line.", "The Bollinger bands concept was originally developed by John Bollinger. These bands comprise of an upper and lower band and are placed within two standard deviations above and below the moving averages.", "The way to analyse this is by first assuming them as upper and lower bands as the price targets. If the stock price falls below the lower price band, it probably indicates buy trigger and vice versa.", "I have tried to build these technical indicators using python. I have obtained the closing price for \u2018NETFLIX\u2019 stock prices using the IEX API and have directly loaded them into the dataframe for further analysis. Please see below the code:", "This above is pretty much intuitive in showing us the trends of the price movements and the crossovers happening.", "When the long term (50 day) EMA crosses the short term (10 day) EMA, we can infer that the prices have officially started to fall off for some term and this therefore should act as the sell signal. And similarly, its a buy signal when the short term moving average crosses that of the long term.", "There are more concepts here called the squeeze and the breakouts. The squeeze happens when the bands come closer. Traders view this to be a time of lower volatility and is expected with a future increase in volatility. And this again is perceived as possibility of future trading opportunities. And breakouts indicate the points where the stock prices cross the Bollinger bands.", "Bollinger bands help us to identify the buy and see signals and this can be seen from the above graph too. Wherever the stock prices are breaching the bands, there a signal can be inferred from. If the stock price goes below the lower band, there exists an opportunity for that buying that stock and similarly where the stock prices cross through the upper band, now is the time to sell", "From the second graph one can observe a number of cross overs happening. When the MACD line crosses the Signal line, we can assume the stock prices for the particular ticker going bullish and vice versa when the Signal line crosses the MACD line", "In this article i have mentioned a few technical indicators that a beginner can start looking at and slowly venture into the various complexities and a number of other indicators.
