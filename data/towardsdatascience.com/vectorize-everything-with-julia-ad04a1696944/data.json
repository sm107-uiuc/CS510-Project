Do you feel trapped by all those loops? Well, fear not! There\u2019s a way out! I\u2019ll show you how to do the FizzBuzz challenge without any for loops at all.", "The task of FizzBuzz is to print every number up to 100, but replace numbers divisible by 3 with \u201cFizz\u201d, numbers divisible by 5 by \u201cBuzz\u201d and numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 have to be replaced by \u201cFizzBuzz\u201d.", "Solving FizzBuzz with for loops is easy, you can even do this in BigQuery. Here, I\u2019ll show you an alternative way of doing this \u2014 without any for loops whatsoever. The solution is Vectorised Functions.", "If you already had some experience with R and Python, you\u2019ve probably already come across vectorised functions in standard R or via Python\u2019s numpy library. Let\u2019s see how we can use them in Julia similarly.", "Vectorised functions are great as they reduce the clutter often associated with for loops.", "Before we dive into solving FizzBuzz let\u2019s see how you can replace a very simple for loop with a vectorized alternative in Julia.", "Let\u2019s start with a trivial task: Given a vector a add 1 to each element of it.", "The above gets the job done, but it takes up 3 lines and a lot more characters than needed. If a was a numpy array in Python \ud83d\udc0d, you could just do a + 1 and job done. But first, you would have to convert your plain old array to a numpy array.", "Julia has a clever solution. You can use the broadcast operator . to apply an operation \u2014 in this case, addition \u2014 to all elements of an object. Here it is in action:", "Even better than that, you can broadcast any function of your liking, even your own ones. Here we calculate the area of a circle and then we broadcast it across our array:", "Now that we know the basics, let\u2019s do FizzBuzz! But remember, no for loops allowed.", "We will rephrase our problem a little bit. Instead of printing the numbers, Fizzes and Buzzes, we\u2019ll return all of them together as a vector. I\u2019ll break down the solution the same way as in the for loop article [LINK], so if you haven\u2019t seen the previous posts, now would be a good time to check it out!", "First, let\u2019s return the numbers up until nas a vector:", "This works. Let\u2019s see if we can print Fizz for each number that\u2019s divisible by 3. We can do this by replacing all numbers that are divisible by 3 with a Fizz string.", "Let\u2019s break this down step by step:", "Feel free to break these steps down and try them in your own Julia REPL!", "I know that the use of .= to assign a single element to many can be a bit controversial, but I actually quite like it. By explicitly specifying the broadcast of assignment you force yourself to think about the differences of these objects and everyone who reads your code afterwards will see that one is a vector and the other one is a scalar.", "Adding the Buzzes is done exactly the same way:", "No comment on this one. \ud83d\ude03", "All we\u2019re missing are the FizzBuzz elements for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.", "We used .*to \u201cmultiply\u201d two boolean arrays. You can think of * as a boolean andin this case. So this gives us a true value where the numbers are divisible by both 3 and 5.", "Let\u2019s see if this all works:", "The above certainly does what we want, but it\u2019s not exactly the prettiest. Time to tidy up and make our code nice and presentable.", "This achieves exactly the same as above, but it\u2019s a lot easier to read. We find the indexes that we want to replace and then we replace our array elements where needed. We also used % instead of the rem function, because if there\u2019s an operator for your function, then you should use it!", "After reading this article, you now know how to broadcast any function in Julia using . and make your code more readable by removing some of the unnecessary for loops.", "For full access to all Medium articles \u2014 including mine \u2014 consider subscribing here.", "Your home for data science.
