It is intellectually fashionable to disregard blockchains as over-hyped spreadsheets, notable only for the iffy achievement of propping up Bitcoin (alias \u201crat poison squared\u201d). The \u201cleast useful invention in human history\u201d, ventures one critic.", "For the hopeful technologist like myself, these claims were all the more depressing for having the ring of truth. For all the promise of smart contracts and blockchain platforms raising billions of dollars for R&D, there were vanishingly few real-life applications for any blockchain. Bitcoin has surged in value, but lacks ongoing technological development, mass adoption or any real advantage over existing currencies like the USD.", "However, the past year (and in particular, the past three months) has seen \u2014 finally \u2014 a surge in useful blockchain applications that could actually represent killer apps for the technology. A critical mass of developers has coalesced around one platform in particular, Ethereum\u2014 and the resulting explosion of new applications is seeing some of the hopes for the blockchain come to fruition.", "One team, Sablier, has built a protocol that lets someone stream money in real-time as easily as they would stream a playlist on Spotify. Instead of being paid a salary every four weeks, imagine being paid on a continuous basis \u2014 every hour, or even every second. The Sablier app displays an ongoing transaction in a transparent interface so you can see exactly how much is being paid, and how quickly. By bypassing the banking system altogether, the transaction fees are close to non-existent.", "Real-time salary payments are a tantalising possibility \u2014 monthly salary payments are horribly inefficient, and leave a huge number of workers living paycheque to paycheque, sometimes unable to meet daily expenses. Streaming payments represent a solution and a potentially life-changing service for low-wage workers in particular. Our current way of paying salaries and wages might be relegated to the historical dustheap \u2014 who would seriously prefer to receive a lump sum every month instead of a salary every day?", "With a protocol as radically versatile as streaming money, the potential applications stretch far beyond salaries. Inheritance is traditionally seen as a large lump sum payment paid out after death \u2014 but imagine instead a system where a departed family member streamed their inheritance to their family over a long period of time, avoiding taxes and the impulse to spend a large lump sum. Streaming money in real-time could also totally disrupt services billed by hour: legal fees, vehicle rentals, car parking and more \u2014 pay for the service as long as you are using it, and not a second more.", "The spend on lotteries in the United States alone is 71 billion, a ridiculous number made all the more insane by the tiny odds of any participant in particular actually winning. When you stop to think about it, it\u2019s a confusing act of financial self-harm only really justified by the fun and thrill of being in to win \u2014 we humans are highly susceptible to game-based feedback loops.", "Enter PoolTogether, a new app fashioning itself as a \u201cno-loss savings game\u201d. In essence, it is a digital lottery where you \u2018buy\u2019 tickets with a deposit of money \u2014 giving you a shot at the jackpot each week \u2014 but you never lose your deposit. You can withdraw it anytime. What seems like dark magic is enabled by the blockchain \u2014 the protocol \u2018pools\u2019 all the deposits together in an interest-earning smart contract and the interest generated is awarded as a jackpot to a ticket-holder each week.", "Make no mistake, while these are early days for PoolTogether, with relatively few users and proportionately small jackpots, the concept is on the money (so to speak). The world\u2019s biggest money-losing game (lotteries) could be replaced by a system that incentivises people to save, while preserving the game-like properties that make lotteries so addictive.", "If you follow American politics (for your sins), or even if you don\u2019t, you may have heard that voting in the Democratic presidential primary has been a train wreck\u2014 the Iowa caucuses are still confirming exact totals, despite voting occurring three weeks ago. There are a long list of problems with the process of voting generally, from long queues and wait-times to broken machines and the partisan placement of voting locations. The solution kicked around for a decade \u2014 online voting \u2014 has long been thought of as too insecure, prone to hacking or manipulation.", "With the security and efficiency advantages of a blockchain system, there might be hope yet for a secure online voting system. One team, Vocdoni, is building an online voting protocol with \u201cuniversally verifiable\u201d voting \u2014 using some complex cryptography to build a system where voters can cast their vote using a blockchain protocol, which constantly checks the integrity of each vote to guarantee its integrity (and block attempts to corrupt the system). Vocdoni have also built the protocol with smartphone access in mind, with an eye to making democracy radically easy and much more accessible.", "If the emotional investment of cheering on a particular sports team or player was not enough of a stake, smart contracts are now letting fans invest with their own money. Spencer Dinwiddie from the Brooklyn Nets has \u2018tokenised\u2019 his $34m three-year contract on Ethereum\u2014which essentially means fans can buy a small stake in his contract, turning it into a tradable financial asset. If you think Dinwiddie will have a huge season, you don\u2019t need to just add him to your fantasy team \u2014 you can literally invest in his performance, and reap the gain if he hits the performance-based bonuses in his contract.", "While these are early days for the brand-new market of sports star investing (and there are certainly more hurdles to come \u2014 the NBA did not look too kindly at Dinwiddie\u2019s innovation), this is a pretty exciting step towards a much more liquid financial system. Blockchain and smart contracts allow new kinds of investment and novel financial instruments, and it is exciting to see the sandbox of smart contracts produce a genuine game-changer for the sports sector.", "Not too shabby for the least useful invention in human history. If you are interested in pieces like this about this burgeoning new platform, you might like my new publication, Technocracy. I\u2019ll be regularly writing about technology is changing society, like my most recent piece about how the Coronavirus is making mass surveillance our new normal.", "Your home for data science.
