Just like bar graphs, lollipop plots are used to make comparisons between different items or categories. They are also used for ranking or for showing trends over time. We compare only one numerical variable per item or category. They are not suitable for relationships, distribution, or composition analysis.", "LCs are preferred to bar charts when you have to display a large number of similar high values. In that case with a standard bar plot, you may get a cluttered chart and experience an optical effect called a Moir\u00e9 pattern (#1). Fig. 1 shows a bar chart on the left and a lollipop chart on the right side. Both are based on the same data but it is evident that the minimalist alternative of the lollipop results in a more attractive and clear visualization.", "The Moir\u00e9 effect is a visual perception that occurs when viewing a set of lines or bars that is superimposed on another set of lines or bars, where the sets differ in relative size, angle, or spacing. Moir\u00e9 patterns are those dark bands you see when looking through layered fences or when taking a picture of a TV or a computer screen. Even though the Moir\u00e9 effect can produce interesting and beautiful geometric patterns, they should be avoided in data visualization tasks so as not to confuse the audience.", "HOW: lollipop charts are two-dimensional with two axes: one axis shows categories or a time series, the other axis shows numerical values. Those numerical values are indicated by the position of the dot at the end of the line. A vertically oriented LC displays the categorical variable on the y-axis whilst a horizontally oriented LC displays it on the x-axis. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of a horizontal LC where the dots at the end of the thin lines indicate the numerical value for each category. With Matplotlib, you must use the stem function to draw a horizontal lollipop. The stem function plots vertical lines from a baseline to the y-coordinate and places a marker at the top (#2).", "LCs are a nice alternative for rankings. The standard procedure is to arrange the categories in decreasing order and represent them vertically. With Matplotlib, you must use in combination the functions hlines and plot to draw a vertical lollipop. hlines draw horizontal lines at each y from the scalars xmin to xmax (#3). There are several possible markers for the function plot but we suggest using the classic circle symbol, as shown in the figures of this article.", "You must always start the numerical axis at 0: if the lines are truncated, the actual value is not properly reflected. Remember that our sight is very sensitive to differences in length when trying to compare data. We inevitably distort the visual if we modify the baseline. If one of the variables is time (years, months, days, hours), always set it on the horizontal axis. Time always runs from left to right and never from top to bottom.", "LCs are equivalent to bar charts, but this equivalence is only valid for standard bar charts; do not try to extend it to Stacked, Clustered, or Overlapping Bar Graphs (#4, #5).", "LCs were the subject of an interesting debate, both on a theoretical and conceptual level, between two data visualization heavyweights: Stephen Few and Albert Cairo (#6). Few through the sarcastic title \u201cLollipop Charts: \u201cWho Loves You, Baby?\u201d claimed that \u201cLCs were inspired by the same thing that has inspired so many silly graphs: a desire for cuteness and novelty\u201d. He added that the main problem with LCs was that: \u201cThe center of the circle at the end of the lollipop marks the value, but the location of the center is difficult to judge, making it imprecise compared to the straight edge of a bar, and half of the circle extends beyond the value that it represents, making it inaccurate\u201d.", "For his part, Cairo came out in defense of the charts indicating that: \u201cI believe that lollipops have their uses. Bar graphs with more than, say, 8 or 9 bars, often look busy and clunky. Lollipop graphs may solve that problem by increasing the amount of white space in between bars significantly.\u201d He proposed as a solution to reduce the size of the circles or even mark the numerical value with the upper point of the circle instead.", "Eli Holder in a very interesting article published in Nightingale (#7) with the title: \u201cSettling the Debate: Bars vs. Lollipops (vs. Dot Plots)\u201d described an experiment to shed some light about: \u201cHow do lollipop charts affect readers\u2019 comprehension? How much of our epistemic responsibility are we sacrificing for a playful aesthetic?\u201d Finally, he concluded that the results of the experiments show no significant differences between Bar and Lollipop graphs and they led to roughly equal accuracy and equal response times. In the end, LCs provide a nice minimalistic visualization of the data and they should be used exactly in the same situation than a bar graph.", "1.- Fuel Consumption with the mtcars dataset: Human activities have increased carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHC), driving up temperatures. Most man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. GHG emissions from transportation account for about 28 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest contributor of the USA (#8). The United States Environmental Protection Agency had developed a national program for GHG and fuel economy standards for light-duty vehicles (passenger cars and trucks).", "Previous studies on fuel consumption were based on Motor Trend Car Road Tests through the mtcars dataset. Data were extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973\u201374 models). The following LC indicates miles traveled per gallon consumed for 32 car brands. Blue dash-dotted lines on the top correspond to those vehicles whose consumption was lower than the average (20.09 mpg) while the red dash-dotted lines correspond to those vehicles whose consumption was higher than the average. Clearly, a lollipop chart is better than a bar graph for comparing such a large number of different categories.", "2.- Argentina\u00b4s Government Budget: A Government Budget is an itemized accounting of the payments received by government (taxes and other fees) and the payments made by government (purchases and transfer payments). A budget deficit occurs when a government spends more money than it takes in. The opposite of a budget deficit is a budget surplus.", "Argentina grapples with one of the world\u2019s highest inflation rates due to its recurrent government budget deficit. The next figure shows the country\u00b4s monthly budget deficit for the 2012\u20132018 period. Now, a lollipop chart allows us to follow the budget pattern over an extended period of time in an aesthetically pleasing way. As stated above, time runs from left to right on the horizontal axis.", "IN SUMMARY: used exactly in the same situation than a standard bar chart, lollipop charts encode numerical values in the same way: the length of the lines and the location of the dots at the end of the lines are equivalent to the length or height of horizontal or vertical rectangular bars. Lollipop Charts are preferred to bar charts when you are dealing with a large number of similar numerical values.", "If you find this article of interest, please read my previous:", "\u201cBubble Charts, Why & How, Storytelling with Bubbles\u201d", "\u201cParallel Coordinates Plots, Why & How, Storytelling with Parallels\u201d", "Your home for data science.
