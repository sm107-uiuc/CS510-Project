This process is known as training and, once complete, we would hope that our algorithm would do a good job of predicting the labels of brand new data in which the algorithm has no explicit knowledge of the true label. For example, we might train a supervised algorithm using a set of images of common animals as well as their corresponding labels (e.g. dog, cat, chicken). The algorithm will exploit useful features from the images such as number of legs or colour to find useful patterns that link images with their correct labels. After successful training we can use the fully trained algorithm to attempt to predict the labels of a brand new set of unseen images. We generally judge the performance of the algorithm by its accuracy in prediction of these new unseen images. Supervised learning can be applied to a wide range of problems such as email spam detection or stock price prediction. The Decision Tree is an example of a supervised learning algorithm.", "Unsupervised learning algorithms, on the other hand, work with data that isn\u2019t explicitly labelled. Instead, unsupervised algorithms attempt to find some sort of underlying structure in the data. Are some observations clustered into groups? Are there interesting relationships between different features? Which features carry most of the information? Unlike supervised learning, there is generally no need train unsupervised algorithms as they can be applied directly to the data of interest. Also in contrast to supervised learning, assessing performance of an unsupervised learning algorithm is somewhat subjective and largely depend on the specific details of the task. Unsupervised learning is commonly used in tasks such as text mining and dimensionality reduction. K-means is an example of an unsupervised learning algorithm.", "In recent years a number of paradigms have appeared that don\u2019t quite fit under the supervised and unsupervised labels. Semi-Supervised Learning is just what is sounds like, approaches that combine some labelled and some unlabelled data. Often labelling is an expensive, time consuming process so there are many situations where we would like to use information from a small amount of labelled data and a larger amount of unlabelled data. Also related to this situation is Active Learning where a learning algorithm can query a user to label particular observations which will add the most information. A slightly different situation is where we would like an algorithm to learn from experience. For example, in the scenario of a game such as chess we might like an algorithm to learn from playing many games and using a sort of label from the result of each game. At a very high level we might hope that good moves would be labelled as winning moves while bad moves might be correlated with losing. This is known as Reinforcement Learning and has received a lot of attention in recent years. Most machine learning approaches are quite narrow in the tasks they can achieve whereas Meta-Learning is concerned with generalisability or learning to learn. An example might be a algorithm that should identify animals in images but is only trained on cats and dogs. In this situation, a good meta learning algorithm would be able to identify brand new animals that it has not yet seen. There are plenty of other approaches that don\u2019t neatly fit under supervised or unsupervised learning, but I hope this post gives a useful introduction to the topic.", "Your home for data science.
