There are thousands of active subreddits with overlapping content. If it is no easy task for a human, I didn\u2019t expect it to be easier for a machine. Currently, Reddit users can ask for suitable subreddits in a special subreddit: r/findareddit.", "In this article, I share how to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline and an actual data product that suggests subreddits for a post. You get access to the data, code, an API endpoint and a user interface to try it with your Reddit posts.", "I used the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) to ask for the 5k most popular subreddits but only got back 4k of them. For each subreddit, I collected the newest 1k post\u2019s titles and texts up to the 17th of March. I exported the data to a CSV available for download on S3.", "This dataset is far from perfect in terms of data quality. Some subreddits are too general, others are very similar to each other and some posts don\u2019t have enough information in the text to know where they should be posted. A previous approach selected a subset of 1k subreddits that are more coherent topic-wise. While it\u2019s true that such data selection will make the model achieve higher scores on the test split, it won\u2019t necessarily be more useful on real data as it will miss a lot of subreddits.", "It\u2019s known that data cleaning can have a high impact on a model\u2019s performance and data scientists spend up to 80% of time cleaning data. As a data scientist, I often overestimate the impact of a data transformation. To avoid spending too much time early on data transformations, I prefer to directly build an end-to-end simple baseline as fast as possible. Once I have the first results, I can run version-controlled experiments to see the impact of each transformation. An end-to-end solution also allows you to get feedback from the end-user early on.", "In a previous article, I built a generic ML pipeline for text classification using fastText. I reuse that code to train it on the Reddit dataset using the title and selftext as features and the subreddit_name as the label. In the training dataset, each post is assigned to a single label, but it\u2019s natural to instead think of the problem as multi-label. In multi-label text classification, each post is assigned to each subreddit by a probability.", "Released by Facebook, fastText is a neural network with two layers. The first layer trains word vectors and the second layer trains a classifier. As noted in the original paper, fastText works well with a high number of labels. The collected dataset contains 300M words, enough to train word vectors from scratch with Reddit data. On top of that, fastText creates vectors for subwords controlled by two parameters, minn and maxn, to set the minimum and maximum character spans to split a word into subwords. On Reddit, typos are common and specific terms may be out of vocabulary if not using subwords.", "The machine learning pipeline consists of 5 executions that exchange data through Valohai pipelines. Each execution is a Python CLI and you can find the code of each one on Github and more details about how to create a pipeline that runs on the cloud in the previous article.", "The text features are concatenated, transformed to lowercase and punctuation is removed. Then the data is split into train (80%), validation (10%) and test (10%). I set the autotune command to run for 24 hours on a cloud machine with 16 cores to find the best parameters on the validation dataset. Finally, the model is retrained on all the data and the final metrics are reported on the test dataset. For each execution, Valohai takes care of launching and stopping a cloud machine with the proper environment, code, data and parameters.", "The autotune execution smartly tried 9 different parameters sets to decide on a final model that was trained for 100 epochs, with word vectors of 92 dimensions, n-grams of up to 3 words and subwords from 2 to 5 characters. That results in a vocabulary size of 3M words (including subwords) and a model that trains on 7 hours and weighs 2 GB.", "Classification tasks can be evaluated with classic metrics such as precision, recall and f1-score. The autotune execution logs the best parameters and reports a f1-score of 0.41 in the validation dataset.", "In extreme multi-label text classification tasks, it\u2019s common to also report metrics P@k (precision when taking the first k predictions) and R@k (recall when taking the first k predictions). Below, we can see the precision and recall on the test dataset for different k values. R@k goes from 0.4 when taking one prediction (k=1) to 0.71 when taking twenty predictions (k=20).", "Naturally, metrics vary between subreddits. It\u2019s interesting to explore the f1-score histogram by subreddits and the relationship between the prediction probability (p@1) and the f1-score. I created a Google Colab Notebook to make graphs based on test_predictions.csv.", "Naturally, there is a positive correlation between the f1-score and P@1, the probability of the first prediction given by the model. Still, p@1 lacks behind the f1-score on the test dataset. For example, when the model says that the first suggestion has a probability of 0.8, it should be taken as 0.5. It\u2019s possible that the model needs to be trained for more epochs to better adjust the probabilities.", "Metrics are important but they should not stop you from looking at the data. On the contrary, metrics tell you exactly where to look. For example, if we consider the subreddits for which the f1-score is close to 1, we\u2019ll find good examples of a feature leak.", "In the case of subreddits r/wood_irl and r/anime_irl most of the posts have as title the subreddit name, no text and an image. In r/holdmyfries, most posts start with HMF, a feature leak that may stop the model from learning from other text features. Looking at the worst-performing subreddits I find out that several popular subreddits don\u2019t necessarily have a topic coherence, such as r/AskReddit. The most coherent topic-wise subreddits have average f1-scores, like for r/MachineLearning with a f1-score of 0.4.", "The model not only contradicts the subreddits assigned by the users, but also the label space. If you have a look at the confusion matrix between subreddits, you\u2019ll find subreddits with similar topics. I uploaded the confusion matrix in long format to this Google Spreadsheet so you can use it to find similar subreddits. For example, here are 10 pairs of subreddits that are often confused by the model. The label column refers to the human choice and the label@1 column to the first model choice.", "Looking at the subreddits similar to r/MachineLearning, it gives some insights into why it\u2019s not always possible for the model to predict the human choice. There are often multiple possible choices. Hopefully, the model can still learn with some noise in the data and even correct the human choice when it predicts a different subreddit with a high probability.", "Even with all those limitations in mind, the trained model with R@5 of 0.6 can be useful. That means that two-thirds of the time, the first five predictions include the subreddit chosen by the human on the test dataset. Alternative predictions can help the user discover new subreddits and decide by himself whether to post there.", "In order to test the model with the latest post submissions, I created an API endpoint using FastAPI. FastAPI is a Python web framework used by the machine learning teams at Uber and Microsoft because of its compact code, data validation with Pydantic, automatic documentation and high-performance thanks to Starlette.", "The code in api.py is enough to declare the features and predictions models, load the trained model in memory and create a prediction endpoint.", "Using Valohai\u2019s Deployment feature, I declare an endpoint in the valohai.yaml configuration file with a Docker image and a server command.", "Through the Valohai UI, I can link the endpoint to a model generated by a previous execution. It\u2019s all version-controlled so that you can A/B test different versions, do canary releases and rollback if things go awry.", "You can call the API endpoint with curl and make a POST request with the text feature on the body of the request.", "You should get a JSON response like this.", "Too lazy to open a terminal? We got you covered. The Valohai team crafted a UI to interact with the model.", "I already see several areas of improvement to make the model more useful. For example, collecting data from less popular subreddits that the user may be unaware of. For the Reddit use case, the reported score of R@5 of 0.6 already helps the user discover new subreddits. The score is probably considerably higher if we remove posts that contain an image from the test dataset. In a different business case, the algorithm can be used to automatically classify documents with a high p@1 probability and support the business user to classify the harder cases manually.", "In my opinion, the next step would be to monitor how the performance of the model evolves with time as there is a natural concept drift in what users post on Reddit and fix that. In the following article, I will collect the latest data, compare the model metrics and build a CI/CD machine learning system to retrain and release a new model often.", "If you have a dataset with text and labels, you can retrain the pipeline on your data by following this tutorial. You can use it to build a production baseline to classify products in a marketplace, support tickets in a knowledge base or legal documents.", "Your home for data science.
