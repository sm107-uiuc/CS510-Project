The complete dataset can be found here. For the sake of illustration, I have taken only eight data points. The actual dataset contains around 700 data points.", "Our aim is to create a decision tree that can predict if a person will survive or not. For this context, I have used only four features in the dataset namely \u2014 Pclass, Sex, SibSp, and Embarked", "Before we jump into decision trees, let\u2019s first understand the anatomy of a tree in the context of data science (See the tree in the figure below).", "Our aim here is to build such a tree where each tree node represents a test on a feature (e.g. what is the sex of the passenger?), each branch (M or F) represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (survived or not). I know I have said a lot in one line, but it is extremely easy to understand once you see the below diagram. The diagram shows a test on a feature, Sex, which has two possible outcomes (M and F) on its branches. The leaf nodes of M comprise 3 non-survivors (3 minuses), while the leaf nodes of F comprise of 3 survivors and 2 non-survivors (3 pluses and 2 minuses). Easy.", "You might already have heard that an ML model should be simple enough to predict unseen (test/realtime) data with high precision (remember! the trade-off between bias and variance). If you think in the context of a tree, the tree with minimum depth (or maybe with minimum leaf nodes) will be the simplest. Now the question is, how do we create such a simple tree of tests? In other words, which tests should we choose, and in what order, to keep a tree from getting complex?", "To construct such a tree, in every step we will greedily choose a test that can separate the dataset more homogeneously (we will discuss about homogeneity in a few minutes). Let\u2019s choose a test in the context of the above mentioned titanic data set. We have four tests is the beginning to choose from:", "Let\u2019s look at them one by one.", "Here the aim is to choose the best test. By best test, we mean that the test which segregates the survivors and non-survivors more clearly. Just for the illustration, I am going to judge the quality of the test (or score them) by counting the number of data points which are cleanly separated by the test. Once they have been scored, we will choose the test with maximum score. The below calculations will help understand the meaning of homogeneity more clearly.", "In the Pclass test (look in the above diagram for visualization):", "So the total homogeneity points for Pclass test is 4 (3 + 1). Similarly, if you calculate the homogeneity for other tests:Sex test \u2014 3 pointsSibSp test \u2014 2 pointsEmbarked test \u2014 0 point", "Thus, the clear winner is Pclass test. This test produces maximum homogeneity. Now that we have decided the first test, this is what the tree looks like up to this point.", "The next step is going to be a bit tricky. We have to choose another test that tries to divide the 4 (remaining) non-homogeneous data points (of 1st class) into homogeneous data points (or leaf nodes).", "Again, we list all the tests and find their homogeneity score. The test results look like this. We have not taken Pclass test into account because that test will not be able to divide the remaining 4 data points homogeneously anymore.", "This time the clear winner is Sex test (4 points). Hence our final decision tree is \u2014", "Thus, if we have to interpret the model then, a person has survived if\u2014", "a. They had a 3rd class ticket. Or,b. They had a 1st class ticket and they were Female.", "The only problem with this approach is that it will not work on a large data set. The reason being, it is next to impossible to find a test which divides the data points cleanly and thus, homogeneously. There are various ways to measure homogeneity. Read about them here \u2014", "I hope the examples discussed above were able to provide you at least an intuition on how decision trees work.", "Your home for data science.
