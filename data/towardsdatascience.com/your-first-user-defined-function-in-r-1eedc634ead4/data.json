Then this post is for you.", "User defined functions need not be complex or difficult to build, but can make you very efficient if you are smart about where you use it. It can be small or big based on your needs. A user defined function can be used for any action to be performed in R.", "Read on to know more about user defined functions \u2014 step by step. Once you have a basic algorithm & a cup of tea ready, let\u2019s get started.", "Identify different sections in your algorithm that needs to be repeated again. If there is a continuous chunk that is being repeated, you would need a single function, else you can use two functions separately. There is also a chance that you can use a user defined function within another user defined function. Sounds cool right!", "Look for possibilities, identify the part that you would want to convert into a function. Now, let\u2019s concentrate on just that section.", "There will be an input and output for this section. Input will be a variable or multiple variables/datasets that you have. It could be read directly into R or could be a result of the code that you plan to write.", "Identify and visualize how the input looks like. You can either code it out or use pen and paper.", "Think about what you would want as an output of this function. Output of this function should be such that it can be easily plugged into the rest of the code or saved without further complex transformations.", "You don\u2019t have to worry much about the exact format of the output. You can figure that out on the way.", "Figure out a rough algorithm as to how would you reach from the decided input to the desired output. If you are a beginner, don\u2019t be lazy to draw a flow chart before you code (thank me later!). List down detailed steps, transformations and if you are comfortable with R, write down the in-build functions directly.", "Now we can start coding. Yay! The basic syntax for user defined function is given below:", "where \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 are arguments.", "And once you define a function, you can call it later as", "Let me show you a small example. As discussed above, I am identifying that I need to convert addition of two numbers into a user defined function. I want my input to be the 2 numbers and output should be a sentence containing the 2 numbers and its summation.

You have written your first function.", "Ready to take it further? It is always better to build a skeleton of the function as we did above and then build on it for further modifications or customization. This way, you can clearly check where you are going wrong.", "Let\u2019s say instead of 2 numbers, a user tries to insert a = \u201cone\u201d. Do you want to add error messages telling the user to use a numeric variable rather than a character?", "To do this, we can further modify the same function.", "Let\u2019s see how my function will look like now:", "Try calling this function using different values for a and b as given below:", "Now for a = 3 and b = 5, the results will remain the same;", "MyAddFunction(3,5) gives result as \u201cAddition of 3 and 5 gives 8\u201d", "MyAddFunction(4,\u201dtwo\u201d) gives result as \u201cPlease make sure that inputs are numeric\u201d", "Now that you have learnt how to build a basic user defined function in R, I hope you will be able to use it to make your code better.
