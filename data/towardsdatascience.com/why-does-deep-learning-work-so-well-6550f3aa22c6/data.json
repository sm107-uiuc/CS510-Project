Today, we can train machines to detect objects in images, extract meaning from text, stop spam emails, drive cars, discover new drug candidates, and beat top players in Chess, Go, and countless other games.", "A lot of these advancements are powered by deep learning, in particular deep neural networks. Yet, the theory behind deep neural networks remains poorly understood. Sure, we understand the math of what individual neurons are doing, but we\u2019re lacking a mathematical theory of the emergent behavior of entire network. What makes deep neural networks so powerful?", "We have some guidance from mathematics. In a 1989 paper, mathematician George Cybenko, then a researcher at the University of Illinois in Urbana, proofed the Universal Approximation Theorem: for any continuous function f, there exists a single-layer neural network that can approximate f arbitrarily well, as long as the activation function of that network is sigmoid-like.", "This is quite a remarkable result, but there\u2019s a catch: in practice, we not only want a neural network that approximates well on data we have seen. We also want it to work well on unseen data. The theorem, in other words, is silent about the problem of overfitting.", "Lacking a complete theory, we have to rely on intuition. Deeper neural network architectures, so the common intuition, generalize better and overfit less. They achieve this by learning hierarchies of representations: in face detection, for instance, these could be edges and lines at the bottom, eyes near the top, and complete faces at the top of the hierarchy. Even if part of the face is hidden, the network will still pick up a signal from the remaining input, and therefore generalize better.", "It\u2019s a good intuition, and it appears to be what is actually happening. Experiments confirm that deep neural networks outperform shallow ones on common image as well as text tasks. But it\u2019s just that, an intuition. We don\u2019t have a complete mathematical theory explaining why this intuition should be true.", "Compare this situation to physics. Physics, more than any other discipline, has embraced the symbiosis of experiment and theory. The \u2018standard model\u2019 of particle physics, for instance, describes the properties of the fundamental particles that make up our universe, and how these particles are allowed to interact. The theory then guides the design of new experiments. For example, the discovery of the Higgs particle back in 2012 at CERN was possible because theory told us where to look. Theory, in other words, guides our intuition.", "Theory also provides a safeguard against fluke discoveries. When researchers from the OPERA experiment announced in 2011 that they had measured neutrinos that were moving faster than the speed of light, we knew from our theories that this was an extraordinary statement, and needed to be vetted carefully. Indeed, as it was discovered later, a fiber optic cable had been attached improperly, causing the erroneous readings.", "Perhaps the most important concept in physics is that of emergence: higher-level theories describing macro-phenomena mathematically emerge from lower-level theories describing micro-phenomena. When talking about a gas, for example, it quickly becomes unfeasible to talk about the properties of the individual particles making up that gas. Instead, it is more meaningful and useful to treat macroscopic quantities like pressure, temperature, and entropy as the fundamental properties. The equations of statistical mechanics then describe how these macro-quantities relate to the states of the underlying particles.", "That\u2019s physics in a nutshell. Theory guides intuition. Experiments validate theory. Higher-level theories emerge from lower-level ones, and the game continues.", "The story of the Tacoma Narrows bridge illustrates vividly why it is so important to have a good theory. After being opened for traffic in July 1940, the bridge started swaying wildly in the wind, until it spectacularly collapsed just 4 months later. One dog died.", "When the bridge was built, we simply did not have a good enough theory about the aerodynamical forces that a bridge is exposed to \u2018in production\u2019. Nowadays, with CFD simulations we can stress-test bridges before they are being built, and prevent failures like that of the Tacoma Narrows bridge from happening again. Theory enabled us to build better bridges.", "Which brings us back to the topic. Today\u2019s machine learning practice is much like 1940\u2019s bridge-building. Deep neural networks seems to be working astonishingly well, but we lack a thorough mathematical understanding of why they do. Even worse, deep learning systems can sometimes fail spectacularly, and we don\u2019t really understand why, either.", "What we need, then, is an emergent theory of deep learning: a theory that goes beyond describing what individual neurons do, and explains the emergent behavior of the entire network.", "One candidate for such an emergent theory is energy-based learning, a theoretical framework promoted by Yann LeCun and others. The framework introduces a scalar field that describes the energy of a combined system. For a datapoint consisting of features and a label, for instance, this scalar energy is minimized if the label is the correct one. LeCun shows that any machine learning problem can be reformulated in this way as an energy-minimization problem. In physics terms, this framework views energy as the emergent property of the machine learning system.", "Machine learning research today is almost entirely empirical. We need a better theory to sharpen our intuition on where to look next, and to distinguish real signal from fluke discoveries. Perhaps the success of physics can be a guide.", "Your home for data science.
