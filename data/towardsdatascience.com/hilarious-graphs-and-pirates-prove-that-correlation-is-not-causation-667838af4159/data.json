This problem doesn\u2019t go away when we grow up though, it becomes worse the more intelligent we think we are. We convince ourselves that now we are older, wiser, smarter, that our conclusions are closer to the mark than when we were younger (the faster the wind blows the faster the windmill blades turn, not the other way around).", "Even really smart people see a pattern and insist on putting an explanation to it, even when they don\u2019t have enough information to reach such a conclusion. They can\u2019t help it.", "This is the thing about being human. We seek explanation for the events that happen around us. If something defies logic, we try to find a reason why it might make sense. If something doesn\u2019t add up, we make it up.", "Ever heard the Latin expression Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc, meaning \u2018After this, therefore because of this\u2019? It is the basis of the saying \u2018Correlation Does Not Imply Causation\u2019, also known in statistics as the Post Hoc Fallacy because it\u2019s a very familiar trap that we all fall into from time to time. This is the idea that when things are observed to happen in sequence, we infer that the thing that happened first must have caused the thing that happened next.", "The Post Hoc Fallacy is what causes a football manager to only wear purple socks on match days. He once wore them at a match and his team won. Obviously, it was the socks that did it. Now he fears that if doesn\u2019t wear them to a match the team might lose. Damn those stinky purple socks (he also daren\u2019t wash them for fear of the magic pixie dust washing out).", "Post Hoc is also what made rain men indispensible to the tribe \u2014 they believed that their rain man can make it rain. Spotting the clouds brewing in the distance, the rain man dances until it pours it down. It doesn\u2019t usually take more than three or four days of dancing until the inevitable happens. \u201cRain man dance, water fall from sky\u201d. It\u2019s just a good job for the rain man that the Indians couldn\u2019t speak Latin, otherwise he\u2019d have been in real trouble\u2026", "For a humorous view of the Post Hoc Fallacy, let\u2019s take a look at Pastafarianism. It\u2019s all the rage these days. Not heard of it? It\u2019s one of the newest and fastest growing religions on the block. Pastafarian Sparrowism, to give it its full title, is a \u2018vibrant religion that seeks to bring the Flying Spaghetti Monster\u2019s fleeting affection to all of us, through the life of His Prophet, Captain Jack Sparrow\u2019. Seriously, they\u2019re not joking. Well, actually, they are. They promote a light-hearted view of religion and oppose the teaching of intelligent design and creationism in public schools. They also maintain that pirates are the original Pastafarians.", "In an effort to illustrate that correlation does not imply causation, the founder, Bobby Henderson, presented the argument that global warming is a direct effect of the shrinking number of pirates since the 1800s, and accompanied it with this graph:", "Wow, look at that straight line, I hear you all say \u2014 there\u2019s clearly a correlation between the decline in the numbers of pirates and the rise in global temperatures, so there just must be a causal connection here, mustn\u2019t there? Yup, you\u2019ve all just fallen for the Post Hoc Fallacy (I just knew you would).", "Just because there is a straight line on the graph it doesn\u2019t necessarily follow that one thing caused the other, particularly when you\u2019ve grabbed two seemingly unconnected variables at random and stuck them together to see whether there might be some sort of tenuous correlation between them.", "In the case of pirates and global warming, take a closer look at the labels on the x-axis. Notice something strange? Apart from the fact that the proportions of neighbouring data points are all out of whack, there is also the issue that a couple of them have been humorously disordered to deliberately deceive.", "I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m a believer! As soon as I\u2019ve finished writing this book I\u2019m giving up stats for a life as a pirate on the open seas. I\u2019ll stop global warming if it\u2019s the last thing I do.", "We interrupt this blog post to bring you the breaking news\u2026", "This blog post is an extract from the witty new book Truth, Lies and Statistics", "Pirates, cats, Mexican lemons and North Carolina lawyers. Cheese consumption, margarine and drowning by falling out of fishing boats. This book has got it all. In this eye-opening book, award winning statistician and author Lee Baker uncovers the key tricks used by statistical hustlers to deceive, hoodwink and dupe the unwary. Written as a layman\u2019s guide to lying, cheating and deceiving with data and statistics, there\u2019s not a dull page in sight! A roller coaster of a book in 8 witty chapters, this might just be the most entertaining statistics book you\u2019ll read this year.", "Discover the exciting world of statistical cheating and persuasive misdirection.", "Get this book RIGHT NOW by clicking on the link below\u2026", "If you look online there are all sorts of humorous graphs that prove the Post Hoc Fallacy. Over the past 20 years or so, there\u2019s been a huge increase in the anti-vaccine movement, particularly in the US, and there have been all sorts of spurious correlations that have been \u2018discovered\u2019 that \u2018prove\u2019 that there is a causal link between vaccination programmes and autism. At the same time, to debunk the most crackpot of the theories, other \u2014 equally ridiculous \u2014 correlations have popped up too.", "There was one that was published that showed the correlation between sales of organic food in the US and diagnosis of autism:", "There is a very close correlation between the pair of plot lines, even accompanied by a very large r-value (close to 1) and a very small p-value (close to 0). The suggestion is that \u2014 if we trust that correlation does imply causation \u2014 a much closer correlation exists between organic food and autism than any other theory that currently exists, so therefore it must be the cause. Except that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, and organic food does not cause autism. That would be ridiculous. And that is the whole point of these graphs. All you need to do is find any pair of variables that increase over the same time period, plot them on a graph with the same x-axis and different y-axes, adjust the y-axis scales until the plot lines coalesce, and \u2014 BOOM \u2014 correlation! If, by some magic of coincidence and fate, there is a statistical correlation, then publish the p-value that goes along with it as additional proof. What this does is prove that the correlation exists, but it does not prove that one thing causes the other. It might, but then again it might not\u2026", "I also quite enjoyed the correlation that proved that Mexican lemons are a major cause of deaths on US roads. Wait, what? I must have missed the news that day \u2014 Mexican lemons are killing Americans? You bet!", "Take a look at a plot of the number of fresh lemons imported into the USA from Mexico versus the total fatality rate on US highways between 1996 and 2000:", "My, my, just look at the R-squared value \u2014 it really must be true. Although the graph seems to be telling us that the more Mexican lemons there are in the US the fewer road deaths there are, the inescapable conclusion is that MEXICAN LEMONS KILL AMERICANS! What should we do about it? Should we import more Mexican lemons (the correlation tells us that this is what we should do)? Or should we ban Mexican lemons altogether? After all, if there are no Mexican lemons on the streets then they can\u2019t kill any more Americans.", "What utter tosh! I don\u2019t care if there is a correlation, there is nothing to suggest that lemons cause accidents. If there was, don\u2019t you think that lemons would be causing accidents on Mexican roads before the trucks crossed into the US? What about Sicilian lemons? Do they cause road deaths in Italy and across Europe?", "Oh, the power of correlations. As long as your audience doesn\u2019t understand that correlation does not necessarily imply causation you can make them believe pretty much anything.", "Did you forget your copy of the book? Not to worry, it\u2019s waiting for you right here:", "Your home for data science.
