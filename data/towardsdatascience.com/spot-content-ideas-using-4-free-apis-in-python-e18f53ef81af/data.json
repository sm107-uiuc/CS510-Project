While every writer tries to write about something they care about getting attention from readers is essential.", "Being a Data Analyst I got curious to see the possibilities of solving this problem with the skills I have. I wanted to know how does any successful writer search for topics. Especially when he/she is out of ideas what is their approach to finding topics.", "9x Top writer in Medium Esat Artug wrote an article and shared his insights on how he search for topics. He uses free available sources like Google Trends, Amazon, Answer the public to see what\u2019s trending and how people are interacting.", "I liked his approach as it is simple and very effective as well. As you will be looking at top trends and searches, it guarantees, you only choose topics that people are interested in.", "Being in Data Science field I instantly know that I can make it better and easy. There are lots of sources like Google, Reddit, Twitter that provides free APIs to access data. And if you can search and see all the data in a single screen without going through one by one it should save a lot of time.", "In this article, I will go through step by step approach I have followed to make it happen. Let's dive into it.", "In selecting the sources I have decided to keep 2 things in mind.", "As the idea is to help the writer find content topics it is only helpful if he can see topics that are currently trending. That means absolutely no outdated data.", "For example, if the writer wants to search for a topic in NLP and gets recommended with GPT-2. It won\u2019t be of much help for a writer as an advanced version GPT-3 was already released.", "As I am doing it mainly as a research purpose I definitely don\u2019t want to spend any money in accessing the data. Also, the free tier data provided from APIs should be sufficient.", "The 4 APIs that I have chosen for this project are", "I have used Python for extracting and cleaning the data and used Streamlit to create a website where user can search with a keyword and see the output.", "I used pytrends library to access Google trends data. One nice thing about it is you don\u2019t have to request a special access key.", "Make sure you install the library using pip install pytrends and import the library using from pytrends.request import TrendReq", "You need to initialize it by calling TrendReq()", "From the documentation I found related_topics() , related_queries() and trending_searches() functions which I thought I can use in this project.", "But related_topics() only returns topic names which is not much helpful.", "trending_searches() returns the current trending topics which again is not much helpful as we are trying to find trending searches based on keywords.", "related_queries() returns json output of hot and raising searches based on input keyword. which gives the exact information needed for this project. See the sample output below for raising queries for \u2018Machine Learning\u2019 keyword search.", "You can see the gist for accessing data from Google trends below", "Reddit works based on tags or pages called as subreddit where people can post only subreddit related topic. When searching for the latest posts make sure you search with popular subreddit name to get the best results.", "Access Keys: Unlike Google trends for Reddit data you need to get \u2018access keys\u2019 which are specific to the user. You can use this link reddit app to create your own access key tokens.", "Once done head over to Python editor and make sure you install PRAW library, Python wrapper for Reddit API. You can use pip install PRAW to install the library.", "Import the library and give your access keys in praw.Reddit() function to authenticate and you can check the connection using reddit.read_only()", "reddit.subreddit(keyword).hot(limit=10) is the function used to get the top 10 hot topics in the subreddit.", "The sample output searched for subreddit \u2018MachineLearning\u2019 is as below", "You can see the Gist below for accessing data from Reddit.", "From Twitter API you can get the tweets based on the keyword or hashtag. Before diving into the implementation make sure you have access keys for using Twitter API. Free Tier or standard API would be enough for this project.", "Access Key: Please refer slickremix for a simple guide to create access tokens in Twitter.", "I have used tweepy library to access tweets and you can install the library using pip install tweepy", "After importing tweepy you can authenticate the API using tweepy.OAuthHandler() and set_access_token() functions.", "Next, you can search and download tweets using tweepy.Cursor() I have used \u2018-filter:retweets\u2019 in the query as I want to get data of only origin tweets and filter out retweets.", "Then remove all the hyperlinks in the tweets using below code", "To get the top tweets I have used favourite and retweet counts of each tweet. I have generated a score for each tweet giving more weightage to retweet counts than favourite count.", "Using tweets score I have sorted all the data to get the top 10 tweets. See output below", "You can see the gist for accessing data from Twitter below", "News API is a very good source to get top news from multiple news sources.", "Access Key: You need to generate API access key and the access is free for development.

I have given 7 days as data range to make sure we get at least 10 articles for any keyword search.", "You can see the gist for accessing data from NewsApi below", "In my opinion, Streamlit is the best python library to create a website and share your results. This is the best if you are trying to build a minimum viable product as fast as you can.", "You can see the final output of the website below.", "Here I will be getting data from all the 4 sources of API and then format the data accordingly to display in nice and simple tables.", "Functionalities that I want to provide with the website are:", "Make sure you have streamlit installed.

You should be able to see a screen in a local browser like below", "You can see the code for this in gist below", "As a test, I ran the search with keyword \u2018machine learning\u2019. And I am very happy with the result as I got Top 10 searches from all the API\u2019s and I can see clearly there are a lot of interesting ideas that can be used.", "I put myself in the shoes of a content finder and quickly skimmed through the output and in less than a minute I found topics that I am interested in that I can write about. Also I am assured of getting an audience for my writing in these topics as they are already in trending.", "Some of the topics that I can write based on the search are:", "Finally, I am pretty much happy with the result.", "In this post, we have gone through the process of how to do content search accessible using Google, Reddit, Twitter and NewsApi APIs.Apart from this, I also want to show the approach of making an idea into a final product using skills you have as a data buff.", "If you have observed there is no Machine Learning involved in this project. If you are a Data Scientist or Machine Learning engineer I know the urge to implement every idea you have with complex models. Which is why a lot of models we develop don\u2019t go to production.", "I strongly believe there is no shame in not using machine learning if you don't have to.
