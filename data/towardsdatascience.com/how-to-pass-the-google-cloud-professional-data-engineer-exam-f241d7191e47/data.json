This was the first time I was exposed to the role of a Data Engineer and the Google Cloud Platform.", "You can read more about my internship here.", "I joined Zenu as an aspiring Data Scientist and a firm believer in the company\u2019s vision to later find out that they didn\u2019t have any data or the infrastructure to store it. Since I wanted to work closely with data, I took on the responsibility for the design and delivery of Zenu\u2019s analytical database.", "One technical solution to the business requirement was to use BigQuery as our data warehouse, which supports fast querying of nested rows using the familiar standard SQL syntax. Furthermore, it allows simple integration with other Google Cloud products such as Data Studio for analytical reports and AI platform for machine learning.", "Coming from a non-technical background, I learnt the data engineering skills required for the job from scratch. During this time, I came across the Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer Certification and took several online courses to gain a better understanding of the technology and the wider role it has in the future of data analytics.", "I spent about two months casually watching a couple of videos a day and then an intensive one month of practice papers and nailing the key points. I took the exam in early November.", "Course: Data Engineering with GCP Professional CertificateCost: \u00a338/month (1-week free trial)Helpfulness: 7/10", "Coursera was the first online course I took and is taught by Google employees. They offer a combination of presentations, hands-on labs and demos.", "I found this course to be quite advanced for someone without any prior commercial experience. I wasn\u2019t aware of current technologies such as those in the Hadoop ecosystem and was overwhelmed with many unfamiliar terminologies.", "I finished watching all the videos, but to be honest I forgot most of it immediately. However, I highly recommend taking the Preparing for the Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer Exam Course about a week or two before taking the examination. This is like the revision lecture at university, where they did a quick cover of the key products that can you can expect to see in the exam.", "As any broke student would do, I used the 1-week free trial and downloaded all the videos for offline viewing.", "Course: Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer Cost: $49/month (1 week free trial), $80/3 months (student subscription)Helpfulness: 9/10", "Note: Linux Academy is now part of A Cloud Guru", "This was the second online course I took and covers about 70% of the content that came up in the exam. This course also offers a combination of presentations, hands-on labs and demos.", "This course gives a high-level overview of each Google Cloud service and covers key concepts as well as Google\u2019s best practices for using each one.", "The course was structured well, starting from the foundational concepts, to the different types of databases, architecting pipelines, machine learning and data visualisation.", "I found this one very easy to follow and was kind on the novice. Matthew Ulasien\u2019s (the course instructor) expertise on the Google Cloud Platform meant his explanations were very clear and concise. In his videos, he often highlights key facts and concepts that you can expect to come up in the exam.", "There are a variety of hands-on labs, walkthroughs and quizzes that help consolidate your understanding and provide an opportunity to test the material you\u2019ve learnt in the videos directly on the Google Cloud Platform.", "One of the most helpful resources provided by this course was the Data Dossier which is like a digital set of course notes. It highlights the key points for each service, displays clear comparison tables, diagrams and workflows as well as tips to remember for the exam.", "I recommend taking this course first if you\u2019re new to data engineering as it is slightly easier to follow than the Coursera course.", "If I were to recommend just one paid subscription, this would be the one. I paid for the 3-month student subscription and it was worth it. Not only do you get access to the amazing resources on the GCP course, but you\u2019ll also have full access to all the other courses offered by Linux Academy (which I used).", "Course: Google Data Engineer Exam \u2014 Professional Certification PreparationCost: \u00a349/month (1-week free trial)Helpfulness: 8/10", "Cloud Academy was the third and last online course I used to prepare for the exam. I started this course about a week before taking the exam and used it more as a refresher than a learning guide.", "The most useful thing about this course was that it covered topics such as Security and Networking, Data Encryption and Compute Engines which were not covered in the other courses, but can be tested according to the official exam syllabus.", "Apart from the topics mentioned above, I watched all the other videos at x1.5 the speed to check if there were any new information I was previously unaware of. I found the hands-on labs a bit harder and more copy-pasting long lines of pre-written commands.", "I used the 1-week free trial.", "Here are some of the other resources I found very useful but are optional depending on your experience.", "Linux Academy \u2014 Big Data Essentials (free with community account)", "This course is a comprehensive introduction to the world of Big Data. It covers the principles of Big Data infrastructures and its integration with cloud computing.", "The most useful thing about this course for me was that it provided a high-level overview of the most popular Big Data technologies including core Hadoop, the Hadoop ecosystem (Hive, Pig, Kafka etc) and Apache Spark. For the exam, you will be expected to know what each of these does and their GCP equivalent. e.g Kafka -> PubSub, Hive -> BigQuery.", "This course was recommended at the start of the Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer course for those unfamiliar with SQL. It covers basic SQL statements and functions including aggregations, joins and sorts. I recommend this course if you haven\u2019t used SQL before or don\u2019t use it very often as you will need it to write query statements in BigQuery.", "This course is Google\u2019s fast-paced, practical introduction to machine learning. I used this course a quick refresher since I had already covered some of the popular algorithms and concepts in a university course. However, I think it\u2019s well structured and will give you a good foundation in machine learning.", "Qwiklabs is a platform that provides temporary credits to use on various cloud platforms in the format of tutorials and demos. You can use Qwiklabs to get extra hands-on experience with the Google Cloud Platform. I took the Baseline: Data, ML, AI / Data Engineering / BigQuery for Data Warehousing courses. I found the last one quite useful as it allows you to practise writing query statements in BigQuery.", "There are many individuals that passed the Professional Data Engineering exam and shared their experience online about their preparation and exam experience. I feel like most of them come from a technical background so they skim over some obvious knowledge (since the recommended experience to take the exam is 3+ years of industry experience including 1+ years designing and managing solutions using GCP).", "One pattern that seemed common having read online forums, comments and hearing about people that have taken the exam and failed was that they underestimated the difficulty of the exam because they do similar things in their day job.", "I can relate to this overconfidence for the machine learning part of the exam since I was already familiar with the algorithms having covered them in a university module. I spent less time on this part of the syllabus and as a result, was less confident in some of my answers.", "As students, the one advantage we have is that we are used to studying. In my case, I just finished my final year of exams and was still in \u2018study mode\u2019 so preparing for this exam wasn\u2019t too unfamiliar. On top of your busy schedules, I understand that it might have been years since you last studied for an exam so I will outline some of the key areas you should focus on and how I prepared for it.", "The first mistake I made was to not read the official Google exam guide properly and naively assume that the online courses would cover this. What the online courses do well is that they cover each GCP service in detail, outline its common use cases, Google\u2019s best practices for using the service and how they fit in the overall data engineering role.", "What the exam is testing you on is your ability to come up with a feasible technical solution to the business requirement. Although there will never be one perfect solution, a great solution should take the four points mentioned above into consideration.", "In the exam, you can expect to see several options that may meet the business or technical requirement but one is better than the rest.", "If you\u2019ve watched some of the online courses, you may recognise these terms.", "Lift and Shift is simply migrating existing processes or infrastructure to the cloud without redesigning anything. Some companies might take this approach because they don\u2019t want to spend time and money modifying their current infrastructure but still want to use the benefits of the cloud. For example, hosting a MySQL database on compute engines rather than migrating all the data to Cloud SQL.", "Lift and Leverage means to move your existing processes over to the cloud and make them better using some of the services the cloud has to offer. For example, you can use Dataproc to run your Hadoop and Spark workloads but store the data in Cloud Storage as opposed to storing it in HDFS. This is more cost-efficient since you only pay for the time the job is running and then you can shut down the cluster when you aren\u2019t using it without losing all its data since it is now stored in Cloud Storage.", "After doing all the online courses and the practice questions, you might think that most of the answers involve choosing the most appropriate Google Cloud service for a particular business or technical requirement. After all, Google is selling their superior, low-cost, fully managed, no-ops capabilities of its Cloud Services.", "However, this is not always the case and it\u2019s important to read the question carefully as some questions in the exam have a technical requirement where they don\u2019t want to make any modifications to their existing processes.", "The hardest part of the exam for me was the trade-off between cost and performance. (This is probably where your 3+ years of industry experience might come in handy!). The business people think in terms of minimising costs and the technical people think in terms of increasing performance.", "A common question is phrased along the lines of \u2018A mid-size company wants to [do something] whilst keeping costs low\u2019. While some situations are obvious such as using Cloud SQL vs Cloud Spanner, scenarios which involve running jobs are harder since you could use more powerful CPU\u2019s (which costs more) to run a job, resulting in a shorter runtime (costs less).", "BigQuery ML \u2014 Recently, there\u2019s a trend to make AI accessible to everyone. BigQuery ML allows users to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery using standard SQL queries as opposed to writing code. One of the big advantages is that the data does not leave BigQuery. Check out this video for a simple explanation.", "Kafka \u2014 I read from other sources that Kafka appears a lot in the exam and it was true in my case as well. The Google Cloud equivalent is Cloud Pub/Sub. You should be aware of the differences between the two such as Pub/Sub only holds data for up to seven days whereas Kafka can store as much data as you want and can be accessed anytime.", "Failover replica \u2014 As stated in syllabus 4.3 of the exam guide, it is important to think about a backup solution for your data infrastructure. Some Google Cloud services create copies of the data automatically, whereas others have to be set up manually. Think about which regions and zones you want to provision services. What happens if a data centre in a zone goes down? How do you prepare for this?", "Cloud Key Management & Data Encryption \u2014 Data security is a very important component of data engineering. By default, GCP encrypts all customer data at rest. You should be aware that there are other encryption methods including CMEK, CSEK and Client-Side Encryption. Google Cloud has a Cloud Key Management Service that lets you manage cryptographic keys for your cloud services.", "Everyone has a different studying technique so you should find one that suits your lifestyle. I\u2019m not suggesting that you adopt my approach, but if you haven\u2019t found your style or have found that other techniques don\u2019t work, feel free to try mine.", "In terms of online courses, I recommend the following order.", "If you don\u2019t have a lot of experience using the Google Cloud Platform, I recommend you practise using the hands-on labs and Qwiklabs. You shouldn\u2019t memorise how to do each task, but use it as an opportunity to familiarise yourself with the service and the overall GCP environment.", "If you get the Linux Academy subscription, you get access to the cloud sandbox where you can receive guest user credentials to use GCP for 3 hours per session.", "You can still gain valuable practice without breaking your wallet by using this cloud sandbox or by creating a free GCP account ($300 free credits) and following the task instructions for the hands-on labs on Coursera or Qwiklabs. (On Qwiklabs, you are essentially paying to use the GCP environment for a fixed time)", "My studying strategy in university was to do the past-papers as early as possible and familiarise myself with the exam style and the types of questions I can expect to see in the final exam. This way, you can spot gaps in your knowledge and focus on your weaker areas.", "If you already have industry experience, I recommend this approach. If it\u2019s your first time learning about data engineering, I recommend completing the Linux Academy course, do at least one practice exam and then move onto the Coursera course.", "A month before the real exam, I did one practice exam a week. I used the Linux Academy practice exam, the Coursera practice exam and Google\u2019s official Data Engineer practice exam.", "The most important part of the practice paper step of your revision is to make a note of all the questions you got wrong and review them again. Once you view the answers (after taking the tests on the online courses), you will see a brief explanation of why your answer was right or wrong (and sometimes a link to the video where the topic was covered). For Google\u2019s official practice exam, they\u2019ll also give you links to their official documentation on the GCP website.", "Here are some extra free practice questions:", "I cannot stress how important it is to keep doing practice questions. Although they do not reflect the same difficulty as the real exam, you will gain exposure to a wide variety of questions and increase your confidence walking into the real exam.", "The course instructors strongly emphasise that doing the online course only is not enough to pass the exam. Your preparation should include a variety of online resources, hands-on practice with GCP and past exam questions.", "There are two more things that I also included in my revision that I highly recommend.", "The exam consists of 50 questions and you have 2 hours to finish it. There is a bookmark feature where you can bookmark questions for later review. From what I\u2019ve read online, most people took about 1 to 1 hour 15 minutes to complete the test. I used the full 2 hours.", "I would say that the exam is about 20% times harder than the practice exam. Many of the questions can inflict a lot of self-doubts such as the cost vs performance trade-off. My tip is to pace yourself and don\u2019t waste too much time on a single question. If you don\u2019t know the answer or are unsure about your answer, bookmark it and move on to the next.", "Don\u2019t panic if you can\u2019t answer all the questions the first time. I got stumped on the first 5 questions and then bookmarked more than half of the questions for later review.", "Well done on making it this far! I hope this guide has been helpful and hopefully a confidence booster for those taking the exam soon. It is definitely possible to pass this exam without commercial experience and prepare for it from a theoretical standpoint.", "I\u2019ve added a few links below that helped me in my preparation for the exam. These individuals also share their experiences and provide some great advice and areas to look out for.", "I wish you the best of luck!
