In the unfortunate events that occurred, 10.2 million hectares of land burned, 3100 homes were destroyed, 3 billion animals were killed, and 33 lives were lost [1]. The socioeconomic and ecological impacts of the fires however have extended well beyond the immediate loss. Assessing and analysing the events of the fires quantitively and qualitatively is key to informing policy and decision makers for recovery efforts.", "The Open Data Cube initiative is an excellent example of an open source project specifically designed around unlocking the full potential of remotely sensed imagery. The data cube ingests and indexes imagery sources such as Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery and optimises both data sources for use by applying high level atmospheric, bidirectional reflectance and topographic corrections making the data immediately analysis ready [2].", "In this story, I will walk you through how the Digital Earth Australia instance of the data cube on the National Computational Infrastructure was used to create a script that queried a deep temporal stack of multispectral imagery to conduct a pre and post fire assessment of a 110km by 130km regional scene. Using imagery from two months previous and 3 months after a fire event, a fire extent and severity result can be produced in less than ten minutes.", "The following example was completed using the National Computation Infrastructures\u2019 virtual desktop interface (VDI) \u2014 a virtualised Linux based environment where Digital Earth Australia\u2019s data cube and indexed imagery products are hosted. Inside a Jupyter notebook on the VDI (32 GB RAM, 4 cores, 2GB storage), a result was produced within 28 minutes. Compiling and running a python script on the NCI\u2019s Gadi supercomputer produced a result within 10mins (64GB RAM, 16 cores, 10 GB storage). More information about accessing the NCI can be found here.", "For those of you interested in testing out this code, I recommend trying it in the sandbox environment first which is freely accessible to anyone after creating an account. The sandbox can be found here.", "The immediate result can be seen in the image above. Accuracy of this process was assessed as between 60\u201364% for the fire severity result (classified into severity categories of unburnt, low, moderate, high and extreme) and 88\u201392% for the fire extent (classified into categories of unburnt and burnt). The lower accuracy for fire severity was a result of poor class separability between the low, moderate, and high severity classes \u2014 a known issue of the normalised burn ratio technique [3] . Other sources of error included seasonal variation due to temporal windows or the pre and post fire scenes which was addressed by computing a median pixel value given that pixel distributions were skewed across time. Non-homogenous regrowth of vegetation also resulted in some misclassifications. For example, grass recovered faster than medium and large vegetation structures. This highlights the importance of understanding the biophysical phenomenon you are attempting to analyse.", "The normalised burn ratio is a simple, yet effective calculation for computing fire extent and severity. Traditionally hampered by long pre-processing steps for multitemporal analysis, the Open Data Cube initiative unlocks access to analysis ready datasets allowing for more time and computational resources to be focused on the core problem. The open source collaborative nature of the project coupled with freely available imagery sources and open geospatial consortium standards is a potent recipe for a future of amazing remote sensing discoveries and solving some of the world\u2019s greatest environmental monitoring challenges.", "Please check out my github repository for the source code and notebooks related to this project \u2014 https://github.com/yobimania/dea-notebooks.", "[1]: Vardoulakis, S et. al (2020).
