Conditional formatting, as the name suggests, is a way of visualizing data that applies special format rules based on some pre-defined conditions on the values of a selected metric. It is mostly used when the data is presented in a tabular format; however, it can also be used in any charts such as bar charts, line charts, etc.", "When there is a lot of data expressed in tabular format, it becomes difficult to understand which of the values are higher or lower at first glance. Often, you need to eyeball deeply into the cell values to understand or compare various metrics that are being displayed.", "For instance, if you consider the figure on the left below, there is just too much data and you need to compare each of the cell values individually in order to understand more about it. However, if you see figure on the right, you can understand just by looking at a single glance, what are the higher values, the middle values and which values are lower. This is known as conditional formatting in Power BI.", "Let us first try to import some data into the Power BI data model. Once the data is imported, we will investigate how to implement conditional formatting. For the sake of this article, I\u2019m going to import the data from the famous WideWorldImportersDW database that is provided by Microsoft. You can download and install this database on your local easily. Since I have already installed the database, I won\u2019t be covering those steps here. In order to import the data into Power, you can walk along with me in the steps below:", "Open Power BI Desktop and click on Get Data. Select SQL Server from the drop down that appears.", "In the Connect Server dialog box that appears, provide the server name and the name of the database and click OK.", "Once you click on Connect, you\u2019ll see that all the tables from the database are listed in the dialog box. For this article, we will just select three of the tables \u2014 Dimensions.City, Dimensions.Date and Fact.Sale. Click Load once done.", "Now, let us quickly build a Power BI report using the Matrix visualization. It will use the data from the tables that we just imported. Click on Matrix on the Visualizations pane and drag and drop the respective fields into the Rows, Columns and Values, as shown in the figures below.", "Once the fields are in place, you\u2019ll see a similar kind of matrix being created in the Power BI report. This is a simple matrix that displays the sum of Total Including Tax for each of the Sales Territory and by Year. As you can see, it\u2019s not easy to understand the highest and lowest values in the matrix; we need to dive deep into the visual and understand those values.", "In order to implement conditional formatting in Power BI, let us go ahead and define the rules for which we would like to visualize. Let us consider that we will change the background color of the cells based on the values each cell holds. For instance, the cell with the lowest value will have a background color of red while the highest will be highlighted in blue. You can follow the steps below to implement the same.", "Right-click on the \u201cTotal Including Tax\u201d field in the Values section. Alternatively, you can also click on the Format button and turn on the Background Color under Conditional Formatting.", "Let us now select Color Scale as the Format By option and select the colors as discussed earlier. For the Lowest value, we will assign red while the color for the Highest value will be blue. Click OK once done.", "Now that we have seen what conditional formatting in Power BI is all about, let us explore some more different ways of implementing the same. In the steps above, the formatting rule is based on the range of cell values. That means, depending on the value a cell holds, the saturation of the background color changes. However, there might be scenarios where you\u2019d like to visualize the formatting based on a fixed number value and don\u2019t want to change the saturation of the colors. Or you might also want to segregate the measures into categories like , and values.", "In the steps below, we will try to modify the rules of the conditional formatting from range to fixed values.", "Thus, in the above exercise, we have seen how we can implement conditional formatting in Power BI based on two different ways. The first one was by using the Color Scale and the second was by defining specific Rules for the formatting.", "Let us now go one step further and implement some icons just as a visual indicator in the cells. These specific icons are helpful when defining any KPIs, or while comparing metrics based on a criterion. You can follow the steps mentioned below to implement the icons in the cells.", "In this article, I have explained what conditional formatting in Power BI is all about and how to implement the same. I have also explained the different ways in how conditional formatting can be applied and in what scenarios. Finally, we have seen how to include some infographic visuals (icons) in the visuals that help increase the readability of the reports to a great extent.", "Your home for data science.
