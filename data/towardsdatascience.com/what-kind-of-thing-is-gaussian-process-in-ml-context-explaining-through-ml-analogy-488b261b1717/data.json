A function-generator generator generates infinitely many function generator. That is what a Gaussian process is. It also comes with many handy perks.", "I love Wikipedia because I am a holistic thinker. That means, to learn something, I need to fully know the context, and Wikipedia always gives me that. Most of the time at least.", "For example, Wikipedia will tell me that tomato is a berry. Now, after clicking the link on berry, I know what kind of thing tomato is. By analogy, it is under the same category of grapes, currants, cucumbers, eggplants (aubergines) and bananas; but not strawberries and raspberries.", "Unfortunately, Gaussian Process is a huge topic in its own right. So the Wikipedia page does not make any reference to anything I am familiar with (which is only in Machine Learning). This means I have to go through YouTube videos and blog posts to try to understand what this thing is (check the end for the list)", "Today, we are going to look at the regression task in a different way. We will center our discussion around something called the \u201cfunction generator\u201d.", "In most supervised ML regression task, we need something like a function generator, although we usually never put it that way. A function generator is something, that could generate infinitely many functions. We need it because usually, the task is to find the underlying function behind our datasets. So, hopefully, one of the functions generated by our function generator is similar enough to the function we are trying to find.", "For example, in 2D, linear regression is a function generator. It can generate infinitely many linear functions. The goal of the regression is to find the one single linear function that fits our dataset best. Another example is the neural network. Neural network architecture can generate infinitely many networks, which is basically functions, determined by the bias and weights. Again, the goal is to find the one single network that fits our dataset best.", "Usually, at this point, we talk about the parameters. How the parameters tells the function generator exactly which function to make. Usually, we will reduce the whole problem to finding the best parameters, instead of finding the best function. However, GP is what is known as a non-parametric, although some people refer to it as having infinite parameters. So we would not be talking about parameters, at least not in a way that we normally understand it.", "Now that we know what a function generator is, I would like to introduce a new concept: \u201cfunction-generator generator\u201d. For example, we can think of linear regression function generator as a product of a polynomial function-generator generator, set to the degree of 1. Similarly, we could think of a neural network function-generator generator that could generate any kind of neural network, all it needs is a description of the architecture.", "Usually, it is kind of ridiculous to think in these terms. But now, we know exactly what Gaussian process is, it is a function-generator generator. It can generate infinitely many function generators. All it needs is something called a specific matrix, called the covariance matrix, that could be generated by a function, called the kernel function.", "I\u2019m making huge simplifications here, but kernel functions, are basically functions that takes two numbers as input and output a number. However, here, we can think of it as a hyperparameter. Choosing which kernel function to use is like choosing neural network architecture. Here are some examples of kernel functions (and check this page for more https://peterroelants.github.io/posts/gaussian-process-kernels/). Also, check on these 2 links for more examples: https://youtu.be/clMbOOz6yR0 https://youtu.be/e7as_wY0hUI", "Depending on which kernel functions are chosen, the inferred prediction could be different as demonstrated here (check this page for more explanations http://krasserm.github.io/2018/03/19/gaussian-processes/):", "Here is the most interesting bit about Gaussian Process. Once we have the function generator, we don\u2019t use any kind of gradient descent to nail on a set of parameters and end up with one function. Instead, we use our dataset to eliminate all the functions that don\u2019t fit our dataset. What we have left, are all the function, still infinitely many, that do fit our dataset. Next, we for every point in the feature space x, we could take the average value of the infinitely many function, and use it as our prediction. Moreover, we could also see the distribution of these functions.", "(Unfortunately, since we are not reducing to parameters, we need to calculate through the entire datasets whenever we want to make predictions. This issue has given rise to many variants of Gaussian process.)", "Gaussian process comes with a lot of additional features. If we were to consider that there is a certain level of noise in our datasets, instead of simply giving us an infinite set of functions, Gaussian process could attach a probability value over each function. This is why the most standard definition is:", "A Gaussian process is a probability distribution over possible functions that fit a set of points.", "By now, you should have a feel of what kind of thing Gaussian process is, and how it is related with the typical ML framework. Now, you\u2019re ready to get into the details of how Gaussian Process actually work.
