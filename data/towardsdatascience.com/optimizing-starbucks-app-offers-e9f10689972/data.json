They added a record 1.4 million customers to their member base earlier this year, ending the quarter with 18.9 million active members across the U.S., which marks a 16% year-over-year growth. With the introduction of its technology initiative, Deep Brew, Starbucks is constantly ideating and working on a suite of AI tools to elevate every aspect of their business.", "So what exactly is Starbucks doing right? What could be implemented to maximize earnings? These are some questions I sought to better understand that will be explored in this blog. By answering these questions, Starbucks can target customers that are more likely to redeem offers, which would reduce promotional costs and maximize offer earnings. Successfully targeting offers towards appropriate users also leads to an enhanced, personalized experience, which in turn could improve customer retention.", "In this post, we will analyze simulated data that mimics real customer purchases on the Starbucks rewards app. Transaction, demographic, and offer data will be explored to reveal consumer behavior trends. These trends will then be used to build a machine learning model that predicts offer success. The objective is to send promotions to users that are more likely to respond and to only send them offers that have a high probability of being redeemed.", "The Starbucks datasets provided by Udacity contain demographic, offer, and transaction data from the Starbucks rewards mobile app. The same datasets can be found here on Kaggle. Feel free to download these and follow along!", "Starbucks sends out an offer to users every few days through their mobile app. These offers can be an advertisement, discount, or a buy one get one free (BOGO) promotion. Not all users receive the same promotions and offer frequency varies per user.

In our initial observations of this DataFrame, we can see that \u2018channels\u2019 can be separated into separate columns for better analysis. We can also rename the \u2018id\u2019 column to \u2018offer_id.\u2019", "The clean dataset should look like this:", "Moving on to the profile dataset, we see again that the \u2018id\u2019 column can be clearer by renaming it to \u2018customer_id.\u2019 Gender can also be converted to numerics or can be separated into columns. The \u2018became_member_on\u2019 should be in a readable date format. While 118 is a possible profile age, we can see that this value is an outlier when plotting the distribution. There are no ages between 101 and 118. Based on the distribution, and this age gap, we can infer that this is user input error and replace this value with NaN. We can also drop rows with missing age, gender, and income data.", "The cleaned profile DataFrame should look like this:", "For the transcript data, we can rename the \u2018person\u2019 column to \u2018customer_id.\u2019 The \u2018value\u2019 column can be separated into columns for offer_id and amount. The \u2018event\u2019 column can also be split into columns by offer type and transaction. Since we have a \u2018customer_id\u2019 column in the cleaned profile DataFrame, we can drop the transcript customer id\u2019s that are absent in the profile dataset.", "The cleaned transcript dataset should look like this:", "For the next section, we want to explore all variables so let\u2019s merge these DataFrames.

The merged DataFrame should have these qualities:", "Now for the fun part, let\u2019s check out some trends. When looking at the shape and time column in the merged DataFrame, we can tell that the experiment was run for 30 days and 272,388 events were collected.", "So far, we\u2019ve looked at the offers sent to users during this 30 day period.

Let\u2019s go ahead and write this function.", "Now we can plot percent success by offer type. Let\u2019s also plot the offer type count to see if there\u2019s any association between count and success rate.", "We will now use the customer spending trends identified in our analyses to build a model that predicts whether a user will respond to an offer. The process of sending promotions to users requires labor and is a cost to the organization. If Starbucks implements a prediction model, they can alleviate these resources, while ensuring that promotions are being sent to customers that historically interact with offers and that only offers with a high percent success are being sent to them. The increased number of redeemed offers and reduced use of internal resources will maximize Starbucks\u2019 earnings.", "While the initial cleaning was sufficient for our analysis, the data needs to be transformed into a useful and efficient format for training. We will also remove features that are not relevant for our model. The preprocessing steps for each dataset are outlined below:", "The final DataFrame should look like this:", "Split into train and test datasets", "Now let\u2019s split the data into train and test datasets and ensure the model doesn\u2019t overfit the data by evaluating the test data performance metrics.", "The naive classifier assumes that all offers are successful and serves as a base model.

However, the exploratory analysis of user demographics and offer types suggests a non-linear decision boundary. For this reason the ensemble methods, random forest and gradient boosting, will be built and tested next.", "Random forest uses multiple decision trees and trains each tree independently, using a random sample of the data.

Since this isn\u2019t the case, let\u2019s evaluate the two performance metrics to determine the best model for tuning and refinement:", "Since the user data in this analysis is not symmetric, the f1-score will be used to determine the best model. Given the best f1-score, the random forest model will be used as the best model for the remainder of this analysis. This model also makes the most sense since the random forest typically results in very high quality models that are fast to train. Random forest can handle a large amount of training data efficiently and inherently so it is well suited for future use with multi-class problems given big data from Starbucks\u2019 18.9 million active users.", "Let\u2019s tune our random forest model by first building a DataFrame that ranks all models by performance. From this dataset, let\u2019s print the model\u2019s best hyperparameters.", "With this information, we can refine our model using the \u2018best\u2019 hyperparameters:", "Let\u2019s see the refined random forest model\u2019s hyperparameters:", "Lastly, we should evaluate test data performance to ensure that the random forest model data did not overfit the training data:", "The test data accuracy of 0.695 and f1-score of 0.797 suggests that the random forest model constructed did not overfit the training data.", "Customer spending is greater with increasing age and income. It might be worth exploring whether Starbucks should increase the frequency of promotions based on age and salary. Since females spend more than all other genders, it would also be interesting to explore the reasoning behind these higher numbers.", "Since the top three features are associated with customer offers, the model could be improved by creating features that describe an offer\u2019s success rate as a function of offer duration, difficulty, and reward. The addition of these features should construct a better decision boundary, separating successful and unsuccessful customer offers, returning a model with more reliable performance metrics.", "There\u2019s a reason why companies like Starbucks are focused on building world-class AI and ML capabilities. In this particular case, machine learning models used to distribute personalized promotions increases the odds of offer conversion and reduces the cost of labor, which in turn maximizes profits. Starbucks\u2019 implementation of AI increasingly powers their personalization engine, optimizes store labor allocations, and drives inventory management. Starbucks is constantly implementing changes as seen in their most recent loyalty program update, which offers more ways to pay and earn rewards, making it easier for customers to get their next free cup of coffee.", "Whether you\u2019re a loyal Starbucks consumer or a coffee aficionado unable to fathom the PSL\u2019s 17-year position within the zeitgeist, consider what prompted you to purchase from the coffee giant during your next visit.", "Your home for data science.
