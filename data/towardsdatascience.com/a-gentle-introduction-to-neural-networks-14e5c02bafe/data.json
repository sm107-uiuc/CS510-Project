As a former researcher I like to keep myself up to date with what is new in the research community and I love to write. I have been struggling to do that lately until I came up with an idea: what if I force myself to read and investigate more by forcing myself to write? So I came up with this idea of starting from scratch, delve into the history of the neural nets field, from the basics until the complex neural network architectures that are being applied today. This series has two personal challenges for me: filling missing gaps in knowledge (I am pretty sure I don\u2019t know everything), and making sure I can start one idea and taking it to the end without giving up.", "I decided to name this chapter as Chapter 0 because in this article I\u2019m only going to explain the first historical steps in the field, why neural networks exist, what are they used for and what are the bridges between neurobiology and computer science.", "Neural networks are an Artificial Intelligence connectionist approach that are able to learn how to perform pattern recognition or process controlling tasks without being explicitly programmed for that. Some examples of neural network applications can be (1) controlling the temperature of a room, (2) recognising faces in a picture/video, (3) generating text sequences. They are inspired by the way our brains work, by connecting and causing the interaction between multiple basic entities towards a final goal. These entities are called neurons (as per the whole resemblance between these algorithms and the way our brain works). Neurons can interact with other neurons depending on the way they are connected to each other and how strong their connection is.", "Biologically speaking, a neuron is composed by 3 main parts: the dendrites, the nucleus/cell body and the axon. Its full structure is depicted in figure 1.", "Dendrites receive information from other neurons in the form of an electrical pulse. The cell body is the place where the inputs coming from the dendrites are received and processed. The result of this processing is then conducted through the axon until it reaches the terminals (the synapses). The information is then passed to another dendrites\u2019 neuron through a chemical process known as synaptic process. Throughout human life many neurons are created and die, many connections between neurons are created while others cease to exist (this is an oversimplification but it gives you an idea of our brains\u2019 dynamics).", "According to the Hebbian theory, the strength of these connections will be bigger when the synaptic process between them occurs repeatedly. In other words, the more two neurons fire together, the stronger the connection between them will be. On the other hand, if two neurons never get fired together, their connection gets weaker. This rule is known as Hebb\u2019s Rule.", "Some see Hebb\u2019s Rule as a form of classic conditioning (also known as Pavlovian learning). Classic conditioning is a form of associative learning applied to stimuli. The idea is to link two stimuli together so that they can share the same response. In Pavlov\u2019s experiment, the person who had the concept named after him, he trained his dogs by giving them food while ringing a bell at the same time. Because dogs would start to salivate once they were given food, after repeating this food-bell association a reasonable amount of times his dogs started to salivate once they heard the bell ringing. The same goes for Hebbian Learning: if an eventual neuron that represents \u2018getting food\u2019 is associated with the salivation response, and if the connection between \u2018hearing bell\u2019 neuron and \u2018getting food\u2019 neuron is stimulated so that it gets stronger, then at some point firing the \u2018hearing bell\u2019 neuron can be enough to cause the same salivation response.", "In 1943 McCulloch and Pitts proposed a mathematical model which was able to capture these biological features of neurons. The schema of this mathematical model of a neuron is depicted in Figure 2. This one is known as McCulloch-Pitts neuron.", "Three components arise from the McCulloch-Pitts neuron:", "I have now explained all about how the most basic neural network works. But is it really all? You have now understood how the network computes its output/prediction/result based on external inputs or sensors from the environment, but where is the learning process described in this explanation? The answer is: nowhere! The way the neural network learns is by finding the right values for the vector w, the ones that will increase the number of times the network guessed correctly the answer based on the inputs provided. The vector w is pretty much what is \u2018internal\u2019 in the neural network, so trying different values for it is what we can do to train a network. So how are these weights w modified in order to improve the quality of the network? I am going to talk about this in my next chapter: the perceptron network. Stay tuned!", "Thanks for reading!
