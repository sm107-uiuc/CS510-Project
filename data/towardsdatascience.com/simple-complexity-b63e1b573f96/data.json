A close questions as I experienced a long series of delays and breakdowns today as well as how it was handled firsthand.", "Earlier today on the 15th of September a tree fell over the train tracks between Kristiansand and Oslo in Norway. It was a Sunday and the conductor seemed relatively optimistic as I boarded the train. One train had tried to go past without any luck, but maybe the fault would be fixed. It turned out not to be the case.", "After going half way between Kristiansand and Oslo the train stopped at a small station in the middle of nowhere. In this station there was only one room of 20-30 square meters available with about 200 people outside in the cold Norwegian Autumn weather. You could hear the murmuring of people broken up by an automated voice message announcing signal failures or delayed times.", "Apparently the train company had no buses available as they had subcontracted this out to other smaller vendors around the country. However these subcontractors were not obliged to deliver and there was a confusion between the company running the station as well as the tracks and those owning the trains.", "I tried to talk to the staff, but they said it was another company who was at fault, they were there to look after the station, not the trains nor the passengers. I decided to call up the service line, however the person there knew even less than what was announced at the station in terms of delays or updates. The support company was seemingly a different company to those who were running the trains or those who were responsible for the station. Three companies: Vy with the train; BaneNor with the station; and Entur with the customer support.", "The support company that I came into conversation with was not there to take any feedback either, that was according to the person I talked to irresponsible because it could be confusing. I mentioned that it would be good if they had drivers ready in case of emergency, and she said she was unable to note this down or take it through her supervisor. I mentioned there were kids and elderly people who had not eaten. I had met an old woman who was on her way to the hospital to get something checked she believed to be urgent. She still said she could do nothing to help or notify anyone, she was just in customer service and had no control over the situation on the ground.", "The support company that I wanted to talk to had taken 40 minutes wait time to reach. 40 minutes for a human voice. Then in our conversation the person from support asked me for a few seconds to talk to her supervisor and subsequently proceeded to hang up without calling me back. I called back up and had to queue for 30 minutes until arriving to speak with the same person again. She had no further information.", "By this time four hours after the train had stranded in the middle of nowhere I started wondering what these companies were doing, how they cared or if they cared at all. Later in the night a person arrived and they managed to get a few taxis to come and I was lucky to get a spot on a taxi, of course after the families with children or sick had been prioritised.", "This situation made me wonder about companies that delegate responsibility without anyone responsible. A guard room was placed next door that no one was let into, 200 people in cold weather. Robot voice on the monitor. Someone on their way to the hospital waiting; children that had no food; elderly people with nowhere to sit or rest. Nobody walked around to people for consolation or to give information, everything was conveyed across a loudspeaker with conflicting messages and plenty of automations. There was even an automated message that went out to all passengers that was wrong due to a missed update or a glitch at which point everyone ran out to go back in again.", "It has been widely discussed that the field of artificial intelligence cannot do simple tasks that require common sense in a changing environment. Reinforcement learning can adapt to set environments (such as games or certain rooms or patterns) and perhaps somewhat to environments that change if enough computing power or data is provided. Although I doubt the train companies were using reinforcement learning.", "Artificial intelligence in most situations cannot be \u2018caring\u2019 in the way a human can be other than expressing caring actions in this manner. Oddly enough the systems that were built up in this situation did not allow the humans in the loop to act \u2018human\u2019 as regulations or internal expectations stated otherwise. As such even if we do have human in the loop it does not necessitate a humane way of dealing with a given situation.", "Even if a message had gone out to all the taxi companies in the area automatically the moment a certain waiting time had passed (if waiting time > 3 hours send taxis) they could even have decided to fix a bus earlier. This does seem like a savings exercise or optimisation for decreasing expenses incurred in this type of situation. People had to actively claim for food, taxis or any other expenses that would likely not get paid straight away \u2014 it was not provided freely. Some people additionally called up their own family members or friends to pick them up. Few were so lucky to have anyone available to pick them up or expected the companies they had bought the tickets from to be responsible for transportation.", "If the automatic response is the pathway of least cost to the company and the highest possible cost to the citizen attempting to move around the country it is somewhat problematic even if algorithms were to be involved. If having staff ready for these type of emergencies is too costly and wagering that some people will be too lazy to claim the expenses it seems like both an irresponsible bet and dangerous, possibly deadly in certain situations. There were people there who could not afford to shell out money for a taxi to Oslo and wait for a while to hopefully recover this expense.", "There was no feedback system in the support either, simply a person on the other end attempting to appease you with some basic information that may not even be recent enough to matter much. No algorithms in the world could help a situation that was wrongly optimised or when no/little preparation was made to handle such a situation.", "It was not optimised for a reasonable response time to a failure in the system. I understand it may be harder in other areas and that there are larger issues, yet it would be fascinating to consider which other tasks we optimise for. Process automation and predictive maintenance may mot be optimal in certain cases. It depend on those who defines the variables or statements in such conditions. Would it be quicker if it was winter? When should the unexpected be expected?", "200 people outside in minus degrees with no buses in sight and no food, as opposed to almost the same just in Autumn as was the case here. We optimise for speed or cost, in Intel machines this may have lead to a vulnerability in the hardware with speculative execution. Speed being more important than security, which they hoped few would notice.", "In this case of the train ride cost seemed on the surface to be an overarching factor, as well as confusion regarding the responsibility or involvement of different actors. Perhaps even more how a situation was less human and more automated, less informed and more reactionary. Even with humans not very human \u2014 alienating or devoid of a demonstration of understanding or wanting to understand those present.", "On a more positive note I got to learn more Python programming on my phone with the game Programming Hero while sitting on the ground in the waiting room. It made me think about how programming could help in this situation, but also apparently what it did not or could not help with. When a train breaks down I want more than an automated message and humans that are not present in the moment. It may not be unthinkable that infrastructure that serves citizens on the Internet has similar failures such as the one I experienced with the train. How would you like to be handled when infrastructure breaks down?", "This is day 104 of #500daysofAI. My current focus for day 101\u2013200 is mostly on Python programming.
