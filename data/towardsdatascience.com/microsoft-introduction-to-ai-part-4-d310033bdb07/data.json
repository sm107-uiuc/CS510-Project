Fortunately, my curiosity overcame my fear so I\u2019ve started to do a few courses related to AI. I recently completed the Microsoft Introduction to AI course and wrote course notes to help me retain the knowledge that I have learned. I have tried to write these notes in a basic way to make them easy to consume. I\u2019ve recently become an aunt and have bought a few children\u2019s books related to technology and space and really love how the authors and illustrators have managed to simplify complicated topics.

The course is free without a certificate however, if you\u2019d like a certificate as proof of completion there is a fee. There are labs associated with this course which I won\u2019t include in the notes as I believe the best way to learn is to actually do the labs. However, these notes are useful if you\u2019d like to know about the fundamental theory behind AI and would like to learn it in a way that might be a lot simpler than other resources.

For many of us that\u2019s our go-to form of contact. Now bots are AI agents that communicate using these types of channels enabling a natural conversational engagement with software services through the same communication channels you use with other humans. In 1950 Alan Turing devised the imitation game which has become known as the Turing test and hypotheses that if a dialog is natural enough you may not know whether you\u2019re conversing with a human or a computer. As AI grows ever more sophisticated, this is becoming a reality.", "Microsoft bot framework provides a platform for building and publishing bots. You can use the bot builder SDK or the Azure bot service to create your bot and publish it as a web service. You can make your bot available through one or more channels such as Skype or other popular messaging and social media platforms. The bot connector service handles the message exchange between your bot and the channels through which users engage with it. Each interaction is an activity that can be a message or a visual element such as a card that contains images buttons or input field. When a user starts a dialogue with a bot the activities are routed between the channel and the bot automatically. You can also integrate your bot with cognitive services so it can respond intelligently to user input.", "Well let\u2019s take a look at creating a basic bot using the Azure Bot Service. So here we are in the Azure portal and we\u2019re going to create a new web app bot. To do that we just need to add a new resource to your account. We could go and find it in AI & Cognitive Services or just go and simply search for bot. In the search results there is a web app bot and we\u2019re going to create one of these.", "So the first thing our bot needs is a name and in this example we\u2019re going to call it \u201cShoutyBot\u201d. There\u2019s a few other things we\u2019ve got to fill in here. We\u2019re going to create a resource group for it just to manage all the related resources together. We need to choose where we want to deploy that, so we\u2019re just going to pick the data center that\u2019s nearest. We then need to choose the the pricing tier for this bot and there\u2019s a number of pricing options available. In this example we are going to use the free one. Then we need to give it an app name, it\u2019s going to create an Azure web app to support this bot, so we have an app name there for it which just takes the same name as the bot in this case.", "Now we\u2019re going to choose the template on which we want to base our bot and there\u2019s a number of different templates that you can use depending on the type of bot you want to build. We\u2019ll simply use the Node.JS basic bot template to generate some simple Node.JS code to create a very simple bot. Next is carrying on setting up these settings.", "We\u2019ve chosen the free tier so we won\u2019t be paying anything but we still need to set up a service plan, so we\u2019ll set that up.", "Once we\u2019ve done that it\u2019s going to create a storage account to store some of the data that\u2019s used by the bot, it\u2019s automatically generated a name for that so we don\u2019t need to make any changes if we are happy with that. Then it\u2019s going to create some application insights so that we can track the usage of the bot. So that\u2019s all the settings we need to create. We\u2019ll just go ahead and create our bot.", "It will go ahead and validate those settings and make sure that we\u2019re ready to go. Then once it\u2019s validated them it\u2019s going to go off and start creating our bot. When deployment has succeeded, we get a little message to say that our bot has been created. If we go and have a look at the resource groups that we have in the Azure subscription, we can see they\u2019ve got a resource group called ShoutyBot.", "If we have a look in there we can see all the different resources that are associated with our bot. So they\u2019re all going to be managed together in this resource group and the bot itself is the first one listed here \u201cShoutyBot\u201d.", "So we\u2019ll go and take a look at that and there\u2019s a number of pages here in this that we can use to go and configure and work with our bot. The first thing we\u2019re going to do is go to this Build page and that will let us access an online code editor.", "Now we can edit the code for our bot online in the browser or we could work with it locally using in any IDE, like visual studio or something similar. We can download the code as a zip file and synchronise that and even configure something called continuous deployment. So we could have our code in a source control system and synchronise that with the actual bot online. In this example we\u2019re going to use the online code editor so we\u2019ll open up that and that takes us to this online environment. We currently don\u2019t have a readme file \u2014 there\u2019s no readme file created for this one; but what we can do is go and start looking at the code for our bot which is in this app.js JavaScript file. There\u2019s some some basic code that\u2019s been put together to work with our bot on the Microsoft Bot Framework and here\u2019s the bit where the bot actually responds to whenever we send in some sort of message.", "This is where the code to send the response is and you can see it\u2019s very simple \u2014 it\u2019s just one function that just simply says \u201cYou said\u201d and it repeats back whatever it was that the user said to the bot.", "Now that\u2019s not terribly useful, so we\u2019re going to make a slight modification to it just to prove that we can. This isn\u2019t really going be any more useful but at least we\u2019ll see that it does something. So we\u2019re going to change that to uppercase. So what we\u2019ve now done is written the code so that whenever we say something to the bot, it\u2019s going to shout it back to us in uppercase.", "So we\u2019ve done that we can now go and just close this code editor and go back to our bot in the Azure portal. What we\u2019re going to do is test this bot in web chat. We\u2019ll just click Test in Web Chat and when the bot\u2019s ready to test, we can just go and simply type a message. We should get a response from ShoutyBot shouted back in uppercase \u2014 hello. So you can see it\u2019s easy enough to create a very simple bot. Just simply create the settings in the Azure portal, then make a minor modification to the code and we get a custom message back.", "What we could do now is deploy this bot as a web bot on on a web page for people to use. We can see that if we look in Channels, there is this web chat code here. We can edit this channel here to get the secret keys and the code that we would require to embed that bot in a web page and make it available for people to use. So we very simply put together a bot and deployed that using the Azure Bot Service.", "So we\u2019ve seen how to create a simple bot using the Bot framework and we\u2019re ready now to try and use that through various different channels. So here\u2019s our Shoutybot that we created previously and we\u2019ve already had a look at the web chat channel where we can get the code to embed that bot into a web page. There\u2019s a whole bunch of other channels we could use as well such as Cortana, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Bing or even email. So we could use any of these options here to create a way for users to communicate with our bot in the way that they would communicate with other people for example by sending a Skype message or making a call.", "So we\u2019ve seen how to build a basic bot and connect it to a channel however to make your bot useful you\u2019re going to need to put some sort of intelligence behind it. You can integrate your bot with cognitive services to understand natural language as text, speech, analyse images or videos. You can even use it to search the web for relevant information, provide specialist information and advice based on a knowledge base. Of course you can combine these capabilities to create sophisticated conversation based AI experiences and enable a natural way for users and software to work together.", "We\u2019ve seen how to create a basic bot and how to use the Microsoft bot framework to allow users to connect to that bot over multiple channels, although the bot we\u2019ve created isn\u2019t all that useful. Really what we need is some sort of AI service behind the bot that\u2019s going to provide something of value that users actually want to work with. So we\u2019re going to create a very simple example using a cognitive service called the QnA Service. Let\u2019s take a look at how we can do that.", "So here we are in the QnA Maker website and this is the portal where we can use our QnA service to create knowledge bases that we could use in our bot. So we\u2019re going to take a look at creating a new knowledge base and there\u2019s a three-step process for this. The first step is to create an instance of the QnA service in our Microsoft Azure subscription.", "So we\u2019ll go ahead and do that and click create QnA service. It will open up another tab and logs us into the Azure portal. Then we can go ahead and create a new Q&A maker service. So we\u2019ll give it a unique name \u201cQnAJokes\u201d because it\u2019s going contain a knowledge base with some fairly terrible jokes, apologies for that. We\u2019re going to choose the subscription we want to create it in and the management pricing tier for for hosting that service. In this example we are just going to choose the free tier for that so that that\u2019s going to allow us to develop it. We\u2019ll have some restrictions but it lets develop it for free. We\u2019ll create a resource group for that just call that QnAJokes and we will also have to choose the search pricing tier. We have a separate pricing tier for when the knowledge base is searched and again we\u2019ll just choose the free tier for that because that\u2019ll do it for developing it. We\u2019ll store it in the West US data center and then we need to create our a web app for this \u2014 an Azure app for that for our QnAJokes. We\u2019ll have some app insights so that we can analyse what\u2019s going on with this service and we\u2019ll store those in a central location. So we\u2019ll go ahead and click create and it\u2019ll validate those settings. Then it will go off and provision our QnA Maker service and the web app to host it.", "Then when our QnA service has been deployed we can go back to my QnA Maker here. We\u2019re just going to refresh the page so that we get all the information about the QnA Maker that we actually have deployed and it\u2019s going to list the the QnA services that we have available here. So step two is connecting our knowledge base that we\u2019re about to create to the QnA service we\u2019ve just deployed. So we\u2019re going to use our Microsoft Azure directory ID, we\u2019re going to specify the subscription in which we created the service. So we\u2019re creating a new knowledge base that it\u2019s going to service that QnA service.", "Then we need to give this knowledge base a name so we just call this \u2018Jokebook\u2019.", "Now we\u2019re ready to go and populate our knowledge base and if we had an existing FAQ site on our website or if we had a file with FAQs we could go ahead and use those to populate it. Or we could go ahead and just create our knowledge base manually, which is what we\u2019re going to do for this example.", "So we\u2019ll say create your KB, we\u2019re ready to go and start creating the questions and answers that we want to have in our knowledge base. Now initially there\u2019s nothing in it so we\u2019re going to go and add a QnA pair. Our question that we\u2019re going to ask is \u201cwhy did the chicken cross the road\u201d and the answer that goes with that is \u201cto get to the other side\u201d. So we got our our response there and we\u2019ll go ahead and add another QnA pair. So we could have a question like \u201cwhat\u2019s red and invisible\u201d and the answer to that one is \u201cno tomatoes\u201d. Then finally we\u2019re going to add something here so that when somebody first interacts with the the knowledge base they\u2019re going to say \u201chello\u201d and the response that is going to be \u201chello\u201d. It\u2019s not really a question answer it\u2019s just a way of interacting and getting an appropriate response. So we\u2019ve got those values added in there, we\u2019ll go ahead and save and train the knowledge base.", "So after it\u2019s been trained we can go ahead and test it. We just simply type in a message \u201chello\u201d and get back the appropriate response \u201chello\u201d. \u201cWhy did the chicken cross the road\u201d and I get back the appropriate response\u201c \u201dto get to the other side\u201d. So my knowledge base is working. I\u2019m getting back the appropriate responses.", "That all seems reasonable so we\u2019re ready to go and publish this rather simple knowledge base so that we could use it in a bot or an application. So I\u2019ll go ahead and click publish.", "To publish it it\u2019s going to move the QnAs from the test index into a production index so that we can actually access it from our bot that we\u2019re going to create. So we\u2019ll go ahead and publish. That goes and deploys our knowledge base into my QnA maker web service. We can actually see a sample request that we would use to go and connect to that and use it. It\u2019s got various bits of information, various keys in this URL that we\u2019re going to need when we try and connect a bot that we\u2019re going to build later on to the service.", "Well I\u2019ve created a QnA knowledge base and we can use it as the back end for a bot. So now we just need to go ahead and create that bot. Well here we are in the Azure portal ready to create our bot. So we\u2019ll just go ahead and add a new web app bot.", "When we create our bot we have to give it a name, so we\u2019re going to call it \u2018BadJokes\u2019. We\u2019ll put it into the appropriate subscription that we want to use and we will put it into our existing resource group that we created for our QnA service earlier on. So we\u2019ll put on the West US. We\u2019ll choose the appropriate pricing tier for that and then we need an app name. We\u2019re going to use the appropriate template, we\u2019re going to use a template that\u2019s going to let us use the QnA maker.", "We\u2019ll stick with C# this time just for a change but what we\u2019ll do is go down and choose the question-and-answer template. It\u2019s going to create the app service plan in the West US and it will create some storage for that bot as well and some apps insights. So we\u2019ll go ahead and and choose create and now we\u2019re going to validate those settings.", "It\u2019s going to go off and deploy that new bot, then when the bot has been deployed, we are ready to go and look at that resource. We\u2019ll have to make a few changes before we are ready to use this because we have to connect it to our QnA service. So to do that we\u2019re going to take a look at the application settings for this app service and just load those. If we scroll down a little bit we can see a number of different application settings that we need to use and that are some that are specific to working with the QnA service. We need a QnA authentication key, we need an endpoint host name and we need a knowledge base ID.", "Now all of that information is available to us in the QnA knowledge base that we deployed.", "So those are the three settings we need to connect our bot to our QnA knowledge base. So we\u2019ll go ahead and save those settings and that\u2019s gone ahead and updated those app settings for us. So we\u2019re now ready to go and test our bot. We can just go and test that in the web chat interface.", "Up it comes and we\u2019re ready to start so we can start off just by being polite and saying hello and we get back my response from BadJokes hello. \u201cWhy did the chicken cross the road\u201d and we get the proper response \u201cto the other side\u201d. So we\u2019ve now created a bot and we\u2019ve connected that to our QnA knowledge base. We can then deploy that bot through any of the regular channels the bots can be connected to through and it will use that knowledge base to answer the questions that users submit to it.", "Personal assistants like Cortana are an increasingly popular way for people to keep track of information and automate tasks and all that kind of thing. These AI powered assistants can learn about the things that we care about and they can help simplify our daily lives. Now you can connect a bot that you\u2019ve published with the bot framework to Cortana as a skill. That enables users to interact with your bot through the Cortana interface.", "So here\u2019s the bot we created earlier that\u2019s connected to our Q&A service and what we want to do to use that in Cortana. So if we have a look at the channels for this bot we can see it\u2019s connected to web chat and that\u2019s running just now but we can go ahead and add it to the Cortana channel.", "So if we go ahead and configure that and set ourselves up with an organisation and here we just going to simply register this bot with an organisation. So we\u2019ll go ahead and register. When the bot is registered we can see there that we\u2019ve got Cortana listed in that list of channels. If we now go and have a look in our store portal and look in botlets you can see there\u2019s the BadJokes bot.", "So that\u2019s now been registered as part of this organisation, we can see all sorts of information here about that as a Cortana skill. So what we want to do is go in and have a look at the Publish setting here. Some of the things we can do are give it a name, so badjokes is the name of the skill and give an invocation name \u2014 in other words the the phrase we\u2019re going to use to tell Cortana that this is the service we want to interact with.", "We will go ahead and just publish that out ready to use. Now what that means is if we\u2019re just using our computer as normal and we go to Cortana, we can now say things like \u201cAsk bad jokes why the chicken crossed the road\u201d. Cortana has a think about that and then it recognises that we\u2019re trying to connect to this skill that\u2019s called badjokes.", "In order for it to connect we need to give it some permission, so we\u2019ll say yes share my information with that skill. This only happens the first time and we get the right response \u201cTo get to the other side\u201d. We could then ask a different question of bad jokes, \u201cWhat\u2019s red and invisible?\u201d and we get our response \u201cNo tomatoes\u201d. So we\u2019ve been able to take a bot that we\u2019ve created and we\u2019ve connected it to the Q&A service so we\u2019ve got a knowledge base of questions and answers. Then we\u2019re able to use Cortana as a channel to interact with that and to get information from that interactively by typing in questions or even by speaking.", "Thanks for reading this article Part 4, the last part of the Microsoft Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course.
