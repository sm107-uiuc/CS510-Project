It consists of using knowledge specific to a patient, such as biomarkers, demographics, or lifestyle characteristics, to best treat their ailment, rather than generic, averaged best practices. In the best case, it could leverage the expertise of thousands of practitioners and outcomes from millions of other patients to provide proven, effective care.", "Precision medicine has a number of benefits, both for the patient and physician (adapted from Fr\u00f6hlich):", "The amount of raw data needed to make individualized treatment achievable necessitates machine learning. A previous article of mine covers this, and other applications for machine learning in oncology specifically, as it is likely the closest field to achieving realized results with precision medicine.", "Pharmacogenomics is an entire field dedicated to studying how a patient\u2019s genes affect their response to drugs. This is mostly used to limit adverse drug effects due to prolonged exposure or increased sensitivity, but some drugs require specific genes to be expressed for their target to be available. For example, Herceptin (trastuzumad) targets HER2/neu receptors and consequently that gene must be over-expressed in the patient\u2019s cancer for Herceptin to be prescribed.", "One successful model used genetic data from 800 patients over 10 years at the Mayo Clinic to determine the efficacy of various drugs for easing depressive symptoms. The model was able to achieve 85% accuracy compared to about 55% for psychiatrists, who often have to use trial-and-error with patients to find the most effective drug.", "Other potential avenues for improved care include identifying causal genes, understanding phenotypic and genotypic differences among patients, gene-gene interactions, and novel drug discovery. DeepSEA, a deep learning model developed by Princeton University, has had success in predicting chromatin effects of single nucleotide aberrations in DNA. Models such as these have great potential in their predictive success, but they should also illuminate mechanistic relationships between genotypes, disease diagnosis, treatment options, etc.", "While these various approaches to precision medicine are exciting and are actively being explored, there are still many challenges to be overcome. You should read this article for a more in depth examination, but some points are summarized below.", "First, we often hear \u201cAh, if we only had more data then our model would be better\u201d, but this does not capture the reality, especially in medicine, that data quality is often passed over in favor of data quantity. Colloquially, garbage in, garbage out. While a lot of data is often necessary, that data must have underlying patterns that can separate noise from signal. As Fr\u00f6hlich notes, some noise is error from sampling (not useful) and some is biological variation (very useful), but neither we nor our models can differentiate between them.", "Second, while our models can discover novel patterns in data and even provide very accurate predictions on new examples, they cannot prove causal relationships. It is this specific quality that makes them amazingly useful tools and not a real substitution for the scientific method. Modern media loves to describe \u201cAI\u201d as a replacement for any and every job or task when it simply cannot be. See the less-than-ideal implementation of IBM\u2019s Watson.", "Third, a predictive model lives by its performance on unseen data. This is the rationale behind train/test splits, cross-validation, data augmentation, etc. If a model does not generalize well then it is not very useful. What makes deploying precision medicine models is that the implications of poor performance can be great. We must be aware of the ethical pitfalls of validating our models with the health of unaware patients. Therefore, expensive clinical trials are still needed to substantiate the model and show how it improves care, if at all.", "Precision medicine has an exciting future for improving care according to a patient\u2019s specific phenotypes and genome. Specific models are achieving success in drug discovery, treatment efficacy, guiding diagnoses, and much more. IBM\u2019s Watson general AI has even been incorporated into a small number of oncology departments around the world, though with mixed results. Indeed, the challenges facing machine learning for precision medicine are varied and obstinate. But hey, creating the future is never easy.", "[1] Forbes Insights Team, How Machine Learning Is Crafting Precision Medicine (2019), Forbes Insights.", "[3] M. Uddin, Y. Wang and M.
