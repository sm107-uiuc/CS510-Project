Equality. Data.", "paragraph_index": 32}], "all_paragraphs": ["Data has been referred to as the oil, blood vessel, or cornerstone of business nowadays. Someone has also described data as the diamond of our era. However, it is a very unequally distributed asset. Some technology giants, like Facebook, Google, and Amazon, are considered the behemoths of data who know everything about each and every one of us. Their entire business models are based on the data about individual users of their products: identities, location data, online purchases, and transaction history, even personal preferences.", "The size data marketplace is hard to quantify. Some major online service platforms spend billions of dollars annually to acquire customer data from third parties. The value of data exchanges among online services companies is determined based on various parameters, such as demographics, personal identity details, family status, financial details, and individual activities.", "Basic data about an individual (e.g., age, gender, and location) is worth merely $0.0005 per person (that is $0.50 per thousand people). Financial details about an individual (such as recent payments history or health details) are slightly more valuable. In the case of Facebook, the average value of an active user\u2019s data to Facebook is about $2 per month.", "Another indication of the value of users\u2019 data to companies could be found in the settlement between the FTC and Equifax. In July 2019, Equifax agreed to pay $525 million in compensation for the 2017 data breach, which exposed the personal information (names, birthdays, addresses, social security numbers, etc.) of 147 million individuals. This settlement amount means that each individual would be entitled to a minimum payout of $125.", "Financial Times has prepared an interactive calculator which helps to calculate the value of an individual\u2019s data to a marketer. This calculator provides an opportunity to take a closer into what information marketers collect: demographics, family background, net worth, health condition, purchases online, as well as activities. It does not, however, encompass thousands of more specific details that marketers gather to profile individuals. (Do not be surprised when you find out that your private data might be worth less than a dollar).", "Even if one individual\u2019s data is worth very little to companies, you may have a slightly different perspective on how much your personal information is worth to you. This is especially true when it comes to critical data such as personal details, birth date, social security numbers, not to mention personal financial information and health records.", "Yet, how is it possible to estimate the actual value of personal data to every individual? Some helpful methods could be found in the literature and empirical studies conducted by economists who study human behavior and decision-making. One of the most frequently used methods to estimate how much a certain item is worth to you is to ask two questions:", "Example #1: coffee mugs. An \u201ceasy\u201d illustration of the willingness to pay and the willingness to accept could be a coffee mug. In one experiment, participants were given a $6 mug and then offered the chance to sell it or trade it for an equally valued alternative (pens). It turned out that once participants of the experiment established that they owned the mug, their willingness to sell the mug was approximately twice as high as the amount they were willing to pay to acquire it. (In other words, the willingness to accept and willingness to pay ratio was 2:1.)", "Example #2: tickets. Another \u201charder\u201d example relates to sold-out event tickets. Suppose you hold a ticket to a sold-out NCAA Final Four tournament, which you bought for $200. You are an avid fan of one of the teams and you would have been willing to pay up to $500 for that ticket. Now you learn on the Internet that more affluent or more desperate fans are offering $3,000. Would you sell? If you are one of most of the fans who hold the ticket to a sold-out event, you will not sell. One empirical study conducted by behavioral economists showed that participant\u2019s hypothetical selling price (willingness to accept, WTA) was 14 times higher than their hypothetical buying price (willingness to accept, WTA).", "These two illustrations provide useful lessons on how much value people attribute to different goods. First, the willingness to buy or sell depends on a simple fact: whether an individual owns the item or not. If a person owns the ticket, the decision is influenced by the pain of giving up the ticket. If the person does not own the ticket, then he/she considers the satisfaction of getting one. This is also known as the \u201cprospect theory.\u201d Prospect theory also asserts that individuals prefer to remain as they are \u2014 we think we are better off by not letting go of things we own. This preference for the status quo is a consequence of loss aversion.", "Second, differences in values between the willingness to pay to acquire a mug or a ticket to your favorite game are not the same as the value you might want to receive for giving away the item you already own. This is because of loss aversion: giving up a ticket is more painful than getting an equally good ticket.", "Third, willingness to pay and willingness to accept highlight the contrast between different categories of goods: namely, goods held for exchange (e.g., your budget to buy shoes) and goods held for use (e.g., tickets). Also, WTP and WTA make it quite obvious that different individuals frequently tend to assign different value to identical goods.", "It is possible to apply the same WTP-WTA methodology to determine how much value people attribute to their private data. In July, two Harvard scholars, Angela Winegar and Cass Sunstein, published the results of their study where 2,416 individuals were asked a series of questions on how much they value their personal data privacy.", "The primary finding was simple: the average participant is willing to pay relatively little ($5 per month) for privacy but demands much more ($80 per month) to give up privacy. More particularly, participants were asked how much they were willing to pay to protect their data privacy in general and their demographic, identity and health and wellness data (willingness to pay, WTP). They were also asked how much they would be willing to be compensated for giving away their data privacy (willingness to accept, WTA). Here are their findings:", "It should be noted that in the Winegar/Sunstein study, 63 respondents provided exceptionally high (greater than $25,000 per month) valuations of their data privacy. Twenty-eight stated that their WTA was $1M or more per month, and three said their WTP was $1M or more per month. The numbers in the table above are based on the adjustment that Winegar/Sunstein made by standardizing responses by capping WTP and WTA responses greater than $25,000 to $25,000 because the authors deemed it unlikely that participants would actually be willing and able to pay this amount.", "A recent study conducted in summer of 2022 showed that that individual consumers put an exceptionally high price tag on their data. Personal data is given the biggest value in these five US states:", "In the behavioral economics literature, the finding that people are more likely to retain an object they own than acquire that same object when they do not own it is described as the \u201cendowment effect.\u201d This notion term was coined by Nobel Prize winner Richard Thaler in 1980, who noted that when people face a choice between retaining the status quo and accepting an alternative to it, they will favor the less risky choice of staying where they are. The examples of coffee mugs and event tickets are classical illustrations of the endowment effect.", "The 16:1 ratio in the case of personal data identified by Winegar/Sunstein is extremely high. In fact, it is among the highest TWP-WTA ratios known in the literature. Other examples of noticeable discrepancies between the willingness to pay and willingness to accept have been noticed in the case of, e.g., environmental goods, such as the protection of endangered species (10:1) or clean air.", "Nobel prize economist Daniel Kahneman once noted that \u201cyour reluctance to \u2018sell\u2019 important endowments increases dramatically when doing so might make you responsible for an awful outcome\u201d. This appears to be especially true with regard to data privacy. Winegar/Sunstein suggest that 16:1 ratio indicates the \u2018super-endowment effect\u2019 of data privacy.", "One of the possible reasons why respondents in the Winegar/Sunstein study are willing to pay only $5 for getting their privacy could be the belief that they already own their data. And the reason why the price for giving access to their data is multiple times higher (willingness to accept) is that people attribute great value to their personal data. Furthermore, the mere idea that someone could access their private data seems outrageous \u2014 thus, extremely high numbers of willingness to accept.", "Another possible factor to consider is whether people actually understand what personal data is collected online. Without understanding what data is being collected by third parties, it isn\u2019t easy to attribute actual value to one\u2019s personal data. Thus, one may wonder whether WTP-WTA analysis is appropriate.", "It is also frequently indicated that people do not really care about their private data and data privacy. The $5 willingness-to-pay finding by Winegar/Sunstein supports this assumption. However, from a behavioral economics point of view, two additional points may shed light and help better understand this paradigm. First, people may feel overly optimistic and hope their personal data will not be misused. Second, concerning choices about whether to give up data privacy, consumers might undervalue the long-term risks and emphasize the short-term gain, including access to social media platforms and websites (\u201cpresent bias\u201d).", "So this is where we are now. Recently adopted regulations such as GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California add momentum to the discussion about the value of personal data and how to make the use of personal data fair.", "One of the unfortunate consequences of the current dominance of GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon) in consumer markets is that individuals have very little control over how such platform operators access and use data. Theoretically, we have the right to know what data about platform operators and app developers access and collect, how they use it, and whether they share those data with anyone else. We can also request that they stop tracking us or even delete all the data they have about us.", "Some companies help consumers exercise their data privacy rights. Since the adoption of the GDPR, we have seen the growth of various services that help consumers manage their consent. Such services would show how many companies and data brokers are tracking you and collecting your data (for an average consumer, the number of such companies usually exceeds several hundred. For example, here below is a screenshot of SayMine, one of the companies that could help me \u201ccontrol\u201d my data. You can see that as of today, 517 (!) service providers and data brokers track my activities online:", "From the screenshot above, you can also notice that I have not exercised any of the tools offered by this service (partly because I have already adjusted my phone and laptop tracking settings so that minimum information about me is exposed).", "But the real question is how do we empower consumers with their data? Is there a way to move beyond a short-term and transactional approach to user-generated data and create an environment where your data becomes an asset that generates you a long-term value?", "When we think about the future of the data economy, we should not try to reinvent the wheel. In fact, in the early days of the internet, one of the main ideas was that it was a decentralized network of computers operated by different users. Here\u2019s the early vision of Steve Jobs and the people Apple:", "\u201cWhen Apple was founded, the proposition was, \u2018This is the personal computer. This is your own data.\u2019 \u2026 As the world has evolved, [we] have continued to think \u2026 that the data that you create, the things you do with your computer \u2013 those are yours and should be under your control. You should be aware of what\u2019s happening with your data.\u201d \u2014 Craig Federighi (Apple)", "So when we think about the next iteration of the internet (Web 3.0, if you want), we should get back to the beginnings and reimagine how the value from data could be captured on the user\u2019s side. One possible practical implementation is the user-centric, user-held data approach where users can collect their data in their personal data cloud and get daily value from their own data:", "In the user-centric, user-held data environment, individuals can collect their data from different data sources \u2014 not only your online accounts (like Netflix or Google activity histories), but also live data from your wearable devices. In the emerging user-held data ecosystem, you will be able to download applications that run on top of your data (i.e., in your personal data cloud, not in some centralized server).", "The most interesting developments are happening in the area of generating value from your wearable devices: what if you could combine data from different devices and get unique insights about your health, trends and improve your habits to live more healthy and happy lives?", "I am a co-foudner of data technology company Prifina.
