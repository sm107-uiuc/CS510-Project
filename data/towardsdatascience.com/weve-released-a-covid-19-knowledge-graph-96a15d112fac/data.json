This first release includes entities extracted from Covid-19 papers, and from additional datasets including, proteins, genes, disease-gene associations, coronavirus proteins, protein expression, biological pathways, and drugs.", "For example, by querying for the virus SARS-CoV-2, we can find the associated human protein, proteasome subunit alpha type-2 (PSMA2), a component of the proteasome, implicated in SARS-CoV-2 replication, and its encoding gene (PSMA2). Additionally, we can identify the drug carfilzomib, a known inhibitor of the proteasome that could therefore be researched as a potential treatment for patients with Covid-19. To support the plausibility of this association and its implications, we can easily identify papers in the Covid-19 literature where this protein has been mentioned.", "By examining these specific relationships and their attributes, we are directed to the data sources, including publications. This will help researchers to efficiently study the mechanisms of coronaviral infection, the immune response, and help to find targets for the development of treatments or vaccines more efficiently.", "Our team currently consists of a partnership between GSK, Oxford PharmaGenesis and Vaticle", "For this first release, we\u2019ve integrated CORD-19 papers with publicly available annotated molecular datasets. BioGrakn Covid is free to access via GCP. You can query it using Workbase:", "You can also connect programmatically using one of the Grakn clients (link). Use the IP address, port and keyspace as specified above.", "The migration scripts and schemas are available on Github: https://github.com/graknlabs/biograkn-covid", "To see the schema file, you can find this here.", "Currently, the datasets we\u2019ve integrated include:", "We plan to add many more datasets!", "Some queries we can run include:", "Return drugs that are associated with genes, which have been mentioned in the same paper as the gene which is associated with SARS.", "BioGrakn Covid includes a few rules that allow us to infer relations between data. This is particularly useful where not all the data is complete. For example, the source data for BioGrakn Covid doesn\u2019t include direct connections between drugs and proteins. However, we can infer this from connections between genes and drugs, and proteins and genes.
