A quantum bit (called a qubit), by contrast, can be in a state of superposition. The quantum superposition is a linear combination of 0 and 1. But the qubit can only be in a superposition as long as you don\u2019t measure it. Once you measure your qubit, it instantly collapses to either 0 or 1. Just like a classical bit.", "In this post, we have a closer look at the quantum superposition and how its state determines whether we will measure the qubit as 0 or 1.", "There are two possible measurements of a qubit: 0 and 1. Therefore, the qubit is a two-dimensional quantum system. Each dimension is denoted by a standard basis vector. In quantum computing, we use the Dirac notation. It represents a column vector by the ket that looks like \u201c|\u03c8\u27e9\u201d:", "The state of the qubit is represented by the superposition of both dimensions. This is the qubit state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 (\u201cpsi\u201d).", "\u03b1 and \u03b2 are the probability amplitudes of the states |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9. Their squares denote the probabilities of measuring the qubit as 0 (given by \u03b1^2) or 1 (\u03b2^2) respectively.", "Let\u2019s have a look at a graphical representation of the qubit state |\u03c8\u27e9 in the following figure.", "In this representation, both dimensions reside at the vertical axis but in opposite directions. The top and the bottom of the system correspond to the standard basis vectors |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9, respectively.", "When there are two dimensions, the usual way is to put the two dimensions orthogonal to each other. While using one axis to represent both dimensions is rather an unusual representation for a two-dimensional system, it is well suited for a quantum system.", "Look at the arbitrary qubit state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 in this figure above. Since qubit state vectors are normalized, |\u03c8\u27e9 originates in the center and has the magnitude (length) of 1/2. The diameter of the circle is 1. Due to this equal magnitude, all state vectors end at the pointed circle. So does |\u03c8\u27e9.", "The angle between the state vector |0\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u27e9, named \u03b8 (\u201ctheta\u201d), controls the proximities of the vector head to the top and the bottom of the system (dashed lines).", "The proximities \u03b1 and \u03b2 are at the opposite sides of the state\u2019s probability(|\u03c8\u27e9) they describe. \u03b1 is the proximity (or distance) to |1\u27e9 because with increasing distance to |1\u27e9 the probability of measuring 0 increases.", "Thus, by controlling the proximities, the angle \u03b8 also controls the probabilities of measuring the qubit in either state 0 or 1.", "Rather than specifying the relation between \u03b1 and \u03b2 and then coping with normalizing their values, we can specify the angle \u03b8 and use the required normalization to derive \u03b1 and \u03b2 from it.", "We can deduct the values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 and thus the state |\u03c8\u27e9:", "Do you want to derive this formula? Here\u2019s a little hint: Thales\u2019 and the Pythagorean theorems help you here.", "There\u2019s one problem left. For \u03b8\u2208R, what if \u03c0<\u03b8<2\u03c0? Or in plain English, what if the \u03b8 denotes a vector pointing to the left side of the vertical axis?", "The following figure shows this situation.", "Mathematically, we don\u2019t have a problem. Since we square \u03b1 and \u03b2, their signs (+ or \u2212) are irrelevant for the resulting probabilities.", "But what does it mean? How can either \u03b1^2 or \u03b2^2 be negative, as the figure indicates? The answer is i. i is a complex number whose square is negative: i^2=\u22121.", "And if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are complex numbers (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2208C), their squares can be negative.", "This entails a lot of consequences. And it raises a lot of questions. For now, we interpret all vectors on the left-hand side of the vertical axis to have a negative value for \u03b2^2 (\u03b2^2<0).", "While such a value lets us distinguish the qubit state vectors on both sides of the vertical axis, it does not matter for the resulting probabilities.", "yields the same probability of measuring 0 or 1 (50% each). It resides at the horizontal axis. And so does", "Although these states share the same probabilities, they are different. And the angle \u03b8 differentiates between them.", "One of the consequences mentioned above of \u03b1^2 or \u03b2^2 being negative is that our normalization rule needs some adjustments.", "We need to change the normalization equation to:", "This post contains a lot of formulae. The important takeaway is we can specify quantum states that yield certain probabilities of measuring 0 and 1 by an angle \u03b8. It depicts a clear picture to foster understanding and to remember.", "Let\u2019s have a look at how the angle \u03b8 works in Python code.", "In this piece of code, we introduced the function getState (line 5). It takes theta as a parameter and returns the array [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. This is the vector we specified in the equation above. It results in a 50% chance of measuring the qubit is a 0 or a 1 respectively.", "The qubit and its state of superposition are hard to reason about. While math provides a clear definition of what the qubit is and how it behaves, for most of us, formulae alone are not very intuitive. In this post, we presented a visual explanation of the qubit state and how it determines the probabilities of measuring the qubit in either state 0 or 1.", "Having a picture of a concept in front of your eyes not only helps to understand it at all but also promotes the memory of it.", "This post is part of the book: Hands-On Quantum Machine Learning With Python.", "Get the first three chapters for free here.", "Your home for data science.
