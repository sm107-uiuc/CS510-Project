With just a few lines of code, CoreNLP allows for the extraction of all kinds of text properties, such as named-entity recognition or part-of-speech tagging. CoreNLP is written in Java and requires Java to be installed on your device but offers programming interfaces for several popular programming languages, including Python, which I will be using in this demonstration. Additionally, it supports four languages other than English: Arabic, Chinese, German, French, and Spanish.", "First, we have to download CoreNLP. If you\u2019re using a MacBook, open the terminal and enter the following line of code and hit enter:", "This will start the download of CoreNLP\u2019s latest version (3.9.2 as of February 2019). You should see something like this on your screen:", "Downloading CoreNLP will take a while depending on your internet connection. When the download is complete, all that\u2019s left is unzipping the file with the following commands:", "The command mv A B moves file A to folder B or alternatively changes the filename from A to B.", "In order to be able to use CoreNLP, you will have to start the server. Doing so is pretty easy as all you have to do is to move into the folder created in step I and use Java to run CoreNLP. Let\u2019s look at the commands we need for that:", "The cd command opens the folder we created. Then, to run the server, we use Java. The parameter -mx6g specifies the amount of memory that CoreNLP is allowed to use. In this case, it\u2019s six gigabytes. The -timeout 5000 parameter specifies the timeout in milliseconds.", "Now, you should see something like this:", "The number I\u2019ve highlighted is going to be important when using CoreNLP in Python.", "The last thing needed before starting to analyze text is to install a Python API:", "I\u2019m going to use py-corenlp but there are other Python packages that you can check out here. If you should happen to be an avid user of NLTK, there is also an API for NLTK that lets you use CoreNLP. The full instructions can be found here.", "After having finished installing CoreNLP, we can finally start analyzing text data in Python. First, let\u2019s import py-corenlp and initialize CoreNLP. This is where the number I highlighted above comes into play:", "The syntax in NLTK is very similar:", "The rest of this demonstration is going to focus on py-corenlp but you could also use NLTK as pointed out above. The main difference between the two is that in py-corenlp outputs a raw JSON file that you can then use to extract whatever you\u2019re specifically interested in while NLTK provides you with functions that do so for you.", "The only other function needed to conduct NLP using py-corenlp isnlp.annotate() . Inside the function, one can specify what kind of analysis CoreNLP should execute. In this demonstration, I will take a look at four different sentences with different sentiments. All of this can be done in one single line of code but for readability purposes, it\u2019s better to stretch it over several lines.", "The annotators parameter specifies what kind of analyses CoreNLP is going to do. In this case, I\u2019ve specified that I want CoreNLP to do sentiment analysis as well as named-entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging. The JSON output format will allow me to easily index into the results for further analysis.", "Sentiment analysis with CoreNLP is very straightforward. After having run the code chunk above, no further computation is needed. Let\u2019s look at the results for the four sentences defined above:", "Running this for-loop outputs the results of the sentiment analysis:", "The scale for sentiment values ranges from zero to four. Zero means that the sentence is very negative while four means it\u2019s extremely positive. As you can see, CoreNLP did a very good job. The first sentence is tricky since it includes positive words like \u2018funny\u2019 or \u2018witty\u2019, however, CoreNLP correctly realized that they are negated. The easier sentences were classified correctly too.", "Another option when trying to understand these classifications is to take a look at the sentiment distribution that again ranges from zero to four. Let\u2019s take a look at the sentiment distribution of sentence two:", "As you can see, the distribution peaks around a sentiment value of two and can thus be classified as neutral.", "Part-of-speech tagging, just like sentiment analysis does not require any additional computation. In a similar fashion to the code chunk above, all that\u2019s needed to retrieve the desired information is a for-loop:", "Running the code returns the following:", "The abbreviations in parentheses represent the POS tags and follow the Penn Treebank POS tagset, which you can find here. To give you an intuition, PRP stands for personal pronoun, VBD for a verb in past tense, and NN for a noun.", "Another possible use of CoreNLP is named-entity recognition. Let\u2019s create a new sentence in order for named-entity recognition to make more sense:", "\u201cThe earphones Jim bought for Jessica while strolling through the Apple store at the airport in Chicago, USA, were great.\u201d", "Again, all we need to do is define a for-loop:", "Running the code above gives us the following result:", "As we can see, CoreNLP has correctly identified that Jim and Jessica are people, Apple is an organization, Chicago is a city, and the United States is a country.", "Before explaining how to shut down the server, I\u2019d like to point out that CoreNLP provides many other functionalities (lemmatization, stemming, tokenization, etc.) that can all be accessed without having to run any additional computations. A complete list of all parameters for nlp.annotate() can be found here.", "If you would like to shut down the server, navigate to the terminal window you used to start the server earlier and press Ctrl + C .", "To summarize, CoreNLP\u2019s efficiency is what makes it so convenient. You only have to specify what analysis you\u2019re interested in once and avoid unnecessary computations that might slow you down when working with larger data sets. If you\u2019d like to know more about the details of how CoreNLP works and what options there are, I\u2019d recommend reading the documentation.", "[1] Manning, Christopher D., Mihai Surdeanu, John Bauer, Jenny Finkel, Steven J.
