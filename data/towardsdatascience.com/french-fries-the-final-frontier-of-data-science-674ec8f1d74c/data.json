Move over March Madness, Hello Starch Madness", "I typed up our findings into the first academic paper about French Fries and submitted it to arXiv.", "Nevertheless, here is the story of The Objectively Best French Fries, or as I titled it:", "An Objective Analysis of the Subjective Quality of French Fries in the Downtown Santa Monica Area", "Warning: This article will very likely make you hungry for French Fries", "It all started with a team lunch. We always ordered fries for the table. After several lunches, we began to ask the question: What are the best French fries near our Santa Monica office? How do you even determine \u201cbest\u201d? As a Data Science company, we knew this couldn\u2019t be determined simply by eating fries at various restaurants \u2014 we had to structure our analysis around scientific rigor and specified constraints, so that we could be confident in our findings\u2026 If the results weren\u2019t reproducible through peer review, what was the point? And thus, Starch Madness was born; a contest wherein a bunch of data nerds objectively decided which restaurant served the subjectively best French fries in Santa Monica.", "In 1802, Thomas Jefferson served \u201cpotatoes served in the French manner\u201d at a White House dinner. From there, the French fry was born. Potatoes cut into slices and deep fried became a staple in American cuisine.", "Despite being most associated with burgers and fast food, French fries are served in most restaurants. With their ubiquity, the question must be asked: \u201cWho serves the best French fry?\u201d The simplicity of the food recipe makes this question especially interesting, as there are only a few variables a chef can play with to craft their ideal French fry.", "In addition, some institutions produce mass quantities of fries per day \u2014 does this mass production reduce the quality of the fry? Does the fact that they must focus a large portion of their business on producing enjoyable fries create a better quality than a restaurant known for higher end cuisine?", "We would like to take this moment to address the research elephant in the room \u2014 if this research is even important in the first place. We propose that in fact:", "The pursuit of knowledge is admirable regardless of scale, and there has yet to be any studies conducted on the French fry quality of the downtown Santa Monica area. We may not have millions of dollars in French fry funding (yet) at our disposal, but we have the tenacity and drive (and palettes) to see this project through. It is our pleasure to add a tiny morsel of new knowledge into the human corpus.", "We had to first choose the fries that would be entered into the contest. The simplest sampling method was to select fries that could be purchased at a location that was less than 10min walk away from our office. Luckily, our office was located in the heart of downtown Santa Monica and there was no shortage of fry options; in fact there were far too many. To narrow down the locations, we simply typed \u201cbest French fries\u201d into Yelp and chose the top 12 results. Several of the locations were eventually replaced due to fry style (see section 1.2) but this methodology yielded a strong crop of contenders.", "To avoid bias from judges based on where the French fries were from, each location was randomly assigned a false identity based on popular T.V shows. Figure 1 is the key mapping the real restaurants to their false identity. Henceforth all restaurants will be referred to by their false identity names.", "There are many types of French fries, and unfortunately comparing different styles of French fries is like comparing apples and oranges, and thus we had to standardize our French fry types. We settled on the most common style \u2014 salted potato fries. This excluded popular variants such as waffle fries and sweet potato fries, but still allowed creativity and diversity amongst the participants.", "Judging one batch of fries at a time was not a feasible option, as that would have required quadruple the amount of time the current experiment was allotted as well as made tournament play (1.3.2) impossible. This increase in time would have inevitably resulted in judging fatigue. We instead attempted to gather as many fries as required per round at one time without degrading the integrity of each fry batch.", "Despite our earnest efforts to procure the fry batches as close to simultaneously as possible, our retrieval was not without flaws and some may argue the distances a fry batch travelled correlates inversely with the batch\u2019s score. This conjecture is exhaustively reviewed in our discussion section 3.2.", "Individuals in charge of picking up the French fries were instructed to order the fries by saying, \u201ccan I please have an order of fries.\u201d Whatever style the restaurant produced from this order was considered their typical fry style.", "Similar to the FIFA World Cup tournament design, Starch Madness was structured with two sections: group play (1.3.1) and tournament play (1.3.2). Adequate performance in the group play stage qualified you for tournament play.", "Each of the 12 participating French fries were randomly assigned into 4 groups of 3 contestants, called divisions, to be rated during the group play stage. The scoring used was the F.A.T System, defined in 1.4. Judges were instructed to use the F.A.T system (1.4) instead of comparing fries from within a division to reach a score.", "This is an important distinction as producing an objective score for each fry is a stronger indicator of fry strength than a comparative one. In addition, if a particular division has three excellent (or terrible) batches, they should be admitted into tournament play on their strength alone, rather than their division\u2019s overall strength. Figure 2 Outlines the divisions.", "Figure 2: Group Play Divisions. \u201cClassic\u201d movie distinction is subjective (but correct)", "While not the most scientifically rigorous way to compare French fries, it certainly is entertaining. During this stage the top 8 highest rated French fry batches were seeded and placed in a single elimination bracket. Each head-to-head match-up was a blind vote of which fry the judge preferred. Through the tournament play, a winner is crowned.", "One of the first obstacles set forth when judging French fries is how to standardize scoring. And to do this, one must answer a deep philosophical question of, \u201cwhat makes a good French fry?\u201d Our team of fry-experts narrowed the quality of a French fry down into 3 categories:", "This 3-part scoring rubric was brilliantly named the \u201cF.A.T System.\u201d Each of these represents a core attribute of a good French fry. By rating batches based on these metrics, we can decide with confidence which fry is best. Each of these metrics is scored on a 5-point scale, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. Averaging these three numbers produces a fry\u2019s overall quality and helps the judges make important voting decisions during tournament play.", "The French fries were judged by the capable RETINA.ai team, whose love of fries is only surpassed by their love of data collection and analysis. The merit of these judges is excellently defended in 3.5.2", "After the group play stage, and each contestant had been graded on the F.A.T System, we produce the following data table below:", "Those highlighted in green received acceptably high enough F.A.T scores to qualify for the tournament round. Those not highlighted fell below the McDonald\u2019s line, named for the fact that not only was McDonald\u2019s the lowest scored fry that qualified, but also with an average score of 2.43/5 McDonald\u2019s can be considered an average, mediocre fry.", "It should also be noted that Little Ruby had an absolutely incredible score, scoring nearly a half point higher than any other contender and a near perfect score of 4.44/5. An additional interesting result was that Little Ruby and Burger Lounge scored higher than Great American Fries, a food truck that exclusively serves French fries.", "All contestants above the McDonald\u2019s line were entered the seeded tournament play resulting in the tournament structure seen in Figure 3. False identities are used because this is the same bracket judges saw during the contest.", "After the first round, Los Pollos Hermanos & Mos Eisley won as projected, with Los Pollos Hermanos sweeping JJ\u2019s Diner 7\u20130. However, in the bottom two matchups the both fry-offs were upsets. Krusty Krab won decisively with a 6\u20131, while Bob\u2019s Burgers squeaked out a victory 4\u20133 in a hotly debated heat. Krusty Krab knocking out Leaky Cauldron, and doing so effectively, is very surprising because as stated in the previous section, Leaky Cauldron (Great American Fries) only sells fries \u2014 and yet they couldn\u2019t win a single game in the playoffs.", "The Final Four went as expected, with #1 Los Pollo Hermanos beating #4 Mos Eisley Cantina and #6 Krusty Krab dominating #7 Bob\u2019s Burger 7\u20130. The Championship game was an instant ESPN classic. Seed #6 Krusty Krab, with only 1 vote against it the entire tournament, took on Seed #1 Los Pollos Hermanos, whose group play score was significantly higher than anyone else \u2014 and 1.44 points above their championship opponent. But in the end, after intense debate and judging, the underdog took the championship 4\u20133.", "Hi Ho Burger (Krusty Krab) was crowned victor of Starch Madness!", "Now that we have objective scores for each fry, we are given the opportunity to see the impact of certain attributes on French fry quality, derived from F.A.T score averages", "When looking at French fry price vs quality, there is one thing that sticks out quite clearly: the most expensive French fry in the contest, The Misfit, was also voted the worst. In fact, the Misfit is such an outlier that inclusion of it as a data point actually changes the relationship between fry price and quality from positive to negative.", "The correlation between price and quality without the Misfit is moderately positive (0.40 Pearson Correlation Coefficient) and the correlation with the Misfit is none to negative (-0.08 Pearson). To sum this up nicely:", "Speaking of McDonalds \u2014 the cheapest option is actually the best option for the price you get. While absolute quality does increase as price increases, it does not increase to the point that you increase the quality per dollar spent. In fact, a dollar spent at McDonald\u2019s produces 38% more fry quality than the next restaurant. If you\u2019re looking for the best \u201cbang for your buck,\u201d McDonald\u2019s is the best option.", "A major discussion amongst judges during scoring was whether the distance from our office implied if the fries would be better or worse. The reasoning behind this is simply because fries are best when they are fresh and hot, and if we had to walk them back to the office for several minutes, they could lose more heat than a batch procured closer to our office.", "There are strong arguments for both sides. In support of this theory, Umami burger is one of the farthest and lowest rated fries, Little Ruby, Plan Check, and HiHo all made the playoffs and are very close to our office. However, Misfit, the closest restaurant, is the lowest score, and Great American Fries is far but still very high quality. Clearly, the only way to solve this is with", "We charted where each restaurant was and found the Euclidean distance from each to our office, marked on the map. Firstly, even by removing The Misfit from the data, only 10% of variance can be explained through a linear or exponential relationship (0.1 R2 value), so the hypothesis that distance degrades quality is rejected. What the distance-quality chart does produce is an interesting bucketing strategy for these restaurants. By bisecting the data by both the McDonald\u2019s line and the average distance, we can create 4 quadrants/segments.", "Quadrant I can be labelled \u201cEasy Bets,\u201d where each restaurant is close and of high quality.", "Quadrant II can be labelled \u201cWorth the Journey\u201d since they are farther away, but still high quality.", "Quadrant III can be labelled \u201cNot Worth the Journey\u201d for having below-McDonalds\u2019 quality at above average distance.", "Finally Quadrant IV can be labelled \u201cDeceptively Bad\u201d because while they are close to the office, they are not even the short trip. The Quadrant IV name also stems from the fact that we frequent the Misfit often since it is so close, and we have grown to believe that their fries are quite good. Our studies show this is incorrect, and our frequent visits have simply biased us", "3.3 Did External Factors influence our Voting?", "The false identities were added to the restaurants so that people wouldn\u2019t be biased based on their prior experiences with that restaurant when voting. However, in our attempt to mask their identities, we may have introduced new bias through our associations with the cinematic universes that the fictional restaurants are from. Specifically, what if a restaurant was given a comedic identity, and because of our positive association with that movie/show, we graded it higher? Or conversely, what if a restaurant was given a very serious movie/show identity, and because of this, the judges scrutinized the fry more closely? Would people treat associations to Silence of the Lambs more negatively than Dumb and Dumber?", "The answer is no. Splitting fries by comedy, we get a t-test p value of 0.52. The comedic value of the false identity did not influence our voting.", "We conducted these experiments during February and March \u2014 the heart of winter in Los Angles. It reached a chilling 58 degrees during some of our rounds \u2014 did this influence our votes? Did the cold weather make the warm fries taste even better, and therefore result in higher F.A.T Scores? Or did the overcast weather make us somber, and therefore more critical of the fries we ate?", "The answer is no. Splitting fries by if the weather as above 60 degrees of not, we get a t-test p value of 0.74. The weather outside did not influence our voting", "Does judging fries on Fryday impact our votes? No, a p value of 0.55 rejects this hypothesis.", "3.4 Can Yelp Ratings indicate F.A.T Score?", "Yelp is a service that prides itself on crowd-sourced ratings for restaurants. Many often check Yelp first before deciding if they should eat a particular location. Can we use the same strategy when selecting a location to dine on the best French fries? One would hope that as the overall Yelp score increases, so does the quality of the French fry.", "Unfortunately, this is not the case. As seen in Figure 8, highly rated Yelp eaters fail to produce on average fries that are as highly rated as their restaurant. Even when we cut out the Misfit outlier, good Yelp restaurants fall below the Yelp-FAT Line, which simply charts a 1:1 relationship between Yelp score and F.A.T score \u2014 a restaurant above the Yelp-FAT line (such as 3.0 Yelp score) produces fries of a higher caliper that the Yelp score would suggest. Our explanation for the 4.0+ restaurants failing to produce 4.0+ fries is that the Yelp score includes not only other foods, but also the ambiance of a restaurant. High Yelp score restaurants tend to have a better dining experience than lower scoring locations, despite their fries being of an equal or lesser quality.", "Everyone loves an underdog story, and so it is possible that despite having blinded each restaurant during group and tournament play, knowing the rankings could have compelled voters to choose the underdog when a contest was close. Fry quality in tournament play was higher than in group play, and so this is entirely possible. How to control for this in the future is to avoid telling rankings, but also changing the false identities several times throughout the contest, thereby removing any bias judges have procured during previous tastings.", "To address the concern that the judges themselves were bias and not indicative of scores of those not involved in the research, this is also possible. However, each judge has passed the French Fry Judge Certification Program (Figure 9) and therefore their expertise should be considered adequately accurate for French fry quality.", "Ranking French Fries is a relevant subject to all readers, and we hope to continue our research beyond the Santa Monica area. While our resources confined us to Santa Monica and single elimination, next steps could be an expansion of both region and trials. We are all interested if these results hold up across all restaurant locations, or if there are locations that claim to have the best French Fry that wish to enter the challenge.", "For those unconvinced that the research topic of Fry Quality of Santa Monica French Fries was worthy of publication, we would strongly argue that the pursuit of knowledge should always be encouraged, no matter how small the impact or specialized the application.", "We hope that all those who read it feel empowered to conduct their own French fry quality assessment as a form of peer review, and publish any interesting results found. The research area of French Fry Quality is young and ripe for more publications.", "The Quest for the Ultimate French Fry is still afoot, and Data Scientists have a major role to play in the road ahead.", "Your home for data science.
