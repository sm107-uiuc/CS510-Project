It argued that a specialized version of a Jupyter notebook would be so much better than classic business intelligence dashboards. I must admit that I immediately loved the thought!", "If you do not know what these notebooks are: They are basically a way of writing a formatted document (think: MS Word) with embedded code blocks which can be executed right on the page and will display their results on the page, as well. This allows you to document and explain the whole process beautifully and also to directly make changes to the code and experiment with it, seeing the changed results directly on the page. This approach became wildly popular with machine learning applications, where experimentation really is one of the most important steps on the way to a good result.", "If I think of myself as a dashboard user I would certainly like that approach for exactly the reasons stated in the article: A notebook gives you clear visibility of the process as well as the chance to play with it.", "But of course: I may be a management user by now but I have an IT and design background and I like math. In order for a notebook approach to work for your off-the-mill standard CEO, I see some challenges which need to be addressed, first.", "This one always is the biggie in the room. Even before these current notebooks, self-service reporting was nothing new. And the main challenge of it always was and still is to make the right data sources available to the end-users to play with. The typical chain of events is: First you attach the reporting tools directly to the production instances of your day-to-day tools. This gives users all the data in the most current state. The obvious downside is that one of the users will bring your production system down by creating very demanding (or simply faulty) requests for data. Then you attach your reporting tools to a daily copy of your production system. Good choice. Users try to dig in happily but some actually need near-live data and are unhappy with the daily dump. That is probably OK, we do not have to make everyone happy. More importantly, though, many users will find that they do not understand the data structure in the source system. The relational databases of your back-end systems were not designed with reporting in mind! Users may need to build complicated joins in order to make sense of the data and in many cases, it may not even be obvious. They may think they are summing up all the car sales of a month by region while actually summing up sales and cancelled offers. And on top of that we suddenly also start bumping into nasty data protection laws and need to make sure that personal data is kept out of reach of most reporting users. So you begin to build old fashioned data warehouse structures with nice OLAP cubes or you start creating business views to make it easier for users to select the right data. Since performance may also be problematic when operating on the original data, you also start to consolidate it a bit, here and there.", "This is a lot of hard work but it does allow the management users to perform self-service reporting. In a way, they are faced with the same dilemma as they were when using prepared dashboards. They need to trust the prepared data source.", "When talking about the data source, I had users in mind who at least know what they are doing and why. My experience tells me that these are not the only type of user.", "People who get into positions where they typically consume dashboards may have some great qualifications but data science usually is not one of them. Often they like to play with all the switches and will quickly form strong opinions about the outcome. So with a notebook style approach that offers up all the tools, prepare to find the work of the data scientists tweaked beyond recognition real quick. So even if you open up the possibility to play with the data, you will still want to keep up a basic workflow of someone requesting a key performance indicator (KPI) and someone creating a valid and secured version of it which will not be overwritten by experiments.", "While many classic dashboards may just have been created because someone said that KPIs are important to be able to perform a management review, some dashboards actually have a defined use-case. Either they show some agreed KPIs which are monitored and discussed by several managers and therefore should always stay the same as long as the group does not agree on a new definition. Or they are used to monitor service level agreements (SLAs) from external contracts. These types of dashboards should be very concise, clear and simple displays of the required information. Some of them may even be made available to external suppliers, so no playground area here.", "While all of this goes against the notebook, so far, I am still a great fan of the idea.", "Dashboards need to be done right. Most importantly a certain amount of documentation must be made available to every user. These days, stakeholders are sometimes exchanged so fast that the data guys may not ever get to know each of the passers-by. One day you have worked with one CFO to define a KPI, the next day a different CFO is there to misinterpret it. On the dashboards we make at my company, typically with a line chart per KPI, there always is a little question mark symbol in one corner of every chart. If you click it, you are presented with the documentation. Depending on your access rights you can even edit it directly or issue a change request. This has proven valuable time and time again.", "Dashboards also need to be alive. If your goal is to learn about your company\u2019s inner workings and then to iteratively make things better, you need to continuously adjust your dashboard to reflect the changes. Also, every look at your dashboard will give you new ideas for new KPIs. So you need it to be built on a flexible platform and you need available man-power to implement changes. Good dashboards need data exploration and an iterative approach. Predestined for a notebook, in a way.", "In conclusion: I believe that dashboards have their place in a business context and are here to stay. At the same time, I would love it if the foundation they were built on would be a notebook-style technology. The data scientist would build the process using a notebook. He then would assign some of the results to slots in a dashboard view. This view is then shared with people. Depending on their access rights they may have a details button on their dashboard, taking them to the notebook. This could then either be just a read-only access or could allow for editing or derivative work.", "If this is the future, I love it! Who is working on it? I want to tag along!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Passionate about many things.
