We try to skip the town as much as we can and together we already visited almost 30 countries on 5 continents. Although we enjoy unexpected adventures while travelling, we like to get prepared before we go anywhere. That is why, for my capstone project of the IBM\u2019s Data Science Professional Certification course I decided to solve the problem we often face in preparation for an upcoming journeys.", "When planning a trip to a new place we often have a hard time deciding which area would be the best to stay during the visit. Some of the main concerns are accommodation cost and safety of the area. Additionally, because we come as tourists, we want to be as close to tourist attractions and recommended eateries as possible. Due to the number of criteria, making an optimal choice might not be that straightforward.", "Here, I present an analysis of different criteria to be considered while travelling to Istanbul. Based on that analysis, a classification of its districts is made to indicate the most optimal areas to stay at.", "Neither of us has ever been to Turkey and it has been on our list for some time now. Hopefully, when the pandemic calms down we will finally have a chance to go there and use these findings for our preparations.", "As mentioned in the introduction, several data sets are necessary to fully explore the given problem. For the case of travelling to Istanbul, the following datasets were used:", "In order to determine the optimal areas to stay, the K-means clustering method was used. K-means method partitions unlabeled observables (districts) into provided number of clusters based on supplied features, such that each observable is assigned to cluster with the nearest center. This method perfectly suits the given problem, where districts are to be grouped based on their similarities.", "For this, gathered data needs to be transformed into useful insights.", "While investigating gathered data, it was noticed that the used crime statistics dataset has missing values for a few districts. Therefore, before moving on to the fitting process, a data imputation had to be performed to be able to include all the districts in classification. To treat districts with missing data neutrally, any missing values were replaced with the average of crime indices from districts with crime statistics.", "Before performing classification, scikit-learn\u2019s StandardScaler was used to normalize all features. This is to ensure that all the features had equal impact on the fitting process.", "The elbow method was used to determine the number of clusters that districts should be divided into. For this, K-means fitting was performed for a range of cluster numbers recording associated errors. Of course, the more k-clusters chosen, the lower the obtained fitting error. However, to avoid over-fitting, a trade-off between the number of clusters and error has to be chosen. As shown in Figure 1, adding more clusters above 5\u20136 does not reduce the error significantly. Therefore, for this analysis 5 k-clusters were chosen.", "As mentioned earlier, 39 districts of Istanbul were classified into 5 clusters. Of all the districts, 19 were assigned to cluster 0, 10 to cluster 1, 4 to cluster 2, 3 to cluster 3 and 3 to cluster 4. To determine which cluster consists of the most optimal districts to stay at, clusters were rated according to average value of each feature for districts in a given cluster, as shown in Table 1. As it was described in methodology section, each feature was designed such that districts with lowest values of the features are better to stay at (ie., lower rent, lower crime, shorter distance to best rated places). Thus, cluster 0 in Table 1 is considered to contain districts best to stay at, because it is 3rd in rent prices, 1st in crime index, 1st in district-attractions score and 1st in district-food score, which adds up to 3+1+1+1=6 and is the lowest from all clusters.", "Figure 2 shows box-plot charts visualizing basic statistics for each feature of the obtained clusters.", "In order to spatially visualize performed analysis and the statistics associated with the city of Istanbul, gathered information were overlaid on a few maps. Figure 3 shows the classification of districts into clusters, Figure 4 shows the location of the top 100 eateries and sightseeing places, Figure 5 shows average rent prices per m\u00b2 and Figure 6 shows calculated crime indices. All the gathered statistics overlaid on an interactive map can be viewed at:", "Comparing box-plot charts with associated maps, a few conclusions can be drawn for the determined clusters.", "By implementing K-means algorithm, 39 districts of Istanbul were classified into 5 groups, based on price, safety, and proximity to best eateries and sightseeing places. By sorting obtained results, the best and worst districts to stay at while visiting Istanbul were deducted.", "The best to stay turned out to be districts located just outside of the city center, while the worst, due to the high prices and crime, are districts in the strict city center.", "Although the final results seem to agree with the common view that it is the best to stay close to the center but not in the center itself, the performed analysis could still be improved. Used crime statistics data were from over 10 years ago. During that time a lot could change, therefore, using more recent data would be more beneficial. For the accommodation prices, long term rent prices were used instead of hotel prices per night. Although it is assumed that both would be correlated, without having both data one cannot be completely certain about it. As for the district-attraction and district-food scores, distance in straight line was used. Instead, commute time would be better, differentiating districts hard to get to, e.g. located on islands.", "Jupyter notebook containing step by step process leading to creating of this report can be viewed at:", "Your home for data science.
