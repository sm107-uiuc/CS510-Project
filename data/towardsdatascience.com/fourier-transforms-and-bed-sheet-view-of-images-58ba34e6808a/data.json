What do the Fourier modes represent? Why are Fourier Transforms notoriously popular for data compression? These are the questions this article aims to address using an interesting analogy to represent images.", "Images are digital paintings. They are made up of different features. Some features require really precise control of the brush like drawing whiskers on a dog. Others can be quickly filled in with a thick brush, like a clear blue sky. All images are a combination of fine and dull features to varying degrees, i.e. high-frequency and low-frequency features.", "let\u2019s take a moment to understand how frequencies crept up into our analysis. Imagine the sine wave over half a period. It slowly goes up reaches a maximum and then slowly diminishes. The higher the frequency of the sine, the narrower the wave.", "Imagine a cursed painter, who can only paint with brushes whose tips are half-wave sines. If he were to draw a delicately fine feature like the whiskers on a dog, he would choose a brush with a sine which has high frequency i.e. a narrowly pointed brush. Similarly, if he were to paint a clear sky that is devoid of any finer details, he would choose a brush with low frequency i.e. a fat thicker one.", "Surprisingly, all the images to ever exist are just like the artwork of the cursed painter. Notably, Fourier showed that every image (signal) can be decomposed into a range of sinuous terms where each term has a magnitude. The magnitudes are called Fourier coefficients. The whole process of decomposing an image into various sine terms and concomitantly their magnitudes is called Fourier decomposition. Fourier series is a much more general scenario, where the signals to be decomposed are periodic. Fourier Transforms are special cases where signals have an infinite time-period, i.e. non-periodic.", "One elegant and fast algorithm to do the above decomposition is the Fast Fourier Transform, which is arguably the most important algorithm to be developed in the 21st century. It has far-reaching applications in cellular communications, satellites, films, televisions, and much more.", "To visualize the sinuous nature of images, it would be interesting to plot the magnitude of an image as if it were a surface plot and observe the top view of the contours. This idea was developed by Dr. Steven Brunton at the University of Washington.", "The sinuous nature of the image is clearly visible. the high-frequency features are sharply visible as narrow peaks. These include the eyes, the outlines of the facial structure, and the outline of the human hand. The low-frequency features, which are usually huge stretches of uniform color, are observed in the background. These include large regions of black colored fur and the background.", "Here, is the simple code to replicate the prior results.", "The source code to animate the surface plot is included in my Github, here!", "This is called as the bed sheet view of the image. The idea behind the name is that if four people were holding each side of a bedsheet and begin oscillating it at one of the Fourier frequency with the corresponding magnitude and a similar setup with four people exists for each of the infinite Fourier modes, then the superposition of all the bedsheets would result physically in creases which look like the above image. Hence, the name, bed sheet view!", "Okay, now that a good intuition is developed to understand what Fourier transforms can do, its a good exercise to go over these ideas formally. The Fourier decomposition equation for a discrete signal looks like:", "Here, xn is the value of the signal at time n. Xk is the Fourier coefficient for each frequency k. N is the total number of samples of the signal (i.e. the number of discrete time steps over which the signal was recorded). The FFT algorithm returns the Xk values for each frequency. The complex exponential can be decomposed into sines and cosines using the Euler\u2019s formula. This provides a sanity check to the intuitions developed so far.", "For example, let\u2019s build a sinuous signal out of multiple frequencies. Say a combination of sines with 50, 100, and 200 hertz as frequencies and at different proportions. The periodic nature is still visible, but it is really hard to understand the original frequency components by visualizing the signal in the time domain.", "The Fourier Transform helps to intuitively visualize the signals in the frequency domain. So, applying the Fourier decomposition on the above signal gives us the following plot.", "The true frequencies of the mixture at 50, 100, and 200 Hz show peaks in the frequency domain as expected. Notably, the FFT algorithm can also give the weightage of each frequency component, without having any prior knowledge of the signal.", "Now going back to the bedsheet view of images, every picture is a 2-dimensional signal on which the Fourier decomposition can be applied. If a slice of the image is taken, it would resemble the time domain signal from our example, however with its own frequency components. The bedsheet views are powerful to develop intuition behind how an image can be a simple signal in the time domain, with multiple dimensions.", "In general, the information-dense regions are made up of high-frequency terms and plain stretches of uniformity are made up of lower frequency terms. The genius of Fourier is deriving the weighted modes (or frequency \u2014 magnitude pair). This gives an idea to understand the most important modes which make up the image. Turns out the Pareto rule holds true here and a really small number of modes contain most of the information about the image. This principle is crucial to data compression. By ignoring the majority of modes, we could reduce the size of the image. However, the quality of the image is only slightly compromised.", "If you are interested in going more in-depth on how Fourier Transforms are used for data compression, or to understand why data is compressible, to begin with, check out my previous article.
