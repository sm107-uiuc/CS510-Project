Not sure which APIs and packages to use? Don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel? I built a stock day trading program (github repo) from scratch and wanted to share some helpful resources as well as some advice on how to get started. I know starting a new project, especially in a foreign domain, is challenging, and I hope this article can help flatten the learning curve. Taking a step back, I also wanted to discuss my criteria for a \u201cgood\u201d project. There are many projects you can work on, so why work on this?", "Disclaimer: this is not meant to represent financial advice. Any investments you make using the algorithm, strategy, or ideas below is at your own risk. I am not liable for any consequences related to or caused by the information contained in this article.", "Given that the complexity of buying or selling a stock/cryptocurrency/forex is nearly infinite, there is plenty of room to introduce new technology. Are you a data scientist and want to analyze some Tweets from Elon Musk or identify keywords in SEC Filings? An aspiring cloud engineer looking to use cloud for something like being able to run your scripts 24/7 on an EC2 instance? A backend developer wanting to provide end users an API to get signals from your algorithm of when to buy and sell? An ETL or data engineer wanting to play with big data tools like Kafka, Spark, DynamoDB and build a pipelines to streams price data and throw it into NoSQL/SQL databases. A frontend developer or financial analyst interested in using DASH or React+Flask to represent the algorithm\u2019s performance to end users? You want to incorporate some MACHINE LEARNING? Hopefully you get the idea.", "Easily collaborate with others by breaking your program into areas of interest. I guess any project can be collaborative, but given the complexity of this challenge, people can choose their interest and simply tackle those challenges. It\u2019s also helpful that the overall objective of this project is clear, make money. Sometimes its hard to collaborate because people get lost in the details and forget the overall objective. Whether you are building a data pipeline, creating dashboards, or building some machine learning model, the objective is clear.", "Sometimes its hard to measure success but with this project, knowing how much money the program has made or loss is the ultimate indicator. Frankly, from a learning standpoint, its a win-win. If you make money, think how you can make more money or lose less. If you are losing money, think how you can make more money or lose less. That\u2019s right, there is no difference. Always room for improvement and all effort amounts to the same measure. Sometimes with other projects, its hard to know whether your changes are beneficial. Success may rely on user feedback or just a matter of opinion. This project, in contrast, is great because success and failure is clear. Nevertheless, its important to remember that markets are infinitely complex. Though it is easy to measure progress, this doesn\u2019t mean that it is easy to make progress.", "It\u2019s good to have a project that everyone can understand. Most everyone invests in the stock market. Its easy understanding the goal of buying low and selling high. When employers ask about projects, most ramble on about some technology stack they\u2019ve implemented and lose the recruiter or hiring manager in the details. This isn\u2019t to suggest that the technology isn\u2019t important, but that the ultimate goal of this project makes it easier to explain the technology. For example, \u201cI wanted to limit the scope of stock tickers so I used K-Means Clustering to cluster all my successful trades and find similar stocks\u201d versus \u201cI implemented a K-Means Clustering\u201d. Even if you don\u2019t know what K-Means Clustering is, you can understand its purpose.", "You can make money building a successful algorithm that trades for you. When I first started on this project a few months ago, I was convinced that building something lucrative is mostly luck and chance. I still mostly feel that way, but I believe it is possible to build something profitable. I would never risk money I can\u2019t afford to lose, and I strongly recommend others adopt the same mindset. Making money should not be the goal of this project, but its a nice side-benefit and aspirational goal.", "This ties in with my earlier point about easily incorporating any technology. Infinite complexity means you will never be done. (I am viewing this as glass half full). There will always be new strategies, technology, indicators, and metrics to incorporate and test. It\u2019s a never ending game. Interpret that how you will, but I find that interesting and exciting.", "Develop a strategy that works. Notice I didn\u2019t say to create a profitable strategy. Fact is that you will iterate. Defining a strategy will help provide some framework that can be improved upon. This is an example strategy that I created for trading stocks:", "I explained this strategy in another article I wrote about the initial performance of my stock trading algorithm. Now iterate upon this strategy and provide more details. Once you feel like you have something you can easily implement, start thinking about how to implement. This is when I felt I could start implementing:", "Note: notice that include API calls that I expect to use during implementation. This might be more specific than is currently needed during the pseudocode phase.", "What APIs, packages, and other resources help or are necessary to implement this pseudocode? Is this even possible? This is when I did some research and found that there are stock APIs for Robinhood (NOT RECOMMENDED), TD Ameritrade, and Alpaca that can execute buy and sell orders. For news stories, I am thinking about doing some web scraping using Python modules Beautiful Soup and Selenium and Scrapy. I can use Yahoo Finance API for getting moving averages and tracking volume. For building some machine learning models I might use scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy (I don\u2019t recommend focusing on machine learning too much in the beginning). I wrote my initial program in Jupyter Notebook and used Github as my repo.", "Now at this point, you may be tempted to start delving into new technologies and platforms such as incorporating some cloud or using airflow or kubeflow, but I recommend focusing on implementing as quickly as possible. If are interested in incorporating other technology and are a bit more experienced, you can do Proof of Concepts (POCs) for the technologies you plan to use before incorporating the technology. If you are working in a group, some might focus on just doing POCs and seeing what works best.", "Simply going through the process of implementing the psuedocode will teach you so much. You begin to understand where the bottlenecks are and improvements in design. And perhaps have learned about new APIs, packages, or frameworks that can be useful. I also recommend doing some paper trading (simulated trading) to test your program\u2019s performance. Keep in mind, nothing is like trading live. When you live trade there are a variety of factors that will impact your program\u2019s performance. Read one of my earlier articles which describes some of the challenges I faced when building my algorithm.", "Below are some of the resources that helped me get started and might help you too. Again, some might provide specific tangible advice while others provide you some domain knowledge and expertise.", "Note: I will continuously update the list below with useful resources.", "These are some podcast that describe high level strategies. (You can also just google \u201cday trading podcast\u201d \u2014 there are many).", "I recently created a substack to learn how to program and solve LeetCode questions in Python. Check it out here:", "Note from Towards Data Science\u2019s editors: While we allow independent authors to publish articles in accordance with our rules and guidelines, we do not endorse each author\u2019s contribution.
