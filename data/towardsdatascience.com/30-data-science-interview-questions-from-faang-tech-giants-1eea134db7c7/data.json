Feel free to use this to prep for interviews, to see where you need to study more, or even if you just want to see what top companies ask!", "This can be answered using the Bayes Theorem. The extended equation for the Bayes Theorem is the following:", "Assume that the probability of picking the unfair coin is denoted as P(A) and the probability of flipping 10 heads in a row is denoted as P(B). Then P(B|A) is equal to 1, P(B\u2223\u00acA) is equal to 0.\u2075\u00b9\u2070, and P(\u00acA) is equal to 0.99.", "More specifically, the question is asking for the most optimal method of finding the threshold floor given two eggs.", "To get a better understanding of the question, let\u2019s assume that you only have one egg. To find the threshold floor, you would simply start at floor one, drop the egg, and go one floor higher at a time until the egg cracks.", "Now imagine that we have unlimited eggs. The most optimal method in finding the threshold floor is through a binary search. First, you would start on the 50th floor. If the egg cracks then you would drop an egg on the 25th floor and if it doesn\u2019t crack then you would drop an egg on the 75th floor, and you would repeat this process until you find the threshold floor.", "With two eggs, the most optimal method in finding the threshold floor is a hybrid of the two solutions above\u2026", "For example, you could drop the first egg every 5 floors until it breaks and then use the second egg to find out which floor in between the increments of 5 the threshold floor is. In the worst-case scenario, this would take 24 drops.", "If you dropped the first egg every 10 floors until it breaks, it would take 19 drops in the worst-case scenario, which is much better than dropping the first egg every 5 floors. But what if you wanted to do better?", "This is where the concept, minimization of maximum regret comes into play. Basically, what this implies is that as you complete more drops at a given increment (how many floors you skip), you want to decrease the increment slowly each time, since there are less possible floors that the threshold floor can be. This means that if your first drop is on floor n then your second drop should be floor n + (n-1) assuming that it doesn\u2019t break. This can be written as the following equation:", "To take it a step further, this can be simplified to:", "Solving for n, you get approximately 14. Therefore, your strategy would be to start at floor 14, then 14+13, then 14+13+12, and so on until it breaks and then use the second egg to find the threshold floor one floor at a time!", "The expected number of odds for both options is 4 out of 100.", "Feel free to let me know if I\u2019m missing something here because this question seems too straight forward!", "You can use hypothesis testing to prove that males are taller on average than females.", "The null hypothesis would state that males and females are the same height on average, while the alternative hypothesis would state that the average height of males is greater than the average height of females.", "Then you would collect a random sample of heights of males and females and use a t-test to determine if you reject the null or not.", "There are a number of possible variables that can cause such a discrepancy that I would check to see:", "Generally, you would want to probe the interviewer for more information but let\u2019s assume that this is the only information that he/she is willing to give.", "Focusing on likes per user, there are two reasons why this would have gone up. The first reason is that the engagement of users has generally increased on average over time \u2014 this makes sense because as time passes, active users are more likely to be loyal users as using the platform becomes a habitual practice. The other reason why likes per user would increase is that the denominator, the total number of users, is decreasing. Assuming that users that stop using the platform are inactive users, aka users with little engagement and fewer likes than average, this would increase the average number of likes per user.", "The explanation above can also be applied to minutes spent on the platform. Active users are becoming more engaged over time, while users with little usage are becoming inactive. Overall the increase in engagement outweighs the users with little engagement.", "To take it a step further, it\u2019s possible that the \u2018users with little engagement\u2019 are bots that Facebook has been able to detect. But over time, Facebook has been able to develop algorithms to spot and remove bots. If were a significant number of bots before, this can potentially be the root cause of this phenomenon.", "The total number of likes in a given year is a function of the total number of users and the average number of likes per user (which I\u2019ll refer to as engagement).", "Some potential reasons for an increase in the total number of users are the following: users acquired due to international expansion and younger age groups signing up for Facebook as they get older.", "Some potential reasons for an increase in engagement are an increase in usage of the app from users that are becoming more and more loyal, new features and functionality, and an improved user experience.", "You can perform an A/B test by splitting the users into two groups: a control group with the normal number of ads and a test group with double the number of ads. Then you would choose the metric to define what a \u201cgood idea\u201d is. For example, we can say that the null hypothesis is that doubling the number of ads will reduce the time spent on Facebook and the alternative hypothesis is that doubling the number of ads won\u2019t have any impact on the time spent on Facebook. However, you can choose a different metric like the number of active users or the churn rate. Then you would conduct the test and determine the statistical significance of the test to reject or not reject the null.", "The odds of rolling a 7 is 1/6. This means that you are expected to pay $30 (5*6) to win $21. Take these two numbers and the expected payout is -$9 (21\u201330).Since the expected payout is negative, you would not want to pay this game.", "Two weighings would be required (see part A and B above):", "A convex function is one where a line drawn between any two points on the graph lies on or above the graph. It has one minimum.", "A non-convex function is one where a line drawn between any two points on the graph may intersect other points on the graph. It characterized as \u201cwavy\u201d.", "When a cost function is non-convex, it means that there\u2019s a likelihood that the function may find local minima instead of the global minimum, which is typically undesired in machine learning models from an optimization perspective.", "Overfitting is an error where the model \u2018fits\u2019 the data too well, resulting in a model with high variance and low bias. As a consequence, an overfit model will inaccurately predict new data points even though it has a high accuracy on the training data.", "I\u2019m not 100% sure about the answer to this question but will give my best shot!", "Let\u2019s take the instance where there\u2019s an increase in the prime membership fee \u2014 there are two parties involved, the buyers and the sellers.", "For the buyers, the impact of an increase in a prime membership fee ultimately depends on the price elasticity of demand for the buyers. If the price elasticity is high, then a given increase in price will result in a large drop in demand and vice versa. Buyers that continue to purchase a membership fee are likely Amazon\u2019s most loyal and active customers \u2014 they are also likely to place a higher emphasis on products with prime.", "Sellers will take a hit, as there is now a higher cost of purchasing Amazon\u2019s basket of products. That being said, some products will take a harder hit while others may not be impacted. It is likely that premium products that Amazon\u2019s most loyal customers purchase would not be affected as much, like electronics.", "Decision Trees: a tree-like model used to model decisions based on one or more conditions.", "Support Vector Machines: a classification technique that finds a hyperplane or a boundary between the two classes of data that maximizes the margin between the two classes. There are many planes that can separate the two classes, but only one plane can maximize the margin or distance between the classes.", "Random Forests: an ensemble learning technique that builds off of decision trees. Random forests involve creating multiple decision trees using bootstrapped datasets of the original data and randomly selecting a subset of variables at each step of the decision tree. The model then selects the mode of all of the predictions of each decision tree.", "Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset. This is important mainly in the case when you want to reduce variance in your model (overfitting).", "Wikipedia states four advantages of dimensionality reduction (see here):", "We need to make some assumptions about this question before we can answer it. Let\u2019s assume that there are two possible places to purchase a particular item on Amazon and the probability of finding it at location A is 0.6 and B is 0.8. The probability of finding the item on Amazon can be explained as so:", "We can reword the above as P(A) = 0.6 and P(B) = 0.8. Furthermore, let\u2019s assume that these are independent events, meaning that the probability of one event is not impacted by the other. We can then use the formula\u2026", "Boosting is an ensemble method to improve a model by reducing its bias and variance, ultimately converting weak learners to strong learners. The general idea is to train a weak learner and sequentially iterate and improve the model by learning from the previous learner. You can learn more about it here.", "Both L1 and L2 regularization are methods used to reduce the overfitting of training data. Least Squares minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, which can result in low bias but high variance.", "L2 Regularization, also called ridge regression, minimizes the sum of the squared residuals plus lambda times the slope squared. This additional term is called the Ridge Regression Penalty. This increases the bias of the model, making the fit worse on the training data, but also decreases the variance.", "If you take the ridge regression penalty and replace it with the absolute value of the slope, then you get Lasso regression or L1 regularization.", "L2 is less robust but has a stable solution and always one solution. L1 is more robust but has an unstable solution and can possibly have multiple solutions.", "To understand ACF and PACF, you first need to know what autocorrelation or serial correlation is. Autocorrelation looks at the degree of similarity between a given time series and a lagged version of itself.", "Therefore, the autocorrelation function (ACF) is a tool that is used to find patterns in the data, specifically in terms of correlations between points separated by various time lags. For example, ACF(0)=1 means that all data points are perfectly correlated with themselves and ACF(1)=0.9 means that the correlation between one point and the next one is 0.9.", "The PACF is short for partial autocorrelation function. Quoting a text from StackExchange, \u201cIt can be thought as the correlation between two points that are separated by some number of periods n, but with the effect of the intervening correlations removed.\u201d For example. If T1 is directly correlated with T2 and T2 is directly correlated with T3, it would appear that T1 is correlated with T3. PACF will remove the intervening correlation with T2.", "Here\u2019s a great explanation of ACF and PACF here.", "The bias of an estimator is the difference between the expected value and true value. A model with a high bias tends to be oversimplified and results in underfitting. Variance represents the model\u2019s sensitivity to the data and the noise. A model with high variance results in overfitting.", "Therefore, the bias-variance tradeoff is a property of machine learning models in which lower variance results in higher bias and vice versa. Generally, an optimal balance of the two can be found in which error is minimized.", "XGBoost is an ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that leverages the gradient boosting algorithm. In essence, XGBoost is like a bagging and boosting technique on steroids. Therefore, you can say that XGBoost handles bias and variance similar to that of any boosting technique. Boosting is an ensemble meta-algorithm that reduces both bias and variance by takes a weighted average of many weak models. By focusing on weak predictions and iterating through models, the error (thus the bias) is reduced. Similarly, because it takes a weighted average of many weak models, the final model has a lower variance than each of the weaker models themselves.", "Random forests are an ensemble learning technique that builds off of decision trees. Random forests involve creating multiple decision trees using bootstrapped datasets of the original data and randomly selecting a subset of variables at each step of the decision tree. The model then selects the mode of all of the predictions of each decision tree. By relying on a \u201cmajority wins\u201d model, it reduces the risk of error from an individual tree.", "For example, if we created one decision tree, the third one, it would predict 0. But if we relied on the mode of all 4 decision trees, the predicted value would be 1. This is the power of random forests.", "Random forests offer several other benefits including strong performance, can model non-linear boundaries, no cross-validation needed, and gives feature importance.", "Naive Bayes is better in the sense that it is easy to train and understand the process and results. A random forest can seem like a black box. Therefore, a Naive Bayes algorithm may be better in terms of implementation and understanding. However, in terms of performance, a random forest is typically stronger because it is an ensemble technique.", "The Rectified Linear Unit, also known as the ReLU function, is known to be a better activation function than the sigmoid function and the tanh function because it performs gradient descent faster. Notice in the image to the left that when x (or z) is very large, the slope is very small, which slows gradient descent significantly. This, however, is not the case for the ReLU function.", "Both L1 and L2 regularization are methods used to reduce the overfitting of training data.

L1 is more robust but has an unstable solution and can possibly have multiple solutions.", "Batch learning, also known as offline learning, is when you learn over groups of patterns. This is the type of learning that most people are familiar with, where you source a dataset and build a model on the whole dataset at once.", "Online learning, on the other hand, is an approach that ingests data one observation at a time. Online learning is data-efficient because the data is no longer required once it is consumed, which technically means that you don\u2019t have to store your data.", "There are a number of ways to handle null values including the following:", "For those who don\u2019t know, overfitting is a modeling error when a function fits the data too closely, resulting in high levels of error when new data is introduced to the model.", "There are a number of ways that you can prevent overfitting of a model:", "I would conduct an A/B test to determine if the introduction of a new feature results in a statistically significant improvement in a given metric that we care about. The metric(s) chosen depends on the goal of the feature. For example, a feature may be introduced to increase conversion rates, or web traffic, or retention rates.", "First I would formulate my null hypothesis (feature X will not improve metric A) and my alternative hypothesis (feature X will improve metric A).", "Next, I would create my control and test group through random sampling. Because the t-test inherently considers the sample size, I\u2019m not going to specify a necessary sample size, although the larger the better.", "Once I collect my data, depending on the characteristics of my data, I\u2019d then conduct a t-test, Welch\u2019s t-test, chi-squared test, or a Bayesian A/B test to determine whether the differences between my control and test group are statistically significant.", "The box with 24 red cards and 24 black cards has a higher probability of getting two cards of the same color. Let\u2019s walk through each step.", "Let\u2019s say the first card you draw from each deck is a red Ace.", "This means that in the deck with 12 reds and 12 blacks, there\u2019s now 11 reds and 12 blacks. Therefore your odds of drawing another red are equal to 11/(11+12) or 11/23.", "In the deck with 24 reds and 24 blacks, there would then be 23 reds and 24 blacks. Therefore your odds of drawing another red are equal to 23/(23+24) or 23/47.", "Since 23/47 > 11/23, the second deck with more cards has a higher probability of getting the same two cards.", "Edit: Thank you guys for commenting and pointing out that it should be -$35!", "This isn\u2019t a trick question. The answer is simply to perform a hypothesis test:", "Learn more about hypothesis testing here.", "Since a coin flip is a binary outcome, you can make an unfair coin fair by flipping it twice. If you flip it twice, there are two outcomes that you can bet on: heads followed by tails or tails followed by heads.", "This makes sense since each coin toss is an independent event. This means that if you get heads \u2192 heads or tails \u2192 tails, you would need to reflip the coin.", "You can tell that this question is related to Bayesian theory because of the last statement which essentially follows the structure, \u201cWhat is the probability A is true given B is true?\u201d Therefore we need to know the probability of it raining in London on a given day.
