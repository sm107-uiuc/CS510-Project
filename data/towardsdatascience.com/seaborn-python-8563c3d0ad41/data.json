Visualization is the central part of Seaborn which helps in exploration and understanding of data.", "One has to be familiar with Numpy and Matplotlib and Pandas to learn about Seaborn.", "These are only some of the functionalities offered by Seaborn, there are many more of them, and we can explore all of them here.", "To initialize the Seaborn library, the command used is:", "Using Seaborn we can plot wide varieties of plots like:", "For this entirety of the article, we are using the dataset of Google Playstore downloaded from Kaggle.", "We can compare the distribution plot in Seaborn to histograms in Matplotlib. They both offer pretty similar functionalities. Instead of frequency plots in the histogram, here we\u2019ll plot an approximate probability density across the y-axis.", "We will be using sns.distplot() in the code to plot distribution graphs.", "Before going further, first, let\u2019s access our dataset,", "Now, let\u2019s see how distribution plot looks like if we plot for \u2018Rating\u2019 column from the above dataset,", "The Distribution Plot looks like this for Rating\u2019s column,", "Here, the curve(KDE) that appears drawn over the distribution graph is the approximate probability density curve.", "Similar to the histograms in the matplotlib, in distribution too, we can change the number of bins and make the graph more understandable.", "We just have to add the number of bins in the code,", "Now, the graph looks like this,", "In the above graph, there is no probability density curve. To remove the curve, we just have to write \u2018kde = False\u2019 in the code.", "We can also provide the title and color of the bins similar to matplotlib to the distribution plots. Let\u2019s see the code for that,", "The distribution graph, for the same column rating, looks like this:", "One of the biggest advantages of using Seaborn is, it offers a wide range of default styling options to our graphs.", "These are the default styles offered by Seaborn.", "We just have to write one line of code to incorporate these styles into our graph.", "After applying the dark background to our graph, the distribution plot looks like this,", "Pie Chart is generally used to analyze the data on how a numeric variable changes across different categories.", "In the dataset we are using, we\u2019ll analyze how the top 4 categories in the Content Rating column is performing.", "First, we\u2019ll do some data cleaning/mining to the Content rating column and check what are the categories in there.", "Now, the categories list will be,", "As per the above output, since the count of \u201cAdults only 18+\u201d and \u201cUnrated\u201d are significantly less compared to the others, we\u2019ll drop those categories from the Content Rating and update the dataset.", "The categories present in the \u201cContent Rating\u201d column after updating the sheet are,", "Now, let\u2019s plot Pie Chart for the categories present in the Content Rating column.", "The Pie Chart for the above code looks like the following,", "From the above Pie diagram, we cannot correctly infer whether \u201cEveryone 10+\u201d and \u201cMature 17+\u201d. It is very difficult to assess the difference between those two categories when their values are somewhat similar to each other.", "We can overcome this situation by plotting the above data in Bar chart.", "Now, the bar Chart looks like the following,", "Similar to Pie Chart, we can customize our Bar Graph too, with different Colors of Bars, the title of the chart, etc.", "Up until now, we have been dealing with only a single numeric column from the dataset, like Rating, Reviews or Size, etc. But, what if we have to infer a relationship between two numeric columns, say \u201cRating and Size\u201d or \u201cRating and Reviews\u201d.", "Scatter Plot is used when we want to plot the relationship between any two numeric columns from a dataset.

For example, let\u2019s say we want to see how a company\u2019s sales are affected by three different factors, in that case, pair plots will be very helpful.", "Let\u2019s create a pair plot for Reviews, Size, Price, and Rating columns from of dataset.", "We will be using sns.pairplot() in the code to plot multiple scatter plots at a time.", "The output graph for the above graphs looks like this,", "The heatmap represents the data in a 2-dimensional form. The ultimate goal of the heatmap is to show the summary of information in a colored graph. It utilizes the concept of using colors and color intensities to visualize a range of values.", "Most of us would have seen the following type of graphics in a football match,", "Heatmaps in Seaborn create exactly these types of graphs.", "We\u2019ll be using sns.heatmap() to plot the visualization.", "When you have data as the following we can create a heatmap.", "The above table is created using the Pivot table from Pandas. You can see how Pivot tables are created in my previous article Pandas.", "Now, let\u2019s see how we can create a heatmap for the above table.", "In the above code, we have saved the data in the new variable \u201cheat.\u201d", "The heatmap looks like the following,", "We can apply some customization to the above graph, and also can change the color gradient so that the highest value will be darker in color and the lowest value will be lighter.", "The updated code will be something like this,", "The heatmap for the above-updated code looks like this,", "If we observe, in the code we have given \u201cannot = True\u201d, what this means is, when annot is true, each cell in the graph displays its value. If we haven\u2019t mention annot in our code, then the default value it takes is False.", "Seaborn also supports some of the other types of graphs like Line Plots, Bar Graphs, Stacked bar charts, etc. But, they don\u2019t offer anything different from the ones created through matplotlib.", "So, this is how Seaborn works in Python and the different types of graphs we can create using seaborn. As I have already mentioned, Seaborn is built on top of the matplotlib library. So, if we are already familiar with the Matplotlib and its functions, we can easily build Seaborn graphs and can explore more depth concepts.", "Thank you for reading and Happy Coding!!!", "Your home for data science.
