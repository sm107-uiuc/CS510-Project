Racial discrepancies within healthcare contribute significantly to an adverse patient health outcome. According to the National Center for Health Sciences, despite the noticeable improvement in health and mortality rates in the United States, the health gap between Caucasian and Black Americans remains significant as in 1950.", "Among men, racial disparities in mortality rates have increased over time. The National Center for Health Sciences also reports that Black Americans suffer from multiple ailments, with worse outcomes than White Americans.", "Black females are less susceptible to breast cancer than White females. However, they are 40% more likely to die from it [1].", "Health disparities include several factors, such as socioeconomic status. A population belonging to a high socioeconomic status typically possess better health. However, Socio-Economic Status does not entirely justify the racial health disparities, which persists even in high-income groups.", "According to the 2012 National Healthcare Disparities Report, Blacks patients with comparable SES and insurance were provided with more inferior quality of care than Whites on 43% of 191 measures [1].", "2. Another national study conducted within the United States of America exhibited that Black children who lose a finger are half as likely as White children to have the finger reattached [1].", "3. According to a review of 800,000 hospital discharge notes, Black patients with peripheral arterial disease had 77% more chance to have the affected limb amputated than White patients [1].", "4. Black females receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer compared to White females were significantly more prone to be treated with the non-standard treatment protocol [1].", "The analysis shows that overall, the Black and White American patients with similar diseases were treated differently. As shown in the photo below, all the factors such as \u201cnumber of lab tests\u201d, \u201cnumber of inpatient visits\u201d, \u201cnumber of outpatient visit\u201d, \u201clength of stay\u201d, \u201cnumber of diagnosis\u201d, \u201cnumber of medications\u201d were found to be significantly different.", "Detailed analysis, as shown below, also shows that diabetic White patients received more medications and diagnostics tests when compared to diabetic Black patients. For non-diabetic patients, White Americans received more lab tests and diagnostic procedures. However, both non-diabetic black and white patients received a similar number of medications.", "The analysis below shows that Black Americans have a higher likelihood of getting readmitted than White Americans.", "Your home for data science.
