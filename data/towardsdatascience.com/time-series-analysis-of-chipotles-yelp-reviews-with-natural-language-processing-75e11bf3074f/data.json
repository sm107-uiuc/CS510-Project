Using natural language processing, we analyze Chipotle\u2019s reviews on Yelp with a time-series approach. We first conduct market research on Chipotle to identify its values, issues, and strategic factors. Then, we study these key factors through sentiment analysis and uncover trends and insights into Chipotle\u2019s business.", "Founded in 1993 by Steve Ellis, Chipotle Mexican Grill is a reputable fast-casual restaurant chain that has been serving Tex-Mex cuisine to more than one million customers daily. Chipotle adopts a premium pricing strategy that offers customers best-quality products at a reasonable price. It builds its brand on the promise of \u201cfood with integrity\u201d and on key values such as the freshness of its meal items and high-quality sourcing of its ingredients. With such strategic factors, Chipotle successfully secured its spot in the competition and holds a 2.4% market share of the restaurant industry, according to CSI Market.", "However, since 2015, Chipotle began to lose its customers due to a series of health issues such as norovirus, E.Coli, and Salmonella that sickened a great number of consumers across the U.S. Its revenue took a big plunge in 2015 and 2016. Behind the scene, consumers were losing trust in Chipotle\u2019s promise of \u201cfood with integrity\u201d. In 2018, Chipotle shut up to 65 underperforming stores as an effort to revamp and improve profitability, as reported by Reuters.", "To regain its customers, Chipotle implemented several measures such as establishing a new safety protocol and rolling out new menu items. It also tried to overcome its problem of customer wait time by introducing mobile app and online ordering. As Chipotle follows the general trend of E-commerce and becomes increasingly digital-friendly, we recommend that it take a more data-driven approach to improve its business. By analyzing its reviews on Yelp, Chipotle can find valuable insights about key aspects or trends of its business and develop strategies accordingly to boost revenues.", "For this project, we utilize the Yelp Open Dataset. We first merge the business table and reviews table using the business id. Then we filter the merged table to only include 9590 reviews on Chipotle Mexican Grill.", "We label the sentiment for each review. Using TextBlob, we calculate the sentiment score, on a scale of -1 to 1, of each review. We assign \u201cpositive\u201d sentiment to reviews with positive sentiment score, \u201cnegative\u201d sentiment to negative score and \u201cneutral\u201d sentiment to score of 0. Next, we apply stopwords removal, negation handling and lemmatization to each review text.", "After filtering out irrelevant columns, the final dataset has 9590 rows and 5 columns of date, star rating, review text, sentiment score and sentiment.", "We first look at the star rating of Chipotle. By visualizing the monthly average star rating, we see that Chipotle\u2019s rating has been on a steady recline since 2011, dropping from 4.0 to 2.5.", "Then, we visualize the number of reviews across all star rating groups. We notice that the number of one-star and two-star reviews increases most significantly among all groups, which is likely to contribute to the decline of Chipotle\u2019s overall star rating.", "We also create visualizations of the reviews\u2019 sentiments.", "There are twice as many positive-sentiment reviews as negative-sentiment reviews of all time.", "In addition, we verify that the sentiment score increases as the star rating increases.", "In previous EDA, we reveal that the sentiment of reviews is closely related to star ratings and, consequently, the business performance. Now, we are interested in identifying the factors that contribute most to the review sentiments. We consider these factors as the key aspects that Chipotle should pay attention to. In this analysis, we identify such factors as words whose occurrences are strongly correlated with the star rating.", "We first establish a pool of words, or, words of interest (WOI), by looking at past business strategies taken by Chipotle:", "1. Establish new safety protocols (WOI: fresh, safety, etc.)", "Learning from its health crises, Chipotle established new safety protocols to position the company as \u201cindustry leaders in food safety.\u201d Such protocols include rules such as branching fresh produce before they are used.", "2. Roll out new menu items (WOI: menu, burrito, etc.)", "Chipotle rolled out new menu items such as queso and quesadillas. Why the sudden change? Is it that Chipotle wants to address its shortcomings in a limited menu? Or is it that customers are losing interest in its staple dish, burrito?", "3. Introduce mobile and online ordering (WOI: line, online, mobile, etc.)", "In 2014, Chipotle introduced a mobile ordering app to let customers order and pay for food a few minutes before coming to the restaurant. This has helped reduce customers\u2019 time in lines and improved their ordering experience.", "Now we visualize the change of occurrence ratio of selected WOIs along with the change of star rating on a monthly basis. The occurrence ratio of WOIs in positive and negative reviews is formally defined as the following:", "where s indicates the review sentiment (s = positive /negative), R refers to single reviews, N is the total number of reviews having sentiment s, and I is the indicator function.", "We analyze occurrence ratios instead of raw occurrence counts because the total number of reviews varies from month to month. Thus, the metric measures the normalized frequency of WOI in reviews of either sentiment category. We also decide to only analyze reviews after 2012, since there were insufficient reviews before 2012.", "We interpret our visualizations of the WOI metric from three aspects: change of occurrence ratio of WOI in positive/negative reviews over time and comparison of occurrence ratios of WOI in both reviews.", "1. Change of occurrence ratio of WOI in positive reviews", "If a word used to have a high positive ratio, we can say it served as the strength of the business. The decrease of the positive ratio indicates the restaurant is losing edge in this aspect. Based on the following graphs, Chipotle should investigate the freshness of its menu items and the quality of its burrito products.", "As shown below, the occurrence ratio of \u201cfresh\u201d, a key value of Chipotle, in positive revies decreases by half, dropping from 0.3 to 0.15.", "The same applies to Chipotle\u2019s most important product, \u201cburrito\u201d, with its occurrence ratio dropping from 0.4 to 0.2.", "2. Change of occurrence ratio of WOI in negative reviews", "A WOI that has a higher occurrence ratio in negative reviews indicates Chipotle is likely to underperform in this aspect. It can be seen in the following graph that the occurrence ratio of \u201cline\u201d increases from 2012. But it decreases from 2015 onward. We can infer that the turning point in 2015 is caused by Chipotle\u2019s launch of its mobile ordering app in 2014, which aimed to reduce line. In this sense, Chipotle\u2019s strategy in alleviating customers\u2019 wait times through digital ordering was a success. Moving forward, Chipotle should pursue this initiative.", "3. Comparison of Occurrence Ratios of WOI in Both Reviews", "If a WOI has a higher occurrence ratio in positive reviews than in negative reviews, we say that it carries a positive sentiment. Consequently, when a WOI, neutral on its own, has a higher occurrence ratio in positive reviews than in negative reviews, it can be regarded as a positive aspect of the business. Vice versa.", "Both \u201conline\u201d and \u201capp\u201d are neutral words but have consistently higher occurrence ratios in negative reviews than in positive reviews. This indicates that Chipotle is underperforming in the digital commerce channel. It needs to improve its mobile ordering app and online ordering system to enhance the customer buying experience.", "Based on our analysis findings, we make recommendations to Chipotle in the areas of ingredient quality, wait times and digital ordering.", "By visualizing the occurrence ratio of the keyword \u201cfresh\u201d over time, we discover that \u201cfresh\u201d is slowly disappearing in the positive reviews. This indicates that, from the perspective of consumers, Chipotle is losing its edge in sourcing fresh ingredients. Thus, Chipotle should investigate the freshness and quality of its ingredients for improvement to regain its strategic strength. In terms of its menu offerings, Chipotle needs to investigate the current quality of its most important product, burrito, which is seen less and less in positive reviews. Chipotle needs to investigate why its staple dish is losing its appeal to customers.", "On the other hand, wait times and lines are clearly a problem at Chipotle. Both our market research and data analysis point out that \u201cline\u201d is a big contributor to customers\u2019 negative sentiment towards Chipotle. To address this, Chipotle has sought digital channels such as online ordering and mobile app ordering to ameliorate this issue. Our sentiment analysis shows that the launch of the mobile ordering app had some positive effects on wait times. However, this is not enough. We find that both \u201conline\u201d and \u201capp\u201d have a more negative note in the customers\u2019 reviews, indicating dissatisfaction with Chipotle\u2019s digital ordering experience. In this light, Chipotle needs to improve its online ordering system and mobile app, in order to better solve the wait time problem and improve the customer buying experience.", "In this blog, we compare the change of word occurrences in customer reviews to reveal the key factors that contribute to the change of Yelp ratings of Chipotle. Combining market research and NLP tools, we uncover valuable insights into Chipotle\u2019s business conditions and make recommendations accordingly. Such an analytics pipeline can be applied to the reviews of other declining businesses as well to form insights and actions.", "Your home for data science.
