Once AST parsing recognizes a view within a project, those nodes and in a directed graph, or a Digraph, to preserve the hierarchy a computer program can easily understand.", "With TornadoFX configurations indicating which elements we might care about (buttons, textfields, forms, etc), we can pull out the nodes from the saved UI hierarchy we feel a user may interact with.", "The idea to generate UI testing is far from original. There are many existing products comprised of large code bases and teams from places like test.ai and TestComplete that has worked by solving a problem by the case in many ways. Likewise, there are academic papers aimed at detecting UI elements in Android applications and more using image classification in machine learning.", "Unfortunately, current AI image classification locator mechanisms suffer from partial view render recognition as well as detecting custom object interactions not typically considered for user input, as demonstrated in a study on using neural networking to create a GUI skeleton.", "Additionally, much of those AI-based solutions for testing are incredibly intensive in terms of resources and processing power computed by the algorithm existing behind the scenes. And that algorithm will be consuming data. Often lots and lots of data.", "For these reasons, I would argue the metaprogramming locator mechanism is essentially better than their \u201ctraining-based\u201d locator mechanism.", "Currently, this is what those generated tests look like for buttons and textfields:", "They\u2019re not incredibly sophisticated. At the moment, the best that can be done with these generated tests is interacting with these individual nodes as well as permutations of grouped nodes.", "To have gotten this far is a feat in itself, but the testing generated is really dumb at best. A UI Test goes something like this:", "I need smarter testing. I looked into the possibility of implementing Tensorflow for TornadoFX-Suite, but after diving into machine learning, I realized I had to put machine learning asides for now.", "The trick with AI related to testing evolves around understanding theory of error; understanding how and where we make cognitive mistakes when we deal with space and time complexity.", "But AI is not smart. In fact, there\u2019s still very much a human element that exists in deep learning.", "In my research on machine learning and computational thinking, Jeff Nyman\u2019s extensive work and research on testing and machine learning proved to be one of the more influential pieces in changing the direction of this project in that I had to put aside the idea of applying machine learning\u200a\u2014\u200afor\u00a0now.", "This reasons I put aside machine learning?", "Jeff Nyman demonstrates this bias-variance distinction in his Pacument project, where Pacman shows how the weights of a neural network were being \u201ctweaked\u201d enough that they provided a bias factor that weighted in one direction rather than another.", "So with Pac-Man, for example, Nyman shows that a bias toward power pellets would lead Pac-Man to chase ghosts all over the board trying to kill them, at the expense of just finishing the game and winning.", "Here is where we get into the concept of long-term reward at the expense of short term reward which is what impacts a lot of the machine learning\u00a0we\u00a0see\u00a0today.", "The traditional model of machine learning appears to have severe limitations, especially in real life problems. The question that keeps popping up in my head is \u201chow do we know what is relevant and irrelevant?\u201d", "I don\u2019t know what makes a good UI test. I don\u2019t know what makes a bad UI test. How would I know what weights I ought to consider and how would I be able to calculate for bias when I don\u2019t know what is relevant and irrelevant factors for UI testing?", "If I don\u2019t know what factors are relevant or irrelevant, the cost of resources required to run these models can become high and the loss function becomes a lot harder to try and minimize. I just don\u2019t have the resources or the expertise to handle this on my own\u2026 but maybe, just maybe, the traditional machine learning model just won\u2019t cut it for this project.", "We may grab these nodes and generate random ids which can be attached at runtime, but how do we know if a node looks as it should? This is a hard question to answer. There\u2019s lots of interweaving information that we need to be able to answer such a question.", "Let us re-examine short term rewards versus long-term rewards, with which the short term is typically achieved in machine learning.", "Machine learning is about searching for useful representations of some input data within a predefined space of possibilities, using guidance from feedback that tells us how good or bad the representations are.", "A deep learning model is an engine made of different layers we can think of as data processing units. Each of those units contains data filters. These units are stacked up one-on-top-of-the-other.", "What\u2019s important is that the model passes inputs through stacks of data. The neural network itself is called the model, but it can also be recognized as an algorithm.", "Conceptually, a neural network is searching for a transformation of shaped data and looks to flatten it into something that can be processed.", "Essentially, we\u2019ve achieved a flattening of data by taking AST parsing and breaking down these literal 3-dimensional shapes into class breakdowns that makes it easy for us to analyze organizationally post-parsing. How might metaprogramming feed this flattened data into more specific layers?", "We click a button. What happens next? Well, that depends. In this example, the save button in the Editor dialog is not enabled until the model has been dirtied (the contents of the textfields are changed).", "So we can\u2019t even click our button, at the moment! How can we predict our ability to interact with a node? This problem can be likened to complex game systems like Skyrim or Mass Effect. If you create an alliance with one group, you cannot participate in the other (and likewise, if you choose to become a vampire, you cannot become a werewolf). This system of formal specifications is otherwise known as a Finite State Machine, a common strategy of formalizing UIs.", "One benefit of formalizing specifications for a UI system is that formal ideas and clear structures leads us to being able to create a system metaprogramming can work with.", "Another more explicit benefit of formal specifications allows us to check a UI Node\u2019s properties; are any transitions ill-specified? Is it possible to get locked out of interactions?", "More importantly, how might metaprogramming create its own finite automata of predicting states like Button enablement and disablement when tied with models?", "Within every UI node, there is a possibility to store the following information:", "With metaprogramming, I accidentally realized \u2014 maybe we don\u2019t have to guess how good or bad representations of results from data filters are.", "In this case, we can use TornadoFX-Suite\u2019s class breakdown and located UI nodes and reanalyze our code analysis to create new graphical relationships that can remove some of the guesswork of being able to predict behavior that would have come from \u201cblack-box\u201d testing.", "Namely, at the creation of UINode, we create an empty Digraph storing functionComposition and associateFunctions for the node, which is retrieved from our initial class breakdown achieved in AST parsing.", "An associatedFunction is a function responsible for affecting a node\u2019s property or state. Associated Functions can be discovered by scanning for nodes with values that may be recognized as a member variable of any Viewtype member that may exist in any other classes. As soon as there is a reference to the assigned node value within a function, chances are, that function affects the state of the node.", "functionalComposition can be thought of as the functions that are spurned from interacting with a particular node. Lucky for us, we can reuse the Digraph structure used to create UI hierarchies.", "More importantly, we can map over these functionalComposition and associatedFunctions in order for metaprogramming to create Kotlin state machines to help predict expected states from certain interactions with nodes, which is another version of the metaprogramming locator mechanism (just a less obvious one). The processing is intensive, but as we continue to map over these relations, there is less, but more relevant information to work with as we create smarter relationships in a very, very dumb way. This idea is the focus of the next stage of implementation.", "What is a neural network? According to machine learning, it\u2019s the algorithm. But a neural network works by simulating a large number of interconnected processing units that resemble abstract versions of neurons.", "In metaprogramming, a neural network is a noun, whereas in machine learning, a neural network is an action. In either case, there is a set of operations on things and as the neural network evolves, more add new operations are added. However, an imperative world works best when those operations are finite, and the definitions of how those operations need to work are not necessarily edited (as attempting to minimize the loss function with adjusting weights tends to occur in machine learning).", "The answer I propose is far less opaque than what traditional machine learning models offers by feeding data through hidden layers. I mentioned that AI is not smart \u2014 well, neither is metaprogramming. However, the operations required to compute and create further graphical relations using metaprogramming appear to be proportionally and exponentially less given the information we already have, whereas machine learning appears to operate in the inverse.", "I really think I\u2019m on to something here.", "Your home for data science.
