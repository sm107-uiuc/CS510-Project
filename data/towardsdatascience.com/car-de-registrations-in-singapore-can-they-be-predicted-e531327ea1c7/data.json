It was a delightful process, and a very intriguing one at that. In light of several educational enlightenments that I had during my winter exchange programme in Vienna (and basically a lot of free time in my hands), I have decided to do a short writeup on my results. Also, this would be a good time to seek feedback and comments from the wider community as part of a broader learning experience.", "Disclaimer: My foray into statistics/data science/ML is purely out of interest (and of course jumping onto the 21st century bandwagon) so I do try my best to equip myself with all the necessary knowledge needed. Should there be any misconceptions in the technicalities of what is to come in the post below, do prod me towards the right direction! :)", "In Singapore, individual ownership of cars have (sort of) a more different meaning to its population as compared to residents of other countries throughout the world. In order to be a \u2018highly revered\u2019 car owner, one must first obtain a Certificate of Entitlement which is valid for 10 years. Exactly what the process of obtaining a COE is here is a bit muddled from my side, but there is some form of bidding involved. Only when you have successfully obtained the correct COE category for your vehicle are you able to finally own your car.", "That said, when a car\u2019s COE hits the 10 year mark, its road usage no longer becomes legal. Hence, owners can either choose to buy a new car with new COE, renew their COE, or just scrap the car to get some form of rebate. In any case, should you choose not to renew the COE of your current car, you would need to de-register it.", "So what exactly is the big deal with car de-registration data?:", "In this article, I will only (boringly) attempt to feebly predict future values of car de-registration here in Singapore. My Github repo for this project can be found here!", "All data can be found on Singstat table builder, which is a magnificent tool. The category of cars I will be looking at is Category B which are cars 1600cc and above, or the engine power output exceeds 97 kW. The data is in monthly series, with the first time point being Feb 1990. An initial scan of the time series plot showed a few outliers, which I decided to then clean using the tsclean function.", "Well, looks pretty much like any time series plot to me. I observed some form of a one-cycle behaviour (but we can\u2019t be too sure without more data points), with no obvious seasonalities and a general upward trend.", "Before running the data through any predictive models, I would first split them into training/test sets. For this post, the training set would be all data points up to March 2018, and I will be testing my model on the subsequent 4 months (April : July 2018). For illustration, the training and test data split is shown as the points on the left and right of the purple dashed line in the time series above.", "The first model I would like to try is an ARIMA model. Essentially, an ARIMA consists of an three components: an auto-regressive part (AR(p)), an integrated part (I(d)), and a moving average part (MA(q)). I\u2019d love to delve into more detail, but I do not think that I am the right person for it. For more technical explanations of ARIMA, I found the first link on a Google search of \u201cWhat is ARIMA\u201d to be most informative!", "My task here is to specify what exactly these three parameters (p,d,q) are, and this can be done manually \u2014 which is what I will do next, and automatically on R using the auto.arima function in the forecast package.", "For me to be able to fit an ARIMA model, the data must first be stationary. Stationary essentially just means that the time series\u2019 mean and variance are not functions of time. With this assumption, I think that it is quite clear from Figure 1 that this time series is not stationary. Just to confirm this, I plotted the ACF and PACF plots for the time series, as well as an Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test of stationarity to justify my claim:", "The high p-value of the ADF tells us that we do not reject the null, showing that the series is indeed non stationary. From the ACF/PACF plots, we can infer two things:", "In order to transform my non-stationary series into a stationary series, I will be differencing the series once, and running the same procedure as above to test if the differenced series is now stationary.", "Not bad, after differencing the series once, the ADF test now shows that the series is stationary, but ACF plot still show some signs of correlation with lags with a recurring pattern every 2 lags. Similarly, PACF plot shows a recurring pattern every 5 or 6 lags. Perhaps possible models would have parameters (p = 5:6, d = 1, q = 2)? For the sake of practice, I did loop through several combinations of (p,d,q) and chose the model with the lowest AIC value, and that can be seen in my script. However, for this post I would be showing results from the auto.arima function instead.", "Hey! At least I had two parameters right! The auto.arima function specified (p = 3, d = 1, and q = 2) as the optimal model Now, let us see if the model residuals make sense, and if I could use this model for future predictions.", "Hmmm. The model residuals seem to have varying variance, and there are significant spikes in the ACF and PACF plots especially recurring around lag 12. What can be done about this? Perhaps I could try setting p or q as 12 and see how that goes, or I could also have took a natural log of the series before proceeding with fitting an ARIMA model on it (on hindsight I should have done this earlier). Nonetheless, allow me to just use this current model for the forecasting of the next four months for illustration sake - noting that this model probably isn\u2019t the most correctly specified one.", "Well, the in-sample fit seems quite promising. There seems to be a lead of 1 period in my fitted values, but that is probably because of the h specification in the fitted function, which defines how many steps ahead it will forecast. What about the out-sample performance?", "Zooming in to the top right part of the graph (in blue) yields:", "Forecasted values for April to July 2018 seem a little bit off, but hey, I guess that is expected. I can imagine the multitude of macroeconomic and social factors/indicators that could have an effect on car de-registrations, hence expecting this model to predict future value solely based on its historical values may be pushing it a bit. In the future, maybe an ARIMAX model, whereby other explanatory variables are introduced could help improve model predictions.", "During my winter exchange in Vienna, I took mainly Machine Learning Applications modules, and was formally introduced to the various predictive models used in the modern world today. My professor then joked that \u201cshould you not know what to do with all the data you have, throw them into a random forest model and see what comes out\u201d. Why not we do just that?", "Behind the scenes, as can be seen in my script, some additional data preparation was necessary. TLDR:", "With that done and dusted, time to create a forest!", "For the implementation of Random Forest, I will be using the caret package, method = \u201crf\u201d. There is only one hyperparameter to tune, which is mtry. For this, I did a grid search to find out what the optimal value was. For cross validation procedures, I used the common 10-fold cross validation to reduce overfitting and increase robustness of my Random Forest.", "The results? Let us have a look at the in-sample performance of the Random Forest Model:", "Not bad! The predictions lack a bit in terms of predicting the spikes, but generally the trend is there. What about the out-sample performance?", "The RF model seems to be doing a lot better in terms of forecasting the April to July 2018 values. As you can see, at least for April and May the forecasted values seem to be very close to the actual values. However, it did failed to predict the drop in June, and its July predictions are slightly off.", "Meanwhile, let us view some of the relative importance of variables:", "One takeaway here would be that the first 7 \u201cmost important\u201d variables are lagged values. Now I know that it makes sense as we often look to what is happening in the current time period in order to make a decision for the next time period, but seeing it happen in a real world data set is just fascinating.", "Well, thats it! This marks the end of my first ever attempt at toying around with predictive modelling on a real world dataset (and not the usual iris or titanic datasets). Given that the automobile segment is such a big part of the consumer household spending in general, I am sure there are many applications in which these models can be used in - from a business perspective. It has been a very enjoyable process writing this post, and I would very much appreciate feedback and comments!", "Your home for data science.
