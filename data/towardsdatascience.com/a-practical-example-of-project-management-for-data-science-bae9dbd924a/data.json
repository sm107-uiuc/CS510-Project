It reviews project management tools that I\u2019ve personally found helpful in my former role. These descriptions and tools are likely very abstract if you\u2019ve never used them. So to help make it more understandable, I wrote this article to show exactly how you would apply this project management process to your data science question.", "In my earlier project, I decided to cluster publicly-listed companies based on calculated financial ratios. While I was not given this business problem, based on my domain expertise in Finance, I imagined the problem would be something like this:", "Our equity analysts analyze company financial data to determine the value of these companies. This is done by pulling public records like reported financials\u2014Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, etc.\u2014and calculating financial ratios that describe how well a company is operating. Financial ratios are more helpful than pure financials because it allows us to standardize across companies, regardless of how large a company is. When determining the value of a company, however, we often compare the financials within industries rather than across industries. That\u2019s because there are fundamental differences in how a company operates that affects their financials. For example, banks and other financial industry players have a price-to-book ratio (P/B) that is close to 1, while other industries can have higher multiples in the 3\u20135x range. Why is that, you ask? Because banks are in the business of refinancing, so their balance sheet (the size of their \u201cbook\u201d) is directly correlated with revenue generation (and ultimately, the \u201cprice\u201d that people are willing to pay). Other industries like consumer discretionary, for example, are expected to be able to generate more value or earnings with a smaller amount of assets. Up until now, we\u2019ve been using the reported industry for a company to compare its financial ratios to similar companies and determine if the company is undervalued or overvalued. However, recently a lot of companies have jumped on the technology bandwagon and describe themselves as tech companies, while their financials might paint a different story.\u00b9 Rather than grouping companies based on self-reported or pre-determined industry types, we would like to be able to \u201csee\u201d which companies are similar based on their financial ratios. We would like to use machine learning to determine company similarity and verify if it conforms with our process of comparison by industry\u2014and maybe even try to identify undervalued or overvalued companies based on which group or cluster they are placed in.", "So how did I approach this business problem? As you can tell toward the end of the business problem statement, I decided to take this into an unsupervised, machine learning direction. While the business would like to see if their assumptions are correct, we don\u2019t necessarily have \u201clabeled\u201d data \u2014 using industry to group companies is not the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer necessarily, so I didn\u2019t have target values for my data. Moreover, I thought using clustering algorithms would be my best bet because we are trying to find similar companies based on financial ratio features. After we cluster the companies, we can color the companies based on their industry to help our equity analysts discover what companies are clustered outside their industry.", "As mentioned in my previous blog article, RAID stands for Risks, Assumptions, Issues, and Dependencies. Once we think we understand the business problem and have outlined how we we would like to approach it from a data science point-of-view, it\u2019s best we log what we know in the form of assumptions, dependencies, and risks. This way, we can take our RAID log to the equity analysts and make sure not only our understanding of the business problem is correct, but also that our stakeholders are in agreement of our approach and understanding of the data.", "Based on our problem, let\u2019s list out some assumptions that we might make. Note that the process of listing our assumptions gives us implications that will guide our project:", "Notice how as we continued to write out our assumptions, we flowed naturally from what the business told us about the business problem to what data is available (publicly-listed companies), where we will source the data (10-Q filings), and how we expect that data to look (consistent across all companies). If we return to the business with these assumptions, we might be informed that there exists an internal data source that we were not aware about. Perhaps one that already has all the ratios calculated to save us time. While this time-saving fact might have come up during our first meeting, if the business assumed we knew about this internal data warehouse (but, as a new data scientist, we didn\u2019t) and we assumed that the business would\u2019ve told us if a data source already existed (which might not have crossed their minds to tell us), a lot of effort might be duplicated. Best practice is to review and confirm all assumptions with your stakeholders.", "For the purposes of this thought experiment, let\u2019s proceed with having our assumptions hold true.", "We tend not to think of dependencies until they start to negatively affect our project process. At that point, our stakeholders or senior management are fed up with us because this was something that should\u2019ve been identified and remediated earlier. That\u2019s why listing out dependencies throughout the project as we identify them is crucial to identify the beginnings of slippage and remediate them before it affects the project deadline.", "For our example, let\u2019s assume that the dependencies we identified at the beginning of the project are as follows:", "We usually include the delivery date of the dependency and agree on the date with the delivery team, so everyone knows how their work affects the project progress. Notice how we identify mitigating actions prior to the dependency actually becoming an issue (the I in RAID). Doing so allows us to think clearly and line up resources before panic mode turns off our ability to think about creative solutions. It also forces us to do our due diligence, such as identifying where can we get industry classification or what are the various ways 10-Q data can be sourced.", "These dependencies were written assuming that this project required the assistance of several teams to complete. In fact, most projects require cross collaboration, even if they are primarily data science projects. For solo projects, these dependencies can be simpler, and may include dependencies between different project phases (e.g. data must be sourced and financial ratio calculations drafted before continuing to the feature engineering phase).", "Risks can sometimes be confused with dependencies (the risk that the dependency is not met) or assumptions (the risk that the assumption is not met). While the identification of assumptions or dependencies can illuminate underlying risks that we didn\u2019t notice up until that point, they are not the same. Note how some risks are informed by assumption #3 but are fleshed out as risks:", "Listing out risks can be difficult. Especially if you don\u2019t have a lot of experience, it can be hard to come up with risks at the beginning of the project\u2014you just don\u2019t have the experience to know where things can possibly go wrong. There are two ways to help you identify risks. One, ask the different teams (the equity researchers, the data engineering team, the data science team) what they are afraid of. Two, if your company has been in the good habit of documenting their data science projects, look at old RAID logs or even post mortem documents to see where possible pitfalls may lie.", "Moreover, as the project continues as you report progress and ask questions of the various teams, risks are naturally identified. Continue to update the RAID log throughout the process. In fact, the good habit of regularly updating the RAID log will keep your ears perked for underlying risks.", "The WBS breaks your project into workstreams and further into smaller categories until we get to the smallest piece of work, usually a single task. These tasks are mutually exclusive and completely exhaustive of all the work that is necessary to complete your project. While it is often advised to complete your WBS to identify dependencies, I like to think of the two being created in tandem\u2014as you identify dependencies, you are informed of how the project naturally splits into workstreams (or functional areas) and identifying tasks can clarify which tasks need to come first and what dependencies exist.", "Data Science Process Frameworks are a great start to creating the WBS. While there are a number of these frameworks, including CRISP-DM, KDD, and OSEMN, don\u2019t let the anxiety of \u201cchoosing the right one\u201d prevent you from using one\u2014any one\u2014as a great starting point. I\u2019ll use OSEMN as an example:", "As you can see, if you work in a large organization, each of these steps in the OSEMN framework can have a different team that is responsible for it (as marked). This shows how each stage in the process naturally cleaves off from the others. While the stages can occur at the same time in an iterative fashion, especially between creating models and interpreting the results, the team or group that is responsible for each stage is different. This makes the breakdown of our work into the 6 workstreams above natural and easy. Let\u2019s focus on # 4 Modeling and create a more detailed WBS:", "(An aside: Note that some Data Science Process Frameworks include business understanding or data understanding as a part of the process. We don\u2019t have a workstream for that stage because the initiation of a project occurs after we conduct all the analysis and determine if we want to proceed with our project or not. As such, that is not included in our WBS)", "Notice how I fleshed out some tasks for the K-means clustering model. This is a great way to think through what needs to be identified prior to using the model (e.g. the number of clusters), what model assumptions we should check for violation (e.g. cluster shape and cluster size), and some hyperparamters we would like to run (e.g. steps 4.1.3.1 to 4.1.3.4). This informs us how long things will take \u2014 if we know running a model on different hyperparamters takes 2\u20133 hours, listing out all the models we intend to run can help us calculate how long the project is reasonably expected to take. This can be great help in either advocating for more time or reducing hyperparameter searching right off the bat.", "Documenting tasks in a WBS also forces us to systematically review things like model assumptions, making our scientific process more robust and documenting that the necessary steps were taken. You may have also noticed that parts of the WBS may be reused from project to project\u2014if our next project also requires clustering, we already have a proven format to follow.", "Lastly, we can identify dependencies between our tasks and be able to assign tasks to team members. If we have more than one ML researcher assigned to this project, we might assign one to run K-means clustering while the other researcher fits and runs a hierarchical clustering model in parallel. Or, if we only have one researcher, it again gives us good footing to argue for more time or more ML researchers when the project is discussed with senior management.", "As I briefly mentioned, these project management tools should be constantly reassessed and updated as the project goes on. For example, when I was working on my Financials for Dummies project \u2014 which is blog is based on\u2014I realized that my assumptions about the data being consistent across companies was incorrect. And it turned from a \u201crisk\u201d into a fully realized \u201cissue.\u201d Since I didn\u2019t have additional time to complete my project, that meant I needed to take mitigating actions such as reducing the number of calculated financial ratios and cutting out several machine learning clustering models.", "While I didn\u2019t have any stakeholders to keep informed, this escalation of unrealized risk to actual issue is a great way to stave off finger-pointing and focus conversations on actual issue remediation. This is because the risk was identified prior to the project and presumably accepted as acceptable by both stakeholders and management. Better still, get in the habit of documenting the risk acceptance by the business in the RAID log itself!", "In general, projects are said to be a triangle where the sides are cost, scope, and time. That is, if the length of a side such as scope increases, we must adjust either the size or cost of the project, or else . the project is not feasible. And if an issue arises and time cannot be changed, that means that something needs to budge in cost (throwing more computing power or people at the problem) or scope (cutting out tasks you had planned to do). Here are some ways you can approach issue resolution in your own data science projects:", "This is the easiest solution to any problems that might come up, but it is only an option if time is not an issue (or, not as much of an issue as shopping a sloppily-completed model). Be honest and even give an inflated estimate of how long it will take to resolve the issue. Chances are, resolution will take 1.5x longer than you think.", "What\u2019s great about creating a WBS and assigning the tasks to people is that you are able to identify who is free. Maybe a data analyst who can assist in running a machine learning model. Or maybe they can assist in the data cleaning. This gives the various teams a chance to use their skills in adjacent areas, especially if it was a skill that they may have exercised at a previous job but have no need to use in their current role. Note that this only works if the current project takes priority over other responsibilities or if senior management re-arranges priorities to allow them to focus on the current project. Otherwise, hiring an additional data engineer on a part-time or short-term basis can help.", "We start off very ambitious, but things often don\u2019t go according to plan. You can also use the WBS to strike out tasks that are more \u201cnice-to-haves.\u201d For example, you might only need to run 2\u20133 variations of clustering models instead of the 5 listed on the WBS. And based on your understanding of the data, it might not make sense to proceed with all 5 after the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) is complete. This way, as you proceed through the project, you can continue to adjust time allocated to each task while still keeping yourself on track.", "This is one of the most commonly used issue resolution tactics because it allows you to have your cake and eat it too. How does that work?", "Projects are delayed because tasks are delayed. And that sounds really obvious. But when you think about the repercussions of a task being delayed, it means that the time another team has to complete their tasks is reduced due to the dependent task being late or necessary data not being delivered. When that happened in professional experience, we would take an iterative approach to delivery. The entire model document is not ready for hand off to be reviewed? Then send just the first couple of chapters. Or better still, send the draft and get feedback early.", "This strategy, however, can be a double-edged sword. While iterating can be time-saving if, for example, the next group identifies an issue with the approach and the delayed team can change their approach mid-way. The problem is that it can be a waste of time for the group that is doing the review or using the data before it is ready. My suggestion is to always ask for more time or resources, rather than hoping that an iterative approach will save time. It might, but can also increase workload.", "Lastly, for a solo project, this approach can be difficult to implement. One idea is to structure your projects that will allow you to continue data cleaning or feature engineering as you run models or particularly time-intensive processes.", "As I mentioned, when working on my Financials For Dummies project, I assumed that all financial statements would look the same across all companies. This was not the case. And since I was working under a tight, one-week deadline by myself, my only option was to scale back the scope.", "By planning out my project, I was able to identify early on that I was falling behind. I was incentivized to reach out to my coaches and ask for help dealing with the long-format data sooner rather than later.", "While I was unable to create as many or as varied features\u2014financial ratios\u2014as I had wanted, I was able to recognize when I needed to \u201cprioritize\u201d (on easily calculated ratios) and move on.", "When the project comes to a close, the RAID log and the WBS end up as excellent documentation of all the risks, issues, assumptions (that either were confirmed as true or disproved as false), dependencies, and tasks. And it turns into an excellent resource for post mortem analysis of why your data science project went awry and how to prevent it from doing so in the future. And, as you use these tools more and more, they become re-usable templates that can save you precious time and energy thinking through all minute tasks that need to be completed.", "I admit, when I first started working as a project manager, it was difficult to identify risks and dependencies. I couldn\u2019t zoom out to see the full picture and how things fit together. This is the most important skill of a project manger, however, and the best project managers are able to rearrange and reprioritize before risks become true issues. But as I continued to follow a structured approach and forced myself to think about projects in terms of risks, dependencies, assumptions, issues and tasks, I was better able to handle any wrenches in the projects.", "So I encourage you to try out these tools and see how it works for you. And if you have real-world experience managing a data science project, let me know some pitfalls, difficulties, and cleve solutions you have.", "Your home for data science.
