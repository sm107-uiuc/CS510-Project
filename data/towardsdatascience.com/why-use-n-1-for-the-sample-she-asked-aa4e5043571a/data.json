We had 5 self-proclaimed estimation experts to estimate the mean with varying sampling choice:", "Let\u2019s take the example of the first estimation expert having a choice of a sample size of two. With his first sample, he estimated the sample mean to be 160 cm based on the mean of two derived values \u2014 155 cm and 165 cm.", "Notice the fact that the estimation expert doesn\u2019t know the population mean all throughout his practice of estimation and his best guess of the population according to him is the mean of two observations he derived from the population. It is obvious to us as we are well aware of the population distribution and the population mean but according to him one best feasible position of the population mean is the mean of collected observations, also we are well aware that it is the mean around which the variance measure is minimum. So when we write the formula for variance calculation using N (as in population statistics), notice what is going wrong when we try to estimate it with sample data:", "Big Green bars reflect feasible population mean positions (for our data it is the big red bar-actual position). The point of the above representation is to put an idea in your mind that the population mean could be anywhere and the variance associated with it will always be greater than the variance estimated using the mean of the sample data by the estimation expert.", "Notice how our actual variance has been under-estimated by the current formula.", "Clarifying further, the Estimation expert gives the best estimate in the form of the mean of the sample data which again repeating is one of the feasible positions of the population mean. The population mean here (170) as we know is to the right of the estimated mean (160) but it can be anywhere if we were working with some other data set. Assuming the population mean position at the mean of sample data deflates the variance measure in the sense that the variance is lowest around the mean of the sample data. This is the only reason why we need to inflate the variance measure with manipulation in the denominator, replacing n with n-1 to compensate for under-estimation.", "If a thought comes into your mind that by using the modified formula too we are still not doing a good job at estimating, recollect that estimations improve when we increase the sample size (here in this example we are taking only a sample size of two, increase in the sample size will eventually reflect in the accuracy of estimations)", "*This concept is also proven in the Central Limit Theorem blog in detail", "When we take a sample out of a population data, it is obvious that its mean gets fixed (a constant value):", "Now if I give someone 4 data points of this sample along with the sample mean (which is fixed), would he/she be able to solve for the 5th data point? The answer is yes!", "This is the key point, in sample statistics we lose one degree of freedom because there is a constraint of the sample mean (fixed). That\u2019s why we always deduct 1 from the sample size = n-1", "This n-1 correction is originally known as Bessel\u2019s correction and if you are interested in detailed derivation, please do refer to the below-mentioned link:", "For population statistics, we don\u2019t have any constraint because population data points selection doesn\u2019t have any impact on the actual population mean, that\u2019s why N is used as the denominator for computations.", "That\u2019s it for this blog, I hope this simplified explanation has finally cleared the doubt of using n-1 instead of n in the denominator for sample statistical measures that get underestimated. The only source of bias originates from the estimation exercise which is the only realistic way of reaching a close approximation of population statistical measures. The ultimate conclusion is to make biased variance output(underestimated - obtained via sample computation) unbiased by inflating the same using Bessel's correction.", "I will be covering a lowkey yet very important concept of \u2018degrees of freedom\u2019 in the upcoming blogs since it is of great relevance to address major interpretation challenges in statistics, keep a watch", "Your home for data science.
