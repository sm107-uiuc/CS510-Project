The Google Play Store is one of the most used digital distribution services in the world, with tons of apps and users. Because of it, there is a lot of data available regarding the apps and their users\u2019 evaluations.The project was solicited as part of the course of Data Science I at the Instituto Metr\u00f3pole Digital, part of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, in Natal, Brazil to practice the subjects learned in class.", "In this project, we will search for trends in the Google Play Store Apps dataset available in Kaggle. For this purpose, we will determine some initial hypotheses and try to find information that helps to consolidate it. We are going to work on this project with Python using Google Colab.The code used for this project is available in this GitHub repository.", "The packages used in this project are:", "Through the Kaggle API, we can download the dataset. Our main dataset contains information about apps available at the Google Play Store and there is also a secondary dataset with information about the reviews for the apps.", "The reviews dataset contains a lot of null observations. Since we will work with numeric data and can\u2019t identify the value of the missing data, it\u2019s better to completely drop those observations.The column Translated Review won\u2019t be used in this project, so we can drop it as well. Also, the names of the columns can be optimized.There are multiple reviews for each app so we need to work with it.", "As we can see with the unique method, the Sentiment column assumes three values: negative, neutral, and positive. Knowing this, we can apply a Likert scale to evaluate this information as numeric values.Likert scale is the most common psychometric scale for questionnaires. It consists of asking the respondent to evaluate something in a range from negative to positive.For this project, the Likert scale will be -1 for negative, 0 for neutral, and 1 for positive. This way, when calculating the mean we obtain a number between -1 and 1 where higher values imply more positive reviews, lower values more negative reviews, and closer to zero neutrals.", "The function merge will do almost entirely the work needed. The common column is the app name, which is the index of reviews_mean. As the index kept the name \u201cApp\u201d, the function can still access it. The default \u201cinner\u201d method will keep only the observations with values in both datasets.The resulting dataset has 1229 observations in comparison with the 865 observations of reviews_mean. This means that for some reason, there are apps in our dataset with multiple appearances. Dropping duplicates will ensure there is only one observation for each app.", "Now, we will only select the columns needed and change the value at the Installs column to numeric.", "First of all, let\u2019s establish some initial hypotheses. Those can be things that seem logical before looking into the data or an initial guess.", "Let\u2019s check how our data is now. For that, we want to see the histograms for Sentiment and Rating. If our hypothesis is true, if there are a lot of high values for sentiment, there will be a lot of high values for rating also, implying a high correlation between those two variables in our dataset.", "Looking at the histograms, we can see a positive trend for both columns. In the Sentiment aspect, the majority of the values are above neutral (0), at around 0,5 for a range of -1 to 1. But for the Rating column, this trend looks way more significant, with a lot of the values being around 4 and 5 for a range of 0 to 5.", "The median can help to visualize it. As a second resource, we can plot a line graph of Sentiment by Rating and see the behavior of the line. If the sentiment influences the rating, we could expect a close to a straight line moving upwards.", "First, we need to separate the content types (free and paid). Then, we can get the mean for each category.", "As we can see, the mean for paid content is just slightly above the mean for free content. But the difference does not appear to be enough to support our hypothesis. Also, there are only 9 paid apps, that may mislead the information due to a low number of observations.", "In our dataset, we have the column Installs, containing the number of times that app was installed by grouping it and ordering, we obtain the rank of popularity for the categories.", "Let\u2019s check how the sentiments comport as we go down through the popularity rankings. We will be using a gradient line to help us in seeing the changes in the graphics.", "All of our three hypotheses were somehow observed in the analysis section. Since we are only trying to see the macrostate of the data to guess things about it, without using any real information test or inference, we can\u2019t make any assumption. Still, the work in this project can help to create a better hypothesis.", "There are many viable ways of continuing this project in future works. First, it\u2019s possible to assume other hypotheses and try to visualize it as we did.Another possibility is to verify the hypothesis presented here through statistical tests and methods.", "By last, one can approach the dataset with inferential methods to try to find new information about it. For example, a Chi-Squared test can be applied to the Likert Scale utilized here.", "Your home for data science.
