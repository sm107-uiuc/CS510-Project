We can get clarity or the answer to a simple problem very quickly.\u201d \u2014 David McCandless", "Visualizing data is one of the essential steps in any data science project. It makes it easier to find patterns, detect anomalies, and communicate your results efficiently.", "The process of visualizing data, however, can be a bit tricky. Today, there are so many plotting tools and libraries that we can use to bring our data to life through charts and colors. Some tools are quite extravagant and expensive.", "So, how can one decide what to use?", "Well, this article will \u2014 hopefully \u2014 help you answer that question.", "In this article, we will cover the top 10 plotting libraries in Python; we will go through some usage examples and how to choose one of them for your next visualization adventure.", "Before we get into that, let\u2019s first talk about the two types of plots we can generate.", "When plotting any information, we have options to choose from; we can either generate a static plot or a dynamic one.", "Static plots contain graphs displaying constant relations between two or more variables. That is, once the plot is created, it can\u2019t be changed by the user. In static plots, the users can\u2019t change any aspects of the plot.", "Dynamic plots \u2014 also known as interactive plots \u2014 are used when the developer/ designer wants the users to interact with the plot, changing some aspects of it and getting more familiar with the data used to create it.", "Okay, so you have some data that you want to visualize, but you don\u2019t know where to start. Let me help you out. Whenever I start a project and need to create some visualizations, I often ask myself 4 questions that lead me to the right choice.", "The first thing you need to decide is which plot type do you need, static or dynamic? Usually, static plots are used in printouts, technical papers, or reports. In this case, you need to tell your audience something and not to interact with the plot itself.", "However, if you\u2019re using the plot in an online tutorial, in a class, or any web application, where the users can play around with the data to understand it better or to use it elsewhere, then you should create a dynamic plot.", "This is a crucial thing to consider. If your data is private and is not publically available, then you need to use static plots. But, if the data is stored on public service that doesn\u2019t require special permission to access, then a dynamic plot may be a better option.", "Once I have made my decision to use static vs. dynamic plotting. I ask myself, what is the priority of my visualization? Do I need it to be complicated with many layers? Answering this question helps choose the correct library to use.", "Finally, I ask myself what kind of plotting do I need? Is it a simple chart? Bar, column, pie, or donut? Or do I need to plot something more specialized such as a network or a map?", "Suppose I need to visualize general information, then using any library that offers my desired chart type. However, if I need to create a map or a network, that will limit my options and help me make the decision faster.", "Python is one of the most used programming languages in data science and many other applications. However, due to its popularity, Python has so many data visualization libraries to choose from. The wide variety of options is both a good and a bad thing.", "Having many options mean you can choose the library the matches your targets entirely, but it can be too confusing to new people joining the field and to experts deciding what to choose.", "Here, I will go through the top 10 Python libraries out there, how and when to use them. I divide those libraries into two categories, libraries used to plot static charts, and those used for dynamic graphs.", "We can\u2019t talk about data visualization in Python without mentioning the first and oldest Python visualization library of them all, Matplotlib. Matplotlib is an opensource library that was created back in 2003 with a syntax close to MATLAB. Since then, the library has gained a lot of love and support than continues to this day.", "Many Python packages are built upon Matplotlib core. For example, Seaborn and Pandas act as wrappers around Matplotlib, allowing the user to create graphs with fewer lines of code.", "Seaborn is one of the libraries build upon Matplotlib. It acts as a wrapper to provide users with a high-level alternative to Matplotlib. You can create the same visualization as Matplotlib but with much fewer lines of code.", "Since Seaborn is built upon Matplotlib, it contains the same charts type as Matplotlib in addition to some cool charts such as Heatmaps and Violin charts. Seaborn can also be used to give Matplotlib charts more visually appealing.", "Back in 1993, a fantastic book was published. The Grammar of Graphics presented a layered rule guide for designers and data scientists to create beautiful, meaningful, and useful data visualizations.", "If you used R before, Plotnine was built with similar syntax and as an implementation of the different aspects presented in the Grammar of Graphics book, and it\u2019s based on the popular R library ggplot.", "NetworkX is a Python library that is not solely for visualization. It is instead a package created to analyze, manipulate, and study the structure of complex networks.", "NetworkX is one of those libraries that are field-specific or area-specific; that is, you can\u2019t generate any charts using this library. For example, you can\u2019t create a bar or pie chart using NetworkX.", "Whenever you start a new data science project, you will need to perform some data exploration to understand your data better. One very annoying thing that often happens is coming across missing data entries. As a data scientist, missing data entries is one of the most challenging tasks in the entire project.", "Well, Missingno is here to the rescue. It allows the user to test the dataset for missing entry by providing a visual summary of the dataset. So, instead of going through rows and rows of numbers, you can filter and sort the data based on completion and correlation between variables.", "Plotly is a Javascript-based module to generate and manipulate interactive visualizations. With Plotly, you can create unique charts like dendrograms, 3D charts, and contour plots. Most of these charts types you cannot generate through most of the other libraries.", "Moreover, Plotly has many built-in applications for machine learning and data science, which makes it easier to implement and visualize standard algorithms such as ML regression and kNN classifications.", "Similar to Plotly, Bokeh is a Javascript-based package that allows you to create stunning interactive visualizations. Besides, similar to Plotnine, Bokeh is an implementation of the rules presented in the Grammar of Graphics.", "Bokeh provides three levels of control to accommodate different user types. The highest level allows you to create standard charts, such as bar, pie, scatter, and so on. The middle level offers some level of specificity as Matplotlib and allows you to control the basic building blocks of each chart. Finally, the lowest level gives you full control of every element of the chart.", "Gleam is a Python library that is inspired by the R Shiny library. It is built to allow Python developers to create interactive data visualization for the web.", "Gleam puts it all together and creates a web interface that lets anyone play with your data in real-time, making it easier than ever to help others understand and interpret your data.", "Altair is a simple, user-friendly, and consistent statistical visualization python library based on Vega-Lite. Altair allows you to create meaningful, elegant, and useful visualizations fast with just a few lines of code.", "Folium is a beautiful Python geovisualization library used for plotting maps. Folium uses the mapping abilities of the Leaflet.js enabling interactive map visualizations.", "Folium gives you the ability to zoom in and out on your maps, click and drag them, or even add markers on them.", "Data visualization is the way a developer or a data scientist communicate their data to a broad audience. Building better, effective data visualization is a valuable skill that every data scientist must work on developing.", "Whenever you want to create some visualizations, here\u2019s a rule of thumb to follow, if you\u2019re new to data science and Python and only want to create static charts, go with Seaborn. For network analysis, use NetworkX. If you want to create interactive visualization to present, use Plotly, but if you want to use this visualization for the web, then go with Gleam. Finally, if you want to create interactive maps, Folium is your friend.", "In the end, you can create compelling visualizations no matter what library you choose. And remember, complex is not always the answer. Always go with the library the provides the features you want fro your visualizations.", "Your home for data science.
