In my latest Youtube video, I used text mining techniques to develop the ultimate data-driven drinking game rules for the upcoming Presidential debates. This post will walk you through exactly how I did that.", "To start, I scraped the transcripts from campaign rallies, speeches, and any other events that have taken place in the last few weeks during which Biden or Trump (or both!) spoke. The full list of events I scraped can be seen in the Github repo for this project (see the \u201cdebates.csv\u201d file).", "I scraped the transcripts from rev.com (with their permission!) because it seemed to have the most exhaustive list of election 2020 events, and because the transcripts followed a standardized format, which made the scraping process easier. Here\u2019s the function I used to scrape the transcripts:", "The above function takes in two arguments \u2014 the URL to the transcript hosted on rev.com, and the \u201cseparator.\u201d The \u201cseparator\u201d refers to the character that\u2019s used to denote who is speaking for each line; for most transcripts, the separator is \u201cparenthesis\u201d (eg. follows the format below).", "Chris Wallace: (01:20)Good evening from the Health Education Campus of \u2026", "If the separator is not a parenthesis, I assume the regex expression I wrote assumes that it will be a colon (eg. follows the format below). You may have to modify the regex expressions depending on the transcript format.", "Chris Wallace:Good evening from the Health Education Campus of \u2026", "The scraping function should return a dataframe that will look similar to this.", "And once you\u2019ve scraped all of the transcripts and concatenated the dataframes, we\u2019re ready to move on to the text analysis!", "Before we can begin the text analysis, we have to prepare the dataframes. Even though I scraped the transcripts from the same website, the naming conventions are inconsistent \u2014 Biden, for example, is sometimes referred to as \u201cJoe Biden\u201d and sometimes as \u201cVice President Joe Biden.\u201d", "I simply called pd.unique() on the \u201cname\u201d column of the dataframe so that I could see all of the name variations for each candidate. I then created a dictionary and used pd.replace() to replace all of these variations.", "Then you can use the following \u201cgetSpeech\u201d function and code to construct the corpus.", "I then used the sklearn library to calculate the \u201ctf-idf\u201d statistic. Tf-Idf stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, and is a good measure for calculating the importance of a word. Not only does it consider frequency of a phrase, but it also devalues general phrases (eg. \u201cthank you for that question\u2026\u201d) that might be said by both candidates \u2014 this ensures that the final phrases will be unique to Trump or Biden.", "After calculating the tf-idf score on each object in the corpus and transforming the columns, you\u2019ll get dataframes that might look like this:", "Couple things to note: firstly, the script only identifies three or four word phrases (not including stop words). So words like \u201ca,\u201d \u201cto,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are eliminated, which leaves some of these phrases unintelligeble. The full phrase of \u201cdon know don,\u201d for example, is \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t.\u201d And the full phrase of \u201crunning proud Democrat\u201d is \u201crunning as a proud Democrat.\u201d", "Secondly, the fact that these phrases in the outputted dataframe are only three or four words long can present a number of problems. It means that crucial words may be left out \u2014 the full phrase of \u201cgoing raise taxes\u201d is actually \u201cnot going to raise taxes.\u201d It also means that longer phrases may be broken into smaller chunks and are overrepresented in the table. One of Biden\u2019s more common phrases is \u201cGod bless you all and may God protect the troops,\u201d and this phrase was broken into rows 7, 9, 10 and 11 in the dataframe.", "And finally, the tf-idf score does not indicate frequency \u2014 it is a combination of both frequency and uniqueness of a phrase. This is why the phrase \u201cthank thank thank\u201d shows up for both candidates \u2014 it is not unique, but was said so many times that it appears in the top 10 list. Still, it\u2019s not at the top of the list even though it\u2019s by far the most common. (And it\u2019s worth noting that neither Biden nor Trump actually said this phrase. It\u2019s referring to when the moderator says \u201cThank you Mr. President. Thank you President. Thank you \u2026.\u201d when a candidate goes over time).", "To count how many times each phrase was said, you\u2019ll have to manually look through your debates transcript CSV. Or at least, that\u2019s what I did.", "After cleaning replacing the stop words and reordering the phrases by frequency, we finally have the drinking game rules for the presidential debate on Thursday!", "Confused about some of these phrases? I explain the context behind each of these phrases in my video, check it out!", "Happy drinking! Please remember to drink (and vote!) responsibly.", "Your home for data science.
