Social media has also transformed the way information is presented to us, with apps like Instagram and Pinterest focusing mostly on visual content over text. This makes it less appealing to read large swathes of text when we have to.", "But what if those large swathes of text could be converted into a summary of just the key points? In comes machine learning to the rescue again.", "Summarization has been a task of interest to the Natural Language Processing community for many years now and there are 2 broad approaches used: abstractive and extractive. The abstractive method focuses on understanding the entire text and generating a summary one word at a time. Extractive summarization, on the other hand, focuses on selecting important information (typically sentences) from the text and stitching them together to form a summary.", "Abstractive summaries are often more concise than extractive models but may be grammatically incorrect because generating words based on probabilities isn\u2019t the most intuitive way to write summaries. However, both these approaches suffer from a common problem. They can\u2019t keep track of long-range context in a document. For example, if a news article talked about Leo Messi in the 1st paragraph and mentioned him again in the 4th, both these approaches would struggle to link the contexts of those mentions. For abstractive models (which are mostly Seq2Seq models), this is because Seq2Seq models give more importance to more recent words than the others while extractive models are generally meant for a few sentences or a paragraph rather than a whole document.", "The researchers at Microsoft Dynamics 365 AI Research aim to improve these summarization techniques by proposing their own model, Discourse-Aware BERT for Text Extraction (DiscoBERT). The name gives away the fact that it\u2019s an extractive model, but with a twist. Unlike other extractive models, DiscoBERT extracts Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs, which are parts of sentences), rather than sentences for its summary. This helps the generated summary be concise because a whole sentence may contain some irrelevant information which don\u2019t exist in EDUs.", "It also solves the long-range context problem by creating 2 different graphs of the document. The first graph, the RST graph, is based on Rhetorical Structure Theory. This theory claims that the structure of text can be boiled down to a tree of independent units. In a similar fashion, the RST graph tries to analyze the dependency among these units and identify their roles in the sentence. The second graph, the Coreference graph, focuses on building an understanding of the key entities (people, organizations and more), events and themes that are being discussed throughout the text.", "Through these 2 graphs, DiscoBERT understands what the important areas of the text are and ranks the EDUs based on this. To generate the summary, DiscoBERT selects the top N ranked EDUs (with dependencies also being taken into account) and stitches them together chronologically.", "The researchers validate DiscoBERT by running it on 2 news datasets, one comprised of articles from The New York Times and the other from CNN and DailyMail which require a model to summarize each article. DiscoBERT achieves new state of the art performance on both these datasets.", "\u201cMost industrial news apps did well on news recommendation, but we want to deliver the news in a more efficient and accessible way. \u201d said Jingjing Liu, Senior Principal Research Manager from Microsoft Dynamics 365 AI Research who oversees the project. So the next time you\u2019re on a short bus ride and want a quick brief of the daily news, let DiscoBERT come to your rescue!", "Here\u2019s a link to the paper if you want to know more about DiscoBERT, a link to the code if you want to try to train it to summarize your stories, reports and more and click here to see more of our publications and other work.", "1.
