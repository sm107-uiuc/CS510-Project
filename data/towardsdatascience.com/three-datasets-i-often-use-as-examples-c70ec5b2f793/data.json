This article outlines three datasets that often serve me as sandbox examples with others at work and in other settings.", "When establishing a data-driven culture, a successful tactic that can promote the use of a shared data-driven vocabulary and then also development of data-driven conversations is to create play spaces. The importance of engaging in data-driven conversations is that they build shared understandings of data-related ideas and topics. What is culture, other than shared ideas, language, customs, conventions, and similar?", "This article first explains what a dataset is. This article then provides an excerpt from, and a description of, three datasets that I often use or offer to others as shared sandbox play spaces.", "Wikipedia defines a dataset as \u201ca collection of data.\u201d This definition is too simplistic for purposes of building a shared data-driven vocabulary, engaging in a data-driven conversation, and establishing or growing a data-driven culture. A previous article gives a better definition: A dataset is a collection of observations stored in a tabular format where each row is one observation and where each column contains a data point that pertains to a characteristic of an observation.", "This dataset comes from Stata Corp, the makers of Stata which is a popular statistical programming language. In a companion article, I have used this automobile dataset to illustrate why researchers and data scientists sometimes refer to columns as either dimensions or variables.", "Here in Figure 1a, there is one row for each vehicle model. Then for each vehicle model, there is a column for specific observable characteristics such as miles per gallon (mpg), weight (weight), length (length), etc.", "To build this dataset, one or more scientists referenced a catalog of information for each make and model listed on the left-most column. Then for each column, the scientist observed that vehicle\u2019s characteristics. The results of those characteristic observations were then recorded in the dataset columns.", "To explore Stata\u2019s Auto dataset on your own in Python use the code shown here. From Pandas it is possible to export the Auto dataset to CSV, as shown.", "The iris dataset is canonical and widely cited. Many have used this iris data as an example when demonstrating a broad range of analytical techniques. Figure 2, displays an expert of this dataset. Also shown in Figure 2 is code that will load and display an excerpt of this data.", "In this dataset there is an observation for each flower. There is one row per observation (one row per flower). To build this dataset, scientists collected flowers and then observed a variety of characteristics such as sepal length & width along with petal length & width. As with all datasets which have been properly configured for research or analysis, there is a column for each observable characteristic of interest and one row for each observation.", "Figure 3a displays an excerpt of data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). This data is publicly available from the National Center for Education Statistics. I maintain a GitHub.com repository that discusses this data.", "In this data, there is an observation for each institution and for each year. With the addition of a column for year, this dataset could also be called a panel or longitudinal dataset. The Auto and Iris dataset would be called cross-sectional datasets. Generally, cross-sectional data represents a single moment in time. Panel datasets represent multiple repeated observations of the same subjects over time.", "Given that this data includes one observation per row, per institution, (per year) it is optimized for an analysis in which the unit of analysis will be institutions of higher education over time. There are columns for specific observable characteristics. In this case the institution type (sector), the institution size (instsize), and the institution\u2019s state (stabbr), etc.", "I am fond of using this dataset for demonstration purposes because it is data to which many can relate. For example, I am twice an alumni of The University of Wisconsin and I have twice been an employee of Duke University. Thus, I know these two institutions well enough to use them as test cases when I prototype, finalize, put into production, or otherwise disseminate any given analysis. I demonstrate a Wisconsin-Duke comparison below in figure 3b.", "I maintain a tool that retrieves from the US Department of Education\u2019s website IPEDS data and then assembles that data in a manner that is optimized for research and analytical purposes.", "This article seeks to explain what a dataset is in a simple manner. Equipped with this simple definition, that is generalizable to many research and analytical tasks, individuals and organizations can better engage in high-quality data-driven discussions.", "Working to define, as a group, the meaning of key terms and phrases, such as \u2018dataset,\u2019 is an important task in the process of establishing, building, and maintaining a data-driven culture.", "After discussing what a dataset is, this article then gives three examples of datasets that I and others frequently reference as model datasets. Having one or more model datasets is useful for individuals and teams because they provide a shared sandbox in which thoughts and ideas about data can be tested. These shared sandboxes promote high-quality data-driven discussions which then support establishing, building, and maintaining data-driven cultures.", "If you like what I have to say, find more at: adamrossnelson.medium.com.", "Thanks for reading.
