Because the commodity state-of-the-art models, better tooling and better access to hardware: machine learning is becoming an everyday tool in the companies\u2019 toolbox.", "The ML democratization is still an on-going trend and given the disruption in this space it\u2019s worth asking: where will this transformation take us? What the future of the everyday ML will look like?", "Predictive queries are an interesting take on machine learning, especially in the ML democratization context. Solutions like MIT\u2019s BayesLite and Aito provide a way to get arbitrary predictions instantly with SQL-like queries. As an example, here\u2019s a predictive query in Aito:", "As such: the predictive queries seem like an easier, faster and radically different way to do machine learning. They give a glimpse of a future, where anyone can do machine learning as easily as one does database queries.", "This article gives a brief introduction to the predictive queries, and it compares the predictive queries to supervised learning through 3 different aspects that are:", "Predictive queries resemble normal database queries with the exception that they provide predictions about the unknown, while the traditional database queries provide facts about the known. Here\u2019s an example of the BQL (Bayesian Query Language) query done against BayesLite database:", "In essence, the predictive queries can provide a very SQL-like alternative to the supervised ML models with the key differences that:", "Only few solutions exist, that provide such predictive queries. One is the mentioned BayesLite, which creates an in-memory multi-purpose models in a special preparation phase. Another solution is Aito.ai, which does query-time narrow modeling without explicit preparations. Here\u2019s is an example of the Aito workflow.", "We are focusing the following comparisons on Aito. We feel this focus is justified as in Aito we are more familiar with the solution, and it is mature enough to serve the end customers in live production settings. While BayesLite is extremely impressive and their BQL interface and DB/ML integration are worth envy: BayesLite seems to have properties like the 16 minute preparation phase for simple data, which are not consistent with the presented arguments.", "So let\u2019s next dig deeper on the difference in workflow, architecture and quality between the predictive queries and supervised ML models.", "The first difference between predictive queries and the traditional supervised models relates to the workflow and the costs.", "Supervised ML models are deployed typically in data science projects, which have several steps like the handover to the data scientist, data preparation, feature engineering, model fitting, deployment, integrations, retraining and monitoring & maintenance. As an addition to this linear progression, you also often have an iteration phase, where the results are improved by refining the data, the preparations, the features, the models, the deployment or the integrations.", "Taking a supervised model to production may take several weeks or months from one to two persons. This can raise the price point up to hundred thousand euros per model. If you need several models, you need several data science projects, leading to multiplied expenses and delays.", "Now this process changes rather dramatically, if you implement the machine learning functionality with predictive queries. With predictive queries the workflow is in essence the following:", "While putting an auxiliary database (like ElasticSearch) into production can take weeks, the expense related to putting each query into production is closer to the expense of using search/database queries. Often such queries form only a small part of the related functionality\u2019s expense, and often the query based functionality can be implemented in hours and put into production in days.", "This dramatic difference between the workflows and the expenses are explained a) partly by the predictive database\u2019s AutoML capabilities that are accelerated by a specialized database and b) partly by the reduced need for deployments and integrations as the data and the ML are already integrated into a single system. The complex phases of the data science project get systematically eliminated or simplified:", "As a consequence, the workflow and the cost of implementing ML via predictive queries is similar to the process of implementing normal business logic via SQL.", "The second difference between the predictive queries and the supervised models is the narrowness and it\u2019s implications on the software architecture.", "Famously: the supervised ML models are narrow in 2 different respects:", "This combined narrowness has negative implications on the architecture. If you have 10 different predictive functionalities that mix prediction, recommendation and smart search use cases: you end up struggling with a very complex system. The system may include separate supervised model platform with half dozen deployed models, separate recommendation system, a separate smart searching product and separate pattern mining tools. Such complexity is hard to learn, master and maintain. Smart search and content based recommendation engines often replicate large parts of the database, which leads to redundancy. The systems may also not integrate well with each other and they may end up in inconsistent states, where the smart search may return old information and the recommendations and the predictions may ignore new products and data.", "On the other hand, it can be argued that the predictive queries are inherently multipurpose and non-narrow in both respects. First of all: predictive queries do not have a fixed prediction setting and they don\u2019t require 10 separate model deployments for 10 different problems. The 10 problems may need 10 predictive queries, which is an obvious advantage: while creating and maintaining 10 different supervised ML models can be hard, most software engineering projects do not struggle in creating, comprehending and maintaining tens or even hundreds of SQL queries.", "Second, regarding the narrowness of the prediction type: for predictive databases the multipurpose nature emerges naturally from the rather inevitable design choices in such systems. To a degree it emerges for the same reasons multi-purposeness emerges in the traditional databases: a database cannot know the query beforehand so by its design it must be ready to serve any generic need. This drives the design choices in general to be generic rather than specific.", "As a less obvious yet inevitable design choice: it is the text-book Bayesian / probabilistic approaches that fit best the fast statistical computations that make the predictive databases possible. This is evident in both BayesLite and the Bayesian Aito. At the same time, such a solid mathematical foundation is very easy to generalize further to create a multipurpose predictive system, as it\u2019s evident in both of these systems. Both BayesLite and Aito provide a wide portfolio of intelligent functionality.", "In the case of Aito, the Bayesian mathematics were generalized to serve not just predictions, but also recommendations. Because the search mathematics is based on a Bayesian Binary Independence Model and a predictive database needs to index all text to function: extending the Bayesian Aito to serve traditional search, matching and personalized search use cases was only natural. Also using the text book mathematics to enable explainable AI was extremely simple. Adding pattern mining support to a system, which needs fast pattern mining to even function, was almost inevitable. On the other side: BayesLite complements Aito\u2019s feature portfolio with wide analytical capabilities, SQLite\u2019s extensive database functionality and an impressive ability to generate data.", "So similarly as databases are extremely multipurpose and versatile with the known data, the predictive databases can be extremely multipurpose and versatile with the unknown data. Now, if you combine both the traditional database and the predictive database capabilities, you will create even more multipurpose system that can flexibly serve all the knowledge related needs covering both the known and the unknown.", "As a consequence for a single application: perhaps you only need one predictive database to serve all your needs. You get the queries, natural language searches, predictions, recommendations, smart searches etc. from a single source. No additional server deployments, custom models or data integrations are needed as everything is served from the single database. The redundancy, consistency and the interoperability issues also disappear, because all functionality is based on the same transactional data.", "The predictive query oriented architecture is also more consistent with the industry best practices. Replacing prediction servers with queries help replacing infrastructure with queries/code as in serverless computing, and separate the concerns around the data (in the database) from the queries/code (in Git). Replacing multiple redundant data integrations with a single integration is consistent with the DRY principle and the approach allows reuse of old data integrations. Using off the shelf solutions is often preferred over creating custom solutions to avoid reinventing the wheel and not invented here anti patterns. Overall, the approach reduces the amount of maintained code, infrastructure and complexity and it is consistent with the good old software architecture goals and principles.", "As such the predictive query/database oriented approach is a radical departure from the traditional approach with wide implications on the industry. Just as a thought play: if you have a database that can answer queries of both the known and the unknown: why would you maintain a separate normal database on the side or deploy a multitude of redundant ML models/systems?", "In the early days of AI, you could see people envisioning a predictive database like system. One vision was McCarthy\u2019s idea of the epistemological part, which would combine machine learning, knowledge representation and reasoning in a seamless way. This epistemological part was essentially a model for the world, which would be used to query both the known and the unknown as with a predictive database. Still, this vision never fully realized for a rather obvious reason: creating a query based statistical reasoning system is extremely challenging both algorithmic and performance wise.", "The fundamental problem is that predictions always need a model, but if you don\u2019t know the prediction specifics beforehand you are left with 3 rather challenging options:", "BayesLite is a good example of the \u2018world model\u2019 approach. It creates an in-memory general purpose model in the extra \u2018create population\u2019, \u2018create analysis\u2019 and \u2018analyze\u2019 steps. While the approach is elegant, the modeling step can take over ten minutes even with limited data sets, which illustrates well the sacrifice on the write/preparation time side. Still, it\u2019s likely that the preparation speed could be improved drastically by using a more specialized database (BayesLite is based on SQLite) and a different algorithm (query time representation learning can be accelerated to millisecond scale as in Aito, which implies that fast write-time preparation should also be possible).", "On the other hand, Aito uses the \u2018ad hoc model\u2019 approach, in which the performance hit occurs at query time. I\u2019m going to focus next on how we solved some of the inherent performance challenges with this approach.", "In essence, creating an \u2018ad hoc model\u2019 for a specific query typically requires 1) warm and fast data structures for a few hundred query specific features 2) a few thousand relevant statistical measurements and 3) a few thousand relevant samples per interesting feature/examination. To serve these needs in the millisecond scale Aito 1) has fast prepared data structures for every possible feature, 2) uses specialized indexes for counting full database statistics in the microsecond scale and 3) has specialized data structures to enable sub millisecond sampling of data.", "As a consequence: the predictive queries can often be served in the milliseconds scale as visible in figure 1. You can find more information about the benchmark in this notebook.", "While most prediction can be served with low latencies: because Aito currently uses full database statistics, there is an O(N) component to Aito\u2019s scaling. This means that once you start approaching million data points: the performance degrades. Also, the amount of the known features in query and the amount of the alternatives in the predicted category affect the performance as visible in the graph.", "Currently, these performance characteristics put certain limitations on Aito\u2019s possible uses as the latency and throughput may suffer with big data sets and complex inference. Still, it is worth noting that also the supervised machine learning performance and resource requirements often start to degrade in the million sample scale or e.g. in the 10k sample scale for the benchmarked SVM implementation. Aito query performance is also more than good enough for applications, where the datasets are limited, and the latency and throughput requirements are looser as in the internal company tools, the PoCs/MVPs, the background processes, the intelligent process automation and the RPA.", "While the performance quality is good enough for many uses, we do expect it to be radically better in the future. The early experiments with even more specialized database structures imply that writes speeds and sampling speeds can be still made up to 10-50 times faster. This could let the predictive database to have a) a write performance, which is comparable (or better) to search databases, b) much better scaling as the sampling based inference scales more O(1) than O(N)-like and c) hugely improved prediction speed. In the future, integrating the \u2018world model\u2019 approach by doing write-time feature/representation learning could bring the prediction speed even closer to what we see in traditional supervised learning in exchange for some decrease in write performance.", "Last, but not least: let\u2019s consider the prediction quality. In this benchmark, we compared Aito to 7 ML models including random forest over 4 different classification data sets with discrete data (Aito doesn\u2019t do regression).", "Like we see in the benchmark, the ad hoc model approach produces very good prediction quality despite the millisecond scale budget to train the predictive model.", "Creating a good ad hoc model in the millisecond scale is feasible, because creating a specific model to serve a specific prediction is radically faster than creating a generic model to serve a generic prediction. Like mentioned before, the training phase doesn\u2019t need to consider every million features and million samples available, but only a few hundred features and a few thousand samples relevant for the query. The reduced complexity together with a specialized database enables serving moderately sophisticated query specific models instantly.", "Ad hoc models can also be surprisingly good, because the model is fine tuned for a single prediction. A traditional supervised model may discard rare features and ignore rare patterns in the data to limit the model complexity, which becomes a problem, when the prediction must be based on rare features. With the predictive queries the problem simply disappears as the query time training allows selecting the features and the model specifics that fit best each individual query.", "It is also worth noting, that databases contain a wealth of metadata. The company ID may refer to an entire company table, which metadata can be used in predictions via Bayesian priors. There are also database-friendly mechanisms like analogies (which is already implemented in Aito), which can assume that the relations like (\u2018message has Bob\u2019, \u2018receiver is Bob\u2019) and (\u2018message has John\u2019, \u2018receiver is John\u2019) to have a shared structure (\u2018message has X\u2019, \u2018receiver is X\u2019) and shared statistical behavior. Such techniques could improve predictions by utilizing data and patterns unavailable to traditional approaches.", "This all raises the question that through the various techniques: could the predictive queries reach not only the parity, but a superior performance compared to the best supervised ML models in many practical applications?", "As such the predictive queries can turn the machine learning field upside down by\u2026", "As a consequence of these 3 factors: it is conceivable that the predictive queries would replace most supervised ML models in the real world applications in the future. This is implied by a simple thought experience: if you can get predictions instantly from the database: why would you spend weeks productizing and integrating redundant supervised models?", "Also, it is conceivable that the predictive queries/databases will emerge as the main drivers of the machine learning democratization. As thought experiments: if doing ML is database query like, then why couldn\u2019t any developer do ML? And also: if the ML based functionality cost becomes similar to the database based functionality cost, why couldn\u2019t ML be used in every company, in every project and in every functionality like the databases are?", "Curious about everything.
