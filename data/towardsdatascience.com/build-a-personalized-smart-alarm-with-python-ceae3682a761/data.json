It gets better each time it is used. It keeps a track of the time taken by the user to put the alarm off (the time user took to wake up) and recommends alarm tunes which help you wake faster.", "So, without further ado, let\u2019s begin building our alarm. We will build it step by step below.", "The first step would be to import the required packages into our Python code to use them in building the alarm.", "If they are not installed, you need to install them using the pip install method. After you are done with the installation step, proceed with importing them into the code.", "The next step would be to set up an Alarm tunes folder where the user would store his preferred alarm tunes.", "You can choose any path for the alarm tunes, I preferred to create the folder in the same folder as the Python script. We need to create the folder only once, so we need to check whether the folder exists or not. If the folder does not exist, we will create one.", "After our folder is created, we will ask users to add some alarm tunes to the folder if and only if the folder is currently empty.", "So, as seen above, we ask the user to add at least a single alarm tune. If there is no alarm tune, raise a warning and ask the user again.", "Let\u2019s define a helper function before jumping into the CSV file creation part.", "This helper function helps us to calculate the difference between two Python lists. This will be used later in our program.", "Now, since we have now written our helper function to calculate the difference between two lists, let\u2019s move forward to create a CSV file if it is not already present.", "So, the above code checks whether we have a CSV file present or not; if not, we will create the lists, as you can see above. We will save these in a CSV file at the end of the program.", "Now, let\u2019s explain the significance of each list present in the code. Let\u2019s see them one by one.", "One thing to note here is I have set some default values to all these lists instead of providing zero since it will affect the model negatively, as the ones never played would never get a chance due to zero probability.", "So, I preferred to assume that each of these has been played once, and the average time is 60 seconds. Thus it makes our work easier.", "Now, if the CSV file is already present, we need to load the data from the CSV file.", "Also, we need to take care if there have been any changes to the Alarm tunes folder. The user might have added new tunes or removed some present tunes. So, we need to update by either adding new tunes to our list or removing the ones which have been removed from the folder.", "So, we use the helper function defined before to find out any differences between the list obtained by the folder and the list obtained from the CSV file. And, thus we can perform the required things on our code and update the tune_prob_rev and tune_prob, respectively, using their respective formulas.", "Now, we need to define another helper function to check whether the time entered by the user is correct or not. So, we have defined the function verify_alarm to do so.", "Now, we have the helper function ready. So, we need to ask the user for the alarm time. We will use a loop to ask for the alarm, and we will break out once we verify the time is valid. If invalid, we will ask the user again until he enters a valid time.", "Now, after taking input from the user, we will find out the current time and will, convert both of these times to seconds and will find out the difference between the times. If the difference is negative, it will mean the alarm is for the next day.", "We will then make the python code sleep for that amount of seconds so that the alarm rings at the required time only.", "Now, we will ring our alarm, and we will need to randomly choose the alarm tune based on the probability list. To play the alarm tune, we will be using the pygame.mixer.music library. We will loop the alarm tune infinitely until the user stops it.", "Now, we will update the values of the lists based on the time needed by the user to stop the alarm.", "We will find the time difference between the alarm and the current time of stopping the alarm. We will convert it to seconds and then update it accordingly.", "Merging the Lists and saving them as CSV file", "Now, we will merge all the lists into a single multi-dimensional list, and then we will convert it to a pandas data frame and save it as a CSV file.", "The complete code for the smart alarm using Python is:", "We have finally finished building our smart alarm. For updates, visit my Github Repository and do contribute to the repository if you have some enhancements or new ideas.", "I hope you find this article insightful. Try building your version, and do share your thoughts in the comments. Thanks for reading!", "More articles to read after this one:", "Your home for data science.
