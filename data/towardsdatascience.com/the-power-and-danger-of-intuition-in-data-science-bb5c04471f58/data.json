To those of you who have a deep understanding of Bayesian statistics, welcome to Talking to People Who Hate Math 101 and to those of you who don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, let\u2019s discuss how the human understanding of \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018luck\u2019 can lead us astray with the help of a couple of goats.", "This article is meant to be helpful to two kinds of people: those with extensive statistical experience, and those who vomit in their mouth at thought of conditional probabilities. As the field of data science evolves and deepens, as we dive further into the complexities of Machine Learning, we are in danger of creating a Comprehension Gap between data scientists and the stakeholders who employ them. In my experience, C-Level executives tend to lack the intensive math background to understand technical jargon. It isn\u2019t their job to know that stuff. Their job is to lead, to set OKRs, to manage people, to hire you to understand it. Our job, as data scientists, is to be an expert in our field and translate the underlying network of interlocking mathematical theories into bite-size presentations.", "A Data Scientist cannot crunch numbers in a vacuum. As mathematicians, we have to both uncover the truth and share the truth. And sharing the truth is typically where this process breaks down.", "Humans are pattern-making beasts. We look to the past to inform our actions. We are also spiteful and chaotic. If you believe that human behavior can truly be perfectly predicted on a granular level, you\u2019re in the wrong field, or you\u2019re going to get a rude wake up call. Here\u2019s a fun example:", "The Salesperson \u2014 You\u2019ve been hired to analyze the sales patterns at a software company and so you, the diligent data scientist, begin crunching numbers, running ANOVA tests, A/B testing, you even build a beautiful model that predicts, with 80% certainty, that the best time to schedule a follow up call with an account is 17 days after the first email. Your data says this will, on average, increase sales. Done deal, right? You tell the sales team your findings, and if they do that simple thing, call clients at the 17 day mark, their sales will increase. You have the data! The truth is in your hands!", "Well, Salesperson A replies with, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s not how I do it. I like to get in on day 2. Day 17 is too late.\u201d", "How do you respond? Do you tell them they\u2019re wrong? That the data is clear? That the other salespeople are doing the 17 day rule and they have a higher conversion rate? For some people that might be enough, but Salesperson A trusts their gut. How do you convince them?", "This is both my favorite and least favorite thought experiment in probability. I\u2019ve always had difficulty understanding probabilities intuitively. Sure, any layman gets that the chance of a 6 of a 6 sided die is 1/6, but ask them what\u2019s the probability of getting a score of 7 on two dice while getting a tails on a coin flip and everyone\u2019s head starts exploding. I have always struggled with Monty Hall, but it\u2019s the best tool to show how misleading intuition can be.", "Goat or Car? Monty Hall was a popular game show, but it won\u2019t be remembered for its charming host or musical guests, it will be forever scribed into the annals of Bayesian Statistics because of one dumb game. The set up is seemingly simple: the contestant has a chance to win a new car, but it\u2019s hidden behind one of three doors. Behind the other two doors stands a goat.", "(Side note \u2014 why goats? Who took care of these goats? Did they have a Monty Hall petting zoo? Were the goats enemies? Friends? Lovers? I have a lot of head cannon questions but I digress).", "The game: the contestant picks one of the three doors. After the choice is made, the assistant opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat. So two doors remain, your door and one more. Which one has the car behind it? Well, you\u2019re given an option: stay with your current door, the door you picked in the first place, the door that spoke to you, the door that the universe said \u2018that\u2019s the freaking door!\u2019\u2026or do you change your mind?", "If you don\u2019t know the twist, you probably think you want to stay with your first choice right? Why is that? Is it because changing your mind is seen as weak? Is it because you believe that luck is on your side? Those internal, invisible questions are why Monty Hall got to keep playing this game for years without giving away too many cars. They turn a statistical game into a judgement on you and your intelligence. \u201cOf course I picked right the first time,\u201d we think and then get to walk home instead of drive.", "Probabilistically? You\u2019re wrong. If you play the Monty Hall game and you always stay with your first choice, you will only succeed 1/3 of the time. However, if you always swap, you win 2/3 of the time.", "This choice might feel \u2018wrong\u2019 to you. It goes against your gut. Now, I could sit here and explain Bayes theorem and why 2/3 works, but that won\u2019t satisfy your annoyance at being wrong. At this point, you either know the theorem, or you don\u2019t care about it. Those probabilities just don\u2019t feel right. Why not? Let\u2019s break it down.", "What\u2019s the chance of picking the right door in the first place? Well, it\u2019s an easy 1 in 3. There\u2019s no way to increase those odds, you\u2019re picking a door and either a car is behind or a goat. But then\u2026a door opens.", "What\u2019s the chance of picking the right door a second time? This is where the brain trips up and it\u2019s for two reasons: 1) you aren\u2019t asking to \u2018pick a door\u2019 you\u2019re being asked to \u2018change your mind\u2019. Anyone who follows politics knows that changing your mind is tantamount to weakness, and so people have no desire to do it. Trap number 2) You see these choices as independent of the first choice. That means, even if you\u2019re asked to pick between two doors, it feels like there\u2019s a 50% chance of success\u2026so both doors are equally likely to have a car, right?", "Both of these approaches are wrong and you\u2019ll see why just by changing our perspective a little.", "New Perspective #1 \u2014 What if there were 10 doors? It\u2019s the same game, but one car and ten doors (which means 9 goats, damn that Monty Hall petting zoo is getting crowded!) You pick a door and then they reveal a goat in one of the other 9 doors. You now have 8 choices left. Do you stay with your 1/10 of a chance? Or do you pick another door? I expect in this version of the game, it would be foolhardy to NEVER examine your first choice. Every open door is more information, it\u2019s another option gone and your chances of getting the correct door increase. This is why the Monty Hall game is played with 3 doors and not 4. Because if you \u2018change your mind\u2019 once, you\u2019re apt to change it multiple times. So that dastardly Monty only gives you one chance to change your mind.", "This is the essence of Bayesian Statistics. Reverend Thomas Bayes asked the question, \u201cHow do I find something if I have no information about it?\u201d Well, you take guesses and see where you landed and then you try again. It is an iterative and cumulative process of gathering more and more experimental data to get you closer to a question that is difficult to answer. This makes sense, right? The more experiments you do and knowledge you glean, the better your choices will be.", "New Perspective #2 \u2014 What about the assistant? What if we\u2019re looking at this problem all wrong? We\u2019ve been focused on that contestant trying to get a new Honda Civic. What if we consider the POV of the assistant who has to open the doors? I know, it\u2019s not a hard job (unless there are specific goat-related challenges that come up), but the problem suddenly coalesces into something that makes sense when you watch the game from the sidelines.", "Let\u2019s say, the contestant picks door 1 and the car is behind door 3. Which door does the assistant remove? Door 2. They can\u2019t open door 1, because you chose that one and that would ruin the game. They can\u2019t open door 3, because, you know, that would be too easy. And so, when the contestant picks the wrong door, the assistant only has 1 out of 3 options to remove.", "What if you pick the correct door? Then the assistant has 2 doors to pick from! Which do they choose? Who knows! That must be the exciting part of the job. In this case, they have 2 out of 3 options.", "Remember, you only had a 1/3 chance of being right in the first place. Which means, 2/3 times, the assistant only has one option and the remaining door has a car behind it. Therefore, 2/3 times, staying with your first choice is the fool\u2019s choice. The removal of the door is new information and it DOES affect your next choice. The assistant doesn\u2019t remove a door at random, they do it because of an algorithm. That\u2019s why the game is weighted. In essence you\u2019re only picking between two doors, not three, just one has a 1/3 chance of success and the other has 2/3.", "Suddenly those probabilities make sense! And it simply required a shift of perspective.", "To the strong-willed, a change of perspectives is a challenge. Convincing someone to go against their gut, even with a wealth of data on hand, is always going to be an uphill battle. Remember, your job as a data scientist isn\u2019t to change someone\u2019s world, it\u2019s to communicate the truth as effectively as possible.", "But, maybe, just maybe, you can sew a little doubt to help those headstrong individuals to encourage them to look outside of what \u2018works\u2019 to see if they can discover \u2018what works better\u2019.", "Our job is to discover and communicate truth. We study, read, and blog about the discovery part, but all of that work is nothing without communication. For many of you starting to code, playing with pandas, exploring GitHub, you\u2019re learning the tools of the trade. But never forget, the most difficult tool to master is how to convince people who just want to feel right.", "Your home for data science.
