Having worked as a Data Scientist for the past two (2) years, I have more exposure to Information Technology companies than an average investment banker would. My degree in Chemical Engineering also gives me an edge selecting from Oil & Gas companies compared to an average Capital Manager who aims to purchase an Oil Company.", "Many of us, individual investors, have a disposition towards industries that we like or understand well. At the same time, we might not realize how wide the industry spectre really is. Few popular industries most people know include Airlines, Oil & Gas, Construction, Consumer Products and Financial Services.", "Am I missing something? In fact, I do! A hundred or two others.", "In this article, I will break down the industry spectre to find out how well they are represented by business and how granular the industrial profiles can be.", "Unlike conventional misconception, what many people call \u201can industry\u201d is in fact called \u201ca sector\u201d. There are 11 sectors based on the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS):", "These sectors are broken down further into 24 industry groups, 69 industries and 158 sub-industries.", "There are more classification standards, such as Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB), Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and others. All of them divide business segments slightly differently, leading towards granular representation of business activities.", "At Vhinny, I use GICS as the core classification system. Hence, I\u2019ll base my further discussion on GICS.", "In this study, I use Alpha Dataset from www.vhinny.com. The version I have contains 2,448 US publicly traded companies. While it\u2019s not a full list of all publicly traded companies in the US, it is a fairly representative subset of all 6,777 companies that have filed with the SEC in 2019.", "The breakdown of sectors by the number of companies they represent is shown on the bar chart below.", "The Y axis has 11 Sectors of the GICS classification. The X axis shows the number of companies operating in those sectors.", "The largest sector by the number of companies is Healthcare. At least 500 US Publicly traded companies are busy developing solutions to improve the quality of our life by discovering new medicine, improving operations and developing technology for cutting edge research.", "The second largest sector is Financial Services. While the general public is well aware of major players in the field, such as Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, American Express, JPMorgan Chase, etc., smaller companies play a vital role in ensuring our day-to-day needs are seamlessly handled with care. This sector is proudly served by more than 350 publicly traded companies.", "The third largest sector is Technology, representing at least 300 players on the US Arena. Lead by the tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft and Intel, Technology companies ensure our internet works, cell phone rings, TV turns on, and enable all other sorts of the 21st century signature pleasures.", "Let\u2019s now look at the top 20 industries in America.", "Staying true to sector distribution, top 10 industries in the list come from the Healthcare, Financial Services and Technology Sectors. Few exceptions to the leading sectors were boldly claimed by the Oil & Gas industry from the Energy Sector (top 4), the Specialty Industrial Machinery (top 6) from the Industrials sector, and the Specialty Retail (top 10) from the Consumer Cyclical sector.", "The busiest industries in the Healthcare sector are Biotechnology (250+ companies), Medical Devices (50+ companies), Diagnostics & Research (40+ companies) and Drug Manufacturers (40+ companies).", "Regional Banks (160+ companies) represent half of the Financial Services sector. The rest of the Financial Services industries did not make it to the top 10 industries by the number of companies.", "The Technology sectors placed two (2) of its industries on top of this top 10 list: Software \u2014 Application (90+ companies) and Software Infrastructure (40+ companies).", "To me, understanding sector classifications and how businesses are spread out across different industries is fundamental to building reliable Machine Learning models aiming to identify potential investment opportunities. As Calson Sheng explained in his recent piece on Company Valuation, we need to know where we are and who we are up against to come up with strong assumptions regarding one company\u2019s future.", "Let\u2019s look at one more plot showing the number of industries under each of the 11 sectors.", "The Sector Breakdown by industry we see here is quite different from the Sector Breakdown by the number of companies shown before. The number of industries in Industrials and Consumer Cyclical sectors is above 20, while the sectors themselves have ~300 and ~250 companies respectively. Making a naive assumption of equal size distribution in each industry per sector, we end up with ~10 companies per industry.", "This is important to keep in mind when conducting studies like the one below:", "Using industries with such small representation among companies in a Machine Learning model will not generalize well. The primary concern here is potential vulnerability to local biases that will inevitably happen if some 10 company industry happens to have 8/10 positive examples by chance. A more looking into the future, generalized solution would rather not consider industries at all and focus only on sectors. With the least occupied sector (Utilities) representing 2% of all companies in the dataset, sectors have good representation throughout the data. Industries, however, do not not.", "In this study, I\u2019ve broken down the GICS classification by the number of companies operating in each of its segments. I\u2019ve found that the top three (3) sectors by the number of companies are Healthcare, Financial Services and Technology. These, however, are not the most granular sectors when it comes to the number of industries they represent. With 20+ industries each, Industrials and Consumer Cyclical sectors make the top 2 sectors by the number of industries covered.", "The analysis presented above raises caution when it comes to including industries in the development of Machine Learning solutions in the stock market due to underrepresentation. Instead, using Sectors only is likely to provide robustness and better generalization.", "P.S. You can find all the visualization code I used in this article on my GitHub.", "I\u2019m happy to connect with people who share my path, which is the pursuit of financial independence. If you also search for financial independence or if you\u2019d like to collaborate, bounce ideas or exchange thoughts, feel free to reach out! Here are some places to find me:", "Your home for data science.
