What on earth is that? Besides being a prime example of shock-and-awe names in machine learning jargon (which often sound far fancier than they are), it\u2019s a reference to the effect that adding more features has on your dataset. In a nutshell, the curse of dimensionality is all about loneliness.", "In a nutshell, the curse of dimensionality is all about loneliness.", "Before I explain myself, let\u2019s get some basic jargon out of the way. What\u2019s a feature? It\u2019s the machine learning word for what other disciplines might call a predictor / (independent) variable / attribute / signal: information about each datapoint, in other words. Here\u2019s a jargon intro if none of those words felt familiar.", "When a machine learning algorithm is sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, it means the algorithm works best when your datapoints are surrounded in space by their friends. The fewer friends they have around them in space, the worse things get. Let\u2019s take a look.", "Data social distancing is easy: just add a dimension. But for some algorithms, you may find that this is a curse\u2026", "Imagine you\u2019re sitting in a large classroom, surrounded by your buddies.", "You\u2019re a datapoint, naturally. Let\u2019s put you in one dimension by making the room dark and shining a bright light from the back of the room at you. Your shadow is projected onto a line on the front wall. On that line, it\u2019s not lonely at all. You and your crew are sardines in a can, all lumped together. It\u2019s cozy in one dimension! Perhaps a little too cozy.", "To give you room to breathe, let\u2019s add a dimension. We\u2019re in 2D and the plane is the floor of the room. In this space, you and your friends are more spread out. Personal space is a thing again.", "Note: If you prefer to follow along in an imaginary spreadsheet, think of adding/removing a dimension as inserting/deleting a column of numbers.", "Let\u2019s add a third dimension by randomly sending each of you to one of the floors of the 5-floor building you were in.", "All of a sudden, you\u2019re not so densely surrounded by friends anymore. It\u2019s lonely around you. If you enjoyed the feeling of a student in nearly every seat, chances are you\u2019re now mournfully staring at quite a few empty chairs. You\u2019re beginning to get misty eyed, but at least one of your buddies is probably still near you\u2026", "Not for long! Let\u2019s add another dimension. Time.", "The students are spread among 60min sections of this class (on various floors) at various times \u2014 let\u2019s limit ourselves to 9 sessions because lecturers need sleep and, um, lives. So, if you were lucky enough to still have a companion for emotional support before, I\u2019m fairly confident you\u2019re socially distanced now. If you can\u2019t be effective when you\u2019re lonely, boom! We have our problem. The curse of dimensionality has struck!", "As we add dimensions, you get lonely very, very quickly. If we want to make sure that every student is just as surrounded by friends as they were in 2D, we\u2019re going to need students. Lots of them.", "The most important idea here is that we have to recruit more friends exponentially, not linearly, to keep your blues at bay.", "If we add two dimensions, we can\u2019t simply compensate with two more students\u2026 or even two more classrooms\u2019 worth of students. If we started with 50 students in the room originally and we added 5 floors and 9 classes, we need 5x9=45 times more students to keep one another as much company as 50 could have done. So, we need 45x50=2,250 students to avoid loneliness. That\u2019s a whole lot more than one extra student per dimension! Data requirements go up quickly.", "When you add dimensions, minimum data requirements can grow rapidly.", "We need to recruit many, many more students (datapoints) every time we go up a dimension. If data are expensive for you, this curse is really no joke!", "Not all machine learning algorithms get so emotional when confronted with a bit of me-time. Methods like k-NN are complete divas, of course. It\u2019s hardly a surprise for a method whose name abbreviation stands for k-Nearest Neighbors \u2014 it\u2019s about computing things about neighboring datapoints, so it\u2019s rather important that the datapoints are neighborly.", "Other methods are a lot more robust when it comes to dimensions. If you\u2019ve taken a class on linear regression, for example, you\u2019ll know that once you have a respectable number of datapoints, gaining or dropping a dimension isn\u2019t going to making anything implode catastrophically. There\u2019s still a price \u2014 it\u2019s just more affordable.*", "*Which doesn\u2019t mean it is resilient to all abuse! If you\u2019ve never known the chaos that including a single outlier or adding one near-duplicate feature can unleash on the least squares approach (the Napoleon of crime, Multicollinearity, strikes again!) then consider yourself warned. No method is perfect for every situation. And, yes, that includes neural networks.", "What are you going to do about the curse of dimensionality in practice? If you\u2019re a machine learning researcher, you\u2019d better know if your algorithm has this problem\u2026 but I\u2019m sure you already do. You\u2019re probably not reading this article, so we\u2019ll just talk about you behind your back, shall we? But yeah, you might like to think about whether it\u2019s possible to design the algorithm you\u2019re inventing to be less sensitive to dimension. Many of your customers like their matrices on the full-figured side**, especially if things are getting textual.", "**Conventionally, we arrange data in a matrix so that the rows are examples and the columns are features. In that case, a tall and skinny matrix has lots of examples spread over few dimensions.", "If you\u2019re an applied data science enthusiast, you\u2019ll do what you always do \u2014 get a benchmark of the algorithm\u2019s performance using just one or a few promising features before attempting to throw the kitchen sink at it. (I\u2019ll explain why you need that habit in another post, if you want a clue in the meantime, look up the term \u201coverfitting\u201d.)", "Some methods only work well on tall, skinny datasets, so you might need to put your dataset on a diet if you\u2019re feeling cursed.", "If your method works decently on a limited number of features and then blows a raspberry at you when you increase the dimensions, that\u2019s your cue to either stick to a few features you handpick (or even stepwise-select if you\u2019re getting crafty) or first make a few superfeatures out of your original kitchen sink by running some cute feature engineering techniques (you could try anything from old school things like principal component analysis (PCA) \u2014 still relevant today, eigenvectors never go out of fashion \u2014 to more modern things like autoencoders and other neural network funtimes). You don\u2019t really need to know the term curse of dimensionality to get your work done because your process \u2014 start small and build up the complexity \u2014 should take care of it for you, but if it was bothering you\u2026 now you can shrug off the worry.", "To summarize: As you add more and more features (columns), you need an exponentially-growing amount of examples (rows) to overcome how spread out your datapoints are in space. Some methods only work well on long skinny datasets, so you might need to put your dataset on a diet if you\u2019re feeling cursed.", "If you\u2019re keen to read more of my writing, most of the links in this article take you to my other musings.
