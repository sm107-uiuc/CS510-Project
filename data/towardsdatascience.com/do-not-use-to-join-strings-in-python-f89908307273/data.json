In this article, I\u2019ll introduce what\u2019s the differences between these two approaches and why you should not use +.", "As a beginner, or someone has just switched from other languages that use + to join strings, it is very easy to write code like this:", "As you use Python more and more, you may realise that someone else prefers to use the join() method like this:", "Honestly, when I saw the above method first time, I was thinking that this is not intuitive and looks kind of ugly.", "Nevertheless, one time I need to join multiple strings in a list.", "Initially, I have done it like this:", "In this example, I have to write a for-loop to join the strings one by one. Also, the result string needs to be trimmed a white space I added at the beginning because all the strings need to be added a white space in the front, but not the first one. You may have other solutions such as adding an index to the for loop so that the string at the index = 0 should not be added this white space. Anyway, you will still need this for-loop and do something for the white spaces.", "After that, I recalled that I\u2019ve seen the .join() method before, maybe this is the time that I need to use it!", "How easy it is! One line of code does everything. Since the .join() method is called by a string object, the string object will be utilised to join every string in the list, so you don\u2019t need to worry about the white spaces at the beginning.", "But wait, do you really think this is the only reason why we need to use the join() method rather than +? No, please read the next section.", "Now, let\u2019s compare these two methods in terms of their performance. We can use the magic method%timeit of Jupyter Notebook to evaluate them.", "The performance shown above is based on 100k trials so that the results are very confident and obvious. Using thejoin() method can be 4 times faster than using + to join the strings in the list.", "Here is a conceptual graph that I drew for demonstrating of the approach using + to join the strings.", "This shows what the for-loop and the + operator did:", "However, what happened for join() method?", "Therefore, it is obvious that the major difference is that the number of times for memory allocation is the main reason for the performance improvement.", "Imagine that it is already 4x faster to use thejoin() method to join 6 strings together. What if we are joining a very large number of strings? It will make a much larger difference!", "In this short article, I have compared the differences between the + operator and the join() method when joining strings in Python. Apparently, the join() method is preferred because of its performance.", "Learning a programming language is usually a long curve, but Python makes it relatively shorter for beginners, which is absolutely great. After we have entered the door, start to use Python, we should not stop there and satisfy what we can do use Python. Usually, the difference between a master and a regular developer comes from the knowledge in detail.", "Let\u2019s keep finding more tips on Python to make ourselves closer to a Python Master!", "If you feel my articles are helpful, please consider joining Medium Membership to support me and thousands of other writers!
