Last month, while we interviewed one guy for a Data Engineering position at EmCasa, we came to realize that we have done quite something here. We briefly explained to him what we did in terms of data infrastructure and he was really impressed. But it was not always like that. In this article I\u2019ll explain what we have done and what we learned from it.", "When I got the call for a Data Engineering interview at EmCasa I was working as Data Scientist for another company. They were looking for someone to start organizing their data. When I asked what data they already had, the answer was sincere: \"just a few tables in our backend PostgreSQL database. We also tried a BI tool and that's all.\" When I heard that, I had to be crystal clear with them as well: I don't hold a degree, I've never worked as data engineer before, don't know Spark, don't know Airflow, I'm not a specialist in ETL, I don't know testing, don't know git and, by the way, I'm not a developer as well. But I had some past experiences and I've seen things that worked well, others that worked but could be improved and a lot of things that didn't work at all. My idea was to try not doing what I already knew wouldn't work. I don't know exactly how or why they decided it, but I was hired as their first Data Engineer.", "When I joined the company I noticed that the scenario depicted to me was true. It looked like I would have enough room to do everything in the way I thought was the best. Over my first week we defined some OKRs for the quarter:", "To extract data from third party services we started looking at some integration/ETL services such as StitchData, Fivetran, Segment, Alooma, Rivery, among others. The decision here was that we needed to start working fast. Building a custom integration to each of the services APIs would take too much time. Using an ETL service would save us several months of development and a lot of hours of maintenance. We decided to stick with Rivery, and within two weeks we had a Redshift cluster spinning up and all data from third party services being updated on a daily basis. At this point Luca joined us to be our BI analyst. He already had plenty of data to play with. We also decided to use Metabase for our dashboards, at that moment. So far so good. We officially had data, it wasn't a few tables on a PostgreSQL anymore!", "Next thing was to improve our property valuation model and make it work as a standalone API (the previous model was bonded to backend). But we didn't had data to create a new model, actually we did, but it wasn't good enough. So I took a look at the web scraping tool that we were using. It was written in Elixir (our backend runs on Elixir) and I don't know Elixir. So I decided to build another scraper from scratch in Python. To accomplish that I created a private Python package, called Spatula, that scraps listings from other websites and save them to S3. At this time we had already hired Priscila, our Data Scientist, and she was struggling with the old data. I ran Spatula locally and she had plenty of good data to query with Athena and start modelling.", "While she was working with the Data Science stuff, I started to study Airflow. And oh, boy! I was stuck. One thing is to learn how to write DAGs, another is to learn how to deploy Airflow to AWS in a reliable way. It took me a lot of hours to learn enough of Airflow, Terraform, Docker and AWS ECS to make the first deploy (we forked this repo by Nicor88). Then it took a lot more of hours to customize it the way we needed. I started to get afraid of taking too long to finish this task, so I asked my manager if I should postpone it and schedule tasks another way (the wrong way, the way that I know wouldn't work in the long term). The answer was: \"Andre, when we hired you, we knew you didn't know a lot of stuff. So take the time you need to learn it and make it work the right way.\" Well\u2026 That was the kind of management posture and commitment with doing the right thing that I've never had in any other company that I worked for. So struggled a little more to finish configuring Airflow, and we set up our Spatula scraper to run weekly from there.", "At this point our new valuation model, made by Priscila, was ready. But not ready for production. So my approach was to do some pair programming sessions with her, showing what I was changing, why and how. Then we deployed Priceteller together, it was our first Machine Learning Model. It works as a Flask API running on AWS Lambda and API gateway. It answers requests from this flux. Before deploying it we also discussed a lot of code quality, testing and documentation with our developers team. They didn't want to make requests from production to an unreliable API \u2014 and they were absolutely right in raising the bar like that. When we finally met their standards, our first machine learning model was available online for our customers. More recently we have also deployed a second real time model called Selekta, we use it to suggest listings to users based on their preferences.", "Priscila also told me how they used Airflow in her previous company. Because I have never used it before, I was trying to learn the best practices by trial and error. She came up with a list of improvements and I accepted all of them. Since then we started to run some Spark jobs on AWS Glue, triggered and monitored by an Airflow task. We have hourly jobs running to extract data from backend, while other tasks are running to persist user log events. We also created a recommendation model that runs in batch every day on Airflow. And I do need to mention one side effect: now we have a DataLake on S3 with more than 2 Tb of data.", "This happened in just six months. We have built our company data foundations. We are using robust tools and technologies. And we are doing data the right way.", "Doing data engineering is not that complicated for someone who came from data science. As a data scientist we feel the pain of not having the right data or tools to do the work. So you have an instinct of how things should look like. The how you are going to do that can be learnt. Airflow, AWS, Spark, Git, Python, you name it, can be learnt in a short period of time if you know where you are heading at. Learning stuff without a purpose (and without a paycheck) is harder.", "There is a big difference in knowing what needs to be done and being able to execute that. And this has to do with your company's culture. I noticed right at the interview that I was joining a place where I would have autonomy to solve the problems the way I thought was right. You can notice that yourself by asking at the interview how important data is to the company. Is it a support area? Or it\u2019s part of the company growth strategy? Are they being sincere with you? If data is not truly part of the growth strategy, then chances are that you won't be able to spend time planning and doing the right stuff.", "Building APIs, models and dashboards that work as standalone products provides great flexibility for a data team. But standards have to be met to connect those pieces to working production code. By creating a data as a product culture, we are protecting the team from daily business questions \u2014 there are plenty of analysts to answer those. We got a manager that protects us from unrelated demands, so it's possible to focus on learning and doing stuff right.", "There will be mountains that you'll have to climb alone, but asking someone who have seen the best path before will save you a lot of time. If you are working with a senior team, ask them about what they have seen in other companies. Even if they don't know how to do, they will have an idea of what works and what doesn't work. Asking for guidance will certainly put you in the right direction.", "Some things can be done easily with third party tools, such as the ETL services that I described at the beginning of this article. There is no need to waste time learning how to connect to Facebook Insights API if you don't have any data from Facebook on your data warehouse. You don't need to learn how to setup a Spark cluster with EC2 if you don't have jobs running on EMR, and you don't need to use EMR if you don't have any Glue Jobs, and you don't need Glue Jobs if you don't have any query written on Athena.", "Try to use the simplest robust solution first (one that doesn\u2019t require constant maintenance). When that solution doesn't meet your needs anymore, start studying other tools. Starting from the most complex will waste your time. Focus on delivering business value as fast as possible with the most simple robust solution.", "The worst thing that can happen is to spend half of your day fixing things that are broken. If it has frequent bugs, then you either didn't do it right, or you are using the wrong tool, or both. Doing right from the beginning will take longer, but will save you a lot of time and burden in the future.", "If you don't know something, then say it, but also demonstrate that you can and will learn it. This way you'll probably be able to use some of your working hours to learn new stuff.", "Teach other team members things that they don't know. It will always help you to fixate the learning and it will also avoid frictions between different positions. If everyone is on the same page, then the work will become more fluid between Data Engineering, Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering. Pair programming is a good practice to share your knowledge and get real time input. Spend some of your time sharing your knowledge, look for what you can give to others.", "While others search for what they can take, a true king searches for what he can give. - Mufasa. The Lion King", "If you have just finished a big project, such as deploying a new ETL pipeline, then it's a good idea to spend some time on a secondary task, such as writing some documentation or fixing bugs that were left behind. Trying to start another big task right away will probably slow you down.", "Your home for data science.
