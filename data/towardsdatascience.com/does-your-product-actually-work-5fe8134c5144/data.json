No one person is the same, and the way they use your product and respond to it will often surprise you. Some of them will download it and forget about it, some will log in every day.

We can no longer do a single Control trial and a single Treatment trial like we can with deterministic systems. We need to do hundreds of trials. Thousands.", "Each trial will be on a different person. What\u2019s important to enforce is that the criteria for assigning a person to a Control or Treatment condition is completely random. This ensures that the samples of experimental participants in each condition will more or less be identical in aggregate: they\u2019ll have the same proportion of people from each gender, height, income level, disposition, etc. The effect of factors that aren\u2019t the one under scrutiny should sort of just cancel each other out.", "We\u2019ve put quite a few pieces together by this point: we\u2019re controlling for a single explanatory variable, and randomizing to mitigate the effect of a bunch of exogenous variables we aren\u2019t studying.

We give participants access to the product and then they do whatever they want with it. All we can do is passively observe!", "Given this, a naive approach may be to declare that:", "But this is a fatal mistake.", "We have to keep in mind that different latent factors, represented by U, drove the cases where the participant took treatment vs. when they didn\u2019t. That same U could very well have affected the probability of them having a good outcome, which would muddy our story for how effective the treatment was.", "For example, in Even\u2019s case, members who choose to regularly use the app may just be inherently more financially well-off than those who don\u2019t (or vice-versa). In that case we\u2019d see a high ATE, but that says nothing about the effect Even is having on people \u2014 it\u2019s just a spurious result of selection bias!", "What we want is to be able to compare the chance of a good outcome given treatment vs. the chance of a good outcome without treatment, where all other factors are fixed. That would look more like this:", "Alright, we\u2019re kind of getting somewhere. We have an expression for how to turn experimental observations into an ATE\u2026 but the expression is useless unless we find some way to understand what u states are elements of U, so we can properly control for those states.", "But U is this inscrutable random variable that\u2019s supposed to capture the whole universe of unobserved factors that influence why a human being decides to try a product and how they might respond.", "How can you even begin to break that down?", "Let\u2019s make the problem as simple as possible. We don\u2019t need to model people\u2019s neurophysiology, or the weather, or the stock market, or any of the infinite factors that can influence decision-making on the day-to-day.", "Let\u2019s just consider what things can affect the result of our experiment.

So you can describe every single person as belonging to one (Compliance, Response) behavior pair, giving us exactly 16 archetypes that a person could possibly be.", "I guess it\u2019s kind of like Myers-Briggs \u2014 except this framework is actually useful for doing science.", "Great, now we know that U can take on a u value like (Always Taker, Helped) or (Never Taker, Never Better). The reasons why a participant might be of a particular u is unimportant for our analysis \u2014 we just need to know what u is. If we know the distribution of U we can actually formulate a far simpler expression for an ATE:", "But how can we know the distribution of U?", "\u2026Ok, so here\u2019s the thing: we\u2019ll never know what that distribution is. That\u2019s impossible to do. How could you ever tell if someone would be \u201cNever Better\u201d in some experimental scenario? That barely even makes sense.", "At this point you might be yelling at me through your computer for wasting your time. Why did we just go through all that troublesome deliberation, just to wind up stuck? A lot of studies take shortcuts that don\u2019t involve U or X or anything as complicated as the diagram we\u2019ve set up at all!", "For example, a pretty standard practice in medical studies is to formulate an ATE as the following, instead:", "This is called an intention-to-treat analysis, and it recognizes its own flaw right there in its name: it\u2019s measuring the effect of an intention to give someone a treatment (an assignment to Treatment or Control), rather than if they actually took it.", "You can kind of already tell why I\u2019m not a fan of intention-to-treat, but to make my displeasure truly visceral, I\u2019m going to simulate an experiment for you. Follow along in this notebook:", "That was a lot of work we just simulated\u2014 we recruited some participants, got informed consent, followed them for some time, measured outcomes, queried our production database to get compliance figures, did some aggregation, etc. etc. At the end we got those 8 beautiful values: P(X,Y|Z=z) for each z in Z (Treatment and Control, in this case).", "You know how in documentaries about spider silk and its amazing properties, the narrators will keep mentioning how they had to painstakingly milk 14,000 righteously indignant spiders for three months just to get an ounce of silk?", "Our P(X,Y|Z) values are that ounce of silk. They are precious.", "Intention-to-treat immediately obliterates them and rolls them up into two coarse numbers: P(Y=Good|Z=Treatment) and P(Y=Good|Z=Control).", "What a waste of useful information! It\u2019s like setting our ounce of spider-silk on fire and then also systematically slapping each of our 14,000 already-distressed spiders in the face.", "Here is this tragedy of information annihilation in action:", "There has to be some use for that rich P(X,Y|Z) information. Right?", "While we can\u2019t ever know what the distribution of U in our participant population is, we do know that P(X,Y|Z) changes conditional on U. Or in other words there is some function U \u2192 P(X,Y|Z).", "The function is maybe one-to-one or many-to-one \u2014 but in either case, knowing what P(X,Y|Z) is should be able to shed light on what U could have possibly been.", "Unless it\u2019s a trapdoor function, in which case we\u2019d be hosed.", "It\u2019s not though! In fact, U \u2192 P(X,Y|Z) is a simple linear function, which you\u2019ll be able to intuit yourself shortly. Let\u2019s think this through:", "Take the quantity P(X=True, Y=Good | Z=Treatment). This probability gives us the proportion of people in the Treatment condition who took the treatment and had a good outcome.", "But another way we could get that value, assuming we had knowledge of the distribution over U, is by adding up the proportions of people who we know always take the treatment and get better, as well as the proportion who would comply with the treatment assignment and get better.", "This lets us assert the following linear relationship:", "As it turns out, every single P(X,Y|Z) value we have is a union of some set of P(U=u) values like in the example above, meaning that U is constrained by the data that we can readily observe!", "And those aren\u2019t the only constraints. We also have the rules of probability at play: each P(U=u) must lie in the [0,1] interval, and the sum of all P(U=u) must equal 1, as well.", "On top of these constraints, we also have an expression involving U we want to learn about: the ATE, our holy grail. Here it is again:", "While we don\u2019t have the tools to solve for exactly what the distribution of U is \u2014 what we do have are all the right ingredients for a linear optimization problem.", "We can range over the constrained space of what U could have possibly been, and pull out the absolute best and worst-case ATEs. This gives us hard bounds on what the true ATE value actually was.", "I set up these constraints and performed this optimization using PuLP, a Python library that lets you frame these kinds of linear programming problems with super readable symbolic expressions:", "Pay close attention to what we just did. Using a few assumptions and the structure of our diagram, we were able to go back in time and see what would have happened if we\u2019d lived in the happiest timeline we can imagine, with the highest possible ATE.", "Using the same reasoning, we could also go back in time to explore the darkest timeline (if we minimize instead of maximize).", "If you were following closely, you might\u2019ve also noticed something pretty alarming.", "The intention-to-treat analysis \u2014 standard practice for analyzing most experimental results with human participants, remember \u2014 declared that our treatment had an ATE of 45%, a moderate positive effect on participant outcomes.", "But when we take the treatment variable X into account, we see that the highest possible ATE is -15%.", "Thinking in terms of a causal model rather than taking the data itself as gospel is the key to unlocking reasoning like this.", "Instead of getting stuck with the set of 8 probabilities spat out by the RCT, we were able to reason that something was responsible for how our experimental participants took our treatment and responded to it. With that in mind, we could work out what the results might have been in a different set of circumstances.", "I need to level with you here: in most cases, this analysis will get you the same directional results as an intention-to-treat study. I purposefully used a contrived example in which their results were divergent. But it\u2019s important to realize that such a divergence can happen in the first place, and that it can be so dramatic.", "I think a lot of people working in applied statistics get used to taking the data we see and throwing it into one of our many ancient and established machines. Or at least, I do. It\u2019s a bad habit.", "Contingency table? Throw it in a Chi-squared test and turn the crank. A 2x2 table and super low sample sizes?
