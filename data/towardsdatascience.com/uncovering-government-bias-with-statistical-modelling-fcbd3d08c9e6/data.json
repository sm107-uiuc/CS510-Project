The Australian Liberal party is about to find this out the hard way.", "In recent weeks, the Liberal party has been accused of using $100M of sporting grants to win votes in the lead up to the 2019 election. As a data scientist, I decided to test this accusation by crunching the numbers. And so, I set out to see what we could learn from publicly available data relating to what is now known as the \u201cSports Rorts\u201d scandal.", "My thinking is that if the Liberal party allocated grants to electorates on the basis of their voting behaviour, then we should be able to use statistical modelling to reveal their strategy.", "Before I go any further, here\u2019s some background in case you haven\u2019t been reading the news\u2026", "The Australian Liberal party has been in government since the 2013 federal election. In the lead up to last year\u2019s election, the government announced a community sport infrastructure program, offering grants of up to $500,000 for local sporting organisations. Marketed as an initiative to boost sporting participation across the country, organisations had to submit an application to be independently assessed and scored by Sport Australia. These scores were supposed to be used by the Sports Minister in deciding which grants would be approved.", "This year the Australian National Audit Office published an audit report that implied, but stopped short of asserting, that the Liberal party gave preference to grant applications from \u2018marginal\u2019 and \u2018targeted\u2019 electorates \u2014 rather than following the advice from Sport Australia. Essentially, the Liberal party is being accused of supplying more grant money to targeted areas in order to win votes for the 2019 election.", "The ultimate aim of my analysis is to see whether there is evidence that grants were allocated on the basis of electorates\u2019 voting behaviour from the previous election. Essentially, is there an underlying strategy? And if so, what voting pattern was targeted by the Liberals?", "To go ahead with this analysis, I need to combine three key data sources, all of which are publicly available:", "With this information, I\u2019ll be able to produce a dataset containing the total grant money allocated to each electorate, along with the corresponding voting results from the previous election and other controls from the census.", "(Note that all data collection, wrangling and analysis is conducted using R)", "Sports Australia has published a list of the 684 approved grants in a table on their website, so I scrape this using rvest. Next, this list is fed to a Google Maps API in order to get the lat-long coordinates of each grant (using ggmap from dkahle\u2019s GitHub). This works for almost all of the grants. Some quick googling helps find where the remainder of these organisations are located.", "To allocate each sporting organisation to its corresponding electorate, I need a map of electorates from the 2016 federal election. Conveniently, this is available in the eechidna package, along with the electoral voting data. Using some nifty functions from sp and rgeos to loop through the electorates, each grant is successfully allocated.", "The grants are now aggregated so that the resultant dataset holds the total grant $ amount for each of the 150 federal electorates. This is then joined with the two-party preferred vote and swing vote from the 2016 election, as well a collection of socio-demographic variables from the 2016 census \u2014 also obtained from eechidna. The two-party preferred vote is the percent of votes favouring the Liberal party over the Labor party, and the swing vote is the percentage point change in the two-party preferred vote from 2013 to 2016.", "Here\u2019s a snapshot of the resultant dataset.", "What I\u2019m really looking to uncover is the relationship between electorates\u2019 two-party preferred vote for the Liberal party in the 2016 election and the amount of grant money received. First, let\u2019s see what a scatterplot looks like with a linear regression line fitted (using ggplot2).", "There\u2019s some evidence here to suggest that electorates with stronger support for the Liberal party were more likely to receive sports grant money. But really, it's likely that if the Liberal party did implement a targeted strategy, the relationship between these two variables would not be linear. A strategy that gives the most money to regions that are the safest wouldn\u2019t be a very good one \u2014 because its highly unlikely that safe Liberal electorates would be vulnerable to changing hands at the 2019 election.", "So instead of fitting a linear regression line, I plot a loess curve \u2014 a smooth, non-parametric regression curve that gives higher weighting to local data points. This allows for a better picture of the relationship between the 2016 vote and grant amount.", "Wow! The loess curve reveals a significant relationship \u2014 one that was not obvious from inspecting the initial scatterplot.", "There is a clear spike in the amount of grant money given to electorates that were won by the Liberal party in 2016, but not won by a huge margin. These are called \u201cmarginal\u201d Liberal party electorates. This plot in itself is pretty convincing evidence of Liberal bias in the funding scheme.", "To take this another step further, I decide to fit a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) with the grant amount as the response, and the two-party preferred vote (from 2016), swing vote (percentage point change in two-party vote from 2013 to 2016), and census characteristics as covariates. Each covariate is included in the model as a smooth term. In this case I have use penalised regression splines \u2014 a type of flexible non-parametric regression similar to loess.", "The GAM is fit with mcgv, and the plot of the modelled effect is produced by visreg.", "It can be clearly seen that even after accounting for the swing vote and census variables, there is still a huge spike in grant amount for marginal Liberal party electorates!", "The difference in funding received by an electorate with 54% Liberal support versus an electorate with 54% Labor support, ceteris paribus, is an astounding $500,000.", "The GAM regression output confirms that this is the conclusive evidence I set out to discover. With a p-value < 0.001, the data proves that the two-party preferred vote had a statistically significant effect on total grant money allocated to each electorate.", "To check that my findings are robust to outliers, I re-estimate the model after removing the two electorates with outstandingly large grant amounts ($1.8M and $2.0M \u2014 given to the electorates of Boothby and Dawson) and find that the same Liberal bias is observed. Additionally, the model assumptions seem to be valid, as the residuals are approximately normal (observed using a quantile-quantile plot). Also for those wondering, the fully specified GAM explains 46.3% of the deviance \u2014 which is a pretty good fit in this case.", "My statistical model provides empirical evidence that the Liberal party used sports grants to try consolidate support for the 2019 election. The data clearly shows that marginal Liberal electorates were targeted by the government, and received more grant funds as a result.", "While this analysis is extremely interesting from a political perspective, it also demonstrates how publicly available data can be used to generate powerful insights.", "For anyone interested in exploring Australian election and census data, I highly recommend checking out the eechidna R package (of which I am an author and maintainer). This package makes it easy to access Australian election and census data from 2001\u20132019 (including maps) and is available on CRAN.", "All code for the analysis can is located in this GitHub repo.
