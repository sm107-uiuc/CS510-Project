Pi is everywhere in math \u2014 it\u2019s a very deep reality. Euler\u2019s identity uses pi to link 5 of the most important numbers together. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle contains pi in stating that the position and velocity of an object cannot both be measured exactly at the same time. Pi is a normalizing constant in many formula, including the Gaussian/Normal distribution. The Reimann zeta function evaluated at 2 converges to a factor of pi.", "But this article will pay homage to the lesser-honored, the sometimes forgotten, the neglected mathematical constants. No less deep and no less fascinating than pi, let\u2019s dive in!", "e has a few characterizations. It is the unique base a by which y = a^x is it\u2019s own derivative and has a 1 at x = 0. It is also the limit of infinite exponential growth. It satisfies the integral range illustrated in the blue highlighted area below.", "e can be written as a continued fraction, two of which are shown below.", "This reality gives rise to a fascinating procedure called a spigot algorithm that can be used to calculate many digits e (and pi too\u2026). A well-written Python implementation of a spigot algorithm for e is here, which I show below with a few modifications.", "This works by using the continued fraction to iterate between two fractional estimates of the number (p0/q0 and p1/q1). As the observed decimals of those fractions converge, you can peel off consistent digits (for example: 23/27 = 0.315068 and 34/108 = 0.314815 would let you peel off 0.31). Even more helpful, we can \u201crebase\u201d the fractions after we peel off those digits and keep the numerator/denominator of our fractions small.", "The lambda functions in the function represent the numerator/denominator of the continued fraction. We store the data as a string to keep it simple to store many thousands of digits. I verified the algorithm to 100k digits via another list.", "A now-famous Google billboard in 2004 designed to field candidates for developer jobs referenced e.", "Modern CPUs, programming languages, and Google itself make it a lot easier to solve this, but it\u2019s still super fun! After generating enough digits of e to begin working with, we need to generate 10-digit primes \u2014 primes will be our next \u201cconstant\u201d.", "Okay\u2026 prime numbers aren\u2019t really constants, but they\u2019re super cool still. Most basically,a prime number is a number greater than one that is divisible only by 1. It\u2019s almost elementary, but recall that any number that is not prime itself can be written as the unique product of prime numbers. That is to say, the prime numbers are the building blocks of all other numbers! That\u2019s true in several ways:", "Proven up to 4*10\u00b9\u2078, Goldbach\u2019s conjecture asserts that every integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes (for example 12 = 7 + 5). A convincing heuristic notes that as numbers grow, there are progressively more opportunities to construct two such numbers: 100, for example has 6 pairs (3+97, 11+89, 17+83, 29+71, 41+59, 47+53). The graph below illustrates this via a scatter plot.", "Lagrange proved that every positive integer is the sum of four squares (i.e. 310 = 17\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 + 1\u00b2. It\u2019s hypothesized that this formulation be made such that 3 of the numbers numbers produce a square themselves in the formula x + 3y + 5z (for example 2+ 1*4 + 4*2 = 25, which is 5\u00b2).", "Another super cool fact: cicadas spend most of their lives as grubs underground, but come above ground after 7, 13, or 17 years to fly, breed, and die in a few weeks. Biologists hypothesize that the prime-number breeding cycle lengths are an evolutionary strategy to prevent predators from synchronizing with their breeding cycles.", "There are many classes of prime numbers, one of which will make an appearance in a constant calculated below. A \u201ctwin prime\u201d is a prime that is 2 more or 2 less than another prime (for example 13 is a twin prime because it is 2 more than 11). A Fibonacci prime is a prime that is also a Fibonacci number. A Mersenne prime, helpful for generating very large primes, follows the form 2^n \u2014 1.", "The largest known prime has over 24.9M digits, but there is no \u201cformula\u201d for generating prime numbers. Many algorithms are known, the easiest to understand of which is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This algorithm starts with a list of all integers from 2 to n, or alternatively all odd integers from 3 to n for some initial performance tuning. Next (using the first formulation), compute all factors of 2(i.e. 2*1 = 2, 2*2 = 4, 2*3 = 6, etc.), and remove those items from your list. Move to the next item that remains in your list (3), and remove all factors of that. When you move to the next item, 4 is no longer in the list, so you move to 5. As you move along, you progressively eliminate non-primes from the list.", "The algorithm below uses this basic logic, with a few efficiencies. A few programming notes regarding modulus calculation:", "The normal Sieve of Eratosthenes runs in approximately polynomial time, meaning that as n (your largest possible prime) grows, time grows by n\u00b2 (approximately\u2026). Intuitively, the problem here is that you\u2019re eliminating the same number many times: n of 5M will eliminate 4,849,845 separately 7 times (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19), but only 1 is necessary. The algorithm above reduces this duplication by using two different and more complex formulas to calculate the list of non-primes.", "Back to our Google billboard. We segment our e_list into 10-digit numbers, and then check if they are prime using a list of primes. We only need to check up to 100,000 because no 100,000\u00b2 is an 11-digit number.", "Prime numbers make an appearance in two fascinating constants we\u2019ll discuss next.", "Brun\u2019s constant takes the form below \u2014 the sum of the reciprocal of all prime pairs.", "The number converges extremely slowly, which is fascinating in itself. The denominator of these fractions decreases quickly \u2014 the problem is that prime pairs are relatively common even for very large numbers. In fact, Brun\u2019s constant is not known. It was estimated to be ~1.902160583104 using all twin primes up to 10\u00b9\u2076 (that is, 10 thousand billion), but is only proven to be less than 2.347.", "The Meissel-Mertens constant is also referred to as the prime reciprocal constant, due to its definition below:", "This number again is not known exactly, though converges much quicker than Brun\u2019s constant.", "Studied since Euclid\u2019s time, the Golden ratio plays an important role in geometry, and has many geometric representations.", "The last spiral image is called the Fibonacci spiral, and represents a fascinating property of the Golden Ratio: taking the ratio of successive Fibonacci numbers converges to the Golden Ratio, which we\u2019ll discuss below.", "A few fascinating properties of Fibonacci numbers: every positive integer can be written as a sum of Fibonacci numbers where any one number is used only once. This is maybe intuitive when you consider the density of front part of the sequence relative to later parts. Fibonacci numbers are the sum of the diagonals of Pascal\u2019s triangle (constructed with each successive layer being the sum of the two numbers above).", "As mentioned above, the Golden ratio converges when you take the ratio of successive Fibonacci numbers. For example, 89/55 = 1.61818, which is close to the true value of 1.61803. The Golden ratio can be defined exactly using the irrational number root 5.", "The Golden ratio can also be expressed as a continued fraction, so we can use or e-generating algorithm above to generate digits of the golden ratio. Specifically:", "You\u2019ll note that running the code above takes a while compared to the e code. The 500,000 asks the algorithm to return 500k digits, without respect to how many iterations of the continued fraction are required. The golden ratio continued fraction converges slowly, which makes some sense: growing numbers in the denominator allows the recurring additive fractions smaller.", "There are many more constants we could discuss, but this article is already a bit of a rambling exploration! We didn\u2019t get to the first sophomore's dream constant (the area bounded by curve x^x between 0 and 1, so named for the incorrect, but oh-so-convenient identity (x+y)^n = x^n + y^n that would make such an integral much easier to solve); values of the Gamma and Reimann zeta functions that appear in statistics; or any of the other constants that make appearances in stochastic random walks and other analytical applications.", "Main take-away from this article: math is super cool!
