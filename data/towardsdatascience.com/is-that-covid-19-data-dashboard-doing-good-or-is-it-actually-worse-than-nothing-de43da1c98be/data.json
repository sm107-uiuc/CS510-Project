For some, this means punishing themselves with ridiculous jigsaw puzzles, or seeking solace on the island paradise of Animal Crossing.", "For many of us statistics and data nerds, it\u2019s been looking at COVID-19 data dashboards, based on datasets like those from the New York Times or the European Union.", "Truth be told, I cannot recall ever seeing so many data dashboards on one subject as I have with COVID-19. And while many of them are extremely informative, I think it is worth considering what message our visualisations send to the reader. Especially in an ongoing pandemic, where people\u2019s actions could vastly affect its outcome at a local and global scale.", "To begin with, let\u2019s take a look at some potential for accidental, or unintended, outcomes.", "As the authors of Freakonomics would say, unintended consequences are everywhere \u2014 and data visualisations are no exception. In some cases, even the most well-intentioned presentation of accurate data can lead to misinterpretations and subsequently poor decisions. Here\u2019s one.", "From early on, graphics like this one were making the news, indicating the much, much, higher mortality risk to the elderly from COVID-19 than to the younger demographic.", "(To be clear, I think Our World in Data are amazing \u2014 I am simply referring to how some people might interpret this data.)", "On the other hand, take a look at this graph below. From this, early data from the U.S., more people aged 20\u201344 were being hospitalised than those 75\u201385 in terms of absolute numbers!", "You\u2019d draw a very different conclusion from this than you might from the above graph that shows mortality rates.", "Which is more accurate? Well, they\u2019re both right, of course. They simply show different aspects of the disease and its impact. Most of the readers I am sure will be able to easily reconcile the two.", "But how would they look to a casual reader? To some, seeing one or the other graph could lead to wildly divergent conclusions regarding risks to different demographics.", "The simplified understanding that came out of this type of data earlier on in the pandemic\u2019s progression was that young people were not much at risk from the virus.", "We also saw a parade of subsequent news items about younger people flouting lockdowns and social distancing orders to have parties and flock to beaches. Were they related? It\u2019s hard to tell, of course. (There\u2019s no data either way!) But it\u2019s not hard to imagine that graphs like that having an impact.", "More concretely, the above example is a clear microcosm of the messaging that a simple graph can tell with the same data. Here\u2019s another example, simply showing the power of words in discussion of fatalities, current vs projected.", "I suspect that many of us remember the voices from January, February, or even March this year \u2014 arguing that the total number of COVID-19 deaths are still only in the tens, hundreds, and then thousands, and that it is only a fraction of those numbers from a flu season, or even a daily road death toll.", "The incredible callousness for human life aside, this statement misses the point of the alarm. The seriousness with which SARS-CoV-2 was taken was based on the potential for damage that it could do, not just the not-insignificant tolls then.", "But then, headlines like this might not have helped matters:", "This particular article does not provide any context \u2014 why the virus is so terrifying, how contagious it is, and what the projections are if it was to get out into communities around the world. Sure, if the reader had been following the news, they might have heard about all that, but not everyone has the time to do so, or the inclination to read article after article.", "On the other hand, the next article, published just three days before that above, sends a vastly different message.", "The main takeaway from this article is that COVID-19 could kill tens of millions of people! Again, even at the same time and with the same base facts, just by presenting a projection rather than the current number, a vastly different tone is derived.", "And now, let\u2019s take a look at how the same dataset could be visualised vastly differently for correspondingly different interpretations.", "Even disregarding the risk of misinterpretations, it\u2019s no easy task presenting data related to a fast-moving, infectious disease with a high reproduction number.", "Take just these two graphs, taken from Our World in Data. The first graph shows total deaths for countries most impacted by this.", "In this graph, the United States\u2019 total and the slope seem extremely alarming, and China\u2019s early numbers due to its initial outbreak clearly stand out among all of the curves.", "Meanwhile, the next graph presents the exact same data, but normalised per million people in each country.", "This paints a drastically different picture. Per capita, China\u2019s figures never even register much beyond the y-axis, the U.S. numbers don\u2019t seem nearly as alarming as they do in the previous figure, and Spain\u2019s and Italy\u2019s numbers suddenly seem the worst by some distance.", "If you are wondering what the fuss is about and why the world has basically shut down, what would the latter graph be saying to them? What does each graph implicitly say about which country has managed this the best/worst?", "Consequently, and one might ask \u2014 what is more appropriate?", "Given that COVID-19 is an infectious disease, and therefore it is not evenly distributed within a particular country, is the overall population the appropriate denominator? Is the overall number a better metric? Should it be looked at as a function of number of epicentres? Or maybe it should be based on population density, given its infectious nature.", "Most importantly, how will the decision makers at an organisational, governmental, or even local levels, interpret the charts and act upon them?", "Without domain expertise, someone like me just isn\u2019t placed to judge these facts. Furthermore, I wouldn\u2019t even know how to begin to interpret these figures, or what might lead the most favourable \u2018nudge\u2019, as Thaler and Sunstein might say.", "Lastly, let\u2019s take a look at some mapped data:", "Even mapping the data is no trivial task. Let\u2019s take a look at the U.S. This graphic is from The New York Times\u2019 excellent COVID-19 tracking page.", "The above map shows the total number of cases as of April 13, 2020, aggregated and presented at county level. This paints a worrying picture where you would be hard pressed to find many spots in the U.S. that has been spared from the outbreak.", "But then, this next image presents a contrasting (still concerning) snapshot.", "This image shows the growth rate of new cases. What stands out here to me is that the growth of COVID-19 has drastically slowed down on the west coast, while it has remained fast on the east coast and the south.", "Given the relatively large number of infections in states like California to date, this figure would be quite surprising to many. Again \u2014 same dataset, vastly different outcomes and takeaways.", "For example, someone looking at this map might then try to identify why at might be, and how that result could be replicated on the east coast. Whereas no such indications might be made from the first graph.", "in selecting, filtering, manipulating and presenting the data, we make a myriad choices \u2014 that vastly affect the output and the readers\u2019 impressions", "The point that I am trying to make here is pretty obvious. Those of us presenting data, or creating visualisations of data cannot pretend that their interpretation is agnostic of the work that goes in creating visualisations.", "Yes, the data is still the data, but in selecting, filtering, manipulating and presenting the data, we make a myriad choices. In turn, these choices vastly affect the output and the readers\u2019 impressions.", "Data visualisation is simply a tool designed to serve a purpose. It is not something that exists for its own sake. More specifically, the visualisation needs to match the underlying intent \u2014 that is, the information that one is trying to convey, and do that effectively. And the authors need to consider what that message is, and what its purpose is.", "And in the current climate, where we are living through a pandemic that has already cost millions of jobs, displaced people, deprived people of hospital care and potentially could cost hundreds of thousands of lives, the stakes have never been higher.", "As Amanda Makulec said perfectly in this piece \u2014let\u2019s #VizResponsibly.", "If you liked this, say \ud83d\udc4b / follow on twitter, or follow here for updates. Also, ICYMI, I wrote about various countries\u2019 healthcare capacities here:", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
