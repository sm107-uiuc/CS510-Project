Whether positive cases, official deaths, people recovered, most of the data available about COVID-19 is misleading. It\u2019s commonly acknowledged that it\u2019s just a matter of how far off the numbers really are.", "In particular, official numbers of COVID-19 deaths generally come from hospitals. People who die at home may not be counted since they are never tested for the coronavirus. As a consequence, death toll may have been underestimated. However, this discrepancy is normally hard to quantify, since government data is often the only source of information available.", "I focus my research on the situation in Italy, given the large availability of primary and secondary data on COVID-19 epidemic for this country. Tracking the evolution of any epidemic and quantifying its progression is an extremely challenging operation, therefore it is likely that other countries have faced the same problems leading to huge underestimations.", "Just two days ago, on May 4th, the Italian National Statistical Service (ISTAT) has published a large dataset reporting every single death occurred in the country, from any cause and not necessarily related to COVID-19. Deaths are reported by day, municipality, gender and age group, containing data for 6,866 municipalities (out of 7,904 - 87% coverage). The dataset focuses on the period from January 1st to March 31st, and it is associated with the historical data for the last 5 years.", "The main goal of this paper is to compare the average mortality of a normal period with the number of deaths registered during the COVID-19 epidemic. The excess of deaths with respect to the years without the epidemic can be explained with the COVID-19 direct and indirect effects.", "We will leverage the full potential of Python data science libraries to analyze the data, identify anomalies on death rates, compare them with official COVID-19 death tolls, and finally map the results.", "This work has been developed with Python-3.7.1 on macOS, and it primarily makes use of open source data science libraries such as Pandas, Geopandas, andMatplotlib.", "You can find the Python code for the whole article here.", "Let\u2019s start importing the necessary libraries.", "Now, we import the large sheet published by ISTAT, reporting deaths recorded by Municipality, age, gender and date (approximately 1 million records). We translate field names to English and remove the Municipalities when the data for March 2020 is missing (about 13% of the rows). Then, we keep only the data for February and March.", "The next step consists in calculating the number of deaths registered in every Municipality in a year without the epidemic. This variable, that we name baseline_deaths, is created by calculating the average of the deaths registered between 2015 and 2019. The difference between baseline_deaths and the deaths for March 2020 is called excess_deaths, and it consists in the anomalies that can be attributed to the COVID-19 epidemic.", "We can now visualize the evolution of these three key variables in time: baseline_deaths (the average number of deaths in the last 5 years), deaths_2020 and excess_deaths. The following code produces a chart showing the trends on a national level.", "The chart clearly shows us that in March 2020 something unusual and dramatic happened, and during some days between 21st and 28th March the number of daily deaths almost doubled in Italy. Now it would be interesting to visualize the percentage increase of deaths in 2020 compared to the average.", "The peak is even more visible in this chart. In fact, the winter of 2019\u201320 was exceptionally mild and there were fewer deaths due to the flu epidemic than the average of the previous years. Then, around March 4th, COVID-19 epidemic started killing the first people in the country. Considering the whole month of March, in Italy mortality has increased by 49.36 %.", "We now have all we need to compare the anomalous amount of death registered in March 2020 with the official COVID-19 death toll published by the Italian Civil Protection.", "The code below downloads the official death toll of the Civil Protection GitHub account and compares it with the excess deaths registered in 2020.", "The peak registered in March is not fully explained by the official COVID-19 death toll provided by the Italian Civil Protection. In March 2020 ISTAT reported 24,668 additional deaths compared to an average non-epidemic year. For the same period, the Civil Protection reported only 12,399 official COVID-19 deaths, which is only the 50.26 % of the excess of deaths. The remaining numbers are most probably due to \u2018hidden\u2019 COVID-19 cases (people who died at home without being tested for the virus), or to indirect effects of the epidemic (saturated hospitals, lower health service, difficulty or reluctance to timely enter in hospitals\u2026). Moreover, we know that ISTAT reports the figures only for 87% of the municipalities. Therefore, the reality is likely even worse than our conservative estimate suggests.", "We know that the virus didn\u2019t hit the whole country with the same intensity. The epidemic has brought northern Italy to its knees, while southern Regions have been left relatively untouched by the crisis. The dataset published by ISTAT provides information associated with very high spatial resolution, and it is possible to inspect the deaths anomalies also on a Regional and Provincial level.", "First, let\u2019s focus on the 6 most affected Regions, comparing their baseline_deaths with deaths registered in 2020.", "Again, we notice a regular trend of deaths in 2020, until the beginning of March. But the Region of Lombardia is considerably more affected than the others. Let\u2019s now visualize the trend of excess_deaths and the percentage increase compared to the five years average.", "The chart above shows that around 23rd March 2020 Piemonte, Liguria, Marche and Emilia-Romagna have doubled the average daily deaths of the last 5 years. But again, the most severe situation occurred in Lombardia, that between 18th and 28th March has registered 3 times the number of the average daily deaths.", "It is now possible to create a map of the deaths increase registered in the entire month of March 2020, by Region. Boundaries of Italian Regions can be downloaded as a shapefile from the Italian National Institute of Statistics\u2019 website.", "The map clearly shows the different situations in the opposite sides of the Country: while northern Italy is suffering from an extreme increase of deaths, it is interesting to notice that in some southern Regions mortality has declined compared to the average of the last five years. This is probably due to the effects of the severe lockdown measures (less road and work accidents, reduced seasonal flu epidemic\u2026) and the exceptionally mild winter, but this hypothesis should be further validated with dedicated analysis.", "ISTAT dataset allows us to go even deeper with our analysis, and compare baseline_deaths with death_2020 on a provincial basis. In the following charts we will focus on the six most affected Provinces.", "Among the 6 most affected Provinces, 4 are in Lombardia and 2 in Emilia-Romagna Regions. In particular, the chart shows an extreme peak for Bergamo Province: in March it has reported even more deaths than Milano, which is about 3 times bigger in terms of total population. Let\u2019s now inspect the provincial excess_deaths and the percentage of death increase, by Province.", "The magnitude of the disaster happened in Bergamo Province is now even clearer. In some days of the month (between 16th and 26th) this Province experienced 10 times the average deaths of a non-epidemic year. Also other Provinces (Piacenza, Brescia, Cremona) have been heavily affected, with some peaks reaching 600% of the normal death rate.", "The last step of this analysis consist in the creation of the provincial map of the death increase for the month of March 2020. Boundaries of Italian Provinces are available as shapefile on the ISTAT website.", "The outputs of the analysis for the most affected Provinces are summarized in the table below.", "The information contained by the table above can be seen as the most accurate analysis on the epidemic effects in Italy in term of overall mortality.", "Some analysis performed in this article have been inspired by the work published by Prof. Federico Ricci-Tersenghi, who managed to quantify the ratio between direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on the excess deaths. I also thank Greg O\u2019 Callaghan, Rohini Swaminathan and Virginia Eterno for reviewing the draft of this article and for suggesting edits and improvements.", "All the code I developed for the analyses and maps displayed in this article are available on my GitHub repository.", "I am learning everyday, if you notice any mistakes please feel free to correct me and write your suggestions in the comment section.", "Note from the author: I am not an epidemiologist, the analysis shown in this article are only based on pure maths applied to publicly available data.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
