It is only the dose which makes a thing poison.\u201d \u2015 Paracelsus", "The lucrative nature of peddling counterfeit and adulterated drugs has led to the proliferation of the global trade of illegal health products. This is also driven by an increase in consumer demand for these products, and the low cost in purchasing them. The obvious downside is that the consumption of these health products purchased from dubious sources run the risk of causing serious health problems to the consumers.", "These products often contain undeclared ingredients to enhance the effects to entice consumers to take them. These ingredients may be hazardous (especially if taken without medical supervision), over- or under- dosed, banned or have not been assessed for safe use in humans.", "In a bid to better understand the illegal health product trade in Singapore, I decided to conduct an analysis of the publicly released list of detected and tested illegal health products reported by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA).", "This analysis was sparked by a conversation I had with a fellow Entrepreneur First cohort member (Shrey Chaturvedi), when we were discussing about potential problems to tackle in the Southeast Asia counterfeit drug market. I decided it was a good opportunity to work on this mini-project related to what I enjoy \u2014 the intersection of drugs and data.", "The database for illegal health products reported by the HSA is available for public viewing on this page. Although this list is not exhaustive, it still serves as a reasonable sample of all the illegal health products being traded in Singapore.", "This dataset is presented as a data table on the site, and was accessed and retrieved on 15th August 2020.", "The features available are as follows:", "The contents of the database on the site was manually transcribed and saved as an Excel (.xlsx) file with the use of Notepad++ and Microsoft Excel. This was then imported into Jupyter Notebook for further analysis using Python 3.", "Having come across street side counterfeit drug peddlers while overseas on holiday, my initial hypothesis is that these counterfeit drugs are mainly lifestyle products. In particular, the \u2018best-seller\u2019 is likely sex-enhancement drugs targeted at the adult male population.", "There are a total of 245 reported illegal health products documented in the HSA Illegal Health Products database at the time of this writing.", "All 54 rows with null values in the \u2018Dosage Form\u2019 column were associated with tablets as displayed in the respective \u2018Product Description\u2019 column. These null values were thus filled with \u2018Tablet\u2019 as a dosage form entry, thereby creating a new Dosage Form category of \u2018Tablet\u2019 not utilized previously. The count of null values for each column in the final dataset is shown below:", "The null values for shape and color were mainly due to products packaged as vials and bottles, which are harder to characterize as compared to the usual oral tablets or capsules.", "Given that there was plenty of missing data in the \u2018Remarks for Dosage Form Marking\u2019 column (i.e. 61.2% NA), the review of product markings was omitted in this analysis.", "There were 13 products with dosage form stated as \u2018Pill\u2019, which was an uninformative categorization. The product images were reviewed manually to determine its exact dosage form (i.e. tablet or capsule).", "Now to the main part of this analysis, which is the patterns and findings observed.", "The product description gives the name of the product, along with some useful (albeit brief) information about its intended use for the consumer. Given that we are dealing with text strings here, it would be a good idea to use a word cloud generator (with Python WordCloud library) to illustrate the text frequency in these descriptions.", "After removing uninformative stop words (e.g. \u2018Brand\u2019, \u2018Capsule\u2019, \u2018Jiao Nang\u2019 (which means capsule in Chinese) \u2018Tablet\u2019), the following word cloud was produced:", "It is clear that most of these words are romanization of Chinese characters (i.e. Hanyu Pinyin). This suggests that many products are mainly labelled in Chinese, and interpreting this full word cloud is not the best way to understand the nature of these products.", "Given that the word cloud suggests a high occurrence of Chinese characters, it would be interesting to see the proportion of the illegal health products containing Chinese characters in their product description.", "It can be seen that the list of illegal drugs is dominated by products labeled in Chinese (73.5%). This might imply that either the Chinese population is the primary target group for illegal drug dealers, or that these products are sourced primarily from China.", "The next step is to generate a Chinese character word cloud. This was done by first using regular expression (regex) to extract all Chinese characters from the \u2018Product Description\u2019 column, and using Python\u2019s jieba library to tokenize these Chinese characters. With certain Chinese stop words removed (e.g. \u80f6\u56ca), the WordCloud library was used once again to generate a word cloud:", "With this Chinese word cloud, it becomes easier to understand the nature of the illegal health products.", "It is also important to analyse the other products that did not contain any Chinese characters, which make up 26.5% of this illegal drugs dataset. After removing English and Malay stop words (e.g. Kapsul, Obat), the generated word cloud is shown below:", "Similar to what was seen earlier for the Chinese-labeled products, these products also appear marketed for weight loss and sexual enhancement for men. This is observed from the English words (e.g. \u2018Men\u2019, \u2018Sexual\u2019, \u2018Slim\u2019, \u2018Weight\u2019), as well as some of the suggestive Malay words (e.g. \u2018Kuat\u2019 (strong), \u2018Untuk Pria\u2019 (for men), \u2018Tongkat Ali\u2019 (herb known for its use in managing erectile dysfunction). All these insights support the earlier hypotheses that sexual enhancement drugs are the leading counterfeit products being traded.", "The majority of these illegal health products are in oral solid dosage forms, namely capsules and tablets.", "This is unsurprising since oral formulations offer many advantages such as:", "Since white is the most commonly occurring color for oral medications in general, it is also not surprising to see that white is the predominant color for these illegal health products as well. The next three most common colors happen to be the standard primary colors of red, blue and green.", "In terms of the dosage form shape, the predominant shape is oblong.", "By looking at the above charts separately, you might imagine that the most common design is that of a white oblong capsule. However, we should be looking at it from the combined sequence of dosage form, color and shape. With that, it is evident that the most common dosage form design was in fact a green oblong capsule instead of a white one.", "Here is an example of what a green oblong capsule looks like:", "It can be seen that the majority of these illegal health products (60.6%) do not have any markings on them. This makes it all the more difficult to pinpoint the specific identity of these drugs, as well as to distinguish the counterfeit products from the real ones.", "Adulterants are the undetected and unapproved potent medicinal ingredients in the health product, and these adulterants are the main reasons why these counterfeit products are deemed illegal.", "These adulterants can cause serious adverse health effects owing to accidental misuse, overuse, or interaction with other medications, underlying health conditions, or other ingredients within the supplement.", "The following table show the top 10 most common adulterants that form a part of these illegal products.", "Now would be a good time to bring in some pharmacological knowledge into the fray, by describing the top 5 adulterants seen in the above table.", "(1) SildenafilWhat is it? Sildenafil is by far the most common adulterant found in illegal health products. Sildenafil is the generic name of the active compound found in Viagra (brand name), and is used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED).", "Fun Fact: Sildenafil was originally developed for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and angina pectoris (chest pain due to heart disease). However, during the clinical trials, researchers found the drug to be more effective at inducing erections than treating angina.", "Side Effects: While most side effects are generally mild (e.g. flushing, headaches), there is a risk of more severe reactions such as vision loss, priapism (persistent and painful erection), and severe hypotension. These risks are certainly amplified when consuming these counterfeit products, whereby the dosages contained within them are poorly regulated.", "(2) SibutramineWhat is it? Sibutramine is a compound used for weight loss. This supports the insights gathered earlier that weight loss is a common area which illegal health products tend to target. Sibutramine works by increasing thermogenesis and making the user feel fuller after a meal, and it has mainly been studied in obese patient populations.", "Side Effects: It is known to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events like heart attack, stroke and hypertension.", "(3) TadalafilWhat is it? Being in the same drug class as Sildenafil (i.e. Phosphodiesterase-5 Enzyme Inhibitors), Tadalafil is also used to treat ED, and shares many similar features with Sildenafil. Its brand name is Cialis.", "(4) PhenolphthaleinWhat is it? Phenolphthalein is a laxative, and is commonly found in adulterated weight loss products. Multiple dietary supplements containing Phenolphthalein and Sibutramine have been previously recalled by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) due to their unapproved inclusion in the supplements.", "Side Effects: Phenolphthalein exposure has been associated with carcinogenicity (i.e. can cause cancer).", "(5) LignocaineWhat is it? Lignocaine is an anesthetic, meaning that it is a medication used to numb tissues in a specific body region when applied topically on the skin or mucous surface. It typically comes in the form of topical products (e.g. spray, gels), and is used to manage premature ejaculation due to its numbing effect.", "Side Effects: Topical use has generally mild side effects such as itch/redness, but the potentially poor quality of the illegal product may lead to unexpected hypersensitivity/allergic skin reactions.", "From here, I decided to take a closer look at these Lignocaine-containing products, to confirm my hypothesis that all supplements containing Lignocaine are of the topical dosage form.", "Although the most common dosage form is indeed something used for topical application (liquid for external use), I was surprised to see that there were quite a number of oral capsule and tablet products containing Lignocaine as well, especially since Lignocaine is not meant for oral consumption. This is certainly something worth looking deeper into.", "This analysis offers some insights into the trends and patterns observed in the illegal health product trade in Singapore, which can be of value for authorities like the HSA. For example, by understanding the common marketed claims and main groups of people targeted by illegal dealers, specially curated education campaigns can be conducted to raise awareness so that the public understands how to better protect themselves.", "Having access to more data (such as place of purchase, country of manufacture, date of reporting, profiles of peddler/consumer etc.) would also help to make this analysis more insightful and useful in tackling the peddling of such illegal products.", "In reality, it can be very challenging to distinguish real products from counterfeit ones. So here is some advice from your friendly pharmacist: Always purchase your medications and health products from registered medical institutions, clinics and pharmacies. If you do encounter such illegal products being peddled, you may report it to the HSA Enforcement Branch via phone (6866 3485) or email (hsa_is@hsa.gov.sg)", "I look forward to hearing your feedback on the above analysis.
