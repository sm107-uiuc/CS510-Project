This is a fictional and creative story\u2026 | by Soumalya Nandi | Towards Data Science", "h1": "The Origin Of Data Science", "description": "Over the years, different data types & various statistical & ML processes fought over the argument of who is more important? Data or algorithm? But the final outcome of the feud led to revolution."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["In some parallel universe, like our beloved planet earth, there is also a planet named SCIENCE, which is a neighbor to other planets like Arts, Humanities, Technology etc in the Education galaxy. Like our planet has various countries, there are different fields in Science. The most powerful field is undoubtedly Mathematics. Almost every other fields in Science imports resources from it. But in recent days another field is becoming more and more powerful day by day. Many believes that it is not any separate field, but is only an area of Mathematics. This field is known as Statistics. A widely spread field with lots of resources but unfortunately experiencing lots of communal riot recently. Also a neighboring field, Machine Learning has started to interfere in this field. So one thing is for sure, the environment of Statistics is not very peaceful nowadays.", "As countries have different states, the field of Statistics also has various areas like visualization, probability, classification, ANOVA, sampling distributions,stochastic process etc. Each area is controlled by some highly sophisticated personnel known as analytical process or algorithms. In different areas different algorithms contest among themselves to be declared the best. For example, in the area of classification, the competition is very tough among logistic, svm, decision tree and Naive Bayes. But how are these processes are gaining their power? Who are helping them to reach to the top? They are the most important and probably hence the most neglected part of any analysis. DATA. The fame of Statistics or precisely of the various processes of Statistics is due to data. But unfortunately data is not getting any fame. They are tensed, frustrated and angry. They want change. They can not take the fact anymore that algorithms are using data to make themselves famous.", "Therefore on an auspicious day, different types of data have gathered together to reach a way to resolve the issue. They also have invited top algorithms of different areas to come to a mutual settlement in a peaceful way. The meeting is headed by a high dimensional image data.", "Head of the meeting: My respected processes and algorithms, and my dear fellow data; we have gathered here today to solve this feud between us. My data friends! we have been betrayed by algorithms. They are using us, they are changing us, dividing us, but not providing any facilities in return. We won\u2019t tolerate this anymore. we want to be free.", "Table: But we are doing it for your own good. I have given you people a proper look. Who bothers about your raw form? No one, absolutely no one. I have given you a structured look.", "Histogram: And I have provided you a graphical look, better than tabular at least. (giving a contemptuous look to Table) (pie chart and scatter-plot nodding from back).", "Continuous Data: Yes, we agree to that. But what have we got for that? Everyone is praising you. Histogram is a great way to present grouped continuous data. Why can\u2019t we get the same fame as you do?", "Arithmetic Mean: See guys, don\u2019t get us wrong. We are helping you. You are the building blocks of this holy field of Statistics. It is the human society, they always require a precise and compact form of data. They fail to understand the raw form of you. That is why they take our help. We just represent you guys to a compact form so that\u2026", "Numeric Data: So that they can discuss that AM is most useful measure of central tendency? Right? Come on AM!! don\u2019t try to make us fool. Few outliers from our side and you will be doomed. And for your friend GM, only a zero will do. So please keep your mouth shut.", "Median: Hahahahahaha\u2026. should I say something?", "Continuous Data: Oh Gentlemen, please!! Stop this nonsense. We are not here to fight. Yes, Mr. Categorical, it seems that you are a bit angry. want to contribute any of your views?", "Categorical Data: Yeah, I have a question. (addressing to algorithms) Most of you don\u2019t know how to tackle me, those who have some knowledge have divided me and my fellow categoricals into dummies. Why? We get abused for that. If you guys are so much efficient then why can\u2019t you handle us with our raw form? I can have 50 different values, for that will you divide me into 49 dummies? That is not justified, not at all. Its against the laws of Data Rights. Do you take my permission before creating dummies?", "Now everybody is silent. No one has any answer. Suddenly K-NN stands up and says \u201cSince the beginning of this meeting you have accused us. What about the pain that you have caused us?\u201d", "Head of the meeting (looking astonished): Sorry? We have caused you pain? Are you joking? Can you please elaborate?", "K-NN (with his own pride): Have you forgotten about \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d? huhh? We have failed abruptly in several occasions because of your high dimensionality.", "Head of the meeting: What else could we have done? The way you guys started to capture all of us, we tried to make ourselves more complex. We thought if we increase our dimensions, you would fail to capture us. But in the mean time you people became too greedy for features. You started to search for data with more and more variables to train yourselves better. Its not our curse, it is the curse of your own greed.", "(staring towards visualization techniques) Only you people have kept the faith. Thank you very much for that!!", "3D Scatter-plot : Don\u2019t be!! Since we have PCA, t-SNE on our side we are still silent today.", "(standing up he continues): See guys, let me be very clear about this. No matter what you data people try from your side, you will fail eventually. You increased your dimension, we invited PCA, LDA to our area. You even converted yourselves into unstructured format. You challenged us with text, we replied with NLP. You showed us images, we call CNN. You are of no match to our progress. What will you do huhh? (shouting) What will you do? I know what will do. You will change yourselves into BIG DATA. Right? High volume, real time data. No problem. We have MapReduce and Spark with us also. Statistics is at its best today. No one can defeat us.", "Ordinal Data: So you are saying that MapReduce and Spark also belong to the field of Statistics?", "3D Scatterplot: Yes. This field is everything.", "K-Means (holds him and make him sit): Don\u2019t get too excited 3d. You are a bit wrong this time. It is utmost true that this field is necessary for almost everyone of us, but it is not sufficient. I am fro your neighboring field Machine Learning but I am still equally important and famous.", "Normal Distribution: So it is an if condition, not if and only if. Not everything is like the relation between uncorrelated and independence under my supervision. Hehe (shy laugh)", "Discrete Data: You are another pimp. You promised us that you will give us a good symmetric bell shape. Almost every of my fellow continuous data fell into the trap. Now we get it. All these processes used you to get to us, as you are the easiest to handle with some beautiful properties. We believed us, trusted you, but you have betrayed us.", "Normal Distribution: Oh hello sir!! Don\u2019t blame me. Who had told you to increase your size? Were you not aware of my goon CLT? You all knew. still you started to increase your size enormously. Sorry fellas, but you yourselves cam under me.", "Linear Regression being an aged and wise process, was sitting silent and observing these heated arguments. Now he stands up, everybody else stops. Thinking what he might say.", "Linear Regression: Yes, my fellow data. You are right. We are nothing without you. We need you to train ourselves, we need you to test ourselves, we need you to validate ourselves. It is because of you people, none of us is perfect even today. None of us can say that he/she is efficient on every type of you. K-means can not capture arbitrary shaped clusters among you, but DBscan can. (DBscan taking pride). Whereas K-means can tag everyone of you to a cluster but DBscan can not. (DBscan squeezes). Everything that we are today, good or bad, efficient or inefficient, its all because of you. None of us is 100% accurate because of your variety and volume.", "(he continues, after taking a pause): But on the other hand it is also true, human beings value you because we are there. What will you become without us? Some useless redundant insignificant data. We need each other, my friends. Hence I have come up with a suggestion. Would you like to hear it?", "Head of the meeting: Yeah sure, why not!!", "Linear Regression: Why don\u2019t we create a new area for you to stay? Some processes from Statistics and our neighbor Machine Learning will also be there. Well, that area will not be fully inside the field of Statistics. I will talk other fields also. It will be an intersection of area of Statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Science. But the most important thing is that, you will be given the highest respect there. We will stay together there and will collaborate with each other to produce some great insights as our resources. So, what do you say?", "They all seems to be happy. After a small discussion among themselves, the Head of the meeting addressing all: Okay, we accept your proposal. But we have one request. We want that area to be named after us.", "Linear Regression: Fair enough. (thinking for a few seconds, smiling he says) How about DATA SCIENCE then!!!!!", "Everyone starts to jump in joy. Finally they have something in their favor. The processes and algorithms are also happy as nothing is taken away from them.", "That is how Data Science evolved as a designated area in the intersection part of Statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Science and Data where every member has its own role and is given equal importance.", "It is important for Data Scientists and Data Science aspirants to pay focus on data as well. No matter how complex or how popular your model is, if the data is junk or is not of the correct format, your model will result into something insignificant. So first and foremost focus should be on Data. To clean the data, to make the data in right format. And then finally choose an algorithm that is appropriate for the data. Not every clustering algorithm is suitable for every type of data. Selection of appropriate Data should be the first step of any analysis.", "This is my first post. Feedback or criticism in the comment section will help me in future to provide with better creative writings.", "Your home for data science.
