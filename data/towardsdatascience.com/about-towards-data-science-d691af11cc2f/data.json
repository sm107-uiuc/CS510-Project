Using Medium, we provide a platform for thousands of people to exchange ideas and to expand our understanding of data science.", "\u201cIdeas and perspectives you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\u201d", "The emphasis on people rather than on advertisements renders Medium unique. It not only helps writers to present their original ideas, but it also offers a clean reading experience to a broad audience of engaged readers.", "The Medium ecosystem is kept clear to remain transparent with a user-friendly Terms Of Service and simple rules accessible to all. Writers are better protected because they are in control of the licenses for their work.", "Furthermore, in 2017 Medium launched the internet\u2019s first open Paywall. This paywall enables creators to \u201cearn money from a community of readers that believes ideas and creativity are worth paying for\u201d. We are thrilled to be a part of it!", "We joined Medium\u2019s vibrant community in October 2016. In the beginning, our goal was simply to gather good posts and distribute them to a broader audience. Just a few months later, we were pleased to see that we had a very fast growing audience and many new contributors.", "Today we are working with more than 4 editors and 15 volunteer editors (Editorial Associates) to prepare the most exciting content we can find for our audience. We provide customized feedback to our contributors using Medium\u2019s private notes. This allows us to promote our latest articles across social media without the added complexity that we might encounter using another platform.", "The success of Medium\u2019s Ecosystem attracts more and more unique voices eager to share something that matters. In February 2017 Ev Williams, CEO of Medium, reported that more than 50,000 writers publish on Medium every week. This striking figure is still growing. Better still, Medium is a platform for everyone, meaning you get authors from everywhere - who are professional and also new to the journey.", "This impressive community of authors is what lifted our following, drove the early days of Towards Data Science, and continues to be the reason we\u2019re still here. In January 2020, we counted thousands of authors that were located around the globe, and we are grateful to receive so many of your new contributions every day.", "People join for all sorts of reasons, whether it\u2019s to reach a broader audience, obtain critical feedback or to build professional networks within our community. Others like publishing with us as they remain the sole owner of their original work. Whether our authors choose to publish with us once week, a few times a month or several times during the year, they all offer a unique contribution that makes us who we are today.", "For instance, Jonny Brooks-Bartlett has published several articles on probability. Susan Li shared her latest codes and tutorials with the data science community. George Seif explained different types of clustering algorithms amongst a host of other concepts.", "Since we started, we have been amazed by the quality of the posts that we receive. We can feel the hard work and the willingness to share something important. We feel privileged to help and support our contributors to get their message across.", "While we allow independent authors to publish articles and videos in accordance with our rules and guidelines, we do not endorse each author\u2019s contribution.", "Towards Data Science started as a side-project created to help the data science and machine learning community share concepts, ideas, and code.", "Now an international team, we work day and night on the content shared on this platform. Every day, we review submissions and offer feedback to a multitude of authors. On top of that, we are always working on new projects to help our contributors reach our audience.", "For everything we do, we try to involve our community as much as possible.", "Our goal is to present well-written, informative articles that our audience is excited to read. Ultimately, we hope to make the world a better place. We believe that sharing and developing data-related knowledge is a crucial part of achieving this, so we work diligently to bring value to our community.", "\u201cWe believe that data-related knowledge is crucial in making the world a better place.\u201d", "As our publication grew over the years, we had to make decisions about the best ways to share our contributors\u2019 content. Here are a few important ones:", "Being hosted on Medium. We made the decision early on to be hosted on Medium and we\u2019re glad we did. Medium is a great platform. It offers speed, security, a smartphone app, and it allows for comments, highlights, notes, and more.", "We also appreciate that Medium doesn\u2019t allow ads. Ads are damaging the reputations of many platforms and we don\u2019t want businesses to be able to pay to get their products in front of your eyes. It disrupts and damages the exchange of ideas. Our authors can choose whether or not they want to be paid and we believe that the system offered by this platform encourages higher quality content.", "Growing and Learning. In 2016, we began as an open publication, and we accepted most of the submissions that we received. We were simply excited to start connecting with the data science community, sharing ideas and code. As our audience and responsibilities grew, we worked diligently to improve the quality of TDS. Since then, we\u2019ve released guidelines, rules, and terms and expanded our team of editors. We are continually working to improve the quality of our publication in every way we can.", "Please be aware that we don\u2019t necessarily endorse or agree with the content written by every one of our thousands of contributors. We also occasionally publish controversial opinions when we believe that they have the potential to create valuable discussion. We appreciate that there are many ways to see an issue, and we encourage our writers to approach problems from unusual angles. We aspire to spark intelligent discussion, and we love it when our readers respectfully offer their own insights, solutions, and thoughts.", "That being said, we are human. We make mistakes, and we occasionally miss errors in the articles we publish. If you feel that you\u2019ve found something that violates Medium\u2019s standards, Medium has made it easy to report any posts and users who violate its rules. We have also made it easy for our community to register a complaint, and we welcome your feedback and concerns.", "Prioritize the best, most unique essential content: Part of what we do at TDS is decide which posts get more exposure than others. We decide which articles are featured on our publication and for how long and which articles we share on our social media channels. We spend time trying to find the best, most unique, and most essential content to share and feature.", "When we use the term \u201cessential,\u201d we mean both information that\u2019s critical and underrepresented ideas. For example, we often feature exceptional posts about fairness, bias, safety, and interpretability in machine learning models longer than other articles because we want to make sure that they are seen and read by as many people in our community as possible.", "We created a collection dedicated to what we believe our community should learn more about with posts that we thought were valuable to share. You can find more info here if you wish to contribute.", "Stay Positive: Sometimes the best way to protest is to propose something new. We help people who are trying to present and share new ideas. The more we offer new ideas and share knowledge, the quicker we can solve the pressing problems.", "Focus on Improvement: As we care about the long-term, we always seek to achieve manageable and gradual improvement. We continually want to earn and build on our readers\u2019 trust!", "Be Grateful: Without Medium, or without our community, we never could have existed. We are thankful to all the people that have made this possible. We are especially grateful to our writers, Editorial Associates and anyone else who has helped us along the way.", "TDS is a publication with a global audience and a distributed editorial team. Our company is incorporated in Canada, with a registered office address in what is commonly called \"Toronto\", a traditional territory of many nations, including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee, and the Huron-Wendat peoples that have lived on the land for over 10,000 years. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous peoples from across Turtle Island and we acknowledge our place as non-Indigenous settlers on stolen land. Using and participating in a land acknowledgement is a way to recognize the enduring presence and resilience of Indigenous peoples in this area for time immemorial. They are also a reminder that we are all accountable to these relationships and no one is exempt from pursuing acts of reconciliation and allyship.", "Our commitment to equity and fairness goes beyond our geographic location and its history. TDS is a publication that focuses on data science and adjacent fields, and we acknowledge that the origins of modern statistics and computing are often inextricable from practices of eugenics, racism, and violence. In our work, we strive not only to recognize this history, but to actively promote voices and research that grounds data science as a force against discrimination, bias, and marginalization.", "Our work would not be possible without our Editorial Associates. Since we started recruiting in October 2017, they have raised the quality of the content published on Towards Data Science. We now have a team of kind and responsible people, eager to learn, to help and to understand our authors\u2019 ideas.", "Like in many bottom-up movements, Towards Data Science was also built with friends, family, and people who decided to help without wanting anything in return. We thank them, and you, for everything.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Building the most vibrant data science community on the web.
