Codefolding and code prettify."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html", "anchor_text": "jupyter_contrib_nbextensions", "paragraph_index": 0}, {"url": "https://datascience2.medium.com/subscribe", "anchor_text": "https://datascience2.medium.com/subscribe", "paragraph_index": 16}], "all_paragraphs": ["As a Data Scientist who primarily works in Jupyter Notebook, I have experienced several pros of development in my notebook, while also encountering many various issues as well. Some of those issues can be solved by jupyter_contrib_nbextensions [2]. If not solved, then the notebook can be enhanced. This Python package has numerous nb extensions that you can configure that help to make your Data Science development process easier. It is important to note that once you install this package, you will need to restart your notebook from your terminal to see its effects. Below, I will be describing the top 10 or essential Jupyter Notebook extensions that have helped me in my Data Science process.", "As you can see from the above screenshot, there are a ton of extensions that you can enable to make your Jupyter coding and Data Science development easier. I have selected and enabled the 10 extensions that I will also be describing down below. There are a few clicked that come pre-clicked already like the jupyter-js-widgets/extensions, which shows the widgets and icons once you enable your extensions. Similarly, there is also Nbextensions edit menu item already preselected.", "This extension allows your notebook to send you a web notification when your kernel becomes idle. If you have a long task running, this extension can be useful by becoming aware of your current process. You can have options of 0, 5, 10, and 30 seconds as well. Here is the dropdown menu example in your notebook.", "This is perhaps my favorite extension. Similar to the Collapsible Headings, this extension folds your code sections so that you can more easily scroll and view your notebook.", "If you have a long dictionary or a long function, you can collapse them so that they are mainly hidden but still show the function naming so that you can still see the main part. In the example below, you can see how the function is now collapsed, you can even collapse up to the comment level to hide both functions and keep the text of your comment only. The purple arrows icon shows that your code is there, but hidden. This extension is beneficial when sharing your code with others or when you would like to focus on certain parts of your notebook.", "This extension is rather simple and self-explanatory. You can highlight your markdown text by clicking on the highlighter icon. You can see that there are a few options like red with yellow used below. Here is the before and after of this easy, yet useful extension.", "Also simple, yet useful, is the spellchecker. This extension is especially useful if you are sharing your notebook, pushing it to GitHub, or displaying it to stakeholders. You will want to make sure you have correctly spelled your words in your markdown cells. You will not see misspelled words show up in your displayed markdown, but only in your edit. This feature is beneficial so that if you do have some words that you disagree on with the spellchecker, like Jupyter Notebook (is not actually Jupiter Notebook), you can still display it without a distracting, red, highlighted text.", "If you want to change the code font size, this extension allows you to do that. When sharing and collaborating, especially sharing your screen, this feature can prove to be beneficial so that your code is easier to view.", "This extension allows you to paste your current date and time into your cell. I recommend saving it as a markdown so that the formatting does not run as code with hard-to-see formatting. If you want to keep track of when you started a process that involved different cells and functions, this extension can be useful (on top of the popular tqdm library).", "This extension is incredibly useful. You can use your scratchpad as seen below, by selection Ctrl-B on your keyboard. You can modify the current code that can work off the same kernel as well. It is also useful for viewing side-by-side code and comments if you need to compare them within your notebook.", "This unique extension allows you to ignore some of the duplicate or long error messages you see in your Jupyter Notebook cells. It works similarly to the Collapsible Headings and Codefolding. In the screenshot below, you can see how the main part of the error is still there on the right, but reduces the duplicate error information that can sometimes cause a headache and overwhelm you from fixing that same error.", "So there you go, these were 10 essential Jupyter Notebook extensions for Data Scientists or anyone else who likes to code and develop in a Jupyter Notebook as well. I hope you learned some new tricks that can make your job as a Data Scientist easier. Keep in mind that there are plenty more extensions to explore as well. These are some that I find particularly interesting and useful.", "Here are all of the extensions I mentioned above in one spot:", "Thank you for reading! Please comment down below if you have had an experience with any of these or other Jupyter Notebook extensions.", "[8] M.Przybyla, Before and after of the highlighter extension screenshot, (2020)", "Your home for data science.
