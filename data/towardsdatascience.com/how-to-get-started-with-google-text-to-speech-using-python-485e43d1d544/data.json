I will give a brief introduction on text to speech and then I will cover how to get started with the installation of the Google text to speech (gTTS) module. We will then proceed to understand how the gTTS module exactly works and also write a simple program to grasp the overall concepts better. We will also explore more ideas on what else could be done using this module and then try to comprehend the many real-life use cases which can be accomplished using gTTS.", "Primary Requirement: An active internet connection with at least a moderate bandwidth. This is because we will be using the Google API for the text to speech translation.", "Note: This will be the first part of the language modeling tutorial. In this tutorial series, we will cover how to use google text to speech, optical character recognition, deep learning models like sequence to sequence models with attention, and other cool things.", "The text-to-speech (TTS) is the process of converting words into a vocal audio form. The program, tool, or software takes an input text from the user, and using methods of natural language processing understands the linguistics of the language being used, and performs logical inference on the text. This processed text is passed into the next block where digital signal processing is performed on the processed text. Using many algorithms and transformations this processed text is finally converted into a speech format. This entire process involves the synthesizing of speech. Below is a simple block diagram to understand the same.", "This seems like quite a complicated process, but thanks to python and the gTTS module, this process can be simplified to just a few lines of code. From the block diagram, we can understand that the text being passed is firstly pre-processed with the help of natural language processing, and then using digital signal processing is converted to speech.", "Without further ado, let\u2019s get our hands dirty with some code.", "We are going to be working with python for the rest of the tutorial. If you haven\u2019t installed python already, then please do so here.", "The installation of the gTTS module is simple and can be done using the following command in the command prompt terminal \u2014", "After the installation is done, we can proceed to write a very simple program to understand how exactly we can use this module to convert our typed text into a speech converted output. Open the python file and give it a name of your choice and make sure it ends with the .py format. Let us look at the program \u2014", "gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)is a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate text-to-speech API. We will import the gTTS library from the gtts module which can be used for speech translation.", "The text variable is a string used to store the user\u2019s input. The text can be replaced by anything of your choice within the quotes. Another alternative can be to use the input statement for the user to type their own desired input each time the program is run. This can be done as follows:", "The tts variable is used to perform the Google text-to-speech translation on the user\u2019s input. The output of the converted text is stored in the form of speech in the tts variable.", "The tts.save function allows us to save the converted speech in a format that allows us to play sounds. I have saved it in a file called hi and in a format called .mp3. Other formats like .wav format can also be used.", "We have successfully completed saving our file. Now there are 3 ways to run this file. I will go over all the 3 ways to do this task \u2014", "3. Using the playsound module: The playsound module can be installed with a simple pip install playsound command and then we can proceed to play the audio from the file using the following command.", "The gTTS module can be used extensively on other languages such as French, German, Hindi, etc., as well. This is extremely useful when there is a communication barrier and the user is unable to convey his messages to people. Text-to-speech is a great help to the visually impaired people or people with other disabilities as it can help them by assisting in the text to speech translation. There are also many ideas possible with the gTTS module and it can be used for other languages as well.", "There is potential for a lot of awesome projects with the same. I will encourage viewers to try experimenting around more with this module. Viewers can feel free to refer here for a cool project which I had previously done. In this series, we will see how we can implement a translation using deep learning and how the gTTS module will play a role in doing this.", "I hope all of you enjoyed this read and wish you all a wonderful day!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Love to explore and learn new concepts. Extremely interested in AI, deep learning, robots, and the universe.
