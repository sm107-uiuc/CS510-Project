Great, but how will you prove its worth? The answer: synthetic data.", "Synthetic data has several advantages over real data when evaluating a new approach. With synthetic data, the nature of the task, input features, dimensionality, sampling size, degree of noise, and other data factors are in complete control of the creator. Synthetic data problems vary widely, and a model\u2019s performance on these problems can tell a lot about the model\u2019s strong and weak spots \u2014 perhaps it performs well on linearly separable data or doesn\u2019t handle noise well \u2014 which can help understand what types of real-world data the model would perform well on.", "Synthetic data provides the blueprint for how the model can be applied to real data.", "In this article, I\u2019ll outline 5 binary classification synthetic data problems, provide Python code for creating data (with support for adjusting parameters), and explain how to interpret the results of these problems. Additionally, I will outline extensions to each problem.", "In the 2D Annulus Classification problem, there are two circles, both centered at (0.5, 0.5). The annulus is defined by two circles \u2014 the external one with radius 0.5, and the internal one with radius 0.3.", "All data points falling in the overlap of red and blue areas are labelled 1; otherwise, they are labelled 0.", "Written as a function, the annulus problem is:", "In the below diagram, a red point represents 1 and a blue point represents 0.", "The Annulus Problem\u2019s value lies in its non-linearity and geometrically obvious patterns.", "\u2026which can be tweaked to adjust the properties of the data.", "The first 10 rows of the data output are:", "400 data points with no noise:", "Many real-world datasets like medical diagnoses have feature spaces where the labels are more cleanly separated. A model that succeeds at the annulus problem with a reasonable amount of noise (z = 0.1 to 0.2) can recognize geometrically obvious and non-linear patterns in real-world data and has reasonable noise tolerance. By increasing or decreasing the area of the annulus, the model can be adapted for balanced or non-balanced problems. By decreasing the area of the annulus, the problem becomes non-balanced and resembles medical problems like cancer diagnosis where the number of positive diagnoses is much less than the number of negative diagnoses. By increasing the area of the annulus to half of the area of the grid, the problem becomes more balanced, which could be helpful in identifying male or female, under 18 or above 18, etc. Compare geometrically obvious problems with the Checkerboard problem.", "Like a checkerboard, alternating 2-dimensional spaces are marked as 0 and 1. All values of 1 (red) have x1 and x2 values of the same parity (either both even or both odd) while all values of 0 (blue) have x1 and x2 values of opposite parity.", "This can be represented mathematically as", "One solution to the checkerboard problem is as below:", "Each diagonal line separates the points into their respective colors.", "The checkerboard problem is valuable in two ways \u2014 firstly, because while the data is linearly separable, the fact that it requires multiple lines to separate it gives it more realism and complexity; secondly, the data is interspersed such that from a computer perspective, where data is not geometrical but numerical, there is no geometrical pattern but only a numerical one.", "In the checkerboard problem, the adjustable parameters are:", "A model that performs well on the checkerboard problem performs well on heavily interspersed data; whose more complex relationships are not necessarily geometrical but numerical. It also performs well on data that is layered; that is, only separable by multiple lines.", "In the X-Dimensional (default X = 10) parity problem, an X-bit string is categorized as a 1 if it has an odd number of 1s (hence, an odd number of 0s) and categorized as a 0 if it has an even number of 1s (hence, an even number of 0s). This parity problem is non-linear.", "The X-Dimensional Parity problem\u2019s value comes in that there exists a deeper mathematical relationship between all columns rather than one column being the most important. It could be the checkerboard problem without the geometric aspect; the parity problem cannot be analyzed geometrically.", "Since there are more than 2 dimensions, we\u2019ll try to visualize the data with principal component analysis.", "A rather low explained variance, but it should be enough to show the general nature of the data.", "It\u2019s clear that there is no clear geometric pattern that cleanly determines the label.", "Models that succeed at the X-Dimensional Parity problem succeed in datasets where the final target is a semi-equal combination of all features, such as data whose less-useful columns have been eliminated via some feature importance method.", "There are two features whose XOR values create the final target, and x additional random features as noise. By default, x is 97 (such that there are 100 columns in total, including the label column).", "The XOR function acts as such:", "If both inputs are the same, the output is 0; otherwise, the output is 1.", "The XOR Problem\u2019s value comes from the fact that there is a very simple numerical relationship hidden under several layers of random data.", "The parameters that can be adjusted are:", "The output DataFrame (\u2018nf\u2019 stands for \u2018noise feature\u2019):", "Models that perform well in the XOR Problem (especially with high dimensionality) are able to strongly identify which features are important and which ones are irrelevant. These types of models might perform well on the MNIST dataset for digit recognition, as there are certain pixels that are useless in determining the final digit and certain pixels whose underlying relationship have a heavy say in the final label.", "The Corral dataset has 6 binary features, and the label is determined by (f1 AND f2) OR (f3 AND f4), where fn denotes the nth input. Any additional number of features n (default 1) have an m% (default 75%) correlation with the class label, and any number p (default 5) of additional random features may be added.", "The Correlation Problem\u2019s value is measuring how a model can utilize correlated features and to identify heavily correlated features from random features.", "The parameters that can be adjusted are:", "In several real-world datasets, features will be correlated in that they do not completely predict the target but are closely enough linked such that it has a heavy say in the label. A model that performs well in the Correlation problem can tell three types of features present in real-world data \u2014 direct features, whose combination reveals a \u2018golden rule\u2019 to finding the output, correlated features that give the right answer most of the time, and irrelevant features whose presence clouds accuracy.", "Your home for data science.
