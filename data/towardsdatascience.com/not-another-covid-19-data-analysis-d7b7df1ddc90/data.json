There are a lot of data analysis and data analysis articles springing up on Medium, showing some pretty cool visualisations and predictions of the disease. You might be pleased to know, that this really isn\u2019t another one of those posts and I\u2019m going to explain why\u2026", "I am a baby data scientist, and even that is stretching reality a bit. Sure, I am interested in what I can do with the Covid-19 data, but I am also very aware of the limits of my abilities. I have only recently started to get into Data Science, though I\u2019ve been programming for 7\u20138 years.", "We\u2019re also in a very interesting and turbulent time \u2014 I have no doubt that this period of time will be taught as part of History lessons in schools in future years! However, it\u2019s also a time that we need to be looking after our health: both physical and mental. There\u2019s so much information out there on Covid-19, but what is accurate? What should we be believing? Are all these bleak predictions true?", "Combining these two things: my lack of Data Science experience and the saturation of Covid-19 (mis-)information in our lives, I have decided not publish an article with a prediction of fatalities or how quickly it\u2019s going to spread.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I believe that Data Science is going to play an important role in society overcoming this, and future, disease(s) \u2014 but, I am not someone who\u2019s going to make a significant contribution to that.", "There are many other data sets out there that I can practice my skills on if that really is my aim. But publishing an article on my analysis of Covid-19 data, I feel, is only going to have a negative impact. Thinking about the two different scenarios\u2026", "Yes, Data Science will most likely contribute to the effort to overcome this.", "But, that is not to say publishing an article showing the results from a baby Data Scientist is going to be a good thing.", "My goal is to practice my skills and communicate my findings effectively, as probably with many Data Scientists. But, I also feel that we all have a responsibility to each other. There are plenty of other datasets that I can use to practice these very same skills, which are of far less interest to the population, but also won\u2019t negatively impact them so much. Or if I build up my skills enough, perhaps I could have some real impact focussing on other important things in the world that are getting ignored or forgotten whilst the focus is on Covid-19.", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to leave the data predictions and public communication of that work to those who really know what they\u2019re doing.", "Let\u2019s have a think about whether we really need to publish more on Covid-19 and perhaps give some focus to other important things in the world which are getting forgotten.", "Your home for data science.
