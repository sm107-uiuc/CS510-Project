We are not health professionals or epidemiologists, and the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice. To learn more about the coronavirus pandemic, you can click here.", "Covid-19 spreads like wildfire. this microorganism particle is rapidly changing the world. In less than four months, it has emerged from Wuhan (China) to almost every country in the world.", "On the 13 March 2020, the prime minister of UK Boris Johnson gave the Nation the latest coronavirus briefing. At the time he mentioned that the UK would use scientific research to model the best strategy based on the current shreds of evidence that are available, this loose control strategy was later indicted by the UK\u2019s chief scientific advisor Patrick Vallance as Herd Immunity.", "Britain would keep operating as normal without any stringent control or lockdown but at the same time, Boris addressed every Britain family should be prepared to \u201close loved ones before their time\u201d.", "And after 14 days of the Herd Immunity proposal, Boris Johnson was reported to test positive with COVID-19.", "In the same 14 days, UK has identified almost 20,000 infected cases with more than 1,200 death. (Data from March 30, 2020, and The UK government later imposed more strict legislation to suppress the outbreak)", "So what exactly is the herd immunity? And Is this the best way for us to combat the virus?", "Let\u2019s discuss the topic today through the lens of Data Science.", "The virus transmission process is extremely complicated in its nature. There are various epidemiological models to explain or simulate the spread of infectious disease. But for a basic understanding, we start with a simple model.", "In this model, we have two fundamental concepts of grounding (basic reproduction number and generation interval)", "The basic reproduction number (R0), is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single (typical) infection in a completely susceptible population.", "It will help us to understand how quickly an infectious disease will spread across the population.", "If the R0 is less than 1, for example, 0.5. Then one person will produce 0.5 new cases, the secondary 0.5 cases will pass the virus to the next 0.25 cases. Thus the infected population will be getting smaller. and die out without any chance to become a global epidemics.", "If the R0 is close or equal to 1, meaning that one person will only pass the virus to another, then to the next one. We end up having a flat line of the infectious case. Hence we call it endemic (local spread), for example, chickenpox.", "The last scenario is when the R0 is larger than 1, for example, 2, then the growth will be exponential, 2 to 4, 4 to 8 and eventually reach the tipping point that it cannot be contained in a local area. We now call it a pandemic.", "Once a virus outbreak becomes a pandemic, there are normally two endings, the patient is either die (break the circulation) or develop an immune system against the virus. (Stop the spreading)", "To conclude, the bigger the R0, the more contagious It will be. (some scientist use Rt for notation)", "A more realistic calculation of R0", "Take a look at the R0 for some of the well-known diseases. The most contagious one is Measles, it has a basic reproduction rate of 12\u201318, followed by diphtheria, with an R0 of 6\u20137.", "What is the generation interval? It is the period of time separating sequential infections.", "In a simple term, let\u2019s assume a Covid-19 patient can pass the disease to 2 others, so how long does this transmission gonna take? 1 day, 2 days or a week. This is the other critical factor in the mathematical model, the shorter the interval between two-generation, the more contagious it was.", "\u201cA\u201d is infected by the virus at the time that denoted as a circle. After a while, \u201cA\u201d shows some mild symptoms, denoted as a square.", "The gap between the circle and the square is the incubation period. ( period between exposure to an infection and the appearance of the first symptoms) The incubation period for Covid-19 varies quite a lot, ranging from 3 days to 20 days. Let\u2019s take a weighted average, 8 days.", "To point out, patient \u201cA\u201d is contagious throughout the whole incubation period, thus can infect person B anytime between the 8 days. Then it\u2019s gonna take another 8 days for B to show symptoms (marked as square as well). The time gap between the two squares is known as the generation interval. For Covid-19, it\u2019s around 4 days.", "Take \u201cRo = 2.5\u201d and \u201cGeneration Interval = 4\u201d, how long will it take Covid-19 to spread to the entire Europe if there is no intervention?", "By January 24, 2020, the first COVID-19 patient was confirmed in France. Unfortunately, the local government didn\u2019t pay enough attention thus gave a chance for the virus to take an outbreak with limited control.", "The above equation is deduct based on the summation of geometric progression, it calculates the accumulated predicted case of coronavirus in each generation (R0=2.5). The total population in Europe is 741 million then the result of t = 23 generations.", "Most of the people will be shocked by the number, thinking how come this is so small. That the magic of exponential growth.", "And when we take 4 days as per generation, the final result corresponds to 92 days.", "Remember, this is an extremely simple model, the real-world situation is much more complicated and the magnitude of more variables need to be factor into the dynamic epidemiological model.", "Here are a few Model that can be considered,", "Finally, we come to Herd Immunity.", "Economist summaries that the world governments are using three main methods to combat the Covid-19.", "As mentioned before, Britain is the first country that proposed the Herd Immunity approach to contain the disease( as shown form the graph above, the UK is the last country that enforces a lockdown).", "This theory is proposed a century ago (same as many Data Science classic models)", "As you can see in the visualization on the left side.", "The sicked case grows exponentially at the beginning and quickly infects most of the nodes. (Orange)", "But after a period of time, more and more nodes develop an immune system (purple).", "Thus the whole group is recovering back to its healthy state.", "Let\u2019s say if the British government go ahead and implement this approach, 66.4 M * 60 % \u2248 40 M people will be infected. Furthermore, the current case fatality rate (CFR) of Covid-19 is 4% and 8% in China and Italy prospectively, and let\u2019s assume Britain has the best health care system in the world that could bring down this rate to just 1%, there will still be about 40 M * 1% = 400 K death.", "Similarly, Neil Ferguson, an Imperial College London professor who leads the research on Covid-19 non-pharmaceutical research [Paper], said his original estimate, which showed the coronavirus would kill 500,000 people (with limited NPI, Non-Parmarcutical Intervention )in the U.K., remains true, while a new model reading reflecting the influence of lockdown measures saw that estimate shrink to 20,000 or fewer.", "In 2018, the total death toll in the UK is just over 500K. And with the herd immunity strategy, Covid-19 will take almost the same amount of people\u2019s lives in just a few months. And as a comparison, World War Two only cost over 450K lives in Britain including soldiers, nurses, citizens, etc. This implies Covid-19 will potentially have a larger impact in the UK than WWII.", "The supporters of the Herd Immunity approach argue that without a vaccine, this epidemic would return within a few weeks of the restrictions being lifted. The government might need to suppress the disease each time it resurfaces. This on and off-cycle must be repeated until either the disease has worked through the population or there is a vaccine which would be 6 months away.", "The Critics defend that there is no scientific evidence that supports the theory of a seasonal Covid-19 outbreak, and even if the public can build up the herd immunity it won\u2019t be effective when the virus mutates.", "The best example to look at is Measles.", "For all these characters, Measles seems like the best candidate for herd immunity.", "So did this disease die out soon?", "Measles\u2019 first appearance was in the 10th Century, it caused more than 2.6 million death each year till we discover vaccine in 1980.", "Before the age of the MMR vaccine, 90% (or some experts say 99% )of the infants will get Measles. The typical symptoms include rash and pneumonia or even brain damage for small cases.", "Even after we discovered the MMR. Measles is still hard to prevent and control.", "But, due to some of the negative comments on the bad reaction after receiving the MMR vaccine, the actual vaccination rate is only 86%.", "in 1998, The lancet of UK published an article talking about the measles vaccine may cause autism in children [Reference]", "We already eliminated smallpox, the next in the line for WHO is Measles, Polio, and Covid-19.", "However, to combat a pandemic with an R0=2.5 and CER of 1%, would people willing to get infected in order to gain public herd immunity?", "Mitigation cost too many lives and suppression may be economically unsustainable, herd immunity? Are we able to put a price tag on people\u2019s lives?", "When I saw the speech from the prime minister of the United Kingdom and the Chief Science Officer. I am both shocked and disappointed.", "The UK has long been the birthplace of great genius and great artists, some of the unformidable heroes of all time. They lighted up the entire world, Newton, Faraday, who brought humanity into the third industrial revolution; Charles Darwin, who tough us our origin; Shakespeare and Lennon, who made us laugh with tears; Churchill, who united the nation to defend its sovereignty against the enemy invasion.", "A county that first created a vaccine for clinical trials, the first country to conduct epidemiological research, and the country with the world\u2019s top researchers and best medical journal.", "Some people are using World War III as the metaphor for Covid-19, it will be remembered and recorded in human history as an event bigger than the Spanish flu and Black Death.", "I hope one day when the next generation looks back in history and sees the world is united regardless of ideologies and religions, rich or poor to fight against the virus.", "It is not the time for ease and comfort, not the time to shoving and blaming each other and use it as a political weapon.", "No one knows what we will face in the weeks ahead, but everyone knows enough to understand that COVID-19 will test our capacities to be kind and generous and to see beyond ourselves and our own interests. Our task now is to bring the best of who we are and what we do to a world that is more complex and more confused than any of us would like it to be.
