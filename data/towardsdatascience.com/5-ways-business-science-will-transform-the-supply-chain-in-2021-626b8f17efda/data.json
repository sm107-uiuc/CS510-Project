The coronavirus changed every aspect of our operations. One of the biggest trends in data science caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was an acceleration of the integration of data scientists and data-driven analysis into greater company operations. Data was vital to survive and thrive in the chaos caused by Covid.", "This trend was even more pronounced in the retail sector. As one of the hardest-hit sectors this year, retail turned to data science for solutions.", "Because of the increasing importance of data science \u2014 or business science as I think it\u2019s more appropriately considered \u2014 in retail, data-driven trends in the sector matter to every data scientist. It\u2019s not just for those of us focused on the supply chain, pricing or other retail-adjacent applications. Data science trends in retail portend trends for the field as a whole in the post-Covid world.", "Here are five critical trends that I forecast will dominate data science in retail in 2021 \u2014 and that every data scientist must therefore be prepared to face head-on in the new year.", "Almost every business uses Big Data. It\u2019s become a basic necessity of modern retail. Next step: automation.", "Over the next year, more companies than ever will automate their analytics, both in terms of data collection and analysis. Data quality doesn\u2019t matter unless you can leverage its insights autonomously.", "Business science must be autonomous, not just data-driven, to be effective.", "I\u2019ve been a tireless promoter of autonomous systems for analysis for years. Still, I\u2019m not the only person who thinks that 2021 will be the tipping point for automation in the retail sector. McKinsey has noted it as a key trend in both consumer goods and fashion for 2021. Automation is the future for retail \u2014 which means that data scientists will need to shift their focus to automated models and analytics.", "With the rapid acceleration of AI adoption that we\u2019ve seen over the past year, 2021 is likely to become a watershed for AI maturation. That is, more models will deliver the optimal outcomes desired from their implementation. In terms of Gartner\u2019s model for AI Maturity, many businesses will hit the final two stages. AI application in many organizations will finally tip into systematic or even transformational.", "For data scientists, AI maturation is exciting, as they can act like real business scientists, delivering accurate, actionable insights from their models. It also means an adjustment in the approach to model development. Optimization of a mature model is a new challenge that many of us will be facing over the next year.", "More than anything else, 2020 has taught us to expect the unexpected. Supply chains are vulnerable to unanticipated disruptions, whether they come from pandemics, natural disasters, or whatever crisis we face next.", "A good AI model can digest any relevant information, map micro-patterns and micro-trends, learn from its own mistakes, and continuously adjust \u2014 all automatically. Just like a human would react, but more efficiently \u2014 and also more constrained by verifiable data. That means that once armed with new data and even limited observations, AI models learn and respond to changing conditions much better than any economically viable team of human managers armed with Excel and their gut feelings alone ever could.", "Data-driven decisions can better mitigate the impact of sudden deviations from historical patterns, giving companies a vital competitive advantage.", "In 2021, more agile supply chains are only going to increase in importance as retailers prepare for the next disaster. As such, companies will demand more agile forecasting models from data scientists. Data scientists must prioritize creating models that can more deftly respond to data imperfections, model drift and drastic deviations from historical patterns.", "More agile supply chains will be the priority of every retailer, and more agile models will be the ultimate goal of every data scientist serving them.", "The coronavirus officially killed the traditional, top-down \u201cpush\u201d model of retail. Successful retailers must now let customer preferences and demands drive product offerings. A faster response time is vital to meet demand. Product lifecycles will be shorter, requiring the supply chain to adjust accordingly.", "What does that mean for data scientists? Speed is more important than ever.", "Models must work faster, supply chains must be optimized down to the second, and systems must recognize and respond to even the slightest change in consumer demand. For each of these developments, data scientists must work ever harder to increase data velocity (and improve all of the 5 Vs of Big Data!). Every data scientist will be pushing their models ever-closer to real-time data and analysis in 2021.", "During the pandemic, companies have rushed to implement AI, creating exponential growth in its adoption. Despite this, a report by Boston Consulting and the MIT Sloan Management Review reports that only 11% of companies implementing AI have seen sizeable returns on the investment. Why? Companies don\u2019t know how to use the technology effectively.", "For AI to fulfil its potential, AI must be easier to use.", "One of the biggest problems in AI that the pandemic exposed is the poor user experience of AI. The average retail executive struggles to use available tools designed for other data scientists. It\u2019s why I champion business science: data science is useless unless what you learn can be applied for practical, applicable insights.", "What does that mean for 2021? Data scientists will design AI optimization tools and applications to be more user-friendly. More self-service, highly accessible apps will be released at higher rates over the next year. Simple optimization tools will no longer be a secondary goal; it will be the primary focus of every data scientist designing models to optimize any element of the supply chain.", "In fact, my own company Evo has made the release of our self-service portal a priority for 2021 for this exact reason. Even smaller retailers who can\u2019t afford personalized service and a model tailored by a data scientist deserve the opportunity to optimize their supply chain to compete in the post-Covid world. Unless these self-service offerings are accessible, AI successes will continue to lag behind adoption. Data scientists will have to change the way they design their applications to keep up in 2021.", "Each of these 5 trends will critically change the way data scientists operate over the next year. It\u2019s time to adjust to these trends now before they accelerate \u2014 and you fall behind. You may be tempted to ignore these trends as isolated patterns in a single industry, but the reality is that they exist across the business world. They will affect your work sooner, rather than later.", "I\u2019m looking forward to 2021 and a post-Covid world. But as much as the end of the pandemic, I\u2019m looking forward to these trends becoming a reality for data scientists everywhere. Many data science trends for 2021 will help us all become better business scientists.", "PS I regularly write about Business Science. Recommended follow-up reading:", "Your home for data science.
