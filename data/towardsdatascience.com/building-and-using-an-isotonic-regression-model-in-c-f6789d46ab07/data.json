Examples of such tools include models such as linear regression, the family of least squares, and lasso regression. Of course, those are not the bounds at which models for predicting continuous targets are limited to, and there are some very interesting machine-learning models out there for predicting continuous features. A great example of this is isotonic/monotonic regression, which I wrote an article on last year in December you can check out here:", "The combination of the roots iso and tonic tell us that the definition of the word isotonic is to stretch equally. Isotonic uses thresholds to accomplish this effect, by dividing linear regression into established weights. This makes it a fantastic predictor for continuous features. While my previous article dove into why I thought it was a cool model, and went over the basics of how the model works, I thought it might be cool to revisit this model and implement one from scratch.", "While there are likely some namespaces out there that can read in training data effectively from a CSV format, I decided to create my own CSV reader for this instance. Here are the dependencies for this project:", "I also went ahead and did using on the STD namespace to make certain things easier to call.", "The first thing I am going to make is a few dependencies that we are going to need for the model. Firstly, a tokenizer which will take a char and turn it into a double vector.", "Then I will make a tokenizer that will take a string and tokenize it using this function:", "Finally, I have a smaller function that will replace a string in its place:", "The intention between these functions is the be able to interpret strings and chars as data. Interpretations which use such labels of features often call for the use of a label encoder, which is precisely what we have written to tokenize these strings. This will give us accurate and valid data using the composition of our strings as continuous features.", "Of course, an isotonic regressor is quite a complex model, so we will be doing a broad overview of how exactly the model works, but if you would like to learn more, there is a provided link to the source code. Isotonic regression can be thought of as simple linear regression with weights attached to thresholds. Thresholds are simply equal places in the data where statistical cost can be applied.", "To begin building this model, we will need an evaluation metric. For this example, I will be using Mean Squared Error, or MSE. MSE is a relatively great metric for calculating prediction accuracy with continuous targets.", "Next, since isotonic regression is a non-decreasing model, we are going to need to be able to sort our data in order of decreasing prediction:", "This function is just going to return a boolean telling us essentially which double is higher. We can use this like a conditional mask would be used in higher-level data solutions. Of course, we are also going to need the inverse of this function:", "Now, let\u2019s write a regression function:", "Next, we will write a prediction function:", "The final thing our model needs to get out the door is a nice function to load the data, encode it, and then properly return the output of our model. Here is mine:", "Last but not least, we will wrap this code up in our main() function:", "Now simply compiling will return us with a returning predicted test set!", "Isotonic regression is a model that I think might be very valuable for economic analysts. While the model is prone to issues with bias, primarily overfitting, it can also be an incredibly accurate way to predict continuous, non-decreasing targets.
