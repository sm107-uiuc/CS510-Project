They are utterly and absolutely dominating it.", "With 24 victories and a draw from their first 25 games, they\u2019re the fastest team to reach 70 points in the 133 year history of top-flight football. The only other team to ever go a season unbeaten in the Premier League clocked 26 wins across the whole 38 game season. Simply put, their current performance is without precedent.", "All of this is very welcome for a passionate fan base that hasn\u2019t seen their team win a league title in thirty years \u2014 and even more welcome for connoisseurs of the game, who are being treated to some truly outstanding football in the process.", "Liverpool\u2019s recent success is perhaps all the more surprising given their relative frugality. \u2018Relative\u2019 is the operative word, of course \u2014 football is a sport awash with money, with many of the top European teams owned by incredibly wealthy consortia that pump them with cash. For example, Liverpool\u2019s closest rivals, Manchester City FC, are owned by a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family worth at least \u00a317bn. In the last ten years, Manchester City have spent an eye-watering \u00a31.07bn on players, net (i.e. cost of players bought minus price of players sold to other clubs).", "Liverpool have spent 70% less over the same period, and even made net profits on player transfers in three of the last five seasons. Of the 50 most expensive transfers of all time, Liverpool only account for three (their top goal scorer for the last two seasons, Mohamed Salah, doesn\u2019t even feature in the list, and was once sold by English rivals Chelsea for a piffling \u00a313.5m). Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, arguably the best full-backs in the world right now, cost just \u00a38.1m between them. They are now reckoned to be worth a combined \u00a3171m.", "So how have Liverpool been able to do this? As detailed in Bruce Schoenfeld\u2019s excellent piece for the New York Times, the club owes at least some of its recent success to an expanded use of data and analytics.", "An early example of this was the acquisition of J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Liverpool\u2019s enigmatic manager and architect of their highly effective \u2018Gegenpressing\u2019 playing style. Having taken Borussia Dortmund to Bundesliga glory in his native Germany, Klopp\u2019s stock fell during the 2014\u201315 season when the team finished a relatively lowly 7th \u2014 its worst result in eight years.", "Despite this apparent failure, he was hand-picked to be Liverpool\u2019s new manager within months of resigning from Dortmund. Rather than relying on public reputation to make his hiring decision, Liverpool\u2019s co-owner (John W. Henry, whose Fenway Sports Group also owns Boston Red Sox) turned to Cambridge physicist Ian Graham. Graham had built an extensive mathematical model of world football and found that, far from being blighted by bad management, Dortmund\u2019s disappointing season was largely the result of bad luck.", "Football is a game in which a bit of fortune can swing matches. Scores are typically low (a 3\u20133 draw would be a \u2018high scoring\u2019 affair), and only 10\u201315% of attempted shots result in goals. Thus, a match\u2019s final score may not be representative of how well a team actually played. Graham recalls a particular 2014 game that Klopp\u2019s Dortmund lost 2\u20130, despite having dominated the match in every other respect \u2014 they controlled the ball 64% of the time, had seven times as many corner kicks, and had more than twice as many goal attempts.", "Of course, the original marriage of data and sport is \u2018Moneyball\u2019, the Michael Lewis book that tells the story of the Oakland Athletics\u2019 2001 baseball season, for which their manager Billy Beane assembled a highly successful team of cheap \u2018misfit\u2019 players with appealing underlying statistics. Beane would later be approached by one John W. Henry of Fenway Sports Group, who was keen to replicate this approach at the Boston Red Sox (the Red Sox went on to win the 2004 World Series \u2014 their first since 1918 \u2014 using many of the methods that Beane had pioneered).", "And while statistics can help professional teams to claim a place in the annals of sporting history, enthusiastic amateurs are starting to benefit as well\u2026", "On the 16th of December, Magnus Carlsen, one of the greatest chess Grandmasters of all time, found himself top of a global league of over 7.5 million players. Not a chess league, however, but the Fantasy Premier League.", "Fantasy Premier League (a.k.a. FPL, or Fantasy Football) is an online game that follows the real-world Premier League season. Given a budget of 100m virtual pounds, each player (or \u2018manager\u2019) has to assemble a team of real-world players, who then score FPL points based on their performance in real life games (so, for example, a striker will score four FPL points for each goal they score, a defender will score four points for not conceding any goals, a goalkeeper will score a point for every third save that they make, and so forth).", "The rub is that the different players have different prices \u2014 a star player like Mohamed Salah might cost \u00a312.5m, whereas a relatively unknown player at a lesser team could cost as little as \u00a34m. It\u2019s therefore impossible to stuff your team with the superstars who grab the headlines week in, week out.", "As an additional complication, managers are able to swap out one player from their team every week (remaining in budget, of course), to bring in a replacement player who\u2019s perhaps in better form, or has an easier run of fixtures. Planning these transfer \u2018moves\u2019 to get such players, often weeks in advance, has led the game to be likened to chess (though Carlsen insists that luck plays a big part as well).", "Thus, successful FPL managers are the players best able to identify cheaper players with good fundamentals, who have the potential to score FPL points \u2018under the radar\u2019 on a week by week basis. Evidently, this is a game that\u2019s ripe for Moneyballing.", "And this is what my new project is all about. The plan is to build out a classifying algorithm (likely a neural network). It\u2019ll take in data about a player\u2019s underlying performance, and the performance of the team that they\u2019re about to play. It will then tell us whether or not they\u2019re going to be a good pick for an FPL team.", "Initial analysis does suggest that this ought to be possible \u2014 the above heatmaps show that cheaper players are perfectly capable of scoring lots of points (see the patches of colour in the top left of each plot). Of course, the visuals also show that many more cheap players score very few points in each match (see the much darker patches in the bottom left corners).", "Nobody said Moneyballing was easy \u2014 there\u2019s a reason why Liverpool\u2019s lead data scientist has a Ph.D. in Particle Physics from Harvard.", "This is the first in a new blog series \u2018On Target\u2019, in which I\u2019ll be attempting to build out a model for \u2018Moneyballing\u2019 Fantasy Premier League. I\u2019d love to hear any comments about the blog, or any of the concepts that the piece touches on.
