So, to save my butt, I decided to dedicate my whole weekend to learning how to do it. Think of this post as a crash course intro to learn how to brute force your way into doing one.", "Skip to the section you want to read. Table of contents below:", "First, to establish grounds, let me tell you what I do know about regression, and what I can do in R.", "How I figured out what to focus on this weekend.", "These are the top four links that came up for me:", "I clicked the link \u201cnext blog,\u201d and BINGO! \u201cPredict Bounce Rate based on Page Load Time in Google Analytics.\u201d Since I didn\u2019t mention already, to note here: I am in the performance advertising space, so this is literally right up my alley. They even do a part 3 on improving the model!", "I\u2019ve found what I\u2019m going to focus on this weekend. Going to compile learnings here as I learn anything!", "I had a really helpful conversation with an engineer who entertained my questions this weekend, and I\u2019d like to share with you some tips that he shared. In summary, running a regression analysis is just the start of your investigation in assessing whether some data has a relationship with other data. With that context, here are ways you can ensure you come up with an analysis that is honest and helps you figure out your next steps.", "So here we are. Time to actually run a regression analysis using R. As a note, I use RStudio.", "3. Import the csv file into R Studio with function read.csv(). (See this link for how to get the pathname on a mac.)", "4. Remove all NA values of the dependent variable using drop_na() in tidyverse. See here for the reference that describes this function.", "5. Normalize your independent variables. I did this in R by dividing out each of the independent variables by their respective max value.", "To break down what I\u2019m doing above, let\u2019s look at what I did with the column Spend: mutate(spend_norm = Spend/max(Spend,na.rm=TRUE))", "Since I mutated each of the columns with new names, thus creating 5 extra columns, I used the function select() in order to keep just the relevant columns.", "I used the method of not considering anything 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) below the 1st quartile or 1.5 times the IQR above the 3rd quartile for my dataset. See here for the reference I used to determine this and the functions I copied. There are two mini-steps in this:", "I repeated these 2 steps for each independent variable and ended up with the subset removed5. See my code in RStudio below. (You\u2019ll see that I didn\u2019t do this in the most efficient way possible. Would love any suggestions to make this more efficient.)", "7. Regression time! Use the R function lm() with your data. Go back to the original post I\u2019m learning from for an explanation of what you\u2019re doing here.", "You\u2019ve created your model! Now for the summary of results, run the final piece of code for the regression:", "The engineer I mentioned above looked at these results and immediately said, \u201cYeah, your data sucks.\u201d He said the Std. Error for each variable is too large compared to its Estimate. He also mentioned that with just 15 rows of data, using five variables for the model just doesn\u2019t make sense.", "But no matter\u2026 we did it! Hooray!", "So we\u2019ve run our regression analysis! \u2026but this isn\u2019t the end. As the saying goes, \u201cAll models are wrong, but some are useful.\u201d So your next steps are to figure out how to improve your model to make sure what you are pulling is actually useful. From the third post of the series I\u2019m learning from this weekend, along with the support of a more detailed post, I found that the combination of the function regsubsets() along with the metrics Adjusted R2, Cp and BIC allows us to figure out how many variables from your dataset are actually useful for the model in question. This helps for any models that have more than 2 independent variables.", "To explain what I\u2019m doing above using the words of the posts I linked above, here\u2019s an excerpt from one of the posts:", "The R function regsubsets() [leaps package] can be used to identify different best models of different sizes. You need to specify the option nvmax, which represents the maximum number of predictors to incorporate in the model. For example, if nvmax = 5, the function will return up to the best 5-variables model, that is, it returns the best 1-variable model, the best 2-variables model, \u2026, the best 5-variables models.", "In our example, we have only 5 predictor variables in the data. So, we\u2019ll use nvmax = 5. (Source)", "And regarding the second half of the code above:", "The summary() function returns some metrics - Adjusted R2, Cp and BIC (see Chapter [\u2026] - allowing us to identify the best overall model, where best is defined as the model that maximize the adjusted R2 and minimize the prediction error (RSS, cp and BIC).", "The adjusted R2 represents the proportion of variation, in the outcome, that are explained by the variation in predictors values. the higher the adjusted R2, the better the model. (Source)", "The best model, according to each of these metrics, they mention, is in the code block below and produces the results following.", "Based on the results, Adjusted R2 tells us that the best model is the one with 1 predictor variable, as does the Cp and BIC criteria. It\u2019s saying I should decrease the number of variables in my model from five down to one. This isn\u2019t surprising since I only had 15 rows of data to begin with.", "And with that, I conclude my weekend bonanza of learning linear regression using R. If you\u2019re like me at all, brute forcing it and learn by doing is the perfect start to getting to know a topic. I hope you got as much out of it as I did. Onward!", "Your home for data science.
