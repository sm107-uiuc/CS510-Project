This technique and empirical relation\u2019s relationship, which can either be linear or non-linear is derived through regression between sales and marketing spends on each channel.", "Using simulations, where the cost of each marketing channel is varied, multiple scenarios are generated and depending on the results; an effective marketing strategy is derived. Since multilinear regression is used, the equation can be given as follows:", "Where Sales represents Sales Volume, Channel 1 and Channel 2 are different marketing channels, \u03b2_0 represents the Base Sales, which is the sales volume, in the absence of any marketing campaigns, because of natural demand, brand loyalty, and awareness. On the other hand, \u03b2_1 and \u03b2_2 are the coefficients for Channel 1 and Channel 2, representing the contribution of each channel to the sales volume.", "Our dataset will be an advertising dataset available on Kaggle. To illustrate how Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is applied to this dataset, I will be focusing only on the implementation part of the Market Mix Modelling (MMM).", "We will use R for the analysis and let\u2019s start with importing our libraries:", "Then, read our dataset, check for missing values and understand the summary statistics of each column:", "We now perform a Multiple Linear Regression with Sales as the dependent variable and TV, Radio and Newspaper spends as the dependent variable:", "The overall model is very significant with a p-value of 2.2e-16. Apart from the intercept which is a constant term, both TV and Radio turn out to be the most significant variable which also has a very strong and moderate correlation, respectively, with the sales volume. The R-squared value is 0.9026 which means that the model captures 90% of the variance present in the data.", "Finally, the equation can be given as:", "Here the Base Sales is approximately 4.63 which means that irrespective of whether the marketing strategy is in place or not, this is the minimum sales volume that will be generated. It can also be seen that the contribution from the Newspaper is insignificant as compared to the other marketing channels because the co-efficient is extremely small.", "Also, spends on all of the marketing channels irrespective of the size of contribution has a positive impact on the sales volume. We now look into the contribution charts of TV, Radio, and Newspaper.", "Contribution charts are used as a means of visualizing the impact of marketing activities in terms of the percentage contribution to the sales volume with total contribution as the base.", "Similarly, the contribution from other mediums is determined and the percentage of TV contribution is given by ratio of contribution of TV to the total contribution.", "After assessing the contribution of each medium, we now calculate the effectiveness or elasticity of each medium which is the percentage change in sales volume with a unit change in the spend:", "Using MMM on the given dataset, we are able to quantify the impact of different marketing channels on the sales volume and determine that TV is the most effective medium for carrying out promotions and activities. This finding is also backed by research performed by Rubinson in 2009, quoting that \u201cTV advertising appears to be as effective as ever, even possibly increasing ineffectiveness.\u201d", "MMM can be used to create optimized strategies such that based on the performance of different channels, the budget of poorly performing channels can be reallocated to stronger performing mediums.", "However, do note that through time series analysis, there is the optimum spend to be observed. This is because after a certain point of time, saturation is achieved and irrespective of the spend, there is no impact on the sales volume. Also, when marketing activities are carried out, there is always a spillover or carryover effect with respect to time and keeps decaying gradually. In order to understand this, Adstock analysis can be performed to understand the carry-over effect as well as the law of diminishing returns i.e., spending the first dollar is more effective than the second third or fourth dollar.", "Thank you for reading.
