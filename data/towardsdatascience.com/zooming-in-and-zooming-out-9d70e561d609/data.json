No, they like don\u2019t like working with numbers or dealing with the actual calculations involved in getting those numbers but they feel safe and secure when someone else has \u201ccrunched\u201d the numbers for them and then presented them in a report. Given the prevalence of math phobia this trust in numbers never ceases to amaze me. Perhaps it is because so many people struggle with things like statistics and probability that they so unflinchingly honor the all-important confidence interval. Whatever the case with our culture\u2019s obsession with numbers, any qualitative researcher (and most good quantitative ones) know that many things can be left out of a number.", "So how do things work with a small sample size in qualitative research? Let me break it down.", "The goal in sampling with qualitative data is to detect repeating patterns \u2014 not to achieve statistical significance. As such, sample sizes in the 10\u201320 person range are extremely common. With these smaller sample sizes qualitative research looks for signals, which are indicators of trends within a population. Once these trends are detected the research team can dig down to identify the underlying goals and motivations which drive those trends. Connecting these drivers to business goals creates a successful partnership between an organization and its customers.", "With qualitative research, you\u2019re zooming in and getting a closer picture of fewer people. So that you know them better.", "With a small sample size we are able to deeply learn about each participant. This allows us to discover patterns across participants, or in other words to discover signals, which indicate a trend, which lead us to identify and describe the drivers of those people, which finally allows us to connect customer and business goals.", "You don\u2019t need a large sample size to do that.", "Alright, alright \u2014 small samples are okay. But how small exactly?", "When determining how many people to talk to (your sample size) for qualitative research you are looking to achieve saturation or what has often been described as \u201cthe point of least surprise.\u201d This is the point in the research where you can reliably guess how a new participant will respond to prompts and you are no longer being exposed to new information. You get diminishing returns past this point.", "How do you predict what sample size will achieve saturation? You don\u2019t exactly. But with a baseline of knowledge about the population (how diverse it tends to be, how far it is distributed geographically, any demographic or behavioral variations, etc.) and an understanding of the desired type of output (insights to inform new design versus build a business strategy, for example) you can make a fairly good estimate. Design decisions can do well with a particularly small sample size, especially if you plan on doing user testing down the road, whereas strategy work typically needs a larger, still relatively small, sample. I can\u2019t give you exact numbers. It will vary based on your work.", "If you\u2019ve estimated a sample size of 20, followed good screening and recruiting practices, and after 15 people you feel like you are no longer learning new things: Congratulations on achieving saturation! And so soon \u2014 this is great! You can either switch in some new questions for those final five, going deeper into a trend you\u2019ve discovered or maybe adding on a line of inquiry you didn\u2019t think fit into the original scope, or you can stop data collection and begin analysis early.", "If you estimate a sample of 10 and you\u2019re still finding a lot of surprising new things on that 10th participant, or if really none of your participants seem very similar to one another, you have not achieved saturation. That\u2019s rough. But one thing you\u2019ve learned is that your population is more diverse than you thought. This is a good thing to know. It may feel daunting to be confronted with a situation where you have to tell your team that you\u2019re not getting enough coverage, but you surely have picked up on some new and unexpected behaviors \u2014 you must have, or you would have been able to better predict your needed sample size. This is learning and it\u2019s good! You will need buy-in to talk to more people now, so build up your stakeholders\u2019 appetite for discovery by presenting those new phenomena as the opportunities they are.", "Present your discoveries as the opportunities they are.", "Qualitative research uses smaller sample sizes and does not aim for the statistical significance often sought after in quantitative work.", "Because qualitative research is not documenting prevalence, it\u2019s detecting signals. Time for a metaphor. Indulge me. Think of qualitative research (qual) as the metal detector on the sandy shores of innovation. It will detect a signal from metal of any kind in the nearby vicinity. Closer inspection can reveal more about this metal. It might be gold, it might be silver, it might just be tin. But you\u2019ll get a signal if it\u2019s there. It\u2019s your job to determine if what you\u2019ve found is valuable. Qual research is a metal detector.", "Use Qual research to scan an area looking for signals. You may find several interesting hot spots, although the precise value of each one might not be clear. You use your knowledge of the area (your business knowledge) and your taste for further exploration (your willingness to invest time and resources in innovation) to decide how to proceed with following some or all of those signals. Quantitative (Quant) research can be part of this further exploration. Quant is more like digging a mine.", "Quantitative research, in many cases, will only find specifically what it\u2019s looking for: gold coins in a certain spot. You\u2019ll either find them there or you won\u2019t. You won\u2019t likely find anything you weren\u2019t looking for, like silver coins a few feet over, because that is not what your instrument was calibrated for. And that\u2019s fine. You use quant research when you\u2019ve already had a signal that gold is around and now you want to know how much is there.", "If you are a sunscreen manufacturer planning your pre-summer production run, you need the first. If you\u2019re trying to innovate within the summer vacation market, the second is a better start.", "The most important part of research, qualitative or quantitative, is having questions and seeking answers. Don\u2019t let anyone sideline you with objections about statistical significance when your goal is connecting customer goals to business goals. That\u2019s already significant.", "Are you rushing from fieldwork to findings? Stop and spend some time with your data first.", "Kelly Moran utilizes an innate curiosity and unceasing desire to ask \u201cwhy\u201d to understand how people use products and services to accomplish their goals \u2014 whether those goals be work or play.
