We can then use various techniques that can show us which vectors/lyrics are similar or different.", "Vector representations of words were a significant step-change for natural language processing. Early methods that attempted to \u2018understand\u2019 language usually involved counting words (e.g. a bag of words model or weighted models / TFIDF approaches). These were limited in that they failed to capture the context of language. After all, the sentence \u2018kid breaks skateboard\u2019 is very different in meaning to \u2018skateboard breaks kid\u2019 \u2026.despite having the same type and number of words.", "Word2vec by Tomas Mikolov et al. was game-changer in that words were no longer rudimentarily represented as counts but as high-dimensional vectors. These vectors, or embeddings, were created through the training of a simple neural network on a corpus of text. These word embeddings represent a word\u2019s relationship with a neighboring word and therefore its context. Therefore the vectors for the word \u2018walking\u2019 and \u2018walked\u2019 would be more similar than the words \u2018swimming\u2019 and \u2018swam\u2019.", "If you want to learn more about this I would recommend reading the original whitepaper or a previous project I did with ASOS review on TrustPilot.", "For this project, we will be using Google\u2019s Universal Sentence Encoder, a state of the art encoder that has been trained on millions (possibly billions?) of documents.", "It\u2019s like word2vec but on steroids.", "The Universal Sentence Encoder encodes text into high dimensional vectors that can be used for text classification, semantic similarity, clustering and other natural language tasks.", "The model is trained and optimized for greater-than-word length text, such as sentences, phrases or short paragraphs. It is trained on a variety of data sources and a variety of tasks with the aim of dynamically accommodating a wide variety of natural language understanding tasks.", "If you want to find out more about this model, I would strongly recommend you read the documentation on TensorFlow hub as it covers a lot more detail.", "Let\u2019s use Tensorflow Hub to load the model..", "And let\u2019s write a short function that can get a high dimensional vector for any string input using the model.", "Let\u2019s get the vector for a simple sentence\u2026.", "As you can see a simple sentence has now been encoded as a high dimensional vector with a shape of (512,)", "The cornerstone of this project is to find a way to find similarities and differences in song lyrics. As we are encoding lyrics into vector representations then we need to use techniques that allow us find similarities and differences in vectors", "Often when we have continuous, low dimensional data we would use something like Euclidean distance to gauge similarity/difference. We would use this distance metric with something like a KNN classifier or even when clustering dimensionally reduced vectors such as after a PCA.", "However, because our vectors from the sentence encoder have very high dimensionality then using cosine similarity is a better proximity metric to use than Euclidean distance, to begin with at least.", "A cosine similarity closer to 1 would mean there is minimal variance between the two vectors (the input strings are similar) whereas a cosine similarity closer to 0 would mean that two vectors are very different (the input stings are different)", "Let me show you an example with four sentences.", "Two of which are about weather..", "And another two that are about breakfast", "I\u2019ve specifically chosen examples where the word \u2018sunny\u2019/\u2019sunniest\u2019 has been used as a metaphor and as an adjective.

The sentences that are most similar have more similar vectors (cosine similarity of 0.41 / 0.51).

Death metal, heavy metal, and rock differ slightly from one another but vastly different to pop and soul. This makes sense.", "If you are familiar with these bands as you scroll down you will get a strong sense of how genres evolve and that we can see this in the variance across principal component 1.", "Let\u2019s look at the same analysis but grouped by genre.", "This averaged view confirms what we suspected above.", "Let\u2019s make a more sophisticated visualization that uses scatter plots to show this data, by song.", "We can look at this in two dimensions (PC1,PC2) but also in three dimensions (PC1,PC2,PC3)", "The function below combines a few functions from above with some more complex Plotly functions to generate scatter plots, either in 2d (PC1 / PC2) or in 3D (PC1 / PC2 / PC3)", "Let\u2019s call the function and see what the plot looks like. Again, I would strongly recommend you click on the plot link in the footer for the screengrab below if you want to interact with all the genres and where they lie on the plot.", "We can also create a similar plot but utilize the 3 dimensions of the PCA.", "We have shown that lyrics from different music genres do vary although what is interesting is that there is quite a clear relationship between lyrical content as we move from one genre to another in a stepwise fashion. I think the visualization below quite clearly brings this to life.", "The lyrics of different genres aren\u2019t entirely mutually exclusive \u2014 unless you compare the extremes. i.e. there is a huge difference between death metal and soul/r&b but little in the way to differentiate pop and pop/rock.", "These findings reflect the true nature of music in that music genres are fluid and that for each genre, there is likely to be a \u2018neighbouring\u2019 genre that is similar in its lyrical content.", "After all, many fans of r&b/soul will also like pop\u2026..but maybe not punk and/or metal?", "We have shown that universal sentence encoding/transfer learning is a very powerful and incredibly easy technique that can be used to pull out the differences and similarities in song lyrics across genres.", "Its applications on other problems are numerous:", "Thanks for reading and get in touch if you want to talk further!
