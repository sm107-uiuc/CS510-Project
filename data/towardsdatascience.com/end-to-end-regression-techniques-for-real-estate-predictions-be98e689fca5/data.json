This series will provide an end to end look at predicting home sale prices in Ames Iowa. The series will be broken down into four parts for readability:", "Open up a Jupyter Notebook, download the data, and follow along by implementing the following strategies yourself. I\u2019ve included a few \u2018exercises\u2019 to get you going. I\u2019m hiding the full code to force you to focus on the thought process. Additionally, by typing the code out yourself, you will gain experience that will eventually lead to fluency. However, if you need help along the way, you can find my full notebook here.", "If you already read my article \u201cA Beginner\u2019s Look at Kaggle\u201d, you know what\u2019s coming: Let\u2019s get our hands dirty with EDA. It\u2019s going to be the sole focus of this part of the series.", "This first section will focus primarily on basic plotting and missing value imputation. My goal is to outline a process for building an intuition as to what variables are at play, and which have the greatest impact on sale price. I also want to evaluate relationships between variables because it will give insight on how we might intelligently fill missing data.", "The focus of our data exploration throughout the 4 part series is as follows:", "To begin getting a feel for our data, we will plot our target variable distribution along with a couple of different transformations. We\u2019ll do this for a couple of reasons:", "Before transformation, our sale price data is right-skewed, meaning that the mean is biased towards a higher price than the median. Applying a Yeo Johnson transformation via sklearn.preprocessing.PowerTransformer() we get a pretty good approximation of the standard normal distribution:", "I also checked out using a log transformation, but we don\u2019t get quite as close to a normal distribution:", "These transformations alter the meaning of the data (notice the lack of the \u2018SalePrice\u2019 label on the horizontal axis). The main purpose of transforming the target variable is in hopes of assisting the training of a machine learning algorithm. Again, this requires experimentation and won\u2019t be covered until Part 3 of this series.", "As our second warm-up exercise, let\u2019s check our intuition that it\u2019s not just quantity but the quality that counts toward the final sale price:", "In the first column, we compare the sale price to the above-ground living (aka GrLivArea) area and the overall quality of home build materials. What we see is that the sale price is graduated well by both living-area and by quality. This is evident in the strong linear trend in the scatterplot, the even graduation of hue, as well as the boxplot of overall quality.", "Somewhat surprisingly, we see that the variable describing the overall condition, OverallCond, seems to have little effect on sale price. The hue of the data points in the second scatterplot is random, and the boxplot is unordered. This is counter-intuitive, and we can dig into whether or not what we are seeing makes sense a little later.", "Also, notice the two outliers in the data. There are two homes seen in the scatterplots that have quite large living areas, yet somehow sold for very low prices relative to others of the same size.", "Our next round of analysis will focus on our missing data. We want to know why the data is missing, and how we might be able to fill in the blanks. Lost data is lost information that might otherwise be useful to us. It is often worth attempting to fill in those blanks for better predictions.", "First, we will address the gaps in our missing training data. I wrote a little function to visualize missing data in a data set. Look in my full notebook for a method called viz_missing(df):", "The barplot shows a lot of missing data. This data shouldn\u2019t be ignored if we wish to get really good results. This part of the process is tedious but necessary. I encourage you to focus on the following thought process:", "The variable with the greatest amount of missing data in the chart above is PoolQC which stands for \u2018Pool Quality and Condition\u2019.", "After looking at our data dictionary, we should notice that there is only one other variable that describes a home\u2019s pool. That variable is PoolArea. Take note that there is no missing data associated with that variable.", "My intuition is that all of the homes that have PoolArea = 0 may be associated with homes that are missing PoolQC information. In other words, those homes don\u2019t have pools, and that is why they are missing the pool quality variable. We can check that intuition with just a couple lines of code:", "So we see that for all 1452 homes missing PoolQC entries, the PoolArea of that home is 0. This proves our intuition correct. We can fill in the blanks with one more line of code:", "LotFrontage, according to the data dictionary, is the measure of the number of feet of road that is connected to the property. This time we don\u2019t have any additional variables that will tell us why LotFrontage is missing. This means we will have to approach filling the blanks differently.", "We may reasonably assume that almost every piece of property touches at least a small part of some road or alley. This may not be universally true, but is probably the rule rather than the exception. We will use this intuition to fill any missing LotFrontage with the mean or median of all homes for which we do have this data:", "I chose to fill the missing entries with the median, as it will be more robust against outliers.", "I\u2019m going to leave off here until part 2 of the series. Completing exercises 1\u20133 should take you quite some time and are encouraged to code up these exercises before moving on.", "If you have any questions, comments, or critiques, please feel to reach out to me in the comment section!", "Your home for data science.
