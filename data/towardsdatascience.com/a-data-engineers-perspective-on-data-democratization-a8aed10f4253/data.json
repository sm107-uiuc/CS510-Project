Data Engineers needed to follow strict rules and modeling techniques to produce reports (and other outputs) in a financially viable manner.", "Companies, in this pre-Cloud era, had one or few centralized Data Teams \u2014 acting as the benevolent gatekeepers of data. Any request for data, analytics or data-driven products needed to be carefully planned for, scoped and handed to these teams.", "While this approach was necessary, there were several issues caused by such a high level of control:", "Accessibility to data is often unequal depending on the technical ability of a person and the team that person finds themselves in. To assess how democratized data is, in a given business, I would like to offer the following scenario as a starting point:", "As a [Data Engineer | Data Scientist | Data Analyst | Software Engineer | Product Manager | Executive etc..] in the [Mobile Team | Data Team | Marketing Team etc..], how easily can I...", "While some problems highlighted in this assessment have different solutions depending on the type of organization: its size, resources / budget, the technical ability of data users \u2014 there are patterns and tools helpful to most cases.", "The aim of this section is to discuss some, non mutually exclusive, ways to democratize data in an organization. Some of them could be useful to your organization, some would not be adequate, but hopefully, it helps you formulate your own solutions!", "Embedding Data Engineers in each team allows teams to be self sufficient. The technical barrier of exploring data and creating data pipelines might still be there, but each team now has the skills needed to be independent.", "These Data Engineers also become familiar with the team\u2019s mission and get domain expertise which enable them to better understand requirements.", "A team focused on data infrastructure and tooling can help reduce the technical skills needed to perform common tasks. This tooling can be \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d, open source or developed by the team.", "A \u201cMetadata Hub\u201d typically takes the form of an internal search engine, which catalogues datasets, and exposes information a potential data consumer needs in order to use a table.

The QC processes also need to be distributed and the people creating tables should be able to QC the tables they own!", "At Earnest, we have 2 in-house QC tools + 1 machine learning enabled anomaly detection tool which distribute emails and information about the health of tables. However, we found it hard to scale to the analysts\u2019 demand for more QC checks as they required engineering time.", "We have started to explore Great Expectations (GE) and we hope to scale by enabling analysts to take part in the QC effort.", "Read more about Great Expectations here:", "Theoretically if any potential data consumer in the company was given the tools they need to write ETL, it would be one of the biggest enablers of data democratization. So, naturally, this is something I am very interested in (and you should too!).", "\u201cEngineers should not write ETL.

It enforces a structure into SQL-based projects and provides templating of SQL using Jinja (Python). Assuming SQL is known by the data consumers, training them to the DBT specifics would allow them to be autonomous in writing maintainable transformation.", "Data Engineers provide and support individual components that make up pipelines. For example at Earnest, we run most of our tasks containerized on Airflow, so as data engineers we maintain multiple containerized CLI tools to do tasks like translating Hive schemas to Redshift schemas, run Spark jobs on Livy, run our custom QC tasks etc..", "Data Engineers also provide tools (e.g. a Metadata Hub, Airflow, Great Expectations, Snowflake) that they support, extend and create abstractions on top of, to increase productivity of data consumers.", "Once Data Engineers are freed up from crafting individual pipelines, they can look into tools that benefit the pipelines as a whole. LinkedIn\u2019s Dr-Elephant, a tool to detect common optimization opportunities on Spark and Hadoop jobs, is a good example of such a tool.", "Additionally, Data Engineers need to keep enabling data accessibility by making sure their tools can be used by the data consumers directly, requiring minimal or no intervention from engineering.", "\u201cData engineers can focus on pipeline idempotency, integration of new sources inside the data lake, on data lineage and tooling.\u201d", "Data democratization is about increasing access to data, making sure that different teams with different skills are equally equipped to ship insights and data products.", "The key to a successful data democratization might very well be to make sure your different processes scale with the increased demand for data.", "Your objective should be to identify and remove the bottlenecks.", "Your home for data science.
