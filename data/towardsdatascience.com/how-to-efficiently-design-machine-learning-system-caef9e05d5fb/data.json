Here it is.", "Continuously Test and learn using selected evaluation metric", "Your data pipeline should execute the following steps:", "Andrew advice on this is to write the code corresponding for each of the steps above as quickly as possible without worrying too much on the two first steps. They can quickly become time consuming, it is better to make strong assumptions on the first implementation and iterate on those later on.", "There are many ways of diagnosing bias and or variance Andrew proposes two ways of doing so :", "Learning curves are defined as the representation of the evolution of the cost over the number of iterations of gradient descent for both the cross validation and the test set.", "Sadly, it is by definition only relevant to algorithms using gradient descent or a variant for optimizing it parameters.", "By looking at them you can quickly diagnose high bias vs high variance. The following image speak for itself.", "Bayes error : optimal (unreachable) error rate for a specific problem. Often approximated using best available human performance.", "High variance: train error is quite close to the Bayes error and cross validation error is quite worst than both.", "High bias: train error is quite close to cross validation error and both are quite worst than the Bayes error.", "High bias and high variance: train error is quite better than cross validation error and both are quite worst than the Bayes error.", "I have used the term \u201cquite\u201d to insist on the fact that there are no rules thumb to define how big or small the difference on cross-validation error train error and Bayes error should be for either of those cases.", "The action that you could take based on the bias/variance diagnostic differs from one model to another.", "In this article I would only present the ones for Logistic and Linear Regression and Neural Network but you can find the corresponding actions for Tree based models, KNN and SVM with a quick Google search.", "The key insights here is that you should diagnose the type of problem you have (high bias or high variance as quickly as possible).", "Error analysis consists in collecting a random sample of miss classified records in the case of a classification problem or records for which the prediction error was high in the case of a regression problem from the test set. Then you should analyze the distribution of the sample across various categories.", "In the upper error analysis output table, you can see a practical example of the method in the case of a cat detector algorithm.", "The main insights that can be drawn from that table is that 61% of blurry images and 43% of miss classified records were miss classified. Based on those results, spending some time on improving the algorithms performance on Great Cat and Blurry images seems worthwhile.", "The dataset may or not contained detailed informations about its records. That\u2019s, why manually looking at the records may help you to create categories based on your observations.", "In the upper example, it is only by manually looking and classifying images that the great insights on how to improve performance were discovered.", "Throughout the second and third step use your setup for evaluation build in step 1 to track the amelioration of your algorithm performance.", "You should also use this setup, to test different hyper parameters/models and test different methods for filling null values and filtering out outliers.", "If you feel I missed something please let me know!", "All credits to Andrew Ng aka the pope of machine learning.", "Your home for data science.
