Brent is the second London Borough of Culture \u2014 the first was Waltham Forest \u2014 to win a successful bid run by the Mayor of London.", "The aim of the London Borough of Culture programme is to \u201cbring communities together to celebrate cultural diversity across London\u201d. The Mayor, as well as private and corporate partners, provide funds to stimulate a year-long programme of art and culture events and activities. It\u2019s a wonderful initiative and one which I\u2019m proud of as a Londoner!", "This year the opening event at Brent 2020 was RISE, an hour-long performance choreographed by Southpaw Dance Company. Last year, I did a very similar analysis on the Borough of Culture 2019 opening event called Welcome to the Forest, which you can read here. Unlike last year, this year I actually attended the opening event and had a lovely and enjoyable time and took some photos which are shared throughout this blog post \ud83d\ude0a", "The purpose of this post is to use Twitter data to understand the ebbs and flows of the event and apply machine learning and natural language processing techniques to illuminate social value and cultural value. By analysing the tweets of users who attended RISE, we\u2019re able to gain insight into whether the event achieved the aims of the London Borough of Culture.", "Let\u2019s give it a go! Please scroll through to see the analysis. Hope you enjoy.", "Unlike the opening event of last year, there wasn\u2019t a specific hashtag dedicated to the event. Instead, I collected all tweets containing the official hashtag of the programme #Brent2020 and those which mentioned @LBOC2020, the Twitter handle of Brent 2020. At the time of the event, I used the Twitter API to collect 3,000 tweets in total between 14th January to 21st January 2020. It\u2019s important to note that I only collected tweets that contained #Brent2020 or @LBOC2020; there were, of course, many tweets about RISE that didn\u2019t contain those search terms.", "Having collected the tweets, I performed a range of advanced statistical and machine learning natural language processing techniques to help me understand the social and cultural value of the event. Specifically, I used the Google Cloud Natural Language API to calculate the sentiment for each tweet, then I used the gensim library\u2019s Word2Vec model to perform semantic analysis from the entire corpus of the tweets.", "I\u2019ve dealt with economic, social and cultural value measurements for art and culture in a variety of roles: as a cultural data scientist and researcher at The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) at UCL; as director of cultureincities, the world\u2019s first data science consultancy dedicated to arts and culture; on the Technical Reference Group for the next UK City of Culture, Coventry 2021; and, most importantly, having led data science research for Waltham Forest Council as part of London Borough of Culture 2019.", "As described by Social Value UK, \u201csocial value is the quantification of the relative importance that people place on the changes they experience in their lives\u201d. RISE was an event and experience where local citizens felt attached to the history and culture of Brent. Yet, as noted by Geoff Mulgan, social value is very tricky to measure. Even though this post doesn\u2019t use the robust methodological techniques suggested by Mulgan \u2014 largely because they are expensive and time-consuming to undertake \u2014 here I offer NLP an interesting method to try and capture the experiences felt by attendees of RISE.", "Below is a graph which shows how the event unfolded on Twitter with pictures I took on the night. RISE began around 7.15 pm, which is illustrated by the first spike. Then, at 7.54 pm, an amazing dancer inside a came on, and at 8.03 pm lots of coloured powder was being thrown up into the air and, finally, there was a spike when General Levy came on around 8.36 pm!", "You can watch the cool YouTube video below made by Martin Francis who documents the night in much more detail!", "In total there were 741 unique users who tweeted on the day of the event and 876 users across the week. If we take a deeper dive into the text we\u2019re able to analyse people\u2019s reaction to the event based on the language they used in their tweets. Natural language processing (NLP) offers an innovative way to use machine learning to analyse the sentiment and semantic structure of text helping us to draw conclusions.", "The sentiment for each tweet was calculated using Google\u2019s Cloud NLP API. The bar graph below shows the total frequency of tweets during the seven-day period and the average sentiment of tweets per day, with -1 being very negative sentiment and +1 being very positive sentiment. We see that the sentiment of the tweets hovered around 0.42 a few days before the event, dipped to 0.36 on the day of the event and then sharply increased to 0.49 and a very strong sentiment of 0.57 the two days after the event. Overall, RISE had an average sentiment across all days at 0.57.", "In order to get a more granular understanding of the text from the tweets, I undertook the semantic analysis. It\u2019s important at this step to remove all retweets from the analysis because they create duplicated tweets and, therefore, unnecessary noise when analysing the text.", "Word2Vec is a neural language machine learning model that takes a large corpus of text \u2014 in this case, the text from the 3,000 tweets \u2014 as input and outputs a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word corresponding to a vector in space \u2014 a word embedding.", "Specifically, objects that are closer together in that space mean that they are similar. Nearest neighbours are the handful of words from the Word2Vec model that are most similar to \u201cBrent\u201d based on a cosine metric similarity score. The scatter plot below shows the nearest neighbours for \u201cBrent\u201d.", "Words such as \u201cdiversity\u201d, \u201cdiverse\u201d, \u201ctogether\u201d, \u201ccommunities\u201d and \u201cproud\u201d are very close by to Brent, and \u201cfamilyfriendly\u201d, and \u201ccelebrating\u201d are also pictured. The results of the Word2Vec model are extremely positive because these words are very closely linked to the overall aim of the London Borough of Culture to \u201cbring communities together to celebrate cultural diversity across London\u201d. The finding statistically demonstrates that these words most closely represented how people described RISE when they tweeted about their experience and can, therefore, indicate social value.", "Natural language processing offers an innovative way to analyse textual data to reveal and illustrate characteristics of how people felt when then tweet about an event. The findings of this study illustrated that useful, descriptive words were extracted from Twitter data to demonstrate that RISE demonstrated social value. Having a quantifiable and quantitative approach to measuring things like social and cultural value is now paramount for any evaluation study and will set cultural institutions apart from their peers.", "However, it should be noted that NLP is not a perfect or complete technique. In addition, there are issues with only analysing social media data. In fact, many of the tweets during the week following the RISE event were retweets. A more accurate study will certainly include on-the-ground survey collection and interviews, where the answer to those can still be analysed using NLP.", "One of the biggest missions of the London Borough of Culture is to bring communities together to celebrate cultural diversity across London, in turn, generating social and cultural value. It\u2019s important to be able to capture and demonstrate this value quantitatively in some capacity so that these findings can be used to leverage the importance of programmes like this.", "I will be tracking the whole programme over the next 12 months to see how cultural data science can give us deeper insights into the programme. There is still huge potential to dig into the tweets further!", "Congratulations to Brent on such a great event and achievement and all the best for the rest of the year as London\u2019s Borough of Culture!", "Vishal is a Cultural Data Scientist and Research Student at The Bartlett at UCL in London. He is interested in the economic and social impact of culture in cities. You can get in touch with him on Twitter or LinkedIn. See more of Vishal\u2019s work on Instagram or on his website.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Cultural Data Scientist in London.
