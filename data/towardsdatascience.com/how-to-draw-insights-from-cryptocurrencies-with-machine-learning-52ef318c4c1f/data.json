As many of the blockchains that power these cryptocurrencies are open and public by default, there are vast amounts of data being generated across different blockchains. Since each data point creates economic value, there have been a variety of projects and actors looking into the technology, from tax regulators to those looking to predict future cryptocurrency prices.", "I was one of the first to write about new cryptocurrencies and the use of Bitcoin in remittance payments for TechCrunch and VentureBeat. I have a familiarity with the subject, and I also am a data science lover who has helped Springboard work on its machine learning bootcamp with job guarantee, so I\u2019m always looking for ways to combine both the vast data generated by cryptocurrencies and the machine learning projects you can build on them with real-world implications.", "Fortunately, Google BigQuery makes it easy to process data for free from some of the world\u2019s leading Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies, from Bitcoin to Zcash.", "Google was able to build a simple classifier that detected whether or not a transaction came from mining pools. You are able to import a library in iPython notebook and get started using SQL to query that massive dataset. Let\u2019s have some fun with some sample data queries, and see what we can do with that data with the Bitcoin data Google has on hand.", "There are two main tables to examine here in the schema: a \u201cblocks\u201d table and a \u201ctransactions\u201d table, which are joinable.", "Here\u2019s the schema for the blocks table:", "Here, we need to know a few basic definitions. A blockchain is composed of a series of blocks that contain transaction data and which are confirmed sequentially after a flow of time. Using the query of block_id, we can actually narrow down to a particular block in a blockchain.", "Let\u2019s play around with the basic concepts of the blockchain with this explorer. Looking at the first block, we see that there were 50 Bitcoin output for the first block. The block height (1) indicates that it is the first block mined and validated in the Bitcoin mainnet blockchain, which is the in-production version of Bitcoin that people use to transact financial value between one another (in contrast to testnets, which are for staging purposes only).", "You can query for the previous block_id in the blockchain using the previous_block variable. In this case, with a block height of 1, there is no previous_block reference. But if you looked at the block height of 2, previous_block would then refer to the genesis block/the block with the block height of 1.", "The Merkle root is a hash of all the hashed transactions within a block that allows you to verify the entire block\u2019s integrity with much lower computational cost.", "Each block also has a timestamp that has a relatively accurate metric for when it was validated and which serves as an additional layer of authentication against blockchain attackers. The difficulty target in each block is a measure of how much computational power it takes to mine a block: the difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks to ensure a continual balanced rate of about one block being mined every 10 minutes. Since Bitcoin is a proof-of-work system, mining blocks is what allows the system to arrive to a consensus on its current state, no matter the distributed amount of nodes and transactions present.", "Each block has a nonce that satisfies the network\u2019s requirements and means that the block can be mined. There is a version marker that talks about the version of the core configuration of Bitcoin code, and can be used as a marker of what conditions and specific rules a block was mined under.", "Work_terahash is then meant as an expression of how much computational power was required to contribute and mine a block. In the case of Bitcoin now, serious miners will run terahashes (trillions of attempted Bitcoin problem solutions) \u2014 up to 13 per second. This metric can serve as a proxy (along with difficulty level) of how many computational resources it takes to mine a block.", "You can play around with different queries on the BigQuery explorer to test them out, though you will be rate-limited, especially with larger data queries that return gigabytes of data. This limit is quite easy to bump against with rich blockchain data.", "Google BigQuery has a specific function where you need to use backdashes (`) surrounding table names for it to be a valid query as well.", "After all the block variables are analyzed, we can go onto transaction-level variables \u2014 the amounts of transactions between different Bitcoin users.", "Through the primary key of the transaction table, transaction_id, we can unlock information on individual transactions within a block: everything from the code output to the amount of satoshis (100 million satoshis equals one Bitcoin) in each transaction within each block. Blocks will have a number of transactions that are the lifeblood of Bitcoin, the transfer of value between different accounts.", "The coinbase also contains code and output that doesn\u2019t have to do with the satoshis transferred \u2014 this can be used to do things like identify mining pools that aggregate computing power and then distribute the proceeds of cryptocurrency mining among its individual contributors, who explicitly place their signature as an output on a block coinbase to identify themselves.", "After playing around with different SQL queries and the different concepts presented with the Google BigQuery interface, we can then import directly into iPython notebooks using Kaggle\u2019s BigQuery client tool and its kernel interface, and then also do aggregate functions, subfunctions, and everything SQL offers to source exact amounts of data on blocks and the transactions they contain.", "Let\u2019s do a count of every block contained in the Bitcoin blockchain data and play around with the interface in iPython and the Kaggle kernel with a few different queries, where we can easily obtain data via their integration with BigQuery.", "What are some things we can do in machine learning with this ability to source rich data on the Bitcoin blockchain and different cryptocurrencies?", "Classify whether or not a miner is part of a mining pool", "Google released a sample project that was able to classify whether or not a given transaction was generated by a mining pool, an effort to aggregate computing power together across several entities and individuals in order to try to successfully mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, given their difficulty level.", "The following queries led to the 26 feature vectors from output given to a certain address and idle times. Using a simple random forest classifier and miner classifications in the coinbase, Google was able to train and label a model that helped determine whether transactions were likely to be generated as part of a mining pool.", "Correlate and predict cryptocurrency interest and difficulty to price levels", "You can take factors such as the difficulty level and the amount of hash power dedicated to a blockchain, as well as the amount of transactional activity on the chain, and correlate that with historical price data to see if you can predict future prices based on time-series analysis and on-chain factors \u2014 potentially a very lucrative venture these days.", "Classify different blockchains based on their attributes", "You can source different attributes from different blockchains such as the Gini coefficient of miner rewards, as was done in this analysis of Ethereum Classic on Kaggle, and then use that to analyze the similarity between different blockchains based on different traits, such as the concentration of mining rewards, or the difficulty level or version history changes \u2014 or anything else at all that you can find.", "Your home for data science.
