In challenges that the human can\u2019t solve alone, while we are facing global threats because of them. Whether it\u2019s related to medical \u201cconfrontation\u201d (with virus pandemic or cancer spreading out), or it\u2019s to add resilience or robustness to our financial system or to predict storms or severe weather events. AI is like an extension of our brain and we need it to help us.", "But there is a challenge that overwhelmingly surpasses us, it is the climate change. And it\u2019s occurring much faster than we thought! So, we\u2019ll need to establish an intimate relationship between AI and Energy storage to make sure that the required energy transition keep up the pace against this accelerating global warming.", "While Artificial intelligence has been gaining ground for several years in the energy sector, many fears that, one day, it may hinder the actions of the man in his daily life. These fears have inspired many films like \u201cMatrix\u201d. It fascinates, interests but is also scary, almost terrifying!", "But today these fears take a new turn, and they are coming from another root. Some reports show that 62% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are directly or indirectly due to the extraction and processing of the materials and source of energy that make up our consumer products, services, the livelihoods that are greatly depending on the \u201cso-called\u201d unlimited resources.", "To fight against this GHG pollution, it is necessary to completely review our economy and consumption patterns, rethinking our products (life cycle, production, end of life), or energy sources and distribution. This time with an understanding of the importance of artificial intelligence in certain areas, we can see it as the solution, not the scary thing. It\u2019s especially true in the energy transition. AI comes in simplifying this highly complex transition and especially saving time that has become valuable!", "Anyways, if we\u2019re not changing our ways and means to solve it, that\u2019s not just a battle we\u2019ll lose against climate change, it\u2019s the war. And we are, by all the odds, on the weak side. One of the main reasons is the (somewhat) slow speed of the energy transition. We\u2019re not able to catch up on energy demand. That is why AI, well used, could reinforce our capacity to respond to this threat.", "The long, complex dynamics of the greenhouse effect and climate change, the centuries-long, path-dependent, persistent use or path dependence of fossil fuels, lock-in strategies, responses and destabilisation of incumbent energy actors and institutions, and even issues of equity and justice underlie many of the challenges involved and increase the difficulties of national and global (public or private) governance to solve it.", "So, historical expertise might enhance our understanding and many studies have shown that transitioning away from our current global energy system is of paramount importance, including Sovacool, from Oxford University, or Grubler which has compellingly written, \u2018the need for the \u201cnext\u201d\u2019 energy transition is widely apparent as current energy systems are simply unsustainable on all accounts of social, economic, and environmental criteria\u2019. Fouquet has noted that", "\u201cthe relatively rare and protracted nature of energy transitions implies that it is vital to look at historical experiences for lessons about how they might unfold in the future.\u201d", "Adding to the fact that usually, transitions are lasting for a long time or longer than expected (the \u201cprotracted\u201d nature), he outlined that the fastest historical energy transitions observed here was thirty years (in sector-specific cases). 30 years for just one specific sector, while full (or wide-scale) energy transitions, involving all sectors and services, have taken much longer. We don\u2019t have this amount of time yet to fight Climate Change before it\u2019s irreversibly well beyond the 1.5\u20132.0 C threshold.", "Several of the problem areas, identified by energy transition historical research, raise important, tricky issues concerning the development of knowledge about the nature, variety and complexities of energy transitions. They include the distinction between the many kinds of \u2018minor\u2019 and \u2018major\u2019 (or \u2018grand\u2019) transitions. This is important for our capacity to comprehend the scale, pace, duration, smoothness and (dis)continuity or other \u2018special\u2019 properties of transitions, and for our ability to guide or manage them. Indeed, studies have illustrated that the price of energy services played a crucial role in creating incentives to stimulate energy transitions. But an additional key factor is whether the new technology offers new characteristics of value to the consumer, which can help create a market even when the initial price is higher. On the opposite, a crucial factor that can delay a transition is the reaction of the incumbent and declining industries. Nevertheless, governments have, in a few (just a few!) instances, created the regulatory setting to stimulate energy transitions to low-polluting energy sources. Yes, this could be done again, but only if the political will is available at the same time as alternative energy sources project.", "A smart coupling of AI and Energy storage with renewables may act as a catalyst for stimulating processes that led to certain energy transitions. Past energy transitions have had major impacts on the incumbent industries which have declined, but they have also improved energy independence, economic transformations and even inequalities. That\u2019s what needs to be reproduced on a wider scale here, in a sustainability transition way with innovative theories and approaches.", "According to the research agenda of the influential Sustainability Transitions Research Network, research in this area recognises that many environmental problems require deep structural changes in key areas of human activity and society, including energy systems. It asserts, that a key:", "\u201cchallenge for sustainable development is the fact that existing systems tend to be very difficult to \u2018dislodge\u2019 because they are stabilized by various lock-in processes that lead to path-dependent developments and \u2018entrapment\u2019\u201d.", "The transformation of energy grids, the emergence of new services, new players: prosummers, consum\u2019actors and new models such as self-consumption, alters the operating requirements and constraints of the grids themselves and imposes the management of increasingly massive data that would be unworkable without recourse to AI. The term Smart Grid has been around for many years now. It carries the promise of grids that would adapt themselves to new uses, more resilient, more efficient, in a word: smart.", "Another way to understand the exponentially growing potential this is to practice this technology for yourself in one of the many ways available now. You can not imagine how it works on an impressive number of topics and how this ecosystem really feels like a group of pioneers clearing land that just waiting to be conquered. You have to touch it, to try it, kick the tire! In my field, in the energy sector, the gains obtained with energy storage or AI seemed unachievable just a few years ago. You can now find many usage and technologies using AI efficiently. All this depends on having the talent to shape these algorithms. Because, we often think in terms of the education of humans, but the infinite learning curve of the AI. We preferred a pragmatic and concrete approach that slows us when it\u2019s time to go forward. This energy transition with AI is as essential as using computers and databases in businesses, 30 years ago.", "Many examples exist around the world. This term does not only apply to electricity, but it is also referred to as Smart Gas Grids, Smart Water Grids, Smart District Heating and even Smart Factory Networks or Grids, and all sizes of grids are concerned. However, Smart Grids are, especially today, automated networks without real learning capabilities, the premise of what must be truly intelligent networks doped with AI.", "If we compare the AI \u200b\u200bmaturity of these smart grids to that of AI\u2019s game, we are currently much closer to the IBM chess game AI (DeepBlue, 1997) than to the Google game of Go ( AlphaGo Zero in Deepmind Blog or AlphaGo Zero in Nature, 2017). You can take a look at AlphaGo \u201cThe Film\u201d and Kick the tire! See for yourself an example of the AI learning curve in action.", "You can imagine what would be the impact of such an intelligent tool in the energy field. The integration of intelligent energy storage (IES) in the mix is even earlier in the deployment. Concretely the challenges of the \u201creally-intelligent\u201d integration of Smart Grids and Energy Storage is to answer the emergence of the new needs of the consumers and the producers of energy, accompanied by the mass generation of data on their state and necessary to their operation. The direct impact is the sharp increase in the complexity of energy networks. This increase in complexity is great news! It tells us that we are in the process of performing or materializing our energy transition.", "It\u2019s really started, but not yet achieved. Several ruptures result of this transition. Take the case of the power grid on which I\u2019ll focus on in this article, knowing that it is applicable to all other types of Smart Grids mentioned above. The first disruption is the transition from a hierarchical and asymmetric grid to a set of distributed and dynamic grids. We move from the model where the power plants produced energy that was distributed to consumers to the model where everyone can produce, consume, sell, buy or even self-consume on their own or within a community. In short, the new network model is a dynamic and distributed model where each can be an individual, a municipality, a community of individuals or municipalities, an industry or a central.", "The second rupture is the shift from near constant production with little variation to largely intermittent and fatal production related to renewable energy (ENR) and the necessary storage of energy.", "The third is the partial loss of control over the grid by the grid operators due to the emergence of new uses with their own balancing logic: electric vehicles, self-consumption community, etc. It this all needs to be done, while still requiring peak shaving, load shifting, valley filling, conservation at the same time as the total load is still growing. This results in the emergence of significant complexity of flows and islanding of grid structures that paradoxically reinforces the need to balance the global network.", "Some are using a simple way to define Artificial Intelligence is \u201csoftware that can learn and decide in a relevant way\u201d. Others would say that it is a \u201cSet of theories and techniques developing complex computer programs capable of simulating certain traits of human intelligence (reasoning, learning \u2026).\u201d The World Economic Forum, which took place last January in Davos, discussed different topics (ref. EnergyVoice) including the usefulness of artificial intelligence in the energy transition in true purpose-driven tech development. It was explained that AI can facilitate the eco-design of products better integrate Renewable in the energy mix, simplify the development of new business models, which will be designed to be more energy efficient and notably to manage (and reduce) waste of all sorts in a large scale. Artificial intelligence could allow for rapid development of an achievable circular economy conducive to the energy transition, and there is urgency!", "But also, it can help through the biggest challenges and make sure that scale-up is achievable. The complex network of technology needed to usher the transition to low carbon sources needs to be capable of scaling-up to align with global needs. One of the most prominent examples of this is large-scale and long-term energy storage. Concretely, the AI would quickly calculate many data, before associating them, thus making them usable.", "It is now clear to just about everyone that AI is not a simple topic in itself but rather a genius tool for transformation affecting every imaginable area. Optimally integrate Energy Storage with AI (the IES or Intelligent Energy Storage) to efficiently perform Energy transition with clean energy is a natural pathway forward. That will \u201cdisrupt\u201d the conventional ways, but this combination has the potential to solve the biggest of the (exponentially growing) challenges. One way to explain this exponential capacity of the combo tool is that AI algorithms are extremely effective at handling highly complex and non-linear situations as the world becomes more complex each day. The energy transition can not do well and fast without optimizations gained from the IES, the return is no longer an option! In a \u201cCombo Effect\u201d, IES can also help to meet certain shortages in remote areas and thus reduce territorial inequalities.", "IES is, therefore, the new solution, to reduce our impact on the environment, while integrating perfectly the sustainable sector into the global economy.", "Artificial intelligence can, therefore, adapt to many if not all sectors of the power industry. But how is this going? When used in production or energy consumption, AI can work through sensors, which are installed in control systems. These sensors make it possible to analyze any data, for example, temperature, vibrations or the power of the flows.", "This allows for real-time processing of the data. Thanks to this, anomalies or malfunctions of the system are detected and supported much more quickly. Once the problems are highlighted, the defective system or equipment can be replaced, this maximizes the energy efficiency while avoiding waste (example: leaks on a steam line or intermittently failing solar panels or storage modules).", "Soon, artificial intelligence will even be able to detect weak signals, analyze the obsolescence of a component and recommend it in the wake! The maintenance of the system will be optimized and the production never interrupted.", "In short, artificial intelligence represents a real solution to better consider the energy transition. Its major advantage: it is available to different industries. In addition, the ideas fuse to push it and make it always more optimal.", "IES can help build multi-year, transformation grid modernization programs for operators or regulators. The focus is on capability building, from enhanced situational awareness to the deployment of intelligent infrastructure. IES ensure that the integration of bulk and distributed renewables and becoming the grid of the future for customers are central tenets of future strategies. It is a complex Integrated program including Analytics, Customer Empowerment, DER and Bulk Renewable management, Integrated Systems, Network Automation and Physical and Cyber Security. So, for Smart Grid Deployments, IES should be there from the start. It means to explore the connected customers\u2019 market, what a future of transactive energy may look like and whether innovative regulation like Reforming the Energy Vision in New York or California\u2019s AB 2868 will have impacts across other jurisdictions.", "Through rigorous assumption, sensitivity and scenario analysis AI develop business cases for utilities to ensure that investments in new technologies are optimized and can be accelerated and that energy storage is well integrated for Renewables project are built for the future.", "In 2018, C\u00e9dric Villani, member of the French Parliament and renowned mathematician, presented a parliamentary report, soberly titled Giving a meaning to artificial intelligence. Surrounded by a team of seven specialists, he questioned the French and European strategy in artificial intelligence:", "\u201cLike many mathematicians starting their career in the 1990s, I deeply underestimated the impact of artificial intelligence, which finally gave, at that time, few results,\u2026 What a surprise it was to witness, in the 2010s, the incredible improvement of its performances. [\u2026] Moreover, in recent years, no one can escape this subject polymorphous, so he has become ubiquitous in economic and social discussions,\u201d says C\u00e9dric Villani in his Forword.", "In the case of the priority objective of global reduction of the carbon footprint, the report proposes to concentrate the AI \u200b\u200befforts in two sectors: the optimization of the modes of transport and the transition towards more rational and less polluting agriculture.", "How? Mr Villany even proposed a sectoral policy, which would have a non-negligible mass effect, and would constitute a major step forward in the energy transition. All this without forgetting, in parallel, to systematize the recycling of the heat produced by these data centers that receive these exceptional tools! Because with the artificial intelligence of tomorrow, nothing must be lost anymore.", "The bright side is that artificial intelligence and energy storage also carry with them a panoply of solutions in terms of ecological and energy transition. The 2018 MP Villany\u2019s report added:", "\u201cAI opens up radically new perspectives for understanding and preserving the environment. Whether in terms of identifying and preserving biodiversity, repairing the damage, modelling the impact of our actions, optimizing the use of resources, developing renewable energies, AI can help reduce all our consumption and amplify all our actions.\u201d", "This is good news, but we can\u2019t wait for policy to start working on the integration of these innovative technologies into our grids, big and small. This will also greatly help to quickly improve the resiliency of the grids in front of the increasing (in strength and occurrence) storms, fires, droughts, floods and other impacts of climate change; improving not only CO2 emissions but also energy efficiency, independence and responsiveness, especially in remote communities. The energy transition is required as soon as possible.
