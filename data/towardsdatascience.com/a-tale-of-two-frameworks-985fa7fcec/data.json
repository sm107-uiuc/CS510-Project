For me, it\u2019s Tensorflow, particularly since they better integrated Keras in tf2.0. But every time another feature is released in PyTorch the grass looks a little bit greener on the other side. So this tutorial is for those people with a strong understanding of one framework, and a curiosity about the other.", "In this tutorial, I\u2019ll walk you through the same example in both frameworks, including side-by-side comparisons of a few best practices such as:", "I\u2019ll be using a familiar dataset, Cats v Dogs, because this guide isn\u2019t about solving a tricky problem (you\u2019ve probably already got your own problem in mind), it\u2019s about creating a general, minimal example that you can easily adapt. Mostly though, I\u2019m using this dataset because if I\u2019m going to spend vast amounts of time looking at images I\u2019d rather they be of cute animals. If you want to follow along exactly, download the data from here.", "My dataset is stored in a subdirectory (\u2018data\u2019) of folder containing my training script (\u2018folder\u2019), with the following structure:", "My dataset isn\u2019t very large (25,000 fairly small images, of which I\u2019ll only be using 1000 as a minimal example), so I can load it all in to memory. But datasets too large to load in to memory are becoming more common, so it\u2019s important to have a pipeline that can deal with those situations. A data generator is a great option which allows you to generate the data in real time, run preprocessing and augmentation in batches, and feed it right in to the model. This can lead to huge efficiencies during training, since it allows for data to be prepped on the CPU which the GPU is running training.", "For my Tensorflow data generator, I\u2019m going to inherit from tf.keras.utils.Sequence, so that I can capitalise on perks like multiprocessing. You\u2019ll notice I\u2019m calling a function \u2018augment\u2019 in this code, you can find the code for that here, or make your own function where the input is an image, and the output is an augmented version of that image, with fixed size (im_size), scaled between -1 and 1.", "We put as arguments important information such as the directory containing the data (data_dir), the batch size, size the images will be rescaled to (for this purpose they\u2019ll have the same height and width), number of images to use (setting this to a number less than the total number of images is helpful for testing the network and debugging), and whether the data should be shuffled each epoch.", "The class needs a few methods in order to function correctly:", "The two other methods in the class aren\u2019t strictly required:", "Then it\u2019s a pretty simple matter to create an instance of the generator in the training script, and read in all the validation images.", "The PyTorch data generator is fairly similar to the Tensorflow generator. However in this case, inheriting from torch.utils.data.Dataset allows us to use multiprocessing, analogous to the inheritance of tf.keras.utils.Sequence in the previous section. There\u2019s a lot of other similarities too, we\u2019re using the augment function, we\u2019re also using similar arguments, including batch size, image size, number of images and shuffle.", "The generator involves three of the same methods:", "An important thing to note here is the normalization applied to the image if the model type in mobilenet, that\u2019s because the network we\u2019ll use for \u2018mobilenet\u2019 is a pretrained, torchvision model, which was trained using images normalised in this fasion. Therefore, when using this model we need to normalise in the same way.", "Creating the PyTorch generator in the training pipeline requires a little extra work. First we set up some parameters, including the number of threads used to load data in parallel. Then we instantiate the class, and pass it to the DataLoader class, which also takes the parameters we set up. We create a second generator for validation, where we pass the validation flag to make sure that images won\u2019t undergo augmentation.", "Now let\u2019s see what it looks like to create a simple CNN. In both frameworks I\u2019m going to set up a CNN with 4 convolutional layers, separated by max pooling, followed by dropout at 50%, and then two linear layers. We\u2019re not going for performance here, just demonstration.", "Both frameworks allow you to create the layers you need from the ground up, which means you have a fair amount of customisability. However, unless you have a very good reason to want to create your own custom layer, I encourage you to save yourself the trouble and use the user-friendly wrappers both frameworks provide.", "Tensorflow has recently properly integrated Keras, the highly popular wrapper that simplifies creation and training of deep neural networks. This is what it looks like to create our simple CNN in Tensorflow Keras.", "Using the Sequential model type groups a stack of layers together. The order that the layers are stacked within Sequential denotes the order of the layers in the network. In contrast to what we\u2019ll see in PyTorch, all layers, including those without trainable parameters (like MaxPooling and activation functions) are included in the model. That\u2019s because this one function serves to both declare the structure of the model, and define the flow of data in the forward (and backward) pass.", "In PyTorch, the model is defined as a class that inherits from nn.Module, with an __init__ that contains the layers, and a method forward() that defines how the data will pass through the network, and returns the output of the network.", "Keep in mind that any layers that have parameters that need to be trained (like convolutional layers) need to be registered in __init__. Layers with no trainable parameters (like max pooling and activation functions) can be registered either in __init__ or forward().", "This may be a bit more complex than how we connected our network in Tensorflow, but the separation of layers and connectivity lends PyTorch quite a bit of flexibility that isn\u2019t nearly as easy to achieve in Tensorflow.", "The loss function compares the output of the model to the target value, and estimates how far apart they are. The loss function you use will depend on your application, I\u2019m using Binary Cross Entropy with Logit Loss because I\u2019m training a binary classifier. The \u201clogit loss\u201d part is because the output from my model has a linear activation function, which in DL framework terms means that the input in to my loss function is a \u201clogit\u201d, the term used for a classification output before it passes through a sigmoid or softmax layer. It is more computationally efficient to calculate the sigmoid/softmax with the cross-entropy, which the BCE with logit loss layer does.", "The optimizer is used to update the parameters of the model in order to reduce the loss. There are lots of optimizers to choose from, but I\u2019m using Adam.", "In Tensorflow binary cross-entropy with and without logit loss are defined through the same function.", "In PyTorch, binary cross-entropy with logits loss is a separate function to that without logits loss. Also, the optimizer takes the model parameters as input as well as the learning rate. Therefore, if you\u2019re not training all of the parameters (i.e. if you\u2019re fine tuning a model), then make sure to only pass in the parameters that you are training.", "Finally, we get to the good stuff, training our network. We\u2019re also going to be adding two separate functions to the training loop, one for logging the process of our training to Tensorboard, and another for model checkpointing.", "Tensorboard is used to log the loss and accuracy of the model during training. you can also add other capabilities, such as logging images (which is particularly handy if you\u2019re training an image generator), and histograms (great for keeping track of gradients).", "Model checkpointing saves the model or weights in the chosen folder at regular intervals during training (every epoch as default). We will only be overwriting the weights each step if the validation accuracy is larger than the current checkpoint.", "There are many other functions that you can (and should) add, such as learning rate scheduling and early stopping.", "In Tensorflow there are multiple ways of training the network. The first is the simplest, it takes advantage of the Keras \u2018fit\u2019 method, using your data generator as the training data input (note that prior to Tensorflow 2.0 you would have had to use \u2018fit_generator\u2019 to take a generator as input, but this has been deprecated in recent releases). Unfortunately, the validation data cannot be passed in as a generator.", "Prior to calling \u2018fit\u2019 we need to compile our model with the optimizer and loss. We also set some parameters for multiprocessing to speed up the training loop. The other thing to note here is the use of callbacks, which is how we\u2019re defining the Tensorboard and model checkpointing behaviour mentioned earlier.", "This training code, applied to 850 cat/dog training images, with 150 validation images, on a MacBook Pro with no GPU, gives the following results:", "Alternatively, we can define the training loop more explicitly. Specifically, we define a for-loop that iterates over epochs, then another loop over the dataset in batches. First up, we\u2019re defining a number of metrics (train/validation accuracy and loss) which get updated during the train and test step functions.", "We then define the train and validation functions. In the train function, we open a GradientTape() scope, in which we call the model to run the forward pass and compute the loss. Then we retrieve the gradients and use the optimizer to update the weights based on the gradients. The difference in the validation function is that we only run the data through the model to calculate the loss and accuracy, logging them both.", "An important thing to note here is the use of the tf.function decorator above both train and test step functions. Tensorflow 2.0 onwards operates in eager mode by default, which is great for line by line execution and therefore debugging, but it makes for slower function execution. This decorator converts a python function to a static tensorflow graph, which runs faster.", "We also need to set up Tensorboard logging manually, and check the validation accuracy to monitor when to save out the model weights.", "This training code, applied to 850 cat/dog training images, with 150 validation images, on a MacBook Pro with no GPU, gives the following results:", "The Pytorch loop follows the same logic as the tensorflow loop, one of the main differences to note is how the backwards pass is run quite elegantly and intuitively, by calling the backward method on the loss, and parameters are updated by calling the step method on the optimizer. It\u2019s important to note the use of no_grad scope in the validation step, which temporarily sets all of the \u201crequires_grad\u201d flags in the model parameters to False.", "Also note the use of \u2018model.train()\u2019 and \u2018model.eval()\u2019, which are used to switch between modes for models that contain modules which have different training and evaluation behavior, such as batch normalization.", "This training code, applied to 850 cat/dog training images, with 150 validation images, on a MacBook Pro with no GPU, gives the following results:", "This is notably longer time per epoch compared with Tensorflow. Monitoring the use of my CPU cores during execution shows they\u2019re being under-utilised compared to the Tensorflow implementation, despite the setting of the num_workers parameter in the data loader. This is a known issue in Pytorch currently, please comment if you know of a fix!", "One of the great aspects of Tensorflow and PyTorch as deep learning frameworks is the ability to capitalise on in-built pre-trained models. Both frameworks include many of the most popular models pretrained on ImageNet for you to use for free. Better yet, it\u2019s quite easy to start using these networks, and replace the classification layers with something that better fits your problem.", "One particularly easy way of using a pre-trained model in Tensorflow is through Keras Applications, which are canned architectures with pre-trained weights. Note that this is not the only way of using pre-trained models, but it\u2019s probably the easiest. If your model of choice isn\u2019t listed here you can check out TFHub or TF Model Garden.", "This training code, applied to 850 cat/dog training images, with 150 validation images, on a MacBook Pro with no GPU, gives the following results:", "This is much better than the simple model! Note that the training time is lower than the simple model due to the smaller number of parameters actually being trained (even though the whole model is much larger).", "The Pytorch equivalent of Keras Applications is Torchvision. Torchvision pre-trained networks require their inputs to be normalised in a particular way, see here for details. As mentioned earlier, I normalised the images in the data augmentation stage.", "We don\u2019t want to train the feature extraction stage of the network, therefore we turn off the \u2018requires_grad\u2019 flag of the network for all layers, before replacing the second classification layer with our own (trainable) linear layer. We pass only this layer in to the optimizer.", "This training code, applied to 850 cat/dog training images, with 150 validation images, on a MacBook Pro with no GPU, gives the following results:", "It\u2019s been a long read but we\u2019re almost there, we just need to evaluate the models. The following code assumes you\u2019ve already created the model layout, and therefore just need to load the weights from file.", "The Tensorflow method \u2018load_weights\u2019 used on the predefined model structure loads and applies the trained parameters of the model found in the selected checkpoint file. The following code grabs one batch of images from the test set and runs them through the model.", "The Pytorch function \u2018load_state_dict\u2019 applies the state of the parameters of \u2018model\u2019 found in the selected checkpoint file. The following code grabs one batch of images from the test set and runs them through the model.", "I hope that this tutorial has given you a better understanding of the use of the counterpart to your preferred framework. Both frameworks have developed to the point that they\u2019re simultaneously easy to use for beginners and highly customisable when required.
