It hosts free InClass competitions, challenges for conferences like CVPR and NIPS, scientific competitions and business challenges. The challenges organisers usually provide data, the evaluation metric, and the test-set for evaluation. This test-set is used to form a public leaderboard, that allows approximately compare the participant's models performance and drives gamification power in the chasing game of the challenge. Many have been consumed and destroyed by following the public leaderboard chase instead of trusting their local validation.", "Kaggle platform also has discussions, notebooks and datasets, where participants can share their ideas, data and samples of code. It helps to speed up the process as partly the challenge is being solved collectively. It also provides great support for learning; therefore, many students and uprising machine learning experts choose the Kaggle platform for their first competitions.", "There are, of course, other platforms for machine learning competitions, such as the topcoder, Codalab, Zindi, and others [more are here]. But with lack of notebooks and good discussion forums they are more oriented to the established professionals and are less suitable for the students and learners. Therefore, Kaggle is usually the first choice for practising machine learning.", "As a cherry on top Kaggle often provides credi\u0435s for Google Cloud Platform that can be utilised during a limited time of the challenge. The Dutch internet service provider HOSTKEY B.V. (https://www.hostkey.com/gpu-servers#/) also can provide access to GPU servers and technical assistance. You may apply for their grants here: http://landing.hostkey.com/grants.", "During machine learning competitions, many approaches and ideas are usually tried and verified, often resulting in state-of-the-art models for the given task. Far too often, all this is going nowhere, except for maybe top 3 solutions going to the challenge organizers. This is a clear waste of knowledge and (often huge) computational resources, which is a pity.", "In recent years, many top participants make a write-up describing their solution and even open their code after the competition. This is a great initiative. However, the short write-up is usually insufficient to reproduce the results and Kaggle-style code is usually somewhat messy and hard to understand without comments. During the challenge, everybody is chasing the leaderboard in a hurry and only a few participants bother with a production-quality code.", "Here are the main reasons considering forming your top Kaggle solution model into a detailed technical report/paper after the competition, instead of a one-hour write-up, that we usually see.", "1. It is a great contribution to the human knowledge base and it does create an impact. Often, during competitions several ideas are implemented, many tries (and fails) are performed, and sometimes even SOTA solutions can be seen among the winning models. Summing it all up in detail will help other researchers and students to save time while choosing the approach, model architecture, loss function or augmentations.", "Even if you do not see the impact explicitly, it is there \u2014 in all those citations of your paper and forks of your GitHub repo.", "2. The proper technical report/paper after the challenge forces you to clean your code, make it readable and reproducible. It looks nice as a mini-project on your GitHub with the reference to arXiv and a clean project code \u2014 something you can add to the resume and share without NDA issues.", "3. Submissions to arXiv do not have a peer-review process, while submissions to the journals/conferences do. After publishing the tech report on the arXiv you may send it to the conference proceedings or to a relevant journal. It happened to me as well: after publishing a draft on arXiv it was invited to a journal. Submitting your work to conferences and journals gives a proper peer review of your model and methods used. Yes, sometimes the review means you need to do extra calculations, ablation study and rewrite half of the paper (I-know-that-feel), but it\u2019s worth to know that this feedback makes your research and tech part better.", "4. You have it all ready at hand: data analysis, working pipeline code, your results and even figures. It\u2019s easier to put it all together straight after the challenge.", "5. Finally, it\u2019s a good long-standing PR. Kaggle post is popular a day, a good peer-reviewed paper stays for a long time, it appears on arXiv and relevant conference proceedings and thus creates a long-standing PR for you and your company (if you have one).", "Over the last year, I successfully submitted two technical papers on the challenges. I published them on arXiv and GitHub. One paper got invited to the Journal of Astronomical Society and the second got accepted to the CVPR workshop. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to make it happen.", "For staying up to date about novel approaches in deep learning a good source to stay tuned is paperswithcode. It gives references to publications with the code available and provides the up-to-date leaderboards for the popular datasets.", "2. Clean your code and add comments. You may consider using Black for style formating, isort to sort imports, flake8 and Mypy for checks. This blog-post providing useful info on how to make your code more readable.Write a README file with instructions on how to set up the environment and download data, how to train the models and reproduce the experiments.", "3. Do ablation study. Fix all random seeds and hyperparameters and repeat calculations for all those tricks that were useful and not-so-successful, introduce changes one-by-one and repeat all the attempts you\u2019ve tried and denied, record the metric each time. This will give you an ablation study of what was the real contribution of the model improvements you\u2019ve implemented.", "4. Go through other top solutions shared on Kaggle, contact the winners and ask about using their ideas/code with the reference. It\u2019s worth adding their improvements in your ablation study and including their ideas in the paper discussion session. In general, Kagglers are very open about it: I asked around 3\u20134 people about using their content with the reference and always got permissions. You may even improve your model further and make a late submission for the competition. Kaggle platform allows late submissions.", "5. Make a dataset description, prepare several graphs illustrating the data, show data class distribution, give all the sources for additional data used. It should follow the introduction. Describe the given task and metrics used.", "6. When you made your ablation study, re-trained your models with their improvements, and got a good score on a leaderboard it\u2019s time to write it up. Describe the model you used, how did you split the data, hyperparameters used and the training process. Make it concise and clear, refer to your GitHub repo. Do not forget to cite all the resources that you used in the text.", "7. Write up your results. Make a few plots illustrating training of different models, data augmentations; add a table with the score results for your experiments and ablation study.", "8. Finally, reflect on your results. You may add a discussion section and add failed tries as well, mentioning what did not work out. Also, you may include the ideas shared by other participants in this section.", "9. Do not forget an acknowledgement session, thank challenge organisers, Kaggle platform and anything else you found useful.", "10. To craft the paper style you may use a LaTex editor (i.e. WinEdit) or online editor (i.e. Overleaf) and download different styles from overleaf. Once finished, it\u2019s a good idea to check your text with Grammarly.", "11. Submit your work to the arXiv first. Then, identify relevant conferences and journals, pay attention to the coming submission deadlines when picking a conference, read their instructions to authors, download their latex template and copy your content to it. Once ready, submit it through the conference or journal website and wait for the review.", "The peer-review process can give rejections. Do not be too upset about it: every journal/conference has its scope. Try to follow the guidelines of the reviewers and take into account their feedback, when you can. Then, re-submit the improved article to another relevant journal or conference.", "After all that work, some frustration and improvements, your work will see the world. It will be much more readable and usable by that time. Also, most likely, it will make you happy :). It will be a good asset for your resume and GitHub repo.", "Your home for data science.
