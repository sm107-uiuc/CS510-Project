We discuss first Numerical Integration in general then we go to Romberg Integration.", "To get the reason behind the name, this one is the needed part.", "Numerical Integration is also called as \u2018Numerical Quadrature\u2019 or \u2018Numerical Approximation of Definite Integrals\u2019. Its name is from the ancient methods for computing areas of curved figures, the most famous of which is the problem of \u2018squaring the circles\u2019 which means finding a square having the same area as a given circle.", "Numerical Integration as it name suggests gets the integral of a function. However, isn\u2019t it that we already know how to integrate (Remember Math 50 series)? Right, but remember also that we use formulas to integrate and not all of the functions that must be integrated is integrable by these formulas. They are just common special cases.", "Examples of the integrals that is not integrable through the formulas are:", "They may seem so simple and not so wild as that of crowded integrals but still, they are beyond reach of the special formulas we\u2019ve been presented to before.", "We set assumptions so we won\u2019t be discussing them again and again. Also, the nature of answer, to be clear what kind of answer should we be expecting.", "Nature of Answer: \u201cWe seek a single number for the answer\u201d", "This means we\u2019re not looking for a function or a symbolic formula. This distinguishes Numerical Quadrature from the solution of differential equations, evaluation of indefinite integrals, and many packages for symbolic computation.", "One last thing before moving transitioning to Romberg. An integral as we know it is an infinite sum. What we do here is we approximate an infinite sum by a finite sum.", "It is assumed that before jumping here, knowledge of the Composite Trapezoidal Rule is already attained. Though we discuss the another pre-requisite below.", "Richardson Extrapolation is mainly a simple method for boosting the accuracy of certain numerical procedures. This one does the elimination of errors.

The most accurate estimate of the integral is always the last diagonal term of the array. This process is continued until the difference between two successive diagonal terms becomes sufficiently small.", "The overview above can be summarized into the formula:", "Having laid down all the needed tools, we show how to use them. We present first an example then we present the suggested general process", "First we get all our tools (formulas):", "then we get the big picture which is the matrix R above since this is what we will be filling out", "Thus we can actually see a suggested solution pattern. We summarize below:", "Challenge: Use Romberg Integration to evaluate an integral", "Formula Needed: Composite Trapezoidal Rule and Romberg", "Tip: Hold on to a separate sheet containing the matrix R", "Numerical Integration is simply the approximation of integrals and is useful for integrals that cannot be evaluated by the special formulas. One method under it is Romberg Integration.
