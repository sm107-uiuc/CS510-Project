Since his birth more than a decade ago, he has helped thousands of analysts around the world make sense of massive data sets. Despite his importance, few people outside of the big data sector have heard of him, and some who are acquainted with him have only vague idea about his usage.", "A few days ago, I had the pleasure to sit down and talk with Apache Pig himself. Our discussion covered many topics \u2014 from his founding philosophy to practical guidance on writing his language, Pig Latin. Below is the excerpt of this interview.", "Thank you! It\u2019s my pleasure to give this interview and gain some additional exposure for myself.", "You know, I\u2019m tired of people confusing me with my buddies in the Hadoop ecosystem. To many, we are just a mishmash of colorfully-named tools that somehow fit together to facilitate the management of Big Data. This has got to change! We play distinct roles in the Hadoop ecosystem and a familiarity with each of us is key to understanding Big Data. It\u2019s about time that I cleared this confusion and told the world who I really am!", "Of course! My name is Apache Pig, but most people just call me Pig. I am an open-source tool for analyzing large data sets.", "I was conceived by Yahoo in 2006. My conception was driven by Yahoo\u2019s need to transform and analyze massive amount of data without having to write complex MapReduce programs. In 2007, Yahoo open-sourced me under Apache Software Foundation (hence my first name). Since then, I have been guzzling and analyzing petabytes worth of data all around the world.", "Thanks! It is an interesting name, isn\u2019t it? Many people think that my name stems from my creators\u2019 effort to stick to the animal theme that permeates the Hadoop world. This is partly true \u2014 my name was indeed inspired by the eponymous animal\ud83d\udc37. This name, in turn, led to the adoption of cute nomenclatures for concepts related to me such as Pig Latin\u2060\u2014my programming language \u2014 and Grunt\u2060 \u2014 my interactive shell (more on these later).", "However, apart from it being catchy, there is actually an interesting philosophy that underlies my name. This philosophy, which is somewhat related to the characteristics of pig the animal, consists of four principles that guide how I should be developed:", "1. Pigs eat anything. I am a voracious data-guzzler. I can process any type of data, be it relational, flat, nested, structured or unstructured. I\u2019m also capable of reading data from multiple sources, such as Hive, HBase and Cassandra.", "2. Pigs live anywhere. Although I was first implemented on Hadoop, I\u2019m not intended to be tied to this framework. For instance, I can be run in a single computer to analyze local files.", "3. Pigs are domestic animals. I was designed to be easily understandable and modifiable by users. My programming language, Pig Latin, is easy to wrap one\u2019s head around. In addition, its capabilities can be easily extended by importing various user defined functions (UDFs).", "4. Pigs fly. This motto speaks to the speed with which I can process data. It also embodies my ability to help my users express complex logic in just a few lines of Pig Latin code.", "Certainly! To start off, for the sake of those who are new to this field, let me give you a quick explanation about Hadoop.", "Hadoop is a collection of open-source tools with which we can harness the combined power of several computers to store and process massive amounts of data.", "The diagram below depicts how I relate to other components within the ecosystem.", "The core of Hadoop is HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator). I work closely with these two guys.", "HDFS is a distributed storage system. It breaks files into blocks, makes redundant copies of these blocks and distributes them across different machines in the cluster. You can think of HDFS as my data manager. I read input files from HDFS, temporarily store my intermediate calculation results in HDFS and write the output of my analysis to HDFS.", "On the other hand, you can think of YARN as my computing resource manager. YARN negotiates computing resources on my behalf and schedules the tasks I need to execute. In doing so, YARN works closely with HDFS. YARN makes sure that the computing resources I get are located close (in terms of network topology) to the machines that store the data that I have to analyze.", "Good question! YARN is actually as my indirect computing resource manager \u2014 I don\u2019t interface directly with him. Instead, this interaction takes place through an execution engine layer. In Hadoop\u2019s context, an execution engine is a software system or a framework that runs across a cluster and gives the illusion of the cluster being a single giant machine. Most execution engines run on top of YARN. As of today, there are three execution engines I can run on: MapReduce, Tez and Spark.", "Sure! As I mentioned earlier, MapReduce is one of the three execution engines that I can run on. It is not a piece of software per se; rather, it is a simple yet powerful programming paradigm (i.e. a way of designing a program). Every MapReduce program consists of three phases: map, shuffle, and reduce.", "I shall first define these terms conceptually. Suppose we have a giant file on which we\u2019d like a MapReduce program to operate. In the map phase, the program will look at this giant file line by line. For each line, the program will output a key-value pair. The exact identity of these keys and values will depend on the objective of the program.", "In the shuffle phase, the key-value pairs with the same keys are grouped together. The resulting groups will be ordered according to their keys (e.g. if the keys are strings, then the groups will be sorted by the alphabetical structure of the keys). The output of the shuffle phase is an ordered bunch of groups. These groups are then distributed to different machines for the subsequent reduce phase.", "In the reduce phase, an aggregation function is applied to the bundled values in each group produced in the shuffle phase. This process is performed in parallel in many machines. The reduce phase will output the result of the program.", "An example will make this clearer. Let\u2019s say I have a text file and I want to count the occurrence of each distinct word in the text. Here is how a MapReduce job for this task would look like:", "The above example looks simple, doesn\u2019t it? Unfortunately, this is not the case for a great majority of MapReduce programs! Any big data professional can tell you that writing MapReduce programs is cumbersome and that not all data procedures can be easily written using the MapReduce paradigm.", "This is where I come in! It turns out that my language, Pig Latin, is much easier to write than MapReduce (one estimate points out that 10 lines of Pig Latin are equivalent to 200 lines of MapReduce code in Java!). When I run on MapReduce as the execution engine, under the hood, all these Pig Latin codes are converted into their MapReduce programs. Pretty neat, huh?", "Not quite! The MapReduce paradigm requires that a program be broken down into a series of mapping and reducing tasks. This requirement can sometimes lead to a convoluted program that consists of a long linear series of mappers and reducers.", "On the other hand, when I run on either Tez or Spark, I will convert the logic expressed in a Pig Latin code into a data structure known as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The word \u201cdirected\u201d in DAG means that all the data flow to one direction, while the word \u201cacyclic\u201d means that DAGs can\u2019t contain any loop. Here is an illustration of DAG:", "When creating a DAG, I will ensure that the steps are ordered in a way that optimizes computation. For example, let\u2019s say we have a script that contains a JOIN operation followed by a FILTER step. I will investigate whether the FILTER step can be done before the JOIN step. If yes, I will perform the FILTER step prior to the JOIN step, thus reducing the number of data points to be joined (JOIN is a computationally expensive operation!) Because of the power of DAGs, my running on Tez or Spark always leads to better performance compared to MapReduce.", "In my experience, people use me for two things: extract-transform-load (ETL) pipelines and ad-hoc queries.", "A typical ETL pipeline loads in a data from a source, clean it, transform it and store it somewhere. An example is the processing of log data of a particular website. Using my FILTER function, one can clean these logs by filtering out data coming from automatic bots and internal views. I can also perform transformations that enrich the original log data. For instance, I can group these log data by the countries that the visitors hail from to provide more fine-grained view of the data.", "My other common use case is research and ad-hoc queries. Traditionally, these are done using SQL. However, if the data set to be queried is unstructured and contains \u201ccomplications\u201d such as nested structures and missing values, I may be a better tool. My flexibility and extendability lend themselves well for such cases.", "This is a question I receive a lot. Before I go into the details, let me quickly introduce Hive \ud83d\udc1d to you. Like myself, Hive is a data analysis tool that is part of the Hadoop ecosystem and can run on either MapReduce, Tez or Spark.", "Now let\u2019s go to the meat of the question. If both Hive and I can perform data analysis, why is there a need to have both of us? In other words, what are the differences between us? Here are my answer to that:", "Ah I see, the dreaded \u201cweakness\u201d question \ud83d\ude13. Well let me be frank \u2014 I do have some limitations that might make me unsuitable in some cases. Here are my main limitations:", "Sadly, this is true. Spark is quickly gaining ground in the industry. In the rapidly evolving Big Data sector, it is only natural that the community regularly phases out older technologies in favor of newer, more powerful tools. To my chagrin, it feels that I am the one currently being phased out \ud83d\ude2d.", "Let me quickly tell you why Spark is in many ways superior to myself. While my language Pig Latin provides several high-level operators and is extendable to a certain extent, Spark is a full-blown programming language. Thanks to tight integration to its \u201chost\u201d language (usually Scala or Python), Spark comes with complete control statements and unlimited ability to define functions and objects. All these allow you to transform your data in almost any way you like!", "On top of that, Spark also has several libraries that can perform specialized procedures on massive data sets. For example, Spark\u2019s MLlib allows for pre-processing, model training and making predictions at scale. With these abilities, Spark serves as a unified platform for the processing and analysis of Big Data. These are all things that are out of my reach!", "I\u2019d recommend them to download Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) Sandbox. The HDP Sandbox is a pre-configured learning environment that contains the latest developments from Apache Hadoop, including myself! The Sandbox comes packaged in a virtual environment that one can run in their personal machine, allowing them to get a hold of me in no time.", "Once you download the Sandbox, you can run me through a couple of ways:", "Sure! Pig Latin is a relatively simple scripting language. Through Pig Latin, users can command me to perform common data operations such as SELECT,JOIN and FILTER. Pig Latin is also extendable; users can develop and import UDFs to expand Pig Latin\u2019s capability.", "Here is an example of Pig Latin. The script below is the Pig Latin equivalent of the MapReduce program we saw earlier, which counts the occurrence of each distinct word in a text file. Take a look:", "That seems to be a common opinion among my users \u2014 that Pig Latin is a procedural version of SQL. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with this view. Although there are certain similarities, there are also some salient differences.", "SQL is a descriptive language. It lets users describe the information (i.e. the table) they need and will get it for them. Pig Latin, on the other hand, is a procedural language. In Pig Latin, users have to specify the steps that will lead them to their desired table (or relation, in Pig Latin terminology). The procedural nature of Pig Latin commands an advantage: by forcing users to write each step atomically, Pig Latin reduces the risk of conceptual bugs that often creep up in complicated SQL scripts.", "While we are on the topic of language comparison, let me quickly point out that Pig Latin has also been described to be rather similar to Python\u2019s Pandas \ud83d\udc3c. Such a comparison stems from the fact that both Pig Latin and Pandas are procedural languages. IMO, we shouldn\u2019t overstate the similarity of the two \u2014 Pandas is a much more powerful language equipped with extensive in-built functions and easy integration to Numpy and other Python tools. However, on the basic level, Pig Latin does have some overlap with Pandas.", "Certainly! In the table below, I have listed out common Pig Latin commands and their equivalents in SQL and Pandas. Do note that all there are lots and lots of variations to all these commands that can be invoked with different keywords and arguments, and the ones I show are just one possibility.", "Yep, that is my hope when I compiled that table \ud83d\ude07.", "Sure! I hope that our conversation has given insight into who I am and how I fit in the Hadoop ecosystem. Although I may no longer be the sexiest Big Data tool in the market, I am still widely used in the industry and academia. I hope you will take the time to learn to use me \ud83d\ude42.However, if you are pressed for time and want to simply master a single, Swiss-army-knife tool that can be applied to a wide range of Big Data problems, Spark might be your best bet.", "I hope you enjoyed the interview. In case you were wondering, I supplied both sides of the above dialogue. The personification of Apache Pig was intended to facilitate learning and this character does not in any way represent the opinions of the creators of Apache Pig.", "If you have any comments about the article or would like to reach out to me, feel free to send me a connection through LinkedIn. Also, I\u2019d be very grateful if you could support me by becoming a Medium member through my referral link. As a member, you\u2019ll be able to read all my writings on data science and personal development and have full access to all stories on Medium.", "Data Scientist @ DBS \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec.
