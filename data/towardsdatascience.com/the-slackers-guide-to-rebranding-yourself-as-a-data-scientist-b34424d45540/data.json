A common theme started to emerge: aspiring data scientists are confused about how to start, and some are drowning because of the overwhelming amount of information available in the wild. So, what\u2019s another, right?", "I urge aspiring data scientists to slow it down a bit and take a step back. Before we get to learning, let\u2019s take care of some business first: the fine art of reinventing yourself. Reinventing yourself takes time, so we better get started early on in the game.", "In this post, I will share a very opinionated approach to do-it-yourself rebranding as a data scientist. I will assume three things about you:", "I\u2019m a strong believer in Yoda\u2019s wisdom: \u201cDo or do not, there is no try.\u201d For me, either you do something or you don\u2019t. Failure for me was not an option, and I took comfort in knowing that I won\u2019t really fail unless I quit entirely. So first bit of advice: don\u2019t quit. Ever.", "Do or do not, there is no try. \u2014 Yoda", "Let\u2019s get our online affairs in order and start thinking about SEO. SEO stands for search engine optimization. The simplest way to think about is the very fine art of putting as much \u201cstuff\u201d as you can on the internet with your real professional name out there so that when somebody searches for you, all they will find are the stuff that you want them to find.", "In our case, we want the words \u201cdata science\u201d or \u201cdata scientist\u201d to appear whenever your name appears in the search results.", "So let\u2019s start littering the interweb!", "No kidding! When you\u2019re doing household chores, taking a walk, or maybe even while driving, listen to podcasts that talk about data science topics like Linear Digression and TwiML. Don\u2019t get too bogged down about committing what they say to memory. Just go along with the flow, and sooner or later, the terminology and concepts that they discuss will start to sound familiar. Just remember not to get too caught up with the discussions that you start burning whatever you\u2019re cooking or miss your exit like I have many times in the past.", "Now that we\u2019ve taken care of the preliminaries of living and breathing data science, it\u2019s time to take care of the meat and potatoes: actually learning about data science.", "There\u2019s no shortage of opinions about how to learn data science. There are so many of them that it can overwhelm you, especially when they start talking about learning the foundational math and statistics first.", "Tell me and I forget,teach me and I remember,involve me and I learn. \u2014 Old Chinese Adage\u00b9", "While important, I don\u2019t see the point of studying theory first when I may soon fall asleep or worst, get too intimidated by the onslaught of mathematical formulas that I get so exasperated, and ended up quitting!", "What I humbly propose, rather, is to employ the idea of \u201cminimum viable knowledge\u201d or MVK as described by Ken Jee in his article: How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over).", "In his article, Ken Jee describes minimum viable knowledge as learning \u201cjust enough to be able to learn through doing.\u201d\u00b2 I suggest checking it out:", "My approach to MVK is pretty straight-forward: learn just enough SQL to be able to get the data from a database, learn enough Python so that you could have program control and be able to use the pandas library, and then do end-to-end projects, from simple ones to increasingly more challenging ones. Along the way, you\u2019d learn about data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and modeling. Other techniques like cross-validation and grid search would surely be a part of your journey as well. The trick is never to get too comfortable and always push yourself slowly.", "To the list-oriented, here is my process:", "For a more in-depth discussion of the data science pipeline, I recommend the following article:", "For each iteration, I suggest doing an end-to-end project that practices each of these following data science methodologies:", "And for each methodology, practice its different algorithms, models, or techniques. For example, for natural language processing, you might want to practice these following techniques:", "As you do end-to-end projects, it\u2019s a good practice to push your work publicly on Github. Not only will it track your progress, but it also backups your work in case your local machine breaks down. Not to mention, it\u2019s a great way to showcase your progress. Note that I said progress, not perfection. Generally, people understand if our Github repositories are a little bit messy. In fact, most expect it. At a minimum, just make sure that you have a great README.md file for each repo.", "What to put on a Github Repo README.md:", "Don\u2019t ignore this note: don\u2019t make the big mistake or hard-coding your credentials or any passwords in your public code. Put them in an .env file and .gitignore them. For reference, check out this documentation from Github.", "For a great in-depth tutorial on how to use Git and Github, check out Anne Bonner\u2019s guide:", "And finally, as you get better with employing different techniques and you begin to do hyper-parameter tuning, I believe at this point that you\u2019re ready to face the necessary evil that is math. And more than likely, the more you understand and develop intuition, the less you\u2019ll hate it. And maybe, just maybe, you\u2019ll even grow to love it.", "I have one general recommendation when it comes to learning the math behind data science: take it slow. Be gentle on yourself and don\u2019t set deadlines. Again, there\u2019s no sense in being ambitious and tackling something monumental if it ends up driving you insane. There\u2019s just no fun in it.", "There are generally two approaches to learning math.", "One is to take the structured approach, which starts on learning the basics first and then incrementally take on the more challenging parts. For this I recommend KhanAcademy. Personalize your learning towards calculus, linear algebra, and statistics. Take small steps and celebrate small wins.", "The other approach is slightly geared for more hands-on involvement and takes a little bit of reverse engineering. I call it learning backward. You start with finding out what math concept is involved in a project and breaking down that concept into more basic ideas and go from there. This approach is better suited for those who prefer to learn by doing.", "A good example of learning by doing is illustrated by a post on Analytics Vidhya:", "Well, learning math sure is hard! It\u2019s so powerful and intense that you\u2019d better take a break often or risk overheating your brain. On the other hand, taking a break does not necessarily mean taking a day off. After all, there is no rest for the weary!", "Every once in a while, I strongly recommend supplementing your technical studies with a little bit of understanding the business side of things. For this, I suggest the classic book: Thinking with Data by Max Shron. You can also find a lot of articles here on Medium.", "For example, check out Eric Kleppen\u2019s article:", "Taking a break can be lonely sometimes, and being alone with only your thoughts can be exhausting. So you may decide to finally talk with your family, the problem is, you\u2019re so motivated and gung-ho about data science that it\u2019s all you can talk about. Sooner or later, you\u2019re going to annoy your loved ones.", "This is why I decided to talk to other people with similar interests. I went on Meetups and started networking with people who are either already practicing data science or people like you who are aspiring to be a data scientist as well. In this post-COVID (hopefully) age that we\u2019re in, having group video calls are more prevalent. This is actually more beneficial because now, geography won\u2019t be an issue anymore.", "A good resource to start is LinkedIn. You can use the social network to find others with similar interests or even find local data scientists who can still spare an hour or two every month to mentor motivated learners. Start with companies in your local municipality. Find out if they have a data scientist that works there, and if you do find one, kindly send them a personalized message with a request to connect. Give them the option to refuse gracefully and just ask them to repoint or recommend you to another person who does have the time to mentor.", "The worst that can happen is they said no. No hard feelings, eh?", "Thanks for reading! This concludes my very opinionated advice on rebranding yourself as a data scientist. I hope you got something out of it. I welcome any feedback. If you have something you\u2019d like to add, please post it in the comments or responses.", "If you\u2019d like to connect with me, you can reach me on Twitter or LinkedIn. I love to connect, and I do my best to respond to inquiries as they come.", "Stay tuned, and see you in the next post!", "If you want to learn more about my journey from slacker to data scientist, check out the article below:", "Your home for data science.
