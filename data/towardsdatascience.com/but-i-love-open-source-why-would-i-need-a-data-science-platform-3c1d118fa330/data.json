A few lines of R or Python code will suffice for such endeavor and there\u2019s a plethora of resources and tutorials online to even train a complex neural network. The best part: this the case for virtually every single AI algorithm you could think of, while almost every new advance in AI research is usually accompanied by their corresponding open source implementation.", "However, as I previously discussed in this article, AI turns out to be much more than building models. The journey, as a matter of fact, goes all the way from data collection, curation, exploration, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and finally, deployment.", "The Hadoop ecosystem seems to be the to-go choice from the open source to collect and aggregate different data sources. Hive and HBase fit the bill for accessing, mixing, and matching multiple sources of data. Now, for data preparation (i.e., curation, exploration, and feature engineering), Apache Spark can be really useful to slice and dice large datasets through SparkSQL, even leveraging in-memory processing to speed up response times. Spark also gives you natural language processing (NLP) capabilities and feature extractors such as principal component analysis (PCA). But probably the strongest suit of the open source is its massive variety of AI models. scikit-learn, R, SparkML, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, among others, provide everything I \u2014 and any of my data scientist fellows \u2014 could ever dream of. Finally, tools like Docker and Plumbr ease the deployment of machine learning models in the form of web services consumable through HTTP requests.", "So wait a second\u2026 does that mean that one could build an enterprise-ready end-to-end AI system solely using the open source stack? Not really.", "This may be the case for building a proof of concept (POC). Back in 2012, as part of my dissertation, I built a Human Activity Recognition system (including this mobile app) purely under the umbrella of the open source \u2014 thank you Java, Weka, Android, and PostgreSQL! For the enterprise, nevertheless, the story is quite a bit different.", "And don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not only a big fan but an avid user of open source myself and I do realize there are so many fantastic tools; but at the same time, there are quite a few gaps. Let me share some of the reasons why enterprises invest in AI platforms. And, let me do so by telling you some of my most painful moments as an ML and AI practitioner.", "Last time I tried to install TensorFlow in my machine, it broke my Apache Spark configuration. Few minutes later, when I thought I had fixed Spark, I realized TensorFlow was toast. Again!", "Long story short: it took me an entire afternoon to get these two beasts up and running. Imagine how many things could go wrong when so many other tools need to coexist within a Data Scientist\u2019s working environment: Jupyter, R, Python, XGboost, Hadoop, Spark, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Docker, Plumbr, and the list goes on and on. Now consider that all of these tools have new releases every other month so frequent updates will be needed. Did someone say conflicts? Ugh! Let a platform handle that for me.", "Now I\u2019m working with my team of three data scientists. We\u2019re using our favorite Jupyter+Python+Spark+TensorFlow environment and decided to create a GitHub repository to share our code and data assets. But I\u2019m using custom packages on my environment \u2014 which took me a while to install and configure \u2014 and my colleagues can\u2019t access them. They will have to go through the same pain I endured and install the packages on their own machines. Okay, but then, how do we share our deployed models? Creating Docker images or PMML files don\u2019t sound sexy at all! And how about sharing our predictions, experiments, and evaluations (confusion matrices, ROC curves, RMS, etc.)? Ugh! Let the platform handle that for me.", "One of the most common challenges in the enterprise is that datasets are scattered across multiple systems. A typical solution is to copy data over into central data stores \u2014 there you have your data lake \u2014 for running your favorite analytics. However, this approach is clearly costly and error prone.", "Data virtualization allows to query data across many systems without any replication, simplifying the data collection pipeline.", "The open source doesn\u2019t offer a data virtualization solution. So again, let\u2019s have the platform handle that for us.", "This is a key concern for the enterprise and also an area where the open source leaves a huge void. Assets need governance and I\u2019m not only referring to the data but also to the code, models, predictions, environments, and experiments! Should all data scientists know what criteria are used to approve/deny a loan to a customer? Or what factors contribute to flagging a transaction as potentially fraudulent? Certainly not! And how about limiting resource utilization for each user? Let the platform handle that for us.", "What good is an AI model with perfect quality if it\u2019s only sitting on my laptop? A model is useless unless it\u2019s running as a service delivering predictions and being consumed by end users.", "In this article I describe how to build an auto-completion system for Github work items\u2014 in other words, predict the squad, assignee, etc., given a work item title as free text. Building the model (including data preparation) took me nearly two weeks. But the deployment took my colleagues over a month, having to create docker images of the models to later use plumbr to hook things up. Would I want to go through that again every time I create a new model? No, thank you! And how about keeping track of different model versions? Or statistics about each model\u2019s performance? How to detect model degradation? Or automating the entire retraining process every so often to assure the models are current? Let the platform do it for me!", "Imagine a data scientist used gender or age as predictors for credit risk. And, the generated model is assigning higher risk to a certain gender. This is not only unethical, but also illegal in most jurisdictions. How do you detect whether a model is gender biased? And if so, how to correct such bias without having to rebuild the model? Learn more about bias detection and correction here. And again, let the platform do it for me!", "One of my colleagues often jokes with me and blatantly tells me I\u2019m not actually a data scientist but a data janitor, given how much time I spend scrubbing the data.", "Sadly, he\u2019s spot on as up to 80% of the time and effort in a data science project is often devoted to data curation and preparation. And let\u2019s face it, data curation tools from the open source, including Spark, involve heavy coding which can be very tedious. But what if there was a visual tool which allowed to clean and refine multiple data sources without having to write a single line of code? Yes, let the platform do it for me!", "Computational power has increased tremendously in the past decade, with remarkable advancements in graphical processing units (GPUs); this is especially beneficial for deep learning algorithms. Now, configuring frameworks such as TensorFlow/Keras for optimal performance can be a project in itself, requiring technical knowledge that\u2019s not in the background of a typical data scientist \u2014 including myself. Once again, let the platform handle that for me!", "Many statisticians, data analysts, and even managers may be interested in building machine learning models despite them not being proficient coding in languages such as Python and R. Tools such as SPSS have been providing visual interfaces to ML and AI for decades, which can now be leveraged on the cloud. In other words:", "Drag and drop your dataset, then your favorite data prep and modeling algorithms, and finally deploy your models without writing a single line of code.", "There\u2019s also a plain void in the open source when it comes to visual modeling, thus, let the platform provide it for me.", "Our role as data scientists has a big mechanical component of iteratively trying different algorithms, hyperparameters, feature combinations, etc. But what if we had it automated, including the experimentation as well, i.e., cross validation, confusion matrices, ROC curves, precision-recall curves, etc. Oh yes, please have the platform do that for me!", "In a quest for an AI platform that leverages the open source but fills in all the gaps above? Try Watson Studio for free!", "Interested in a comprehensive Data and AI solution? Take a look at IBM Cloud Pak for Data.", "\u00d3scar D.
