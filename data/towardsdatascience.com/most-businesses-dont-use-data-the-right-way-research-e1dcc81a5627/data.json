And since demand for data scientists outpaces supply, many companies will pay six figures to lure top talent.", "But all that glitters isn\u2019t gold: More than half of data scientists say they plan to look for new roles in 2020.", "When asked for the reasons behind their discontent, 44 percent cited bureaucracy and 29 percent blamed lack of support from leadership. Both answers outpaced complaints about lacking the right tools for data science, which earned 28 percent of the vote.", "These results are sad, but not surprising. Despite demand for data scientists, most businesses still haven\u2019t laid the groundwork to help them succeed.", "Last year, GetApp surveyed nearly 500 employees at North American businesses with 500 or fewer employees. We wanted to learn how they use data to make business decisions, and how confident (or not) they are in doing so. We also wanted to learn if having tools and colleagues that are devoted to data increases confidence in business decision-making.", "Perhaps unsurprisingly, results varied by sector. Our respondents who worked in accounting were most likely to use Excel for collecting and analyzing data. But they also have the most trouble identifying insights from data. This makes sense as accountants also reported not having the right amount of data to find such insights; instead, many said that they either have too much or too little data to make impactful choices.", "Meanwhile, respondents who worked in healthcare had the highest utilization rate of the data that\u2019s available to them. But of the five industries surveyed, healthcare had the lowest levels of confidence when it comes to making data-based decisions. They cited needing certain types of data (like customer satisfaction scores) to improve outcomes.", "Other results were more ubiquitous. Across the five sectors surveyed, we found:", "Two things struck me as I reviewed these results. The first is that investing in tools and employees who collect and analyze business data improves outcomes. The businesses that feel most comfortable with data are the same ones that create roles devoted to owning it. They also invest in software and other data science tools for their employees to use.", "That said, it is equally important for businesses to decentralize their data. This involves giving each team leader the autonomy to use data within their domain. Whether you manage a sales team or a hospital, leaders across all lines of business should be empowered to boost their teams\u2019 outcomes using data.", "That\u2019s what it means to be a citizen data scientist: Using BI software features like drag-and-drop models to explain data\u2019s relevance to your team and the bigger business.", "Unlike data scientists, which are often expensively recruited from elsewhere, citizen data scientists are already part of your business. As a result, they bring deep knowledge of your tech stack, strategy, and customer pain points to each data visualization they create.", "Citizen data scientists aren\u2019t just nice to have, nor are they intended to replace trained data scientists. They bring their own unique value to your business, and are equally essential as data scientists.", "This bears repeating since it\u2019s no longer enough for one employee to own all data-based decisions \u2014 or for your business to avoid investing in the tools, training, and employees who can take your data usage to the next level.", "If you want to make better decisions in your business, you\u2019ll need to apply analytics and some form of BI. If that\u2019s your commitment heading into 2020, here are several steps you can take:", "Clarify how data grows your business in one or two written sentences. The more specific you can be, the better. It\u2019s not enough to say, \u201cOur company will give all teams the tools and training they need to make data-based decisions.\u201d", "\u201cOur CTO will enable all team leads to access data within [BI/analytics software of choice]. This will empower everyone to achieve our shared business goal of increasing customer satisfaction scores by 10% in 2020.\u201d", "Don\u2019t put pressure on yourself to keep this mission statement static. You can review and update it as roles and business needs evolve.", "The key is to always keep it focused on desired business outcomes. Connecting data analysis back to the big picture will train everyone to use it more thoughtfully.", "To successfully use data, you\u2019ll need to connect the right types and amounts of data back to business problems that you can solve with it. So, you should base your strategy on data management and analytics practices that support specific business goals.", "Once you\u2019ve written your data mission statement, start building a roadmap to track your progress towards achieving it. This roadmap will show the initiatives you\u2019ll take to achieve your mission statement, and your plan for executing that work. It will also let you compare new requests for data use against your current plan.", "Your data roadmap\u2019s key goals are to build business-wide consensus for:", "Like your mission statement, this roadmap isn\u2019t static: It will evolve along with your business needs and data usage. The key is to use it as a north star for understanding how your business makes decisions based on data. If you and your colleagues know the value that data serves, you can use it to find more effective insights.", "Unite all leaders in your organization by building a steering committee for data usage. Leaders for the overall business, tech strategy, and specific lines of business (sales, marketing, etc.) should all have seats on this committee. It will set priorities for data usage, approve funding for new BI tools and initiatives, resolve resource conflicts, and find new opportunities to use data in the business.", "One person (such as the Chief Technology Officer, or ideally a Chief Digital/Data Officer) should serve as the committee\u2019s Chair. In doing so, they will need to consider the size of this committee relative to business size.", "A smaller committee will be able to schedule meetings faster and more often, along with resolving problems more quickly. But if you exclude leaders of key business units, you\u2019ll risk losing buy-in across your organization.", "To alleviate this, commit to having one leader per line of business serve on the committee. This includes the person who oversees the company\u2019s system architecture, and those responsible for source systems that feed the analytics environment.", "Plan to meet at least once per quarter. Your goal is not to create more work for every leader, yourself included. Rather, you\u2019ll want to show every committee member how invaluable data is to their work, and how this committee will improve all of their outcomes.", "The amount of data created today, coupled with the growth of BI and analytics software, means that old ways of analysis won\u2019t cut it. Tools like Excel, while powerful and useful, were not built to handle the vast volume of data that\u2019s available today. And data\u2019s relevance to all lines of business means it can no longer sit in one C-suite leader\u2019s domain.", "The problem is that the road to becoming a \u201cdata-driven organization\u201d is long and winding. From investing in the wrong BI tool to not knowing which data points are used to solve each problem, it can seem like the risks of using data are too high. The truth is, you can\u2019t afford not to use data \u2014 and laying some groundwork eases a lot of pain points.", "By writing a mission statement, creating a roadmap, and building cross-functional consensus, your own business can avoid most pitfalls and use data to keep growing. You might even be able to hire a coveted data scientist \u2014 and keep them from running out the door.", "Lauren Maffeo leads business intelligence research at GetApp, which matches software shoppers with the right tools and technologies to grow their businesses. As an analyst, Lauren\u2019s areas of interest include speech and natural language tools, data mining techniques, predictive analytics, and building a business case for data science. She has presented her research on bias in AI at Princeton and Columbia Universities, Twitter\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, and Google DevFest DC, among others.
