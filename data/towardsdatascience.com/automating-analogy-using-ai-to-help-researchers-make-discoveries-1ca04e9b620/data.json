One of the authors, Vahe Tshitoyan, also published an overview\u00b2 of the work on Medium. Specifically, they showed that new thermoelectric materials could be discovered by mining scientific journals.", "I think this is an interesting use of the well-known word embeddings technique. With word embeddings, we look to create vector representations for important words in a document. Once vectorized, these words can be used with the usual vector operations from linear algebra. Thus we can add and subtract words to find results that match our intuition. The common example is \u201cking\u201d minus \u201cqueen\u201d approximately equals \u201cman\u201d minus \u201cwoman\u201d.", "Vectorized words also allow us to match words that are similar in some latent sense. For example, Father and Mother would be closer to each other than is chicken and money. This means word vectors can be used to capture complex concepts without explicitly encoding those concepts.", "I thought this would make for a great application. A tool people could use to search for terms relevant to their research. The tool would return recently published articles across a variety of domains that contained words similar to the user\u2019s search term.", "Importantly, the similarity is \u201canalogy-driven\u201d in that the connection being made is not something that would be obvious from casual observation. It is not the same word being found in the other articles, rather the other articles are merely discussing something in a similar context. In the Nature article referenced above, new thermoelectric materials could be discovered because other papers were discussing something in a similar way to how people discuss thermoelectric materials; but the word thermoelectric was not mentioned in the other articles.", "To understand what word embeddings are doing in this application we have to grasp how they relate to the concept of analogy. I\u2019ve written about the power of analogies before\u2075, and I highly recommend the work of Douglas Hofstadter.", "With word vectors, we see linear behavior, e.g.\u201cwoman is to queen as man is to king\u201d. These have been shown to underlie the analogical phenomenon\u2074.", "In reference 4 they show that the factorisation of the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) matrix causes linear analogical structure in embeddings. From a probability perspective, word sets paraphrase one another when they induce equivalent distributions over so-called context words. The authors extend this to analogies by showing that \u201cparaphrases\u201d correspond to analogies via word transformations.", "Going into the mathematical details is beyond the scope of this article. Please ask me if you want to discuss the mathematics behind analogy in more detail. I encourage having these conversations on Twitter, so others can benefit.", "\u201cContext\u201d is the words before and after a statement that influence its meaning. When we make an analogy between 2 different domains we are recognizing some latent similarity.", "\u201cYou shall know a word by the company it keeps\u201d \u2014 Firth", "This is how discoveries are made all the time. Humans draw links between seemingly disparate areas by becoming aware of some latent connection between them. Only through reading the works of other authors can this connection be made.", "But how likely are researchers to read papers outside their own domain? Between reading papers in their own field, teaching and writing grants, not very likely.", "How often are researchers likely to review papers outside their domain?", "This means the wealth of potential connections that could be made between a researcher\u2019s work and other publications is largely untapped. If AI can provide a way to automatically discover analogical connections between a variety of domains this could be quite useful. Turning this capability into a product could help both academic and independent researchers make discoveries they might otherwise miss.", "With this as our motivation, let\u2019s piece together a product that helps researchers make connections between their works and a number of disparate STEM fields.", "Note: I don\u2019t purport that the application in this article is making genuine discoveries. At best the application might point researchers in an interesting direction based on a contextually-similar area outside their domain. See False Narratives section at end.", "The final application looks like this:", "I will cover the high-level approach used to create the application. I use both Doc2Vec and Word2Vec provided by the gensim\u00b3 library .The full application is available on Github. Readers can clone the project to use and/or modify. Please reach out to me for any assistance needed.", "The back-end of the application uses a Node/Express web service to enable communication between the back and front end. Figure 1 shows the user flow as it relates to back-end processing.", "The user first chooses one of the 6 domains from the dropdowns. These are 6 common STEM fields. Once they choose their domain (and a subfield) they are directed to fill in a number of search terms. This would be \u201cthermoelectric\u201d in the example used in reference 1.", "Users can list multiple search terms, separated by a space. Once they have listed their terms they RUN DOC2VEC, at which point our back-end retrieves the most recently published arXiv articles across all 6 domains, creates document vectors for each article and returns the top 5 based on relevance to the user\u2019s search terms.", "At this point, the user can review the returned articles, looking for interesting conversations. Again, the idea is that these returned articles may be discussing work in a similar context to how the user\u2019s search terms are often discussed (the words in these returned articles are \u201ckeeping the same company\u201d as the user\u2019s search terms).", "Let\u2019s begin to support this user flow by getting the topics from arXiv.", "We need to get all the topics available in arXiv.org. Rather than set up a back-end scrape, I\u2019ll just use client-side JavaScript in the browser console since arXiv is unlikely to add new topics frequently.", "We can look to arXiv\u2019s analytics page and scrape the titles and naming codes there. I wrote the following JavaScript to scrape what\u2019s needed:", "We run this in the browser console for each of the 6 domains. Each domain is accessed by clicking the light blue titles at the top of the page:", "Doing this for each domain provides 6 JSON files. The following figure shows a snippet of the expected structure:", "We can use these to populate our dropdowns, and assist in our scraping of the actual articles. I add these to the data folder in the application:", "We can increase the quality of our results by filtering out any non-English words/symbols that might appear in the arXiv papers. I\u2019ll use this list of 50 English words:", "I will copy and paste these words into a file called word.txt and place this into the data folder. These will be used when we run Word2Vec.", "When the user clicks RUN DOC2VEC we first need to scrape the articles on arXiv. This means fetching each article for the domain chosen and creating document vectors. We can get the links of each article by using the Node.js package cheerio. This code is in the scrape_arxiv.js file.", "We target the .list-identifier class and qualify on href to retrieve the URLs of each element. This saves a file called domain_1.json, which holds all the words across all 25 documents, as shown in Figure 2.", "This will be read by the Doc2Vec function (and cleaned using words.txt) in order to create document vectors and find (infer) the closest matching documents to the user\u2019s search term. Let\u2019s write that now.", "We use gensim\u2019s Doc2Vec method, which expects a dict object from the JSON we read in as domain_1.json.", "You can inspect the project on GitHub to see how our API returns these results to the front-end. Now that the user has relevant documents returned we can support the 2nd piece of the user flow.", "In PART 1 the user was able to review returned articles. This allowed them to find potentially useful discussions related by context to their own work. However reading entire articles is still time-consuming, especially when the \u201cconnection\u201d made may be largely superfluous. To help identify whether the article is worth reading, we can attempt to uncover which words in this article are most similar to the user\u2019s search terms. If any of these returned words seem relevant to the user the article may be worth exploring further.", "In Part 2 we scrape the article the user chose (out of the 5 returned), use gensim\u2019s fastText (originally from Facebook) to generate word vectors, and infer the closest words to the user\u2019s search terms from Part 1. This flow is supported as shown in Figure 3.", "Let\u2019s create the Word2Vec function now.", "Now that we have the closest-matching documents to the user\u2019s search term, we want to run Word2Vec on a single paper. Whatever paper the user chooses will be processed by gensim\u2019s Word2Vec method, via fastText, to find the most relevant words.", "As with the returned documents in Part 1, you can review the application\u2019s codebase to see how these results are returned to the front-end.", "Let\u2019s open the application and run a few experiments to see what we find.", "Move into the directory and start the REST API:", "Start a simple web server from the terminal:", "You should see the application\u2019s starting state:", "Let\u2019s run some trials. Can we find interesting new research ideas from our a set of chosen search terms? The idea is to see if the word embeddings behave consistently with our intuition.", "Perhaps I want to discover a new approach to optimization for my research in molecular dynamics. I don\u2019t know anything about quantitative finance, or its sub-field portfolio management, but perhaps people in this area are attempting something similar to my work, despite not working on anything directly related to physics or chemistry.", "I choose portfolio management from the quantitative finance dropdown, and fill in my 6 search terms.", "The user can list any number of search terms they wish, even just one.", "The papers returned in order of relevance:", "I can review the papers shown in the application:", "The papers are definitely talking about optimization, and appear to mention things related to dynamics. Let\u2019s run Word2Vec on our top paper to home-in on the specific discussions related to our search terms:", "The words reduced, order, strategies and filter may be worth looking into. Again, these are the words returned by Word2Vec, suggesting they are contextually involved in some discussion related to my search terms. Let\u2019s inspect the paper closer to see if this is the case.", "The word \u201creduced\u201d refers to the paper\u2019s use of a so-called reduced control model. This comes from Control Theory, which is a subfield of mathematics that deals with influencing the behavior of dynamical systems. Dynamical systems have connections to Systems Chemistry, which is the science of studying networks of interacting molecules and their emergent properties. A major goal of Systems Chemistry is to unveil complex reactions networks, where molecules continuously consume energy to perform specific functions.", "The economic model is dealing with multiple business lines and dependence between them. They are trying to maximize the utility of wealth by creating a model with parameters that are learned via optimization. That optimization is driven by Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation (HJB), where derivatives are replaced by generalized Clarke gradients.", "HJB equations have been used to study \u201cchemical waves\u201d, where information is spread rapidly throughout reaction-diffusion systems in order to synchronize and coordinate biological events.", "By doing a little research online we have been able to make a connection between the word \u201creduced\u201d and our interest in molecular dynamics. This is because the word vector for \u201creduced\u201d, which appears in our most relevant document, sits \u201cclose\u201d to our search terms; optimization, energy, quantum, systems, dynamics, and adiabatic. Upon looking deeper we quickly realized that the word \u201creduced\u201d was indeed being discussed in the context of optimization. This appears to be an example of our word vectors capturing useful concepts without explicitly encoding those concepts.", "Remember that our most relevant documents were also discovered using embeddings, by way of document vectors. By layering both Doc2Vec and Word2Vec together we can make interesting and relevant connections between disparate areas of research.", "This is the power of using automated analogy to make connections between areas we might never think to link together. It\u2019s a nice example of augmenting the way people already work, by using \u201cintelligent\u201d machines that operate in a similar fashion.", "But, is it really worth exploring the use of the HJB equation matched with Clarke gradients, as used by the authors of an economics journal, to learn the parameters in an optimization applied to complex chemical systems? Maybe.", "Or maybe I know (believe) from the onset this isn\u2019t viable. But going down these kinds of paths, encouraged by automated analogies, can\u2019t do much harm. I only tried the first word, of the first relevant paper, of one area, in the first STEM domain I attempted.", "At the very least this application makes me reconsider my current research approach with respect to what others are doing. This may trigger yet new insights or force me to search down different paths. It might remind me of something I\u2019ve read in another journal, prompting me to revisit certain concepts. Making even loose connections between domains helps provoke us away from myopic thinking.", "I would be remiss not to bring up a fundamental issue that plagues humans anytime we \u201cfind\u201d something interesting. It is easy to see what we want, thinking there are connections when there are in fact none. We have to be careful not to assign too much weight to something that appears interesting but is, in fact, irrelevant or impractical.", "Thus when we make connections we should remain skeptical that anything relevant has been found. The beauty of science (when done properly) is that any new idea must be tested against the rigor of falsifiability, and demonstrably validate that it indeed holds water.", "Your home for data science.
