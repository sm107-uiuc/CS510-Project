He made major contributions to group theory and game theory, but is probably best known in the wider world for his Game of Life. The Game of Life is a simple, yet fascinating, cellular automata exercise that ended up developing something of a life of its own, far beyond what Conway expected.", "The Game of Life takes place on a grid, with certain cells being marked \u2018alive\u2019 or \u2018active\u2019 and others being marked \u2018dead\u2019 or \u2018inactive\u2019.", "The initial condition of the grid is set by the player, but after that, the grid evolves according to set rules:", "1. If a cell that is currently inactive has exactly three live neighbors, it is activated as if by reproduction in the next turn.", "2. If a live cell has fewer than two live neighbors, it dies as if by underpopulation", "3. If a live cell has more than three active neighbors, it dies as if by overpopulation", "4. A live cell with two or three live neighbors persists into the next turn", "Simple as the Game of Life is \u2014 Conway chose the rules specifically with keeping them as simple as possible while satisfying other conditions in mind \u2014 it has proven to be an enduringly fascinating framework, basically launching the field of cellular automatons. Of the interesting, even incredible, features of the Game is that it can be proven to be Turing Complete, and accordingly people have \u2018programmed\u2019 things in the Game \u2014 a digital clock, a working version of Tetris, the Game of Life itself.", "Last week, as something of an ironic tribute to Conway (he was on the record as saying that he didn\u2019t think his Game of Life was all that interesting and expressed a bit of dissatisfaction at the thought that that might be all he was recognized for), I played around with programming my own implementations of the Game of Life. I realized that the Game might actually be a useful exercise in visualization and user interaction for anyone working with data graphics \u2014 the rules of the Game are simple enough that even new entrants should be able to get them down in code, but the problem of how the user efficiently sets up the board at the beginning isn\u2019t typical of the sort of interactive visualizations most common in the data science world.", "There are quite a few ways for a user to interact with the board during the initial setup, but allowing the user to select an arbitrary number of points on the board isn\u2019t a problem well solved with a slider or drop down menu. One solution uses the common graphing library Matplotlib, which has interactive features allowing users to click on the plot that many new users might not know about, but it\u2019s not clear that this is the easiest or most efficient solution. With that in mind, I\u2019d like to present Conway\u2019s Game of Life as something of a small, practical case study in interactive visuals and suggest a couple of possible solutions. These are by no means all of the solutions, and I present this as something of a challenge to find the simplest way for a user to set up an arbitrary grid as efficiently as possible in a way that requires as few external libraries as possible.", "Step 1: setting up the Game", "The first thing I did was to create a simple object oriented version of the rules. I created a new class corresponding with a cell in the game, with attributes corresponding to its position on the grid and its status as well as a method that updates the status of the cell according to the rules of the Game. These objects may look something like this:", "If you\u2019re pretty comfortable working in Python, this method may seem a little overly complicated to you. Why create a whole class of objects at all? You could just as easily represent the grid as one Numpy array of ones and zeros have one function that updates the grid according to the rules of the Game. Well, for a couple of reasons. One is that I had in mind that the implementation of the Game\u2019s internal logic should not refer to any external libraries at all, to make no assumptions about what packages an end user would have installed and if possible to have the entire thing programmed to run without anything someone would need to install separately. My first implementation used a library called Curses, which actually comes installed with Python on Mac OS, to visualize the grid so it shouldn\u2019t require anything other than Python 3 to run for many people.", "Another reason is related to personal preferences about code organization. I wanted a standard way to implement the rules and update the grid that would work in the same way regardless of what I was using to input the starting grid or display the visuals. Your mileage may vary depending on what sort of structures you find most convenient to work with, but I have found this approach to simplify debugging my code.", "Anyways, regardless of your method, actually simulating the Game of Life is pretty straightforward: define the rules, create your grid of objects with certain cells turned \u2018on\u2019, update the cell statuses and iterate for successive turns. The more interesting question is how to build in a simple input method so that regardless of the grid\u2019s size a user can easily input the starting conditions. You could ask for some number of coordinates to be entered in, but this is cumbersome, particularly with larger grids, so it would be preferable to find some other input method.", "If your main interaction with Matplotlib is viewing static outputs in a notebook, you may not actually realize that Matplotlib has the ability to take in interactive inputs and even trace mouse movements built in. Running a Python script from the command line will open up your plots in their own Python window through which you can interact with the plots, so long as you tell Matplotlib when to expect certain inputs and what to do with them once they arrive.", "For a simple point and click interface, you can use the function .ginput(), which will collect the coordinates on the plot of a clicked inputs. A simple use might be something like this, where you can mouse over and click any of the cells to activate them, or click them again to deactivate them:", "In this case, I am using a Numpy array to represent the board, both for the easy indexing and also because you can turn an array into a plot in one line using Martplotlib\u2019s imshow, which reads the values in the array as coding display colors. The code to produce a simple grid and track which points have been selected looks something like this:", "The list of start up points can then be fed into a function which initializes your grid of Conway cell objects (or you can simply use the Numpy array of ones and zeros) and the future rounds of the game can be calculated and graphed from there.", "I encourage anyone who wasn\u2019t previously familiar with the interactive features of Matplotlib to play around with them. They open up a range of interesting possibilities, toggling or selecting data, changing visualization style and even inputing new data without the need to set up an external dashboard. This method worked well, and it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a lot of potential for using these features of Matplotlib more generally, but I wasn\u2019t entirely satisfied. This method, too, can start to become cumbersome for larger grids or more elaborate starting conditions. There was also a bit of a lag between the input and the graphical response I found a little frustrating, so I\u2019m continuing to look for other interesting methods of graphical input.", "Input Method 2: fun with Curses!", "Curses, the library I mentioned earlier, presents another, fun solution. Curses lets you control the output of characters into the terminal window. It\u2019s more of quirky throwback, creating fun sort of ASCII like representations, rather than a serious graphing library, but, it\u2019s highly responsive and as I mentioned, comes built in for many people.", "Besides the inherent fun of figuring out how to get my Game of Life to work in Curses, I ended up thinking that tools like Curse may actually provide some useful methods. I came away ready to explore other interesting and little used packages for my data science work.", "Curses lets you place characters anywhere on the available screen, in a way that\u2019s pretty straightforward, though there are a few quirks to bear in mind. First, you need to actually check how big the screen is before you place anything. If the user expands the terminal window, the size of the canvas Curses has to work with will expand. Second, Curses indexes the screen from the top down, something of a holdover from standard printing, where the thing on top of the page gets printed out first. Lastly, Curses collects the locations of any characters you want to add to the screen or want to change, but it won\u2019t actually visualize any of the changes until you tell it to refresh the screen and it won\u2019t change any portion of the screen you don\u2019t explicitly tell it to. If you don\u2019t clear the screen any characters there will persist until they are written over.", "The code for the input page of my Curses Game of Life implementation looks something like this:", "Notice it collects the location of all the toggled cells in a dictionary, which I can then easily pass to a function to initialize the Game of Life simulation. I\u2019ve started to think that maybe that visuals in the terminal might not be a bad way to pass information like coordinates in general and am thinking about other ways to use it.", "As a tribute to the great John Conway, consider playing around with your own implementations of the Game of Life, thinking about sets or just generally creatively innovating in your own way.", "Your home for data science.
