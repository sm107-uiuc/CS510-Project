Poll results are closely watched by voters, journalists and, of course, candidates and their campaigns. An increases in poll standings can help a campaign build momentum, solidify support and spur fundraising. Decreases can have the opposite effects.", "As this is being written in May 2019, the U.S. is in the early stages of the 2020 presidential election, and there are already some 20 Democratic candidates vying to earn their party\u2019s nomination and face the likely Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Understanding poll drivers is of keen interest to these candidates, their supporters and opponents and to neutral observers.", "One driver is media reporting and in this post, I explore the relationship between press coverage and poll results by studying the 2016 Republican presidential primary contest. That primary has some similarities to today\u2019s Democratic race particularly in the large candidate field, it might prove to be a source of useful insights.", "The approach is to build a data set consists of poll results and key press-coverage metrics and themes from 2015 and 2016, a period in which the primary election process trimmed a large candidate field down to one winner, Donald Trump. Using these data, we can then explore relationships.", "To conduct this analysis both polling and press-coverage data are required. These were collected from two different sources, FiveThirtyEight, and the Global Data on Events, Language and Tone or GDELT project.", "FiveThirtyEight is an analytical service with a popular website that provides quantitative and statistical analysis of politics, sports, science and health, economics and culture.", "Polling data from the 2015/2016 Republican presidential primary were obtained from a specific FiveThirtyEight page using web scraping objects built on Selenium and Beautiful Soup tools. They cover 670 polls between Jan 25, 2015 and May 3, 2016 with results for 11 candidates (Donald Trump, John Kasich, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, Rick Santorum, Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee).", "GDELT is supported by Google Jigsaw and is a project thats monitors, stores and provides \u201cthe world\u2019s broadcast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every country.\u201d GDELT manages several repositories, but for this project, data were pulled from the Global Knowledge Graph Version 2 (GKG V2) database. Specifically, the GDELT CKG values for document counts, tone, positive and negative scores, polarity, activity reference density and self reference density and a compilation of article themes were captured for articles related to the primary candidates.", "GDELT data are available via text APIs and as a public dataset on Google\u2019s BigQuery big data service. For this work, I used BigQuery and accessed the database through the Python API available from Google. CKG V2 is massive at 9.85 terabytes (TB) and about 935 million rows. Working with such a large dataset meant that I first had to write relevant press data to another, much smaller, BigQuery table and then query it to construct modeling data in Python\u2019s pandas library. This smaller table had roughly 5.4 million rows where rows represent CKG V2 entries over the polling period related to the aforementioned candidates.", "With 11 candidates and a range of features, there are many visualization charts that might reveal interesting relationships. It\u2019s probably most useful to start with longitudinal views of poll results and press coverage metrics for individual candidates. For example, we can look at the poll results and article counts for Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.", "Article counts show an interesting pattern with coverage at relatively low levels during the early part of the campaign and then rapidly increasing in the final few months. Poll results have trend components and appear to show variation. In reality, they are mostly range bound around the trend line for considerable time periods (in other words, they bounce around the same value).", "It is also help to compare similar measures horizontally across candidates. In the next two charts, we see the average poll results versus article counts and the average poll results versus average of the article-tone averages for all candidates.", "The alignment of the points in first chart confirms what might be an intuitive observation in that higher poll numbers are associated with greater press coverage.", "GDELT captures several metrics for each CKG V2 document including a measure of its average \u201ctone.\u201d Tone is calculated as the difference between positive and negative scores which represent the percentage of positive and negative words respectively. In the following chart, we examine the relationship between average poll results and averages of the tone average.", "Here there is much less of a distinguishable pattern, but it is interesting to see Trump as a notable outlier on this scale with the lowest average tone yet the highest poll average.", "GDELT also tracks polarity for each document. It measures the percentage of words that are matched in a tonal dictionary as an indicator of how much the text is \u201cemotionally polarized or charged.\u201d Higher values are associated with greater polarization. Plotting the average poll results against the average of the polarity average reveals interesting groupings along the polarity dimension. Paul, Cruz, Huckabee and Trump are in group for which press seems to be highly polarized.", "A natural question is can these press data predict future poll performance. To address this question, I constructed a classification modeling framework in which the target variable is performance in future polls and the explanatory features are the press data collected from GDELT.", "The target variable consisted of three classes, down, flat and up, corresponding to whether a particular candidate\u2019s poll results decreased, remained flat or increased between two polls of interest. In my analysis, I modeled performance in the next poll and the third-poll out, but any number of poll periods could be examined. Explanatory features included GDELT\u2019s document counts, metrics as well as a listing of document themes.", "Using these data to create predictive models of future poll performance proved to be challenging. In general, this analysis found broad press metrics averaged across a wide candidate field provide little power in predicting performance in upcoming polls. The accuracy of these models were not much better than the baseline distribution of down, flat and up observations.", "Several model configurations were explored including predicting the performance in a future poll (in this case the third poll out) and limiting the data set to a single candidate. These models exhibited improved accuracy and suggest that such approaches could yield results. More work is needed.", "For those who are interested, you can find more information including all of the modeling work at my GitHub repository for this project.", "If there is interest among the readership, I can extend the analysis to the 2019/2020 Democratic presidential primary to see what observations can be gleaned from an early look at that race.
