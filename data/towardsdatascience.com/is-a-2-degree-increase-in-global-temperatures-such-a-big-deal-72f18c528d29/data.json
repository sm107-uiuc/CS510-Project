I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s a meaningful question. But, it got me to thinking \u2026 and writing.", "I recently had the pleasure of attending a presentation by John Holdren, former co-chair of the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (something that used to exist). In addition to all the great science he presented, he shared a statistical insight that made me slap my forehead, because it\u2019s actually kind of obvious, but I hadn\u2019t thought about it. So, at the risk of elaborating the actually kind of obvious, I thought I\u2019d share it.", "If I\u2019m honest, I never fully understood why a 2 degree increase in the mean temperature is such a big deal. I do believe it\u2019s a big deal, because I believe there\u2019s stuff scientists know that I don\u2019t. But, at a gut level, if every day this year were 2 degrees hotter, well it wouldn\u2019t be something to celebrate, but it wouldn\u2019t be unbearable, either. Frankly, I suspect most people think about this the same way.", "The forehead smacking moment at the Holdren talk came when he made a simple statement:", "In other words, the average day may be only 2 degrees hotter, but we\u2019re going to see substantially more very hot days.", "To see that this is true and why, I downloaded daily high temperature readings in New York City for all days in the month of August in the years 1970 through 2010 from the website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA). Here is a histogram:", "The overlaid orange line is the normal distribution that most closely fits the data: mean 82.2 degrees, standard deviation 5.6 degrees. The actual distribution doesn\u2019t look quite normal. The left tail, e.g., is quite a bit longer than the right. But, it\u2019s close enough that we can safely use the normal distribution to understand Holdren\u2019s point.", "A major assertion of climate change science is that weather patterns are growing more volatile. But, to isolate the effect of a mean shift, let\u2019s take the more conservative assumption that the standard deviation stays the same when the mean temperature increases.", "This is what the new distribution, with a mean of 84.2 instead of 82.2, looks like when compared with the original distribution (the one in the histogram above):", "It looks like a small change. For example, the probability* of an 82 degree day decreases from about 7.2% to about 7.0%. A farmer or climate scientist would notice that, but I wouldn\u2019t.", "However, the effect on very high temperature days is more dramatic. Let\u2019s call a day as hot or hotter than today, i.e. 99 degrees or hotter, a \u201cscorcher\u201d. The probability of a scorcher is pretty low. But, on relative basis, that probability increases dramatically, from 0.13% to 0.40%, which means that a 2 degree increase in mean temperature more than triples the likelihood of a scorcher!", "The effect becomes much stronger as the mean temperature increases by a few more degrees:", "The opposite happens on the left-hand side of the distribution. The likelihood of cool days (say 75 degrees and below) falls off dramatically with an increase in mean temperature:", "To see why this happens, let\u2019s revisit the two distributions:", "And zoom in on the area highlighted by the orange box, i.e. the right-hand tail:", "The total probability of observing a high temperature of 99 degrees or higher (a scorcher) is the area of the shaded region under the distribution. For the original distribution, represented by the solid blue line, that area (darker blue shading) is 0.13%. The 2-degrees-higher-mean distribution includes the original 0.13%, plus an additional 0.27%. Again, small absolute numbers, but the relative increase is more than 200%.", "You may have noticed above that the probability of a scorcher increases exponentially as the mean rises. At +2 degrees, the likelihood of a scorcher triples. By +5 degrees, it\u2019s about 15 times higher. And, at +10 degrees, it\u2019s more than 80 times higher.", "To understand this effect, here\u2019s the shaded diagram comparing the right-hand tails of the baseline and +5 degrees distributions:", "And, comparing the baseline and +10 degree distributions:", "Your home for data science.
