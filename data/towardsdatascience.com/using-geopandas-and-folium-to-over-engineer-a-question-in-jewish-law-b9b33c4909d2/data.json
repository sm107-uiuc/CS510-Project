Its times like these that I love that my profession, Data Science, questions everything as Rabbis and Sages did in the past.", "Rabbi Eliezer Melamed, of the Academy of Higher Jewish Law at Har Bracha, explains that the reason why the Holiday is celebrated one day later in certain places is rooted in the fact that some cities were walled and others were not. If a city was walled in the time of Joshua Ben Nun, then that city celebrates Shushan Purim (the later date) otherwise the city celebrates the regular Purim.", "On the face of it, this looks like a relatively easy division between cities, but upon closer inspection, many questions arise.", "The only city that still only celebrates Shushan Purim is in fact Jerusalem. However, our question still isn\u2019t fully answered since the borders of the city have grown exponentially over the past 2000 years. There are other cities that are considered probable places for celebrating Shushan Purim so in our experiment, we\u2019ll solve for them as well.", "Is the Jerusalem of today considered the same entity as it was at the time of Joshua Ben Nun?", "To answer this question we can take some concrete specifications of city demarcation from the Talmud. \u201cRabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A city, and all settlements adjacent to it, and all settlements that can be seen with it, i.e., that can be seen from the walled city, are considered like the city\u201d (Megila 3, 2).", "But what is included as adjacent? Is it just dense contiguous buildings? Rabbi Melamed clarifies that a gap of fewer than 141 cubits (67.8 meters) between neighborhoods is enough to consider them as one neighborhood.", "So now we have the key variable needed to over-engineer this question of Jewish Law.", "There are many ways to attack this with data but I think that the easiest way would be to use OpenStreetMap to download all of the spatial building data in Israel and to expand the borders of the building by 67.8 meters, unify the overlap, and the find the polygon that contains the ancient part of Jerusalem.", "After importing the necessary packages, I created a dictionary of probable Shushan Purim cities (along with Jerusalem) and then turned it into a GeoDataFrame in a cartesian reference system. I did this by simply using google maps to find the probable historic centers geocoordinate of suspected walled cities.", "I downloaded the shapefile of building footprints in Israel here:", "We turn the polygons in centroids (to make it easier computationally to work with) and the buffer the polygons by 67.8 meters.", "We then turn it all into one MultiPolygon, deleting the borders in between overlapping polygons, and then we turn this MultiPolygon back into a GeoDataFrame. This is done so that we can easily perform a spatial join between it and the walled cities GeoDataFrame.", "Now we\u2019re left with the maximum borders of areas that could possibly celebrate Shushan Purim.", "We can then use folium to turn our calculated Shushan Purim zones into an interactive web map.", "The interactive web app is located here", "A few screenshots from the web app show a high-level map of the Shushan Zones:", "And one zoomed-in shows Jerusalem in detail:", "Well, that worked ok\u2026 But what about Jerico and Hebron?", "Not much success here since there are few building footprints to work with.", "So there we have it, just like how the physical cubit rod helped the Sages of past come up with solutions to Jewish law, so too can we take the tools and logic of today\u2019s technological age and apply them in a scalable and computational way!", "A better version of this project would use Object Detection to delineate buildings and create the zones in a Raster focused way.
