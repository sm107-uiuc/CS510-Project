The ways that we communicate with our machines, and the ways that our machines communicate with us, are essential to the quality of our overall user experience. This has never been more true than with artificial intelligence. The enhanced power of AI-infused software relies on not just the correct data getting from us to the machine, but then on the machine\u2019s sophistication interpreting it.", "Machines don\u2019t work unless we\u2019ve communicated with them \u2014 whether that\u2019s with a person manipulating the explicit controls of a machine, or implicit in the very form of a machine, made in a specific way to actually just \u201cdo\u201d. With our earliest machines, this was all pretty simple. Think of an abacus, requiring the operator to have merely knowledge of simple mathematics and the ability to use a finger or similar device to move the beads to-and-fro. The earliest interfaces with our machines and technology were concrete, physical, and direct.", "As machines became more complicated, this changed. It took the printing press to get to the typewriter, and it took the typewriter to get to the computer keyboard. Punched cards are anachronistic today, but it was mere decades ago that this technology \u2014 which possibly originated in 1725 with Basile Bouchon and the control of a loom \u2014 evolved to accelerate early mechanical computing, joining the keyboard as the two most important devices for computer user interfaces, to say nothing of the punchcards greater role in data storage and retrieval. It was only in the 1980s that the mouse became a core user interface device with the rise of Apple computers and graphical user interfaces, and just over a decade ago that the gestural conventions of mobile computing helped turn computing from a workplace or sometimes activity into the always-on ubiquity we experience today here in the United States.", "It\u2019s important to remember how recent all of this is. Punched cards have a much richer history than the mouse in the historical computing ecosystem, even if it was the usability offered by the mouse that helped computing become mainstream. The moment we\u2019re in is fleeting, and we could be years not decades away from the mouse as we know it shifting into a peripheral role. What seemed forever yesterday will already be obsolete tomorrow, without our even realizing it.", "Today, when we communicate with machines, we still largely use our fingers and hands \u2014 pulling, pushing, flipping, typing, clicking, and swiping. While this paradigm works, it\u2019s not the most elegant or powerful way to communicate. It requires the machine we are communicating with \u2014 machine in this case being the synthesis of the software you are using and the hardware devices you are using it on \u2014 to be particularly well-oriented to get you exactly what you want. Something like a favorite song you haven\u2019t heard in a while can require a carpal tunnel syndrome-inducing amount of swipe-click-clack to get from the impulse to listen to the song to actually have it playing. This says nothing about the time it takes, which can potentially take not just seconds, but minutes depending on your computing and network environment.", "Dumping graphical user interfaces for voice-enabled artificial intelligence is, when done right, infinitely better. This is one of the reasons why technologies like Alexa and Siri are so exciting. The user interface is flattened down \u2014 in the best case \u2014 to a single voice command. It will take just one or a few seconds, time during which your mind and body need not think about the request anymore. What used to be graphical user interface and the cumbersome management of architecture and hierarchy for the user is instead just verbalization of a desire. But while a seamless person-to-machine connection is the ideal, at the moment, such interaction is far from easy. Or, rather, the talking might be easy, but getting the correct results rarely seems to be. Talking with machines can cause us a great deal of frustration: Alexa, do this. Siri do that. No, don\u2019t do THIS, please do THAT instead.", "So it is that Natural Language Processing, or NLP, has become one of the most important, fast-growing, and AI-essential technologies going today. Simply put, this is how computers process and analyze natural language data \u2014 particularly our speech. NLP is a pillar technology in how artificial intelligence communicates with and works for us. The near future of automation will, in many ways, be driven by NLP. Given the power and potential of each voice UI and AI, it is imperative that the machine\u2019s ability to interpret and then use natural language \u2014 particularly the spoken word \u2014 is effective.", "To better understand NLP, we spoke with researcher and computer scientist, Shivali Goel, who has worked for companies like SYSTRAN and Adobe. \u201cNLP is one of the core AI technologies. You can view it as a beautiful mix of linguistics and computer science,\u201d says Goel. \u201cIt is basically giving machines the capability to understand what a person means when he says or types something. NLP is about overcoming ambiguities in language and understanding the intent and context. For example, if I say, \u2018Kids make nutritious snacks,\u2019 what do you understand? Are the children cooking something nutritious? Or that they themselves are a nutritious snack.\u201d", "\u201cNLP algorithms examine and utilize patterns in such data. They understand the word relations and the wordplay, and simulate human-like conversations. So, when you ask Google to play dance music, that\u2019s NLP. When you open a foreign webpage and it gets translated to your language, that\u2019s NLP. And when your Wi-Fi is not working and you end up getting irritated trying to explain your problem to a virtual assistant, or just shouting \u2018Agent! Agent!\u2019 on the phone that\u2019s also NLP. And trust me, we are working hard to improve that.\u201d", "Voice is our most natural input device. It is the primary way we communicate with other humans, and has been for thousands of years. NLP is the technology which translates our voice to best be used by the machine. At its theoretical apex, NLP would interpret our words, cadence, intonation, and other factors to translate it into a nuanced understanding of our intention. Today, as Goel points out, it often can\u2019t even figure out where to take us down a simple phone decision tree. Still, in its better incarnations, the technology seems to understand and respond like magic. One example is Google\u2019s Duplex service which uses a human voice to make appointments for its owner. More than just a convenience, it is another technology that eerily blurs the distinction between real and fake.", "Another excellent example of NLP in action is in machine translation. \u201cMachine translation systems can help students learn a foreign language,\u201d says Goel. \u201cTranslators are not yet good enough to match humans or replace the teachers, but these systems can definitely supplement teaching. Also, a lot of online resources and ebooks can be translated to different languages, so that more people can benefit from learning \u2026\u201d", "Voice does have its limitations as an interface input. In particular, there are many important use cases that can become difficult because of the intruding nature of its use in non-private spaces. \u201cI must say that I do not think voice UI is going to have much of a future in public spaces. I think what we\u2019ve seen is a rise in visual and textual communication [in] public space,\u201d says Lee Humphreys, author of The Qualified Self and an Associate Professor in the Department of Communication at Cornell University. Humphreys conducted one of the first studies in the United States of mobile phone use in public space in the early 2000s. \u201cI did an observational study where I went out and I watched people \u2026 using their mobile phones. And one of the things that was really fascinating about that study is the ways that [people] would try to keep their communication private when they were talking on the phone. So, they would put their head down. They might put their hand over their mouth. They engage in a variety of ways to both try to keep their conversations private. But [at the same time] their voice could be an infringement on the privacy of others in public space,\u201d says Humphreys. \u201cThe British Medical Journal even equated talking on cell phones in the early 2000s to the equivalent of second hand smoke, as a form of social pollutants in the air. \u2026 I really think in certain kinds of contexts, the role of voice is very difficult. Where you\u2019re likely to see it is in cars, as a kind of public space. Yet, you\u2019re in this little bubble where you want to sing along with the radio or Spotify or whatever, go for it. Or, you can dictate something. So, I think that\u2019s a place, slightly more in the public space besides just domestic spaces where you might see voice forms of communication.\u201d", "There is a future for more ubiquitous voice UI, but it will require the addition of other technologies. There is already meaningful work around voice UI that is registering a user\u2019s whispers or mouth movements instead of the sort of loud speech that is required when speaking with other people. These or some other advances will be required to make the most of voice as a dominant interface paradigm.", "\u201cThe way I see voice right now is a lot of people use it as a system to do direct commands \u2014 with setting alarms, or play[ing] back music with \u2018Start,\u2019 \u2018Stop,\u2019 \u2018Next\u2019 \u2014 really simple commands to a computer,\u201d says Erica Lee, Executive Director and Founder of WomenOfAI.org. \u201cInstead of pushing the button, you\u2019re just using your voice. So, right now my entire house is automated with Amazon Alexa and Google Home Assistant to help change music, set timers, read calendars \u2026 do a lot of low-level function. It\u2019s been really helpful just saving me time.\u201d", "\u201cAnd voice interface is now actually starting to merge with visual interfaces. There\u2019s this new trend that we send home electronics with screens being attached to a lot of these sound systems. Amazon recently released \u2026 the Echo Show, which has a screen with a front-facing camera. It [can not only] say, \u201cPlay the next song,\u201d we can actually see the album cover and the name of it, and sometimes even graphics or animations behind it. It\u2019s becoming more interactive and immersive,\u201d says Lee.", "The most interesting AI applications will be the ones that intertwine with our day-to-day lives. To best do that, machines need to understand what we want \u2014 or don\u2019t. That comes back to user interface and how we input commands to the machine. In this, the integration of voice with visuals is an important step. We\u2019ve never come anywhere close to the immersive computing environment in the movie Minority Report, now some 17 years ago. At the time, that was touted as the future, a fictional portrayal based on the input of futurists and technologists who understood how things would evolve, soonish. We still aren\u2019t there yet. In fact, our reality doesn\u2019t even feel close. Still, the integration of improving voice interface with our display environments is one step on that path.", "Lee thinks UI will evolve into more passive and automated inputs: \u201cMy personal perspective \u2014 and I hope the industry moves it this way \u2014 is [that] the system is less, one-way, where I tell the machine to do something, [and] more of a feedback loop, where occasionally I will put in requests to my Siri to change the calendar, or to check my mail. But really the system has many different sensors and many different inputs to read my behavior.\u201d That is certainly a model of machines at their very best: passively leveraging all of the data available on the network and then automating environments and experiences in ways that are optimal for each unique person.", "Creative Next is a podcast exploring the impact of AI-driven automation on the lives of creative workers, people like writers, researchers, artists, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs.
