In layman\u2019s terms, bias is the inverse of the accuracy of predictions. And variance refers to the degree to which the predictions are spread out. Noise, on the other hand, is random fluctuation that cannot be expressed systematically.", "However, the above definitions are vague and we need to inspect them from a mathematical perspective. In this article, I will stress on variance \u2014 the more perplexing demon that haunts our models.", "When we allow our models the flexibility to uselessly learn complex relationships over the training data, it loses the ability to generalize. Most of the times, this flexibility is provided through features i.e when the data has a large number of features (sometimes more than the number of observations). It could also be due to a complex neural network architecture or an excessively small training dataset.", "What results from this is a model which also learns the noise in the training data; consequently, when we try to make predictions on unseen data, the model misfires.", "Variance is also responsible for the differences in predictions on the same observation in different \u201crealizations\u201d of the model. We will use this point later to find an exact value for the variance.", "Let X\u1d62 be the population of predictions made by model M on observation i. If we take a sample of size n values, the variance will be:", "Now that was something we already knew. However, we need to calculate the variance of the whole population (which is equivalent to the variance of the statistical model that generated it) and we are not quite there yet. There is one concept we need to understand before that \u2014 bootstrap resampling.", "Note that this formula of variance assumes that the outcome of the model is a continuous variable \u2014 this happens in regression. In the case of classification, the outcome is 0/1 and thus, we would have to measure the variance differently. You can find the explanation to that in this paper.", "Often we don\u2019t have access to an entire population to be able to calculate a statistic such as variance or mean. In such cases, we make use of bootstrap sub-samples.", "The principle of bootstrapping suggests that if we take a large number of sub-samples of size n with replacement from a sample of size n, then it is an approximation of taking those samples from the original population.", "We find the sample statistic on each of these sub-samples and take their mean to estimate the statistic with respect to the population. The number of sub-samples we take is only limited by time and space constraints; however, the more you take, the more accurate will be your result.", "Let M be our statistical model. A realization of M is a mapping from input to output. When we train M on a particular input, we obtain a specific realization of the model. We can obtain more realizations by training the model on sub-samples from the input data.", "We can combine the two concepts and obtain multiple realizations of a model by bootstrapping the training data to obtain an estimate of the actual variance of the model.", "Now let\u2019s translate the variance formula into an algorithm for model M on observation X.", "We can repeat this procedure on more observations and report the average variance.", "I have used a dataset to predict the compressive strength of concrete in MPa (MegaPascals).", "We assess the variance in predictions (obtained through bootstrapping) of a single out-of-sample observation for different models.", "As expected, the bagging and random forest models vary less than their base model which is the decision tree. In all the models, the predictions peak at the actual value; however, the decision tree distribution is bimodal and more spread out.", "We can compare the overall variations of the models on all out-of-sample observations using scatter plots.", "The darker golden line represents the actual values. Once again, the predictions of decision tree are more scattered around this line.", "For the classification task, I will use a modified iris dataset to predict whether the flower is an Iris Virginica or not (1 or 0). I have also added an infectious flower that disguises as Iris Virginica.", "The base model is more sensitive towards an erroneous observation (encircled) as seen in the decision regions. In other words, it tries to model the noise in the training data.", "Here\u2019s an implementation for computing variance based on bootstrap sub-sampling.", "It\u2019s important to measure and model the errors when comparing two or more models. This is especially important when you consider upgrading to an ensemble.", "Also note that a model with lower variance is not necessarily the more accurate model (remember the trade-off with bias?). The bias is measured in a similar way.", "Your home for data science.
