The repository can be found here.", "Any broken links below should lead to this repo instead. Cheers!", "Whether you want to be a software engineer, data scientist, machine learning engineer, or artificial intelligence engineer; building an application for solving Sudoku is a great portfolio project.", "It is such a great project that Peter Norvig wrote an amazing post about solving it here. Then Aaron Fredrick wrote another great post about how to solve the problem here. In fact, if you want a sudoku solution in a different language, you can find solutions by each of the below individuals in the corresponding languages:", "Given this problem has been solved so many times by many different individuals in many different languages, how do you make your solution stand out?", "One way you can stand out is to extend an existing solution. For example, Aaron\u2019s solution involved building a convolutional neural network in order to process a sudoku image before solving the puzzle. This adds another layer of complexity, and it shows his comfort with deep learning solutions.", "Another way to stand out is to show off your software engineering skills as part of your solution. Specifically, employers look for individuals who already understand the fundamentals of", "Along with the above, it is important to write code that is easy to use and maintain for any new user. In this post, we will focus on testing, linting, and documentation.", "Consider we start with an initial solution as shown here in Github. How might we go about making changes to this solution to show off our skills?", "Before you even begin writing your solution, you likely should write tests. An image like the one below might pop into your head, but this isn\u2019t exactly what I had in mind\u2026", "Tests in python are a way to make sure the code you intend to write performs the way you expect it to and provides the output you expect.", "In the case of this example, writing tests might mean knowing the solution to a particular starting puzzle, and then comparing the result of our code against the known solution.", "A robust testing kit will have a range of different examples to test. Below you can see a simple example where the container and the solution are provided form the function. You can imagine having multiple examples like this one, where you definecontainer as the starting Sudoku, and container_sol is the corresponding solution.", "You might also have a few edge cases. Three examples I came up with are", "You can find a file with a function for each of my test cases available here. Below you can see how we might pull in the SudokuSolver, and compare the solution from the solver (code_sol) to our test solution (sol).", "We can set up cases like the one above for each of our test cases. The good news is that the two \u201cnormal\u201d test cases \u2014 found in functions test1 and test2 of sudoku_tests.py are handled easily with the existing code.", "Unfortunately, the edge cases leave us with a program that will never finish. Therefore, we will need to write code that will handle these edge cases. This is pretty straightforward (though tedious), because we wrote our tests ahead of time, and we know how each case should be handled.", "Below you can see a function that will check to make sure that any provided Sudoku puzzle is valid according to each of the three edge cases noted above.", "From this function, if the return value isFalse, then our puzzle is valid. If one of the strings is returned, then our puzzle is not valid for the reason specified by the string.", "Now that all of our test cases are ready to go, we would begin writing our solution. It is well understood that the first solution likely gets the job done. That is, it solves the problem, but the code may not be well documented, be easy to read, or use best coding practices. This is ok!", "It is important to get in the rhythm of solving a problem and not be so anxious with coding best practices that it stops you from writing anything at all! However, when you have a working solution, you should go back to refactor your code, improve its readability, and see if it can be optimized.", "I started my refactor by changing the existing code to be a pythonclass. The way I wrote my tests required this to be the case, and it was pretty straightforward to take the existing functions and simply put them within a class body with a bunch of self\u2019s placed in the necessary places. The outcome of the refactor to a class is available here.", "At this point, this file can be run to see two examples from your terminal with:", "The above will produce two starting puzzles, as well as each puzzle\u2019s solution to your console.", "And if this file is in the same directory as your sudoku_tests.py, you can run:", "The above command will produce no result since all of your tests should now pass!", "From here, we should now see how well our code adheres to Python standards, known as PEP8. These aren\u2019t strict rules, as much as they are guidelines.", "You can get an idea of how well your code conforms to these guidelines by running:", "You will get a list of issues, as well as a score: Your code has been rated at -0.60/10. And, the list of issues is VERY long. You might jump right in to start manually fixing each item, but there are libraries that can assist in making this a faster process.", "There is an autoPEP8 library that can be used to clean up that code quickly.

Though there is still a pretty hefty list of changes to make that largely fall into the categories of", "Though each of these fixes is pretty self-explanatory using the output from the linting, it may take some time to get through the full list. Again, these all act more as guidelines than strict rules, so it is up to you how much you care about making particular changes.", "I created the refactor-branch, which contains the same code on master, but both the sudoku.py and sudoku_tests.py files have been refactored for 8.76/10 and 9.32/10, respectively. You can view the revisions here. That\u2019s pretty good considering these started at -0.60/10 and -46.60/10, respectively.", "As you already saw from the linting process, documenting your work is very important! Documentation for this particular case means providing an informative README.md; documentation for each script; and document strings for each function, class, and method within each script.", "The pylint we used in the previous section can be tricked by simply providing empty strings in the necessary places. However, a good guide to follow is provided by the Google Style Python Docstrings.", "In terms of writing a good README, the post here by Akash does a good job of explaining the ins-and-outs of a good one. For this particular project, we don\u2019t need all of these components, but this gives you a good idea about what to think about when creating a README.", "In general, your README is very important for getting individuals to interact with your code. If you want people to look at your work, include a good README. Frequently, I write my README at the very end of the project, because I want to be super useful and relevant to the code. Often I don\u2019t know how to explain something to a reader until I have completed writing all the code!", "You can see an example of my module string below. Notice it includes examples of how to run the script, as well as information on the purpose of the script.", "Then the class and method strings should follow the protocol from Google, which means the class documentation contains Args and Attributes. The method strings contain Args and Returns. If there is additional information you believe would be helpful for the user, you can also include that.", "Below is one example you can use to create your own function strings:", "We can also add document strings to the sudoku_tests.py file following the same format. Since the tests aren\u2019t really for the use of others, it seems reasonable to be willing to spend less time on this documentation, but you can again see the results at the repository linked above.", "At the end of completing the documentation, I re-ran pylint to look at the updated scores by running:", "Finally, let\u2019s put together the README! There\u2019s no totally right answer for putting together a README. For showcasing data science projects, the outline for a good README might be much different than for creating a production library (which was the role of Akash\u2019s README post above). For my projects, I usually try to include the following portions in my README, but again there is no right answer:", "You can see the full documentation for sudoku.py on the documentation-branch of my repository here.", "With that, your project has never looked more professional, and you are ready to share it with the world!", "Your home for data science.
