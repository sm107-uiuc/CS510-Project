Here\u2019s a list of projects you can try for yourself if you\u2019re into practical data science. Those will definitely get you hired!", "One of the first things you learn after you learn the basics of Python is how to classify data and put them into groups relative to their different features. You can classify text according to sentiments or images according to similarity. You can go for Kaggle\u2019s different datasets to classify sports\u2019 top performers and try to determine what\u2019s making an athlete a star.", "Options here endless and you should definitely go into playing data as much as you can.", "As for the methods, you\u2019ll be using definitely DBSCAN and/or KNN to cluster your data. Also, some dimensionality reductions, like PCA or t-SNE, might be helpful.", "What\u2019s more fun than choosing a website which you visit often and try to scrape it? You can go for financial news, social media trends or best cooking recipes. You can even try to scrape Google and other search engines \u2014 it\u2019s not hard in Python.", "Scraping a single website is fun because you get to understand how websites are built and their flow of information, from a totally different perspective.", "Scraping search engines is great for learning how different pieces of information are spread throughout the internet.", "And if you connect the two \u2014 you\u2019ll get an amazing project: newsfeed about a particular subject!", "Technologically, you\u2019ll be using Requests library to scrape and BeautifulSoup to clean the html code. Alternatively, you can also use Selenium to scrape.", "Here\u2019s a standard though a little tedious task: cleaning data. It is standard because this happens to be a part of almost any real-world problem you will encounter as a data scientist. It is tedious because you might end up spending long hours thinking about how to make sense of the enormous data you have.", "Data Cleaning might involve taking ticks of stock prices and trying to make sense of that \u2014 by clustering, by good visualization. Or if you already have a data set, like your old documents and photos, it might involve trying to tidy them up, by deleting those which are not needed anymore.", "Data Cleaning might be as easy deleting unwanted files to as hard as trying to use machine learning to spot anomalies in your data set to delete those.", "One of the standard libraries here is pandas.", "Whether you have a nice data set or not, the best way to understand data is to try to visualize in many different ways. It\u2019s not only helpful for you, but also for your potential clients or employers.", "By visualizing it might be much easier to spot what\u2019s going on.", "Here Plotly comes in handy, which is a standard Python library for plotting functions and graphs. If you want to build an interactive dashboard then you should try using Dash in Python.", "Time to get into machine learning! Neural networks are not as hard as you think. Their easiest instances are very quick to implement, especially if you use a framework of Keras, which does a lot of work for you.", "The entry point for neural networks is classifying hand-written digits. If you Google \u201cMNIST Python\u201d you\u2019ll find plenty of tutorials on how to use simple neural networks to do it.", "From then you can go into more complex datasets (e.g. images of animals) and problems (multi-class classification, anomaly detection.", "Finally, if you want to have an overview of what it means to be a Data Scientist, then have a look at my book Data Science Job: How to become a Data Scientist which will guide you through the process.", "And if you want to know more, read my other articles about becoming a Data Scientist:", "Your home for data science.
