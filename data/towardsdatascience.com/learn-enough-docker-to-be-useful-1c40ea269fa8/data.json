We discussed the reasons Docker containers are important and several ways to think about them. And we made one into a pizza \ud83c\udf55. In this article I\u2019ll share a dozen additional terms from the Docker ecosystem that you need to know.", "I\u2019ve broken Docker terms into two categories for easier mental model creation: Essentials and Scaling. Let\u2019s hit the eight essentials first.", "Docker Platform is Docker\u2019s software that provides the ability to package and run an application in a container on any Linux server. Docker Platform bundles code files and dependencies. It promotes easy scaling by enabling portability and reproducibility.", "Docker Engine is the client-server application. The Docker company divides the Docker Engine into two products. Docker Community Edition (CE) is free and largely based on open source tools. It\u2019s probably what you\u2019ll be using. Docker Enterprise comes with additional support, management, and security features. Enterprise is how the Docker firm keeps the lights on.", "Docker Client is the primary way you\u2019ll interact with Docker. When you use the Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) you type a command into your terminal that starts with docker. Docker Client then uses the Docker API to send the command to the Docker Daemon.", "Docker Daemon is the Docker server that listens for Docker API requests. The Docker Daemon manages images, containers, networks, and volumes.", "Docker Volumes are the best way to store the persistent data that your apps consume and create. We\u2019ll have more to say about Docker Volumes in Part 5 of this series. Follow me to make sure you don\u2019t miss it.", "A Docker Registry is the remote location where Docker Images are stored. You push images to a registry and pull images from a registry. You can host your own registry or use a provider\u2019s registry. For example, AWS and Google Cloud have registries.", "Docker Hub is the largest registry of Docker images. It\u2019s also the default registry. You can find images and store your own images on Docker Hub for free.", "A Docker Repository is a collection of Docker images with the same name and different tags. The tag is the identifier for the image.", "Usually a repository has different versions of the same image. For example, Python is the name of the most popular official Docker image repository on Docker Hub. Python:3.7-slim refers to the version of the image with the 3.7-slim tag in the Python repository. You can push a repository or a single image to a registry.", "Now let\u2019s look at Docker terms related to scaling multiple Docker containers.", "The following four concepts relate to using multiple containers at once.", "Docker Networking allows you to connect Docker containers together. Connected Docker containers could be on the same host or multiple hosts. For more information on Docker networking, see this post.", "Docker Compose is a tool that makes it easier to run apps that require multiple Docker containers. Docker Compose allows you to move commands into a docker-compose.yml file for reuse. The Docker Compose command line interface (cli) makes it easier to interact with your multi-container app. Docker Compose comes free with your installation of Docker.", "Docker Swarm is a product to orchestrate container deployment. The official Docker tutorial has you using Docker Swarm in its fourth section. I would suggest you not spend time on Docker Swarm unless you have a compelling reason to do so.", "Docker Services are the different pieces of a distributed app. From the docs:", "Services are really just \u201ccontainers in production.\u201d A service only runs one image, but it codifies the way that image runs \u2014 what ports it should use, how many replicas of the container should run so the service has the capacity it needs, and so on. Scaling a service changes the number of container instances running that piece of software, assigning more computing resources to the service in the process.", "Docker services allow you to scale containers across multiple Docker Daemons and make Docker Swarms possible.", "There you have it: a dozen delicious Docker terms you should know.", "Here\u2019s the one line explanation to help you keep these dozen terms straight.", "Platform \u2014 the software that makes Docker containers possibleEngine \u2014 client-server app (CE or Enterprise)Client \u2014 handles Docker CLI so you can communicate with the DaemonDaemon \u2014 Docker server that manages key thingsVolumes \u2014 persistent data storageRegistry \u2014 remote image storageDocker Hub \u2014 default and largest Docker RegistryRepository \u2014 collection of Docker images, e.g. Alpine", "Networking \u2014 connect containers togetherCompose \u2014 time saver for multi-container appsSwarm \u2014 orchestrates container deploymentServices \u2014 containers in production", "Because we\u2019re keeping with food metaphors, and everyone loves a baker\u2019s dozen, we have one more related term for you: Kubernetes.", "Kubernetes automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It\u2019s the clear winner in the container orchestration market. Instead of Docker Swarm, use Kubernetes to scale up projects with multiple Docker containers. Kubernetes isn\u2019t an official part of Docker; it\u2019s more like Docker\u2019s BFF.", "I have a whole series on Kubernetes in the works. Kubernetes is pretty awesome.", "Now that you know the conceptual landscape and common terms I suggest you try out Docker.", "If you haven\u2019t worked with Docker before, it\u2019s time to get in the kitchen and make something!", "Docker runs locally on Linux, Mac, and Windows. If you\u2019re on a Mac or Windows machine, install the latest stable version of Docker Desktop here. As a bonus, it comes with Kubernetes. If you\u2019re installing Docker elsewhere, go here to find the version you need.", "After you have Docker installed, do the first two parts of the Docker tutorial. Then meet back here for more Docker fun. In the next four parts of this series we\u2019ll dive into Dockerfiles, Docker images, the Docker CLI, and dealing with data.
