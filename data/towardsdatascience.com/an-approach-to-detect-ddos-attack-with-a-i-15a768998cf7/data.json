The base weapon that the hacker uses during these types of attacks is network trafficking to take down or crash websites. There are various subcategories of this attack, each category defines the way a hacker tries to intrude into the network. In this research, we have discussed an approach to detect the DDoS attack threat through A.I. model with over 96% accuracy. We have classified 7 different subcategories of DDoS threat along with a safe or healthy network.", "Distributed denial-of-service(DDoS) attacks target websites and online services. The objective of this attack is to jam the network or server with overwhelming traffic. It achieves effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised systems as sources of attack traffic. There are different subcategories of DDoS attack based on the layer of the network connection they attempt to attack, with respect to the OSI model. Some of the subcategories that we classified through our research are SYN Flood, UDP Flood, MSSQL, LDAP, Portmap, NetBIOS.", "Machine Learning and Deep Learning are one of the most common backbones of A.I. till day. We use these methodologies to solve problems in various domains with accuracy close to human performance. Once again we have tested the limits of A.I. in detecting threats in the domain of cybersecurity through this research. In this research, we did a thorough analysis of the logs generated during a DDOS attack, used supervised and unsupervised techniques for detection of threat, and finally used deep learning to achieve over 96% accuracy for classification of different types of DDoS threats along with the safe connection.", "Processing the data was one of the first challenges faced by us. The data had 88 attributes or features. Processing such huge data within limited RAM memory was a really challenging task for us. So we downgraded the data type of the attributes, and hence reducing the memory usage of the data frame. Data-types of float64 are downgraded to float32, int64 to int32, int32 to uint32 and so on. We successfully reduced almost 42% of the initial size. Our data frame still had attributes or features with the maximum value close to infinite, so we also handled those data in the pre-processing stage.", "As it could be seen that we have tried to maintain even distribution of the target feature along with the data-set.", "Even though UDPLag is a bit unevenly distributed with respect to others, but we have still handled this case later in this research.", "In the above two analysis, we could clearly observe that there is drift in the flow of bits and flow of packets during a DDoS attack compared to a Benign or Safe connection.", "We have also analyzed the distribution of each type of threat within each type of protocol, and inbound. Below are the charts displaying the analysis.", "Unsupervised approach for detection of threat", "In Unsupervised approach we do not let our model learn through the target variables, rather we force our algorithm to learn from input data itself and discover patterns and information on its own.", "Pre-processing before training. We have removed some of the features from our data like Flow ID\u2019, \u2018 Source IP\u2019, \u2018 Source Port\u2019,\u2019 Destination IP\u2019, \u2018 Destination Port\u2019,\u2019 Timestamp\u2019,\u2019 Flow Packets/s\u2019, \u2018Flow Bytes/s\u2019. \u2018Flow plackets/s\u2019 and \u2018Flow Bytes/s\u2019 were removed because after standard scaling these features transformed into values too large for float64 and NaN values.", "We scaled our data through standard scaling and followed by normalization. Use Principle component analysis for dimension reduction and reduced the dimension into two-dimensional data.", "So, from the above two visualizations, it could be clearly observed that our algorithm could successfully cluster out the different threats from the data to some extent.", "Let\u2019s see how our unsupervised model could label the generated clusters.", "Well, it looks like our unsupervised model has successfully found the pattern in the data and could segment out our target variable on its own to some extent.", "Note \u2014 Unsupervised learning gives you a detailed and analyzed insight about the shape and structure of the data. The unsupervised clustering and target label prediction from data would changes when the shape and structure of the data changes as it is unaware of the target data might be. There is no way to determine how accurate they are, making supervised machine learning more applicable to real-world problems. It is also one of the reasons why unsupervised trained models are not appropriate for deploying over production.", "Supervised approach for detection of threat", "It is just opposite to the unsupervised approach, here we let our model learn through target variable which further helps our model to learn the pattern from the data through the target labels. We applied the same pre-processing of data as we did for the unsupervised approach. In this case, we have used deep learning to train our model.", "As our target variable was imbalance so we have used Stratified K-fold to train and validate our data over each fold. It balances the distribution of training and validation with respect to a desired unbalanced feature.", "We have used Adam as our base optimizer and ROC_AUC score to evaluate the performance of the model. ROC_AUC score Compute Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) from prediction scores.", "We have trained and validated our model over 10 folds and we have achieved ROC_AUC score of 96% and above over an average for detection of threat and achieved the highest accuracy 97% and above.", "Classification report from one of the 10 folds", "Accuracy for classifying each class from one of the 10 folds", "Even if you have very little labelled data compared to unlabeled data in a real-life scenario, there are techniques like semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning to achieve remarkable performance.", "Model fairness indicator is also one of the TensorFlow tools that could also be used for better model evaluation and performance scaling.", "The UNIVERSITY OF New BRUNSWICK, for making the data-set available.", "TensorFlow, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, for tools that have been used in this entire research.", "Your home for data science.
