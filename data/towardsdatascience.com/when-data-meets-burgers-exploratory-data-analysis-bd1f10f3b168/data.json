How would you approach the task of climbing a mountain? Will you walk straight to the top? Or would you explore the base and find the best route to the top? The second idea seems to be the better option. Why am I talking about mountains? You will find your answer pretty soon. Until then observe the mountain of Data Science.", "Import the dataset, Choose an appropriate algorithm, Apply the.fit() function, tune the hyperparameters to reduce the loss function, and BAMM!!!!!! You\u2019ll get your accuracy metric! The above process is just an outline of the Machine learning paradigm taught on most of the MOOCs and online courses.Wait..!!!!!", "If you think you\u2019ll be dealing with clean data all the time then you are mistaken. Data in real-life is messy. It consists of missing values, wrongly given data-types, lots of unnecessary columns, and much more. Then how do you deal with this?", "This is where Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) comes into the picture. It is the process of cleaning data and using appropriate visualizations to extract insights and summarize the data. For example, let us assume we are using the linear regression model and our dataset contains some features which are completely uncorrelated with the target variable. Not removing these features and running the model will not generate the best results. Hence EDA is a must, before applying great deep learning models on data. (that is why I used the mountain analogy in the beginning!)", "In the real world, there is no fixed process flow for EDA. It depends on the data we are dealing with. We will be using the McDonald\u2019s Menu dataset to perform EDA and the Pandas Library along with Matplotlib and Seaborn for data cleaning and data visualization.", "We can observe the dataset has 260 rows and 24 columns in total. The Category column denotes whether an item comes under Breakfast, Smoothies, Salads, etc. We can also notice that some columns like Total Fat, Cholesterol, etc. have 2 columns where one denotes the quantity in grams and \u201c% Daily Value\u201d can tell you if serving of food is high or low in a nutrient and whether a serving of the food contributes a lot, or a little, to your daily diet for each nutrient. (Cited from fda.gov)", "Example: Look at the amount of sodium(last column) in one serving of Egg McMuffin. Is %DV(% Daily Value) of 31% contributing a lot or a little to your diet? This product contains 31% DV for sodium, which shows that this is a HIGH sodium product (if an item has more than 20% DV it is considered high!). If you consumed 2 servings of Egg McMuffin, that would provide 62% of the DV for sodium \u2014 nearly 60% of an entire day\u2019s worth of sodium. Hence items having %DV of more than 20 are not considered to be healthy.", "Observe the Egg McMuffin row above. You can notice that Total Fat is 13, Saturated fat is 5, Cholesterol is 260, and Sodium is 750. If we plot a bar plot of these values it looks like Sodium is dominating the item but that is not the case because the values do not lie in the same range (hence we can remove these columns).", "Also, columns like serving sizes can be removed due to a lack of their contribution.", "After removing the columns and renaming all the columns for convenience sake we can notice that we have 260 rows and 16 columns. We can also notice that all the column types are appropriate.", "When there is no data value for a column in a given row we call it as a missing value. It is important to deal with missing values as they may lead to weak/biased analysis. Let us use a heatmap to visualize the number of missing values per column. The df.isnull() method returns a boolean value which explains whether each cell has a value or not. In general, a heat map assigns a color to each data cell depending on the data value.", "We can replace missing values in two ways:1. Delete \u2014 The easiest way to deal with missing values. It can be done using the dropna() method. But not the best solution due to the loss of data.2. Impute \u2014 Standard method which is followed everywhere. Missing values are replaced with the mean/median of that column using the fillna() method.3. Interpolate \u2014 Uses linear interpolation to guess the missing values and fill the data.", "We can now observe that all the columns have no missing values.", "We can notice that there are nine unique categories of items which implies a total of 260 items are divided into 9 categories. The pie-chart shows that the Coffee and tea category dominates the menu whereas the Salads category is the least.", "Let us try and analyze which category has the more number of proteins, cholesterol, fats, etc. Before visualizing the data it is important to understand the concept of pivot_table(). Let us look at an example.", "Instead of np.mean() of Sodium values, we can also perform other aggregation functions like np.max() , np.sum() etc. Since we are comparing nutrient values category wise it is better to take the mean of values.", "Similar to the above example let us create a pivot_table for Category and Protein and try to understand the distribution. Let us plot a bar plot of all mean Protein values wrt. to Category.", "We can create plots using the Pandas in-built plot() method. Since we are going to create a bar plot we pass bar as a parameter to the kind argument.", "We can notice that The Chicken and Fish Category has the highest value of protein. Similarly, let us analyze all the nutrient distributions category wise.", "As expected, we can notice more amount of sugars in Smoothies and more amount of Vitamin A and Vitamin C in salads. Calories are more in Chicken and Fish items whereas Iron is more in Beef and Pork. It is better to have breakfast at home due to the high amounts of cholesterol as indicated by the first bar plot.", "Do you think bar plots are correct in depicting comparisons among discrete categories? Here we calculated the mean of all items category wise and created a bar plot. But we also know that means are very sensitive to outliers.Are outliers playing a role in the bar plots above? To understand the distribution of each item we can create Swarm plots. In Swarm plots, every item in each column is depicted with a dot instead of taking the mean of all items for that particular category like a bar plot does.", "Let us create a swarm plot for the Vitamin C and Category columns and compare it with the bar plot.", "We can create a Swarm plot using the Seaborn\u2019s swarmplot()method. The X-axis labels are rotated by 90 degrees for readability purposes.", "Here we can see that the swarm plot consists of Vitamin C values of all the items wrt. category. On looking at the swarm plot, we may assume that the Beverages or Snacks and Sides category will have the highest amount of Vitamin C but after keen observation, we can notice that the number of zero-valued items(circled in swarm-plot) these two columns have is way more than the Salads column which has all the values around 20\u201330. This leads to a higher mean of the Salads category when compared to the other two columns. Similarly, we can create Swarm plots for other categories and analyze them.", "Selecting the appropriate plot is a crucial part of insight generation.", "It is a metric used to describe the interdependency among features(different columns)of a dataset. A strong positive correlation(closer to 1)between 2 variables means an increase in one variable causes an increase in the other variable. A negative correlation(closer to -1) means an increase in one variable causes a decrease in another variable. If the value is closer to 0 it means it is a weak/no correlation.", "Note: Correlation is useful only in case of Linear Relationship. In the case of non-linear relationship, correlation tends to underestimate the interdependency.", "We can create a heat map using the Seaborn\u2019s heatmap() method. If the annot argument is True then the correlation values are displayed on each cell and the fmt parameter limits the decimal point. The X-axis labels are rotated by 90 degrees for readability purposes.", "Well, no mindblowing facts have been discovered! The correlation matrix confirms the idea that the number of Calories increases with the Total Fat(0.9 indicates a strong positive correlation). There is a weak negative correlation between Sugar and Iron indicating that these two features are inversely proportional to each other. We can also notice that there is no correlation between Iron and Vitamin C(almost zero indicates no correlation!). Let us now try and answer an interesting question!", "While going through the dataset I found 13 items which had 2 variants, one being the grilled and the other being the crispy. I used bar plots to understand the calories and fats distribution in these items to arrive at a conclusion.", "I segregated the data, item-wise, and stored the calories and fats based on Grilled or Crispy. Now we can generate horizontal bar plots to get a better picture.", "Well, the picture says the story. It is better to have grilled items if you are on a diet!", "The full code is available on Github here.", "I tried to explain the importance of Exploratory Data Analysis before applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Hopefully, you have taken some concepts that will help you to perform EDA in real-time. There is no particular methodology and it varies for different datasets. Do feel free to share your feedback and responses. Raise your hands if you\u2019ve learned something new today.", "Your home for data science.
