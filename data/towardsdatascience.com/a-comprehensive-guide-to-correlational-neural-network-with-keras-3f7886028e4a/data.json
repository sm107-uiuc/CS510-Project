We also have additional senses like a sense of balance and acceleration, a sense of time, etc. Every single moment the human brain processes information from all these sources and each of these senses affects our decision-making process. During any conversation, movement of lips, facial expression along with sound produced by vocal cord helps us to fully understand the meaning of words pronounced by the speaker. We can even understand words only by seeing the lips movement without any sound. This visual information is not just supplementary but necessary. This was first exemplified in the McGurk effect (McGurk & MacDonald, 1976) where a visual /ga/ with a voiced /ba/ is perceived as /da/ by most subjects. As we want our machine learning models to achieve human-level performance, it is also necessary to enable them to use data from various sources.", "In machine learning these type of data that comes from different heterogeneous sources are known as multimodal data. For example audio and visual information for speech recognition. It is difficult to directly use these multimodal data in the training, as they may be of different dimensionality and data types. So much of the attention is paid to learning a common representation of these multimodal data. Learning common representations for such multiple views of data will help in several downstream applications. For example, learning a common representation for videos and their audios could help in generating more accurate subtitles for that video than if it generated by only using audio. But how do you learn this common representation?", "Correlational neural network (CorrNet) is one of the methods for learning common representations. Its architecture is almost the same as a conventional single-view deep autoencoder. But it contains one encoder-decoder pair for each modality of data.", "Let\u2019s consider a two-view input, Z = [Ia, Iv], where Ia and Iv are two different views of data such as audio and video. In the figure below, one simple architecture of CorrNet with this data is shown.", "Where both encoder and decoder are single-layered. H is the encoded representation. Ha = f( Wa.Ia+b) is encoded representation Ia. f() is any non linearity ( sigmoid, tanh , etc.). Same is the case of Hv = f( Wa.Ia+b). And the common representation of bimodal data Z is given as :", "In the decoder part, the model tries to reconstruct the input from the common representation H by I\u2019a = g(W\u2019a.H+b\u2019) and I\u2019v = g(W\u2019vH+b\u2019), where g() is any activation and I\u2019a and I\u2019v is the reconstructed Inputs.", "During training, the gradient is calculated based on three losses:", "i) Minimize the self-reconstruction error, that is, minimize the error in reconstructing Ia from Ia and Iv from Iv.", "ii) Minimize the cross-reconstruction error, that is, minimize the error in reconstructing Ia from Iv and Iv from Ia.", "iii) Maximize the correlation between the hidden representations of both views, that is, maximize the correlation between Ha and Hv.", "The total loss can be written as", "Here, Lr() represents reconstruction loss which may be \u2018mean squared error\u2019 or \u2018mean absolute error\u2019. Our target is to minimize this loss. And as we want to increase the correlation, it is subtracted from the loss, i.e., the higher is the correlation the lower is the loss.", "Total implementation can be divided into three parts: Model Building, Setting loss functions, and Training.", "In the Model Building phase, we have to create that auto encodes architecture. First, we have to include all the necessary packages.", "Then we have to create CorrNet architecture. For simplicity, it has a single-layered encoder and decoder.", "Now we have to write the correlational loss function for our model.", "Now we have to compile the model and train", "After training, the common representation learned by this model can be used in different prediction tasks. For example, common representations learned using CorrNet can be used for: cross-language document classification or transliteration equivalence detection. Various studies have found that using common representation increases performance. It can also be used in data generation. For example, in a certain dataset, you have 10000 audio clips with corresponding videos, 5000 audio clips with their videos missing and 5000 videos with their audios missing. In such cases, we can train a CorrNet with 10000 audios and videos and can be used to generate missing videos for audio and vice versa.", "Your home for data science.
