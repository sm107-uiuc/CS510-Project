Almost all of the tasks related to Open-Domain Dialogue system are believed to be \u201cAI-complete\u201d. In other words, solving the problems of Open-Domain Dialogue systems would need \u201ctrue intelligence\u201d or \u201chuman intelligence\u201d. Open-Domain Dialogue systems require the understanding of Natural Languages. The absence of predefined bounded solution space and lack of objective success matric has made the response generation very challenging problem to model.", "To tackle the problems faced in developing these systems, Amazon launched yearly competition \u201cAlexa prize\u201d in 2016. This way they made top researchers think of creative solutions to the problem. In 2018, the second iteration of the competition included the provision of CoBot (Conversational Bot) toolkit and various other models which can detect sensitive content, evaluate conversation and dialog act detection.", "Open-Domain Dialogue systems require an understanding of natural language in order to process user queries. Because of ambiguities and uncertainty, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in an open domain setting is a very difficult problem. In order to respond to the user\u2019s query, dialog systems need to detect their intent. Open-Domain Dialogue systems should understand Dialog Act, Named Entities in user\u2019s utterance, detect ambiguous phrases, detect topic, segment sentences, detect sentiments of the user.", "The objective of \u201cAlexa Prize\u201d is to build agents that can chat coherently and engagingly with the humans for at least 20 minutes and obtain 4 or more ratings out of 5. There have been many other similar challenges like \u201cDialogue System Technology Challenge\u201d (DSTC), \u201cConversational AI challenge\u201d (ConvAI), which were only text-based challenges.", "This post gives an overview of the advances and novel approaches used by Alexa Prize team for building better conversational AI. For further understanding, users can read the paper \u201cAdvancing the State of the Art in Open-Domain Dialog Systems through the Alexa Prize\u201d.", "CoBot (a conversational bot toolkit) was developed in order to minimize the developer\u2019s effort on infrastructure, hosting and scaling. CoBot had some prebuilt models such as Topic and Dialogue Act Classifiers, Conversational Evaluators, Sensitive Content detection.", "CoBot facilitates the testing and evaluation of modifications done by developers. It provides robust logging mechanisms, that are stored directly on Amazon Cloud Watch. It also has a developer-friendly CLI interface, which can be used to simulate conversations and transcribe the conversations. With CoBot, Users can leverage Amazon\u2019s persistent storage, database, and other services like Amazon S3, DynamoDB, QuickSight, etc, to perform rich data analysis and create visualizations.", "Open-Domain Dialogue systems use speech data as input. Poor speech recognition systems and unrecognized word utterances can hugely downgrade the performance of these systems. Therefore, it is important for these systems to be able to handle ASR errors before feeding it to the pipeline for downstream tasks like NLU processing. Participating teams used different methods to deal with ASR errors. Out of all, only one method used a unique approach by capturing homophones by using a contextual knowledge-base. By using this technique Named Entity Error rate was reduced up to 10% to 15%.", "Traditional algorithms in NLP used statistical language models to resolve ambiguities. The performance of current language models can be further improved using contextual information. This can be achieved in two ways. First is by adding contextual information to a dynamic interpolation framework and second is by incorporating contextual information into neural networks.", "In the first approach, the system mixes different statistical language models based on contextual information. In particular various n-gram, based language models are mixed together, by changing the interpolation weights of our n-gram based language model to better adapt and recognize user utterance. These interpolation weights were predicted to maximize the log-likelihood of training data.", "The second approach involved the addition of contextual information for Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. The conversational contextual information is encoded into a Neural Language Model (NLM). The model used was LSTM-RNN. Alexa Prize team explored various methods to incorporate context information, in order to deal with the difference between social bot responses and user utterances.", "To guide the flow of conversations, dialog acts (such as greeting, questions, opinion, request, etc) are useful as general intent. When it is combined with \u2018Topic\u2019 of conversation, it can help in natural language understanding.", "To help build better Open-Domain Dialogue systems, Alexa Prize team developed context aware topic and dialog act classification models. Previous year\u2019s competition\u2019s 10,000 conversations were labeled across 12 topics and 14 dialog acts.", "Open domain dialog setting comes with one of the most difficult tasks, of classifying sensitive or offensive content. Due to cultural differences, racism, religion, sarcasm, non-standard vocabulary, this problem becomes even more challenging.", "Most of the teams trained custom models on publicly available data source such as Reddit and Twitter. Alexa Prize team generated the common forum conversations using a two-stage semi-supervised approach (the approach is illustrated in figure 2).", "The two-stage semi-supervised approach uses a blacklist of offensive words (which is manually curated list of 800 offensive words). Stage 1 consists of sorting forum conversations based on the total number of offensive words present in the said blacklist. In stage 2, highly sensitive comments and non-sensitive comments are sampled using a weakly supervised classifier. This classifier is trained on Toxic Wikipedia Comments dataset. The sampled dataset was used to train a BiLSTM classifier. For word representations, GLoVE embeddings were used.", "Evaluation of open domain dialog systems is another challenging problem. Alexa prize evaluates the quality of open domain dialog systems by asking users to give a rating on a scale of 1 to 5, based on how likely they would like to speak with Alexa. But these ratings don't evaluate turn level performance of open domain dialog systems.", "In order to evaluate turn level performance of open domain dialog systems, Alexa prize team defined the following five metrics.", "Alexa prize conversations (containing around 160,000 utterances) were manually annotated on five metrics mentioned above. Figure 3, illustrates the model used to train the contextual conversation evaluator. The model uses various features like entity grid, sentiment, and context for evaluation.", "Your home for data science.
