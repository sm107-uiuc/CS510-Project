You know that machine learning algorithms typically take in a bunch of samples, each containing a fixed amount of features, and output a prediction in the end.", "What you maybe have heard about (but did not dig deeper into) is the field of cryptography. It is this mysterious subject where it\u2019s all security, passwords, and hiding things. Maybe you have even heard about AES or RSA, which are algorithms to encrypt data.", "But don\u2019t worry, even if you have never dealt with cryptography before, you will be able to follow along since I will explain everything on an introductory level.", "In this article, I want to bring both fields together. I will present to you an easy-to-understand, yet hard-to-solve problem used to build cryptographic algorithms \u2014 the so-called Learning Parity with Noise problem, LPN for short. The \u201cL\u201d in LPN should ring your machine learning alarm bells already because this problem can be seen as a routine machine learning problem!", "But first, let us see where the LPN problem naturally arises in a cryptographic setting and how\u00a0to\u00a0define\u00a0it. We will solve the LPN problem by using machine learning afterward.", "Imagine that you own a hotel and you want to manage access to the guests\u2019 rooms, i.e. each guest should only be able to enter their own room. That makes sense, right?", "Now, traditionally you could use normal, physical keys. The disadvantage is that people sometimes lose their keys, which means a lot of costs for your business since you have to replace the lock from the affected doors.", "So you decide on deploying smart cards, in particular cards with RFID (radio-frequency identification) chips, and also the corresponding locks. Since you have to provide for a lot of doors and you want to save money, you choose very weak RFID chips, i.e. chips with diminishing computational power, maybe even without their own source of electricity.", "The way your system should work is the following: Every lock and every card has a secret key stored, a binary vector such as s=(1,0,1,0), just much longer in practice. If you hold your card next to a lock, the lock works as a reader, scanning the card\u2019s secret key. The chip is called a tag in this context.", "The clue: If the secret keys of the card and the door match, the door opens.", "Perfect! But how to do it? Well, an easy way is to hold your card next to the lock and the lock tells the chip on the card to send its secret key to the lock. Then the lock checks if both secret keys are equal and open the door, if yes.", "This makes sense, because if you do not have the correct card, i.e. the secret key on your chip is different from the secret key in the door lock, the door will not open.", "The trouble with this solution begins when a guest wants to enter their room: A bad guy, usually called an attacker in cryptography, could sit in the hallway, apparently just typing innocently on their notebook. What the attacker actually does is sniff the RFID traffic, i.e. reading the communication between the lock and the guest\u2019s chip. If the chip sends the secret key directly, the attacker will see it, store it, forge a card containing this key, and then will be able to enter the room.", "So, this is a bad idea. It only works if there are no bad people in the world (highly unlikely). Instead, we have to arm ourselves and improve security for our guests. The idea is the following:", "The chip somehow has to prove to the lock that it possesses the correct secret key without revealing it.", "I hear you scream: That\u2019s what encryption is for! And you are right. The attacker would only see garbage in the sniffing tool and wouldn\u2019t be able to reconstruct the key. But sadly, the RFID chip is much too weak for encrypting anything because you wanted to save money, remember? Sadly, this is also true for bigger companies in the real world. The chip has nearly no computational power and also only barely enough storage for its secret key. So we need another, more lightweight solution.", "One way to do that is to use a cryptographic protocol like the HB Protocol by Hopper and Blum [1]. This protocol makes it difficult for this attacker to extract the key.", "The vanilla HB Protocol that I am going to introduce has other vulnerabilities and should not be used in practice. I just use it because it is easy to explain. For real-world security, more secure extensions of this protocol or other secure protocols should be used.", "So, you have a reader R (the lock) and a tag T (your chip). T now wants to prove to R that it possesses the same secret key without revealing it. This is done by R repeatedly challenging T with questions only a tag with the correct secret key can answer. So far, we have seen that the single question \u201cWhat is your secret key?\u201d is insecure since this reveals too much information already. Instead, in the HB Protocol T is asked to only reveal small portions of the secret one tiny bit at a time, until R can be sure that T has the correct secret key.", "Imagine that the secret keys of R and T are in fact both the same s=(1,0,1,0). Now R sends a random binary vector a (e.g. a = (1, 0, 1, 1)) to T and expects T to respond back to it with the scalar product b=<a, s>, which is", "in this example. We call this a a challenge. Remember, we deal with bit arithmetic here, so the \u201c+\u201d is, in fact, an XOR. The multiplication is the same as in the real numbers. Or for mathematicians: we calculate in the field GF(2) or \ud835\udd3d\u2082, the field with 2 elements.", "R can compute the scalar product itself (it knows a and s) and checks T\u2019s answer. If T\u2019s answer is the same, R can be a bit more confident that T indeed has the same secret key. To increase confidence, this game is repeated several times.", "For example, if T does not have the correct key, it would be very unlikely to succeed after a sufficient number of rounds, since a single response would be only correct with a probability of 0.5. Hence, after 10 rounds, for example, the chance of successful authentication is just 1/1024, less than 0,1%.", "This sounds much better, right? T is not revealing its secret in one go now, instead, it gives some information to R by answering the challenges. But sadly, this is also completely insecure. An attacker could still write down the complete communication between R and T and then easily solve a system of linear equations to recover s. This is done in the following way: Imagine the attacker has written down the following for challenge/response pairs:", "where A is the matrix containing the a\u1d62\u2019s as rows and b the b\u1d62\u2019s. In our case:", "So solving this system for s yields the secret. This can also easily be done via Gaussian Elimination if s is much larger, i.e. 1024 bits long. The solution is s = (1, 0, 1, 0) by the way. \ud83d\ude0e", "There is one very small but extremely important tweak to make this secure against our attacker: T just adds some random Bernoulli noise to its responses. Instead of sending <a,s> back to R, it flips a coin e which is 1 with probability p and 0 otherwise, and sends back <a,s>+e to the reader. In other words, with probability 1-p the tag sends <a,s> back to R and with probability p it flips the response bit from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. We assume that p<0.5.", "This does not prevent the attacker from sniffing the communication between R and T and taking notes, of course, but they have to solve the following problem now:", "This notation indicates that each equation of the equation system is only correct with probability 1-p. More formally, you can write it as As+e=b, where e is the noise vector with each component (independently) being 1 with probability p and 0 with probability 1-p.", "Thus, the attacker has to solve a noisy system of equations over GF(2). For a constant error rate p, this problem \u2014 the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) Problem \u2014 is conjectured to be infeasible to solve for large enough length of the secret key. This is also true, if the attacker can get arbitrarily many equations.", "Even with these errors added, R can do its job of determining whether T knows s or not. If T has the correct s, a fraction of about 1-p responses will be correct. That means if p = 0.25 the HB Protocol runs for 1000 iterations, T should give around 750 correct responses.", "If T does not have the correct s, it will give a fraction of around 0.5 correct answers, i.e. 500 out of 1000 rounds protocol run. This allows R to decide whether T has the correct secret or not and this protocol still makes sense for our use case.", "Let\u2019s get to the fun part now. We have established that solving the LPN problem means, given a random binary matrix A and a binary vector b=As+e, recovering s.", "The important observation: We can treat each row a\u1d62 of matrix A now as a sample and the corresponding value b\u1d62=<a\u1d62, s>+e\u1d62 in the vector b as the label.", "As found in normal datasets used in machine learning, a label b\u1d62 actually resembles the scalar product of the feature vector a\u1d62 and a fixed secret vector s (some ground truth), but with an error term added. But how can we get the secret s when we throw a machine learning algorithm for predicting the labels on it?", "Well, if we could learn the problem reasonably well, we could generate good predictions for the labels (the scalar products; the ground truth) for each feature vector a\u1d62 we like. If we throw in the vector a=(1,0,0,0), we would then receive a good guess for", "Thus, we can solve the LPN problem using machine learning.", "The LPN Problem is a very versatile problem that you can also use to build encryption, identity-based encryption, user authentication, oblivious transfer, message authentication codes, and probably more constructions. Also, unlike the factorization problem, the LPN problem cannot easily be solved using quantum computers. Paired together with its light-weightiness it is a good candidate for building post-quantum secure algorithms. So, no worries, if RSA, which is kind of based on factoring large numbers, dies in the presence of quantum computers. ;)", "For more information and a better, mathematical definition of the LPN problem, please refer to my dissertation [2].", "Let us first define an LPN oracle, i.e. a class that we can feed with a secret key and an error level p upon instantiation, which gives us as many samples as we want.", "This can easily be done using the following code:", "We can now instantiate this an oracle with a random secret of length 16 and p = 0.125.", "We can now sample from the lpn :", "Here we have sampled 3 data points. Now, let us try to find s using a decision tree. Of course, you can also try logistic regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and any other classifier of your choice.", "The learning algorithm might fail to capture the ground truth and learn another function. In this case, the so-called Hamming weight of the vector is quite high (around 50000 for our vector of length 100000). This corresponds to the case where the tag T has the wrong key and can answer about half of the challenges correctly. If s_candidate = s, the Hamming weight will be around 0.125 * 100000 = 12500.", "Having a threshold of 14000 in this example is a good tradeoff between recognizing the correct secret and not outputting a wrong candidate as the solution. You can find how to get this bound in [2, page 23].", "We have defined the LPN problem and seen how it arises when trying to break the cryptographic HB Protocol. Then we solved a small instance using a simple decision tree.", "But the journey just starts here: We can use other/better algorithms (deep learning, anyone?) or clever tricks to", "For a list and explanations of non-machine learning algorithms to solve LPN, check out my dissertation [2]. Also, if you want fame, try to solve an instance with a secret length of 512 and p=0.125, for example. This LPN instance is currently unbroken and used for some real-world cryptosystems.
