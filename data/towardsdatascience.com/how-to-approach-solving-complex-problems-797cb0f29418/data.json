Break down the problem into easily manageable parts. Start with minor questions. Apply the Kaizen principle."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["How to approach solving a complex problem? Is there a simple way?", "In this article, I am sharing one simple method that I learned while working on a data analytics requirement, which can be applied to solve pretty much all complex problems.", "A few years ago, I had recently started working on a project for one of our new clients. The client had implemented ERP in the Oracle EBS suite recently and at the moment they were undergoing a business transformation.", "In this context, they required some data crunching to be done in a quick time to find out business insights on various businesses so management could decide on several next steps.", "I didn\u2019t know much about the business and functionalities implemented, however as a software developer, I had worked on Oracle Ebusiness Suite for the past six years so I was comfortable working on such requirements.", "To give an example, this was one requirement regarding the client\u2019s trial order business that I got in the beginning. Our client would give some pieces of equipment to their clients on a trial basis for free, hoping that after the trial period clients will convert into actual sales.", "The requirement for me was to do some analytics\u200a\u2014\u200ahow many trial orders were placed by the top ten customers in the past year and how many of them were converted to real orders within three months of placing them, reasons for non-conversion, what can I find out when there was faster conversion, etc.", "This would then allow the management to find patterns and come up with ideas to increase the trial conversion rates to increase the revenue. This was a one-time activity.", "When I looked at the problem, it looked so simple. The solution I came up with was to write an SQL query to extract the data from Oracle DB and do analysis further.", "Writing the SQL query was easy. You just need to identify the tables that store this information, identify the primary and foreign keys, and join them with a where clause with all the filter criteria each record needs to satisfy, optimize for excellent performance, and execute it. There you go, you get results.", "I wrote the SQL query. I had written hundreds of them prior to it,\u00a0so I knew the nuances involved even in simple queries, and I took care of all of that. I ensured the optimizer used the indexes for better performance, etc.", "But when I executed the query in TOAD, the query didn\u2019t result in any records. In fact, query execution didn\u2019t complete. It took time; the performance was poor, and I just had to wait. I waited for a few mins, then a few more mins, then a few more. The result would not come in.", "I lost patience after a while and canceled the query and tried tweaking it a bit. I reviewed the query again to make sure everything was right, re-executed it. Still, I could not get the results.", "Since I was new to the project, I didn\u2019t know the size of the database, didn\u2019t know much about the business scenario, how many records it had to process. That\u2019s what happens when you work for a new client, but I needed the result in quick time. I had just reviewed it technically, and I was sure I was not missing anything. The execution plan was looking good, however, the query kept on executing and wouldn\u2019t finish.", "This was a one-time data extraction requirement, and they needed it quickly and I was getting late. I tried for three-four hours and I still could not complete it. I struggled.", "I reviewed the query with one of my colleagues who was working on the project for a little more time than I. He also said that the query seemed to be correct. It should have worked.", "I reviewed it from all angles, and it looked fine. Probably, the data it had to fetch was so much, that\u2019s why the performance was poor. I tried rewriting the query a few times, but I still didn\u2019t get the data till the end of the day.", "My team lead asked for an update end of the day. I told him I had completed the query, but also explained the challenges I was facing to get the result.", "He pulled his chair over and sat right next to me. He took my keyboard and started reviewing the query I had written. Yes, the query was correct. But after reviewing carefully for five more minutes, he said, which I still remember.", "\u201cYou are trying to do too many things at once in one query. Break it down.\u201d", "He then told, \u201cLet me show you how.\u201d", "He sat with me and reworked the SQL query I had written. The process went on something like this:", "It surprised me in the beginning as I could not get my head around what was he trying to do and why was he creating so many temporary tables? I didn\u2019t realize he was breaking it down to such tiny parts, which then hardly took any time to execute.", "We got a fantastic result in half an hour. I realized the importance of breaking it down.", "I learned something new that day. It was an outstanding result in a quick time of half an hour which I could not do in an entire day.", "My team lead had taught me something simple yet profound. Was it the best way to fetch the data? Probably not. But did it work? Yes, totally.", "When I reflected on the day, I learned three key lessons.", "This is the same principle of Kaizen which focuses on continuous tiny improvements, by asking small questions, taking small actions, solving small problems resulting in larger outcomes.", "Understand what is the problem. Ask questions, even the basic ones, what, why, when, how, who, and invert also \u2014 like, why not. Try to come up with options to solve. But the key is not to get overwhelmed. Try to break the problem into easily manageable parts. Even after breaking down, if the problem is still complex, break it down even further. When it is so tiny, you can solve it so easily and instead of the fear response mind comes up with an excitement response. Solve each of them independently.", "We can apply the same principle to problems in most of the areas: be it in business, in management, to our habits, to our health and fitness, to our relationships, or to our long-term goals.", "Simplifying a complex problem is difficult, but once we take time to do that, it works great. Often, one step at a time can take us very far.", "I usually prefer a pen and paper to do this. I can write it down, scratch, put boxes, circles, connect, change, rewrite. It gives me a lot of options and it forces me to think well. Check and see what works for you.", "I used the same approach for several more years when I worked in another merger and acquisition scenario where data cleansing and data migration were key requirements for the client. Not only for data analytics problems, but I applied the principle for many complex problems as well, and has been useful for me.", "Sometimes, we just need a reminder to use simple approaches to take our skills and effectiveness to a much higher level \u2014 be in design, programming, problem-solving, career, and in life. I hope that this post just did that for you.", "So, the next time when you struggle to solve a problem, think of \u2014 \u201cHow can I break this problem into smaller parts.\u201d It might just turn out to be the approach that you were looking for.", "Your home for data science.
