In a nutshell, p value is a measure of extremeness or unlikelihood. The unlikelihood of an event helps us make informed decisions rather than random choices.", "In order to understand the importance of p value, we should get familiar with two key terms which are population and sample.", "It is not always feasible or possible to do analysis on population because we cannot collect all the data of a population. Therefore, we use samples.", "What p value provides is the ability to evaluate or compare populations based on sample statistics. Thus, P value can be thought as a bridge between population and sample.", "I prefer to explain this kind of concepts around real-life examples which I think makes it easier to comprehend the topic.", "Consider you and your friend created a website. You are not happy with the current design and want to make some changes. You tell your friend that if you make some changes in the design, more people will click on the website and you will earn more money through ads. However, your friend thinks this is a waste of time and changing the design will not increase the click through rate (CTR).", "Since you cannot come to an agreement, you want to run a test. By the way, this kind of test is called hypothesis testing where you compare null and alternative hypotheses.", "But, how long do you need to run the test for? The population in this case is all the people who visit your website from the date you start the test until forever. This data is impossible to collect. Thus, you collect samples that represent populations. You run the test for 30 days and record CTRs separately for each day. Now, you have 30 samples for both populations. Why 30? We will get to that later on.", "Each day is a sample. The value at each day is the average CTR at that day (i.e. a sample mean).", "You take the average for 30 days and see that the 30 day-average of CTR for new design is higher than that of current design. You ask your friend to immediately change the design of the website because new design increases the traffic. Your friend responds:", "Your friend suggests to do a statistical significance test and check the p value in order to understand if the results are statistically significant.", "Statistical significance test measures whether test results from a sample are likely to apply to the entire population.", "It is time to introduce some new concepts.", "Two terms that describe a normal distribution are mean and standard deviation. Mean is the average value that has the highest probability to be observed. Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the values are. As standard deviation increases, the normal distribution curve gets wider. The y axis shows the probability for values to be observed.", "Normal distribution is used to represent random variables with unknown distributions. Thus, it is widely used in many fields including natural and social sciences. The reason to justify why it can used to represent random variables with unknown distributions is the central limit theorem (CLT).", "According to the CLT, as we take more samples from a distribution, the sample averages will tend towards a normal distribution regardless of the population distribution. Typically, if we have 30 or more samples, we can assume our data is normally distributed. That is the reason why we run the test for 30 days.", "You assume the data is normally distributed and so distribution function of sample means from the current version is as follows:", "Note: To draw a normal distribution, you just need to know the mean and the standard deviation. You can calculate these using the 30 sample means you collected.", "The average of sample means seems to be 10 so it is more likely to observe values around 10. For instance, it is not suprising to have a CTR of 11 as it has a high probability. However, it would be an extreme result to obtain a value of 16.5 because it has very low probability according to our distribution function.", "If the average of sample means from the new design has a very low probability to be observed according to the distribution of current design, we can conclude that the result from the new design did not occur by random chance. If the result is not likely to be observed by random chance, we say that the results are statistically significant. In order to determine statistical significance, we use p values. P-value is the probability of getting our observed value or values that have same or less chance to be observed.", "Assume the average of sample means from the new design is 12.5. Since its a continuous function, the probability of a range is the area under the function curve. Thus, the p value for 12.5 is the green area in the graph above. The green area indicates the probability of getting 12.5 or a more extreme value (higher than 12.5 in our case).", "Let\u2019s say the p value is 0.11 but how do we interpret it? A p value of 0.11 means that we are 89% sure of the results. In other words, there is 11% chance that the results are due to random chance. Similarly, a p value of 0.5 means that there is 5% chance that the results are due to random chance.", "Lower p values show more certainty in the result.", "To make a decision based on p values, we need to set a confidence level which indicates how sure we want to be of the results. If we set the confidence level as 95%, the significance value is 0.05. In this case, for a test to be statistically significant, p-value must be lower than 0.05.", "If you and your friend set the confidence level as 95% and find a p value of 0.11, your results are not statistically significant. You conclude that the average from the new design is higher due to random chance. Thus, you do not change the design.", "If the average of sample means from the new design turns out to be 15 which is a more extreme value, the p value will be lower than 0.11.", "As we can see, p value is much smaller than the previous one. Assume the p value is now 0.02. Thus, according to the confidence level of 95%, this p value indicates the results are statistically significant.", "One important point to mention is that we are testing if the result of new design is higher than the result of current design. Thus, when calculating the probability of more extreme values, we only consider the values on the right side. If we test whether the results are different, we need to consider both sides of the distribution function.", "Thank you for reading.
