A data scientist develops an algorithm, a model, or a machine learning pipeline, and then an engineer, often from another team, is responsible for putting the data scientist\u2019s code in production.", "Such a pattern of development attempts to solve for the following:", "However, there are numerous pitfalls in the over-the-wall development pattern that can be avoided with proper planning and resourcing.", "A data scientist writes some code and spends a lot of time to get it to behave correctly. For example, the code may assemble data in a certain way and build a machine learning model that performs well on test data. Getting to this point is where data scientists spend most of their time iterating over the code and the data. The work product could be a set of scripts, or a Jupyter or RStudio notebook containing code snippets, documentation, and reproducible test results. In the extreme, the data scientist produces a document detailing the algorithm, using mathematical formulas and references to library calls, and doesn\u2019t even give any code to the engineering team.", "At this point, the code is thrown over the wall to Engineering.", "An engineer is then tasked with productionizing the data scientist\u2019s code. If the data scientist used R, and the production applications use Java, that could be a real challenge that in the worst case leads to rewriting everything in a different language. Even in a common and much simpler case of Python on both sides, the engineer may want to rewrite the code to satisfy coding standards, add tests, optimize it for performance, etc. As a result, the ownership of the production code lies with the engineer, and the data scientist can\u2019t modify it.", "This is, of course, an oversimplification, and there are many variations of such a process.", "Let\u2019s assume that the engineer successfully built the new code, the data scientist compared its results to the results of their own code, and the new code is released to production. Time goes by, and the data scientist needs to change something in the algorithm. The data engineer in the meantime moved on to other projects. Changing the algorithm in production becomes a lengthy process, involving waiting for an engineer (hopefully the same one) to become available. In many cases, after going through the process a couple of times, the data scientist simply gives up, and only critical updates are ever released.", "Such interaction between data science and engineering frustrates data scientists because it makes it hard to make changes and strips them of ownership of the final code. It also makes it very difficult to troubleshoot production issues. It is also frustrating for engineers because they feel that they are excluded from the original design, don\u2019t participate in the most interesting part of the project, and have to fix someone else\u2019s code. The frustration on both sides makes the whole process even more difficult.", "The need for over-the-wall data science can be eliminated entirely if data scientists are self-sufficient and can safely deploy their own code to production. This can be achieved by minimizing the footprint of data scientist\u2019s code on production systems and by making engineers part of the AI system design and development process upfront. AI system development is a team sport, and both engineers and data scientists are required for success. Hiring and resource allocation must take that into account.", "Involving engineering early in the data science projects avoids the \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d mentality, makes the product much better, and encourages knowledge sharing. Even when a fully cross-functional team of engineers and data scientists is not practical, forming a project team working together towards a common goal solves most of the problems of over-the-wall data science.", "In the end, data scientists should own the logic of the AI code in the production application, and that logic needs to be isolated in the application so that data scientists could modify it themselves. In order to do so, data scientists must follow the same best practices as engineers. For example, writing unit and integration tests may feel like a lot of overhead for data scientists at first, however, the value of knowing that your code still works after you\u2019ve made a change soon overcomes that feeling. Also, engineers must be part of the data scientists\u2019 code review process to make sure the code is of production quality and there are no scalability or other issues.", "Engineers should build production-ready reusable components and wrappers, testing, deployment, and monitoring tools, as well as infrastructure and automation for data science-related code. Data scientists can then focus on a much smaller portion of the code containing the main logic of the AI application. When the tooling is not in place, data scientists tend to spend much of their time on building the tools themselves.", "The production environment is one of the constraints on the types of acceptable machine learning packages, algorithms, and languages. This constraint has to be enforced at the beginning of the project to avoid rewrites. A number of companies are offering production-oriented data science platforms and AI model deployment strategies both in open source and commercial products. These products, such as TensorFlow and H2O.ai, help solve the problem of a production environment being very different from that normally used by data scientists.", "This post first appeared on the Life Around Data blog.
