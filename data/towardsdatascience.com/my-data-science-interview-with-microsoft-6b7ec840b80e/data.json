This year, it was the first time that Microsoft offered any Data Science Internship for pre-final year undergraduate students.", "Microsoft set the requirements as follows:-", "All the eligible students had to fill the Internship application form on the Microsoft Career website with a resume. Students who had filled the application form received the test link within 1\u20132 days.", "About 60\u201370 students give the test for the internship, conducted on the mettl platform. The duration of the test was 1 hour. The test consists of 62 Multiple Choice Questions, which touches almost every aspect of machine learning. There was no information about the marking scheme for the test.", "The key points takeaways from the online test were:", "I was able to complete about 50 out of 62 questions in the 1 hour time.", "Since I didn\u2019t know much about Recommender Systems and LDA algorithms, so I wasn\u2019t able to answer those questions in addition to questions on Convex optimization(about 2\u20133 in number).", "Microsoft didn\u2019t release the exact results for the test but released a list of 6 students shortlisted for the interviews, including me!", "I had about a day to prepare for the interview and had no idea about a Data Science Interview. I took some help from seniors and revised the online test concepts (mostly traditional machine learning algorithms) from Stanford CS229 notes. In addition to this, I also reviewed everything about the projects on my resume.", "Interviews were taken online on the Microsoft Teams platform due to COVID-19, and there was a total of 3 rounds of technical interviews for each candidate.", "At first, the interviewer asked me to introduce myself and speak about my interests in which I talked about my interests in computer vision.", "I was asked the following questions:-", "I was able to answer all the questions except for the working of SVMs, in which I was able to explain up to margins and kernel functions but as not able to explain the convex optimization part. I explained the answers by illustrating the algorithms on a shared screen.", "He then asked me if I have any questions. I then asked about some data science use cases in Microsoft. And the interview was over. The entire interview took about 45 minutes.", "Three students made it to the second round, which took place after a couple of hours.", "I revised SVM during the time between the 1st and 2nd rounds.", "This round was similar to round 1, but the interviewer asked a significant number of NLP(Natural Language Processing) questions.", "The round starts similarly with introducing myself and my interests.", "I was asked the following questions:-", "I answered most of the questions in the interview, except the mathematical equations involved in SVMs. The interviewer seemed satisfied with most of my answers. I explained the answers by illustrating the algorithms on a shared screen.", "She then asked me if I have any questions. I then asked the same question as round 1. The entire interview took about 45 minutes.", "The interviewer didn\u2019t have a Data Science background, so he asked me questions on Data Structures & Algorithms. But he mentioned that it wouldn\u2019t be hard since the interview was for a data science role.", "The interview starts with the formal introduction, and he asked me to introduce myself as usual.", "I was asked the following questions:-", "I could not answer the first question correctly, so the interviewer modified it to 2nd question, which I answered correctly and coded in a shared screen. He seemed satisfied by the answer to the 2nd question.", "He then asked me the 3rd question, which I answered using the 2-pointer technique, and I coded the solution after explaining to him. He seemed satisfied with the answer.", "The interviewer then modified the question to the 4th question. I changed the loop and added some if-else statements in the loop. After the interview discussed some edge cases in which the solution will fail, I then modified the code to accommodate edge cases. The interviewer seemed satisfied with the answer.", "He then asked if I have any questions, then I asked him about Microsoft's work culture and the work he does at the company. After this, the interview was over. The whole interview took 45 minutes.", "I was very confident about my performance in the first two rounds but was a little unsure of my performance in the 3rd round since I was pretty weak in Data Structures and Algorithms.", "After three days, Microsoft declared the internship position results, and three students received the offer, and I was one of them!", "I will now intern at one of the offices at Microsoft India during May 2021-July 2021.", "Feel free to connect on LinkedIn in case of any questions.", "Your home for data science.
