They are the elements that designers use to explore and ultimately manifest solutions to the problems they\u2019re called upon to solve. Whether analog or digital, traditional or modern, their form and role in the continuum of design is obvious. Less obvious is the idea that AI, and more specifically machine learning, is also a design material. While we see the impacts of AI on various digital artifacts that impact designers, ranging from the increasing power of common design tools like the Adobe Creative Cloud to emerging platforms like mixed realities, AI itself is usually thought of as a material for software engineers. More, the recent evolution of machine learning is still in the discovery phase of new capabilities and inventions. We\u2019re a long way away from standardized libraries and plug-ins that can be applied by designers in ways similar to the fonts, photos, and icons are today.", "Josh Clark is the founder and principal at Big Medium, a New York design studio specializing in future-friendly interfaces for artificial intelligence, connected devices, and responsive Web sites. Clark has spoken and published around the world on his notion that designers should view AI as their newest design material. AI in general, and machine learning in particular, offer a compelling array of features and opportunities for designers to innovate and improve their designed experiences in important ways. While Clark\u2019s thesis that AI is a new material for design is compelling, his idea that it is an available design material now, today, is a counter-intuitive claim \u2014 which makes it all the more interesting.", "\u201cAll designers work with some sort of a material. HTML and CSS are design materials, \u2026 data and the visualization of it is a design material,\u201d says Clark. \u201cAnd, as with all those things, every material has certain strengths and weaknesses. In the same way that I think of a machinist or a woodworker working with the physical material and learning what it can do, what its boundaries are, I think that it\u2019s useful to think about the same thing with machine learning.\u201d", "The metaphor of machine learning as a new design material is a smart one. It helps to demystify AI, and also to frame it as something that is in our general purview of use. It\u2019s not just something for big companies and wizard engineers to tame as part of an elaborate show. It is something that can practically impact many different experiences. Designers, whose core expertise is, or at least should be, creating for the benefit of the user experience, thus have remarkable potential to get to know machine learning technologies, understand their contexts of use, and lead the creation of products, services, and experiences that make our lives better in meaningful ways. More than merely connecting us to the technology, designers can now shape technology that makes our lives better. It\u2019s an exciting opportunity.", "\u201cFor a lot of designers there\u2019s been an assumption that machine learning and artificial intelligence is the domain of data scientists or algorithm engineers, that there may not even be a role for designers,\u201d says Clark. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more clear to me, the more that I work with products that are powered by machine learning, that there\u2019s a huge role for designers, and it very much is a design material that we urgently need some designerly attention given to.\u201d", "Clark details five ways that designers can use AI in software products \u2014 for recommendation, prediction, classification, clustering, and generation. \u201c[AI] is ready to be used in everyday products, sometimes in small ways,\u201d says Clark. \u201cI think that as machine learning becomes more and more prevalent, as we\u2019re already starting to see happen, and as more and more designers and developers realize that this is a tool that you can have in your kit, it will be as common to sprinkle a little machine learning, a little intelligence into an interface as it is to sprinkle a little JavaScript, a little interaction into a webpage.\u201d", "Clark\u2019s perspective helps to, not just further demystify AI usage, but also practically contextualize it. To that point, the first three of these ways in which designers can leverage AI \u2014 recommendation, prediction and classification \u2014 have been considerations in website and software design going back to the early days. AI enhances these functions, but these are not new approaches, rather an important evolution in the way the functions now operate. Whereas designers in the past were creating literal and static forms, now they can offer dynamic interactions which \u2014 when skillfully applied \u2014 much improve the user experience. Clark provides some examples of AI use for recommendation, prediction, and classification in products today:", "\u201c[For example], Slack for teams, for big enterprise organizations, lets you search for people who are experts in something. You can type in something like \u2018human resources\u2019 for example, and it would show the people who talk a lot about human resources. It\u2019s more than a brute force text search. It [provides] recommendations around concepts,\u201d says Clark.", "\u201cPrediction is based on historical data: \u2018Here\u2019s the thing that\u2019s most likely to happen next\u2019. \u2026 In Google\u2019s Gmail feature, it will suggest a word or phrase that will come next, just this little bit of intelligence that you can sprinkle into the application to make that better.\u201d", "\u201cA third application [of AI] is classification and that\u2019s really where you\u2019re teaching the machines to match an event or an object or a photo, or a phrase to some sort of classification, some category,\u201d says Clark. \u201cOne example of this that we see in everyday products is in Google Forms, Google survey tool, which lets you build surveys by typing in questions and choosing an answer. \u2026 Years ago Google added a little bit of machine learning to that so that when you type the question, it defaults to what it believes to be the most likely classification of that answer.\u201d", "Clark next describes the AI functions of clustering and generation, which have the potential to provide immense power for new software.", "\u201cWith clustering, you give the machines a whole bunch of information and it begins to define what the categories are. It recognizes \u2018here\u2019s baseline\u2019, \u2018here\u2019s normal\u2019, and \u2018here\u2019s a whole bunch of things that differ from normal in some interesting or like way\u2019,\u201d says Clark. \u201cOne example of that is a system called Deep Patient, which took thousands and thousands of medical records and poured over them to find patterns.\u201d Deep Patient was able to predict, about two years earlier than most human doctors, the onset of schizophrenia. \u201cYou can use [Deep Patient] to guide human attention,\u201d says Clark. But, it\u2019s not meant to be a substitute for a doctor\u2019s judgment.", "\u201cI think one of the interesting things about this though is that we don\u2019t really understand how or why the machines do this clustering. So, in the case of Deep Patient and schizophrenia, you might think, \u2018Oh, this is great. This will give us new understanding into how schizophrenia works.\u2019 But it actually doesn\u2019t.\u201d Deep Patient processes all of the patient records, but we don\u2019t actually know how it arrived at that result. \u201cAnd even the people who created the system don\u2019t understand it,\u201d says Clark. \u201cSo, it\u2019s this tricky thing.\u201d We have the information, but we don\u2019t know how it was arrived at.", "\u201cI know several curators who are running their museum\u2019s or institute\u2019s art collections through systems like this and letting machines start to cluster and group them,\u201d says Clark \u201cAnd the machines do it in ways that are not like human curators would do. They don\u2019t match up to the formal schools of art or periods that we think about art more traditionally, but they are still grouped in interesting ways. At the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, when they ran their collection through an image recognition search and started to find, for example, artworks that map to the notion of an angel. It found things that definitely were not angels, including sculpture and vases and sort of some odd things like that, but also things that were also not exactly an angel.\u201d", "\u201cYou might think, \u2018Well, that\u2019s not very useful\u2019. \u2026 But, the curators actually looked at it as something that was productive friction, that the machines are strange and they see the world in different ways. They don\u2019t categorize things the way that we necessarily would as human beings. But, that also lets us see the world in new ways that we wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to see,\u201d says Clark. Productive friction is a useful term: AI can approach problems from a novel perspective, and, while some of the results may not be useful, there can also be ingenious and unexpected discoveries.", "Machines can also begin to generate content on our behalf. For instance, FaceApp, a mobile photo editing application, can, among other things, take your picture and, using neural networks, make you look decades older, in a very realistic and convincing way. \u201cThat\u2019s an example of generation,\u201d says Clark, \u201cwhether it\u2019s creating art or writing sentences or creating visualizations \u2014 this idea that the machines can begin to do some kind of creation. And, as a designer, that\u2019s something that I\u2019m interested in. And I\u2019m actually already seeing machines taking over some of the more rote production oriented aspects of my work.\u201d An example of AI-enabled generation for design can be found in Uizard, an application that enables designers to take a picture of their sketch and then generate a full design in HTML, mapping the familiar symbols of wireframes into complete design patterns.", "Clustering and generation begin to feel more like actual intelligence, where the AI is not just improving things we are familiar with in convenient ways, but providing an extra layer of processing beyond what a designer could have imagined before.", "What machine learning is perhaps best at is detecting patterns. In this context, Clark proposes that four functions become possible \u2014 asking better questions and getting better answers, asking completely different types of questions, accessing new kinds of data, and surfacing invisible patterns.", "With AI, we can get better at answering questions and doing it in a more efficient and informed way. For example, rather than brute force matches of a search phrase, AI can enable the creation of semantic vectors around concepts. Further, AI can enable us to ask entirely new kinds of questions. \u201cInstead of searching just for text or for concepts, we are able to search for emotion now,\u201d says Clark. \u201cImagine somebody at a call center, for example. Instead of receiving things in chronological order \u2026 you can actually now look for urgent e-mails, [in which] the phrasing is urgent or angry or upset.\u201d In this example, the AI\u2019s ability to understand and categorize content enables the operator to control their daily workload, proactively directing incoming traffic and workflow around a variety of categories.", "Because machines are now able to understand all of the messy ways in which people communicate with each other \u2014 what we\u2019re taking pictures of, what our speech is, and what our handwriting says \u2014 AI enables us to access new kinds of data. \u201cAll of these things that used to be completely opaque to the machines are now machine readable and understandable,\u201d says Clark. \u201cThat means that we can mine that for data and for insight, but it also means that we can use those new sources of data as platforms of interaction.\u201d", "AI enables us to surface invisible patterns. \u201cThe machines are able to see things that we simply can\u2019t, in part because they\u2019re able to go through and make sense of such a vast amount of data and find patterns that were otherwise lost \u2026 and we weren\u2019t able to spot ourselves,\u201d says Clark. \u201cIt turns out that in many cases, the machines are actually pretty terrible at some of the things that we most care about as human beings,\u201d says Clark. \u201cBut they\u2019re great at the things that we often don\u2019t like to do, the things that are repetitive or error prone or joyless tasks. They\u2019re really good at spotting patterns that we don\u2019t spot well. So, I think part of the work of design is to figure out the point in a user journey where the machines can actually be helpful and showing insight that we would not have spotted.\u201d", "Clark describes how this human-machine collaboration can ideally work. \u201cI was working with a healthcare company that was trying to figure out how to use machine learning to help radiologists do their job better. Radiologists look at images and X-rays to identify problems in our bodies \u2014 masses or other problems. And, much of their work is actually spent looking at things where there are no problems,\u201d says Clark. \u201cIt\u2019s this huge amount of work and volume of looking at image after image after image, until they have something that actually does engage their expertise. So, one of the things, for example, that machine learning can do is triage, obviously with a very high degree of sensitivity. We don\u2019t want to have any false negatives where the machines pass on something that is there that is important. The idea is that the machines can do a pass and bring the interesting cases to the humans \u2014 not do the humans\u2019 work, but let the humans do what they do best.\u2019 And that is the real opportunity for designers, not just to automate, but to extrapolate what is possible thanks to those new opportunities and even to reimagine larger aspects of the overall system", "Clark has significant concerns about data, the raw material that powers so much of machine learning. \u201cI think that we have to be conscious, not just of how we use data, but how as designers we can educate people to be smarter about data, to understand how it\u2019s being used and to what end,\u201d says Clark. \u201cAnd I think that it\u2019s incumbent on us to be really transparent about how we\u2019re using data. And, I don\u2019t mean that we should put it into the Terms of Use that you have to read thousands and thousands of words of information to be able to use a service.\u201d", "\u201cThere are a lot of times when people and companies say, \u2018Well, you know, if we tell people what we\u2019re doing with their data, they\u2019re not going to want to use our service,\u2019 says Clark. \u201cAnd I think that should be a huge red flag that if you are saying that, then you probably shouldn\u2019t be doing that thing.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years how things can go wrong, how bias can creep into systems in unpleasant ways, how these systems can be used in cynical ways by foreign governments to manipulate democracy by corporations, to take advantage of people who believe that they\u2019re customers who are actually being served by the company, when in fact they are serving the company.\u201d", "\u201cThe risk of this, for all of the power and promise of machine learning, is that it will quickly reinforce inequalities and magnify gaps, because the people who are using the technology are the ones who will be able to get the most \u2026 benefit from it. And then it gets into this very vicious and worrying cycle,\u201d says Clark.", "\u201cI choose to be optimistic. I see that these are powerful tools that can be used for good and for bad. And, I think that that\u2019s all the more reason why we need designers and people who really, care about the human experience to be involved in these things, so that they don\u2019t just serve more cynical powers. I think that this is a time when all of us have to choose to be optimistic and to lean into that and, and to bring appropriate skepticism and awareness of how things could go wrong, but also to bring a sense of possibility to these really kind of powerful and exciting new tools.\u201d", "Creative Next is a podcast exploring the impact of AI-driven automation on the lives of creative workers, people like writers, researchers, artists, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs.
