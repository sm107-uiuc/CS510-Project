In this article, I will give a step-by-step tutorial on how to visualize real-time Google Form responses in Streamlit dashboard, starting from importing responses in google sheets until the deployment of the dashboard. There will be 8 steps in total as shown in the above flowchart.", "In order to be able to generate the credentials, first thing first you have to create a new project in your Google API Console.", "After you click \u201cNew Project\u201d, you have to specify the name of your project. Leave the location as default. Then, click \u201cCreate\u201d to create your new project.", "After finished creating your new project, you will see the dashboard showing the project info, API request info, etc. At the top of the dashboard, there is a search bar for APIs and Services. Inside the search bar, search for Google Drive API and choose it.", "Then, you have to enable that API so that we can access resources from the newly created project\u2019s Google Drive.", "Once the API has been enabled, you will see the API dashboard and what you have to do now is to create the credentials.", "Then, choose the Google Drive API option for the first question, then choose Web server option for the second question. Third, choose Application data and lastly choose \u201cNo, I\u2019m not using them\u201d for the last question.", "Next step is to give a service account name and choose the Editor role. You can find the Editor role under the \u201cProject\u201d category. Choose JSON as the Key type. After you click Continue, the JSON file will be downloaded.", "Open the JSON file with your favourite text editor. Here, I\u2019m using Sublime Text 3 to open the JSON file. Inside the file, you can find the \u201cclient_email\u201d key. You have to copy the value of that key and then we can move on to the next part.", "Besides enabling the Google Drive API, you have to also enable the Google Sheets API. Simply search \u2018Google Sheets API\u2019 in the same search bar when you search for \u2018Google Drive API\u2019, then click \u2018Enable\u2019.", "Once you already copy the \u201cclient_email\u201d value from the JSON file, you can simply share the Google Form responses (Google Sheets) to that email.", "Enough with the setup with UI. Let\u2019s start with the code! First, you have to install the dependencies for importing the Google Form responses. There are 6 packages that need to be installed: gspread, OAuth2Client, pandas, time, streamlit, and altair. I\u2019m using Python 3.6.7 in this tutorial.", "Now, you have to create a python script for importing the google form responses data to your computer. In this tutorial, I named the python script as scrap_form_data.py. Please make sure that you move the downloaded JSON file inside the same folder with the python script. Then, you can import the packages and authorize the credentials. Note that you also have to change the JSON filename based on your filename.", "Let\u2019s assume you made a survey to know whether someone has been tested for COVID-19 or not. There are 2 types of survey spread. The first type is asking if one has been tested using PCR Test or not, while the second type is using Rapid Test. In this tutorial, I generate the dummy data for both survey responses types and store it in Google Sheets. Below is the snippet of the generated dummy data and the script to import the data.", "Sometimes we also have to do some data preprocessing first before generating the final data. Below I give some examples of data preprocessing could be done.", "Here is the full code of scrap_form_data.py script.", "Streamlit\u2019s open-source app framework is the easiest way for data scientists and machine learning engineers to create beautiful, performant apps in only a few hours! All in pure Python. All for free.", "There are many great articles out there ([1] [2] [3]) that explains how to build a dashboard using Streamlit. I suggest you read those great articles first before continuing into this section. Here, I give the snippet of what the dashboard will look like and also the main function of the code to build the dashboard. You can see the full code in the repo attached at the end of this article.", "In this tutorial, I use AWS EC2 to deploy the dashboard. To do this, you can simply rent an AWS EC2 instance and run the following command inside tmux so that the dashboard will always online.", "Then you can copy the \u2018External URL\u2019 link and open it in your favourite browser. There is a great article here which explain how to deploy the Streamlit Dashboard in AWS EC2 Free Instance.", "Since we want our dashboard to be a real-time dashboard, we have to import the data in real-time as well, or in this case, maybe we can say in near-real-time. What you have to do is run this bash script inside the tmux as well. It will update the data in the dashboard every 10 minutes.", "You can find all of the codes used in this article here.", "Louis Owen is a Data Science enthusiast who always hungry for new knowledge. He pursued a Mathematics major at one of the top university in Indonesia, Institut Teknologi Bandung, under the full final-year scholarship.", "Louis has experienced as an analytics/machine learning intern in various field of industry, including OTA (Traveloka), e-Commerce (Tokopedia), FinTech (Do-it), Smart City App (Qlue Smart City) and currently as a Data Science Consultant at The World Bank.", "Check out Louis\u2019 website to know more about him!
