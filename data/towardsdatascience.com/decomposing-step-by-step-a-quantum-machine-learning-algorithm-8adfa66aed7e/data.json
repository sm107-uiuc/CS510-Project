There is actually a debate between Google who claims that the task would need 10,000 years on a classical computer, and IBM who says it can be achieved in a few hours. In all cases, the quantum computers took a few minutes, so this is a proof of the potential of the technology.", "In this article, I am interested in explaining how Quantum Computing can be used for Machine Learning.", "I will show how to build a simple binary classifier with a 2 qubits quantum computer.", "In a first section, I cover the basics of quantum computing for the readers who are not familiar with it.

Measuring these characteristics will however leads to a single value, with the associated probability. This is called a measurement.", "For example, an electron is not either spin-up or spin-down, but rather spin-up with 0.5 probability or spin-down with 0.5 probability. The result of the measurement of the spin will be spin up 50% of the time, and spin-down 50% of the time.", "This combination of probabilities associated to different states is called quantum states. You should consider a quantum system as a dice. The dice has no fixed value, and you are only allowed to throw it and read the result. You will say then that the state of the dice is 1,2,3,4,5,6 each with probability 1/6. If you consider a rigged dice with 0.5 probability of obtaining 6, you will say that the state of the dice is 1,2,3,4,5 with probability 0.1 and 6 with probability 0.5.", "The popular example of quantum state is the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, which can be dead or alive with some probability.

It means that with 300 qubits, you can have more states than the number of atoms in the universe!! This is a key element of the potential of quantum computing.", "A general quantum state of n qubits is then a complex vector which sum of square modules equals to 1.", "Quantum states are also noted in vector format, as in the below examples. One can see that the norm square is always equal to 1, hence the constants 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(3).", "Once we have quantum states, it would be nice to perform operations on it. This is the job of quantum operators.", "Quantum operators are linear operators on quantum states, therefore they can be represented by a complex matrix A. Furthermore, they are unitary, which means that the inverse of A is its conjugate transpose, noted A\u2020.", "This property assures that the output of a quantum operator remains a quantum state, which means that the sum of the square module of amplitudes is 1.", "Quantum operators are also called quantum gates, similarly to classical computing. Programming a quantum computer is writing a sequence of gates to be performed on qubits.", "Two examples of basic gates acting on one qubit are the NOT gate noted X and the Hadamard gate, noted H.", "The X gate flips the the qubit (similarly to classical NOT gate) and the H gate creates an equal superposition state of the qubit (no equivalent in classical computing). We have the following identities:", "We have seen so far that quantum states are discrete probability distributions and quantum operators can make linear operations on these distributions. One can also sample from the distribution by measuring the state.", "Creating a distribution, make computations and sampling from it can also be done by a classical computer (with numpy.random for example). This not immediate however, and requires several hidden intermediate steps (creating a pseudo random integer generator, sampling from a uniform law, taking the inverse of cdf, etc). All this process is generally costly.", "A quantum computer is then a physical device that will make for you all these probabilistic operations in a cheap way, exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics.", "The basic operations of classical bits is to make 1+1, 0+0, 1+0, flipping a bit, etc. With this set of basic operations, you are able to code the addition of two integers then the multiplication, and every other algorithm follows.", "The basic operations of a quantum computer is to create a dice, throwing it and reading the results. From there, you create many other algorithms. And these algorithms can sometimes provide a tremendous speed-up for the same operation executed on a classical computer.", "The core of Computer Science is dividing problems into simple steps and giving it to a machine that will perform these simple steps very fast. With Quantum Computing, you divide your problem into other steps than you used to, which quantum computers can execute very fast. And you wish that the overall cost will be lower than the one of a classical computer.", "Many technologies exist, and all hardware providers try their own. It can be electrons trapped in silicon, cold atoms or photons which we manage to control individually. Other approaches like topological qubits use elementary particles only studied in that context.", "In all cases, it boils down to be able to control elementary particles at the individual level. This is very hard, because everything is sensitive to the noise of the environment, and it explains the difficulty to build a quantum computer.", "To summarize, quantum states are complex vectors representing discrete probability distributions.", "Quantum operators are linear operators on these vectors whose output remains a quantum state.", "Measuring a state is sampling from the underlying probability distribution.", "Quantum computers are physical devices which perform these operations faster than a classical computer.", "In a binary classification problem, let\u2019s say labelling an image as a cat or a dog, the goal is to construct a predictor from a training set.

Measuring multiple times allows to estimate the different outcome probabilities.", "Optimizing the circuit is then finding the parameters which will give the closest probabilities to the reality. This step is the same for all ML algorithm, except this time we compute the outcome via quantum measurement.", "We hope that performing all those operations will be cheaper on a quantum computer than a classical one. Concretely, we hope that preparing and measuring quantum states is faster/cheaper than performing matrix products on CPUs and GPUs.", "For the dog/cat classification problem, convolutional neural networks perform tremendously well, and it\u2019s unlikely that quantum computing will be better. But for different configurations, and in high dimensional space, there is a chance that the performance will be better on specific problems.", "One full field of exploration of quantum computing is the use of variational circuits, or parameterized quantum circuits.", "The general idea of parameterized quantum circuits is to create a quantum circuit with tunable parameters, and the effected measurement of this circuit will approximate a quantity of interest.

This is done by classical optimization techniques such as gradient descent.", "We consider a binary classification problem, with an input real vector \ud835\udc65 and a binary output y in {0, 1}.", "We want then to build a quantum circuit whose output is a quantum state", "The proposed algorithm is composed of 3 steps:", "The first step is called the state preparation, it consists into embedding the classical data into a quantum state. There are several ways of doing this, the one used is called amplitude encoding. It consists in mapping the coordinates of a vector into the values of the amplitudes of a quantum state. It requires the vector to be normalized and to have a power of two dimension. When this condition are not fulfilled by the dataset, one can pad and renormalize the vector.", "The state preparation circuit is the following for the readers who are familiar with quantum circuit notation:", "The second step is the model circuit, or the classifier strictly speaking. A parameterized unitary operator U(\ud835\udf03) is created such that |\u03a8(x ; \ud835\udf03)> = U(\ud835\udf03)|\u03d5(x)>. It is a succession of general U (described in the previous subsection) and CNOT gates (more info on the CNOT gate here).", "The final step is the measurement step, which estimates the probability of belonging to a class by performing several measurements. It\u2019s the equivalent of sampling multiple times from the distribution.", "The final circuit is the following:", "The training is performed to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss.", "Batch stochastic gradient descent are used. It is not obvious to compute the gradients of the loss function. Fortunately, they can be estimated via other quantum circuits.", "I don\u2019t go into the details for this part because it is rather technical and it demands more knowledge about quantum computing.

It has been implemented with Qiskit, the framework developed by IBM. The full code and detailed explanations are available here.", "As you see in the figure, the algorithm performs well. It achieves an almost 100% accuracy in the validation set.", "The main inconvenient is that it is very slow, at least on the Qiskit simulator on my average computer. The code can certainly be optimized, but one has to keep in mind that this is only a toy example to validate a general approach. The problem has to be complex enough for quantum computing to be useful.", "Quantum Computing is a totally different computation paradigm. It is a natural way to compute probability distributions on big state spaces and to make linear operations on it.", "This is a great tool for Machine Learning, but we need to wait for better hardware to develop practical use cases.", "Thanks for making it through, there was a lot of information, I tried to make it concise.
