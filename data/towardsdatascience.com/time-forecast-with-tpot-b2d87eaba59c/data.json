Therefore, I decided to try them out, one by one. Today is TPOT\u2019s turn.", "The data set was about predicting engineers of Daimler\u2019s Mercedes-Benz cars speed of testing system, the purpose is to reduce the time that cars spend on testing, with over three hundreds of features. Frankly, I have little or no domain expertise in automobile industry. Regardless, I will try to make the best predictions I can, using TPOT, a Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.", "This data set contains an anonymized set of variables, each representing a custom feature in a Mercedes car.", "The target feature is labeled \u201cy\u201d and represents the time (in seconds) that the car took to pass testing for each variable. The data set can be found here.", "We know what problems we have here: too many features (columns) and not enough rows.", "In addition, we don\u2019t know what those features are except \u201cy\u201d and \u201cID\u201d.", "Target feature \u201cy\u201d is the time (in seconds) that the car took to pass testing for each variable. Let\u2019s see its distribution.", "There is one outlier which was the maximum time at 265 seconds.", "Out of all features, we are having 8 categorical features and 368 integer features. What about the cardinality of the features? The following ideas and scripts were from Mikel Bober Irizar.", "There were 12 features in which only contain a single value (0), these are useless for supervised algorithms, and we will drop them later.", "The rest of our data set is made up of 356 binary features, and 8 categorical features. Let\u2019s explore categorical features first.", "Unfortunately, we did not learn much from the above EDA, this is life. However, we did notice that some categorical features have effects on the \u201cy\u201d and the \u201cX0\u201d seems to have the highest effect.", "After exploring, we now going to encode these categorical features\u2019 levels as digits using Scikit-learn\u2019s MultiLabelBinarizer and treat them as new features.", "We then drop the constant features and categorical features which have been encoded, as well as our target feature \u201cy\u201d.", "We then add the encoded features to form the final data set to be used with TPOT.", "The final data set is in the form of a numpy array, in the shape of (4209, 552).", "It\u2019s time to construct and fit TPOT regressor. When it is finished, TPOT will display the \u201cbest\u201d model (based on test data MSE in our case) hyperparameters, and will also output the pipelines as an execution-ready Python script file for a later use or our investigation.", "Running above code will discover a pipeline as output that achieves 56 mean squared error (MSE) on the test set:", "You may have noticed that MSE is a negative number, according to this thread, it is neg_mean_squared_error for TPOTRegressor that stands for negated value of mean squared error. Let\u2019s try it again.", "So, the difference between our predicted time and the real time is about 7.5 seconds. That\u2019s a pretty good result! And the model that produces this result is one that fits a RandomForestRegressor stacked with KNeighborsRegressor algorithm on the data set.", "Finally, we are going to export this pipeline:", "I enjoyed learning and using TPOT, hope you are the same.
