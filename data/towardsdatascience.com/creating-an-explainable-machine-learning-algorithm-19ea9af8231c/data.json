So goals (1) and (2) weren\u2019t very hard to achieve.", "Identifying stocks to invest in turned out to be very challenging for all the algorithms that I tried. So that is Reason 1.", "Reason 1: To provide a solution to a difficult problem to model with available software.", "Reason 2: If I\u2019m going to invest my money, have skin in the game, I want to understand why the model is picking a certain stock as an investment candidate and not another. What combination of features are driving the decision?", "Reason 3: If the algorithm works and I want to apply it to another problem being able to explain it to an end user can accelerate its acceptance and lower costs. Model development costs include not only the time spent processing the data and estimating model weights, optimizing a function or simulating strategies. They also include testing, monitoring and end user alteration. The alterations & what if questions can include binning data into intervals that are currently in use, preferred or more intuitive or even adding or removing a feature or decision variable from a model.", "Reason 4: By creating your own machine learning algorithm components and features are easy to modify since you\u2019ve written the code yourself.", "Reason 5: After reading, yet again, that \u2018Machine learning models are not useful in industry X because they lack transparency\u2019, I decided to see if I could create a \u2018transparent machine learning model\u2019. I like the challenge of trying to figure things out.", "Reason 6: I like to code.", "When I thought about this I decided to target the easiest to understand useful model \u2014 a scorecard.", "Scorecards, for those not familiar with them, are used in decisions concerning whether or not to grant credit to an applicant. They rank order the risk of default \u2014 higher scores are less risky than lower ones and can be calibrated to odds or probabilities.", "A scorecard building process may include:", "(1) Binning continuous variables (features) into a set of 0/1 inputs.", "(2) Evaluating the predictive power using some metric \u2014 usually information values, sometimes rates.", "(3) Selecting features that will be used to estimate the model. This may be automated or done by the modeler.", "(4) Estimating the model weights using linear regression, logistic regression or mathematical programming.", "(5) Scale or calibrate the score to good / bad odds or probabilities with the weights being scaled up to integers.", "(6) Score the data by summing the weights (now integer points) up for each observation. In credit scoring features are usually referred to as characteristics and the bin of a feature is an attribute. Each feature falls into only 1 attribute bin so scoring is either a table lookup and sum or a matrix multiplication.", "Once the model is estimated it is presented to the end users who usually want other features used as predictors or features in the model binned in a different way that is more intuitive, palatable or in line with business objectives (for example targeting a particular segment of the population). It\u2019s an iterative process that may be made easier by it being easy to understand how the model works.", "To provide a detailed answer we go to the track and ask the question are some horse race bettors smarter than bankers?", "People who bet on horse races may consider these factors:", "Possible model features like those that might be used in a credit risk model for a bank or a stock picking model.", "Banks usually do not optimize returns directly. The payoff odds doesn\u2019t enter into a scorecard but are estimated in a second step often with a linear regression on loss given default. This in spite of the fact that some customers that go into default are profitable \u2014 they go into default after they have paid off most of their credit & some accounts that don\u2019t default aren\u2019t profitable \u2014 they payoff their credit or loan before all the initialization and processing costs are covered.", "Sophisticated horse race bettors use the Kelly Criterion to determine the optimal fraction of their available funds to bet on a race.", "kelly fraction to bet = p minus (1-p) * loss / profit", "where p is the probability of winning and loss / profit is the reciprocal of the payoff odds.", "So, unlike bankers, sophisticated racing bettors have the loss and profit available when they bet and have that ratio baked into their decision for each bet.", "If we were to only estimate the weights for a scorecard to obtain probability estimates or to classify observations we could easily do that using either an explainable model (logistic regression or linear programming, etc.) or a more difficult to explain model (neural net, random forest, etc.).", "All of these models share one thing:", "They produce predictions for the entire population. Their objective function is not targeted at the ultimate goal.", "In the case of selecting candidate stocks to invest in what we are after is a list of N stocks to consider each week for investment and investigate based on their expected return which is related to the Kelly criterion.", "There is a majority of the stock population that we do not care about at all. So why have them considered in the model\u2019s loss function at all?", "We can construct the model so that it computes a score that maximizes or minimizes the number of cases to consider based on their profit and loss and not only their probability of success.", "This is especially important in looking at stocks since stocks with the highest returns may look a lot like the stocks where investment led to disaster.", "We\u2019d like to have an algorithm that passes on high return stocks whose profile of predictive features also includes the higher risk stocks and we would like to have that done by 1 score instead of 2 models.", "I have been unable to find a painting by numbers (great musical interlude at the link) type of algorithm that solves this problem where we want to generate a score that identifies only a subset of the observations and want to optimize that selection with higher scores.", "Step 1: Define the objective function. In the case of stock picking, that\u2019s been done above. Specifically we want to generate 10 stocks each week that have the highest expected return.", "Step 2: Compute the performance of each stock in the model development sample.", "Step 3: From the model development sample select all possible predictive features.", "Step 4: Split the data into model, validation, test and prediction (out of time) segments. Create an index array or list that maps each observation to its segment.", "Step 5: Using the model data, bin each feature, putting any missing values in their own bin. For the feature compute its mutual information value using the performance definition in Step 2. Other measures may be used if desired. Bins should have some minimum number of observations or minimum percent of observations. The binning process is usually not as important as what one assumes as the optimization will still work well with very rough / wide binning intervals.", "Step 6: Based on the results of Step 5, select the set of features that will go into the model dropping those with low information values or other measure of predictive power.", "Step 7: Build the X matrix with 1 column for each bin from Step 5 after the selection of features has been made. The column contains a 0 if the observation is not in the bin and a 1 if it is. This will greatly increase the size of the X matrix which is another reason not to create a lot of bins for a feature. All segments should be in the X matrix, 1 row for every observation.", "Finally we get to the learning part. This is where you can really get creative and test ideas out.", "The approach I took is to implement a modified evolutionary algorithm. There are several to choose from and customize with any adaptation you want to test.", "The basic idea here is to iterate over these steps:", "(1) generate a possible solution (in this case a set of integer scorecard weights).", "(2) score the data using the X matrix and weights", "(3) evaluate the solution (in this case compute the expected returns from the number of stocks to pick every week with the highest scores)", "(4) determine whether and / or how to remember good solutions and forget poorer ones", "(5) explore based on the good solution sets from the memory", "(6) every so often move towards better solutions. This is complicated by the fact that there is an if statement in the optimization function when the top N scoring observations are selected. It is accomplished by evaluating the solutions in memory and determining areas to explore or converge to by adjusting the search area.", "Available approaches that might be tried include:", "Components from other models that might be incorporated into an algorithm:", "There are several hyper-parameters that must be set:", "If an ensemble of models solution is desired it can easily be generated from the model solutions in memory when the algorithm terminates.", "Number of features in model: 30", "Number of columns in X matrix: 134", "Number of unique stock tickers: 535", "Learning model: simple probabilistic search with learning update every 100 iterations", "Sample feature score points and initial values for 2 features are shown below. Here the cut is the floor of the bin with the first bin being all values of the performance of the stock over the last quarter below -31.54%, the last being above 48.58% and missing values getting 0 points.", "We can easily understand that the model likes stocks that went down a lot over the last quarter (they get 19 points) and those that went up more than 1.66% in the last week. It really rewards accounts that went up more than 11.61% in the last week giving them 47 points while it seriously penalizes those going down by more than 5.93%.", "All 30 of the features have points like the 2 in the table as the scorecard displayed is the average score of the ensemble of scores.", "This plot shows the combined expected returns and probability the stock price goes up across different mostly 50 point binned score ranges. The ensemble approach resulted in the following score distribution:", "42% of the observations had a score of 0.", "The number of observations in each of the score bins then declines to the point where the range from 450\u2013499 is the last range with at least 1% of the stock-week observations.", "Finally the 950\u2013999 score range has only 0.45% of the observations scoring that high.", "It\u2019s interesting to see that the model while working on the product of the probability the price goes up * percent price went up minus the probability price goes down * percent price went down still has an almost monotonically increasing probability(up) across the score range while spreading the gap between gain and loss.", "The indexing of the expected loss and gain is computed by dividing the average loss and gain in a bucket by the maximum gain over all the buckets to allow ease of plotting on the same graph.", "Plot of the returns vs. the scores for COUP, a top rated stock.", "Points are the observations at different scores for the top 10 scoring stocks for week 120 over the 52 week model development sample.", "It can be seen that the as scores go up the variation and risk in the return distribution (y axis) is reduced. Also note that the highest return from the top 10 was in the 0 score range \u2014 none of the models in the ensemble picked it as it looked too much like riskier stock-week profiles. Basically the 0 score will have an expected value < the population expected value since both the probability and gain to loss ratio are going up over the score range.", "The vertical black line indicates the score for COUP in the current week when the model was run.", "The model results can be used to estimate targets for individual observations by tabulating the outcomes in the ranges. The first number after target is the expectation if COUP goes down in price at the end of 4 weeks, the second if it goes up and the probability that COUP will go up.", "Machine learning can be incorporated into a flexible simple to understand model namely an integer valued scorecard.", "Doing so allows the modeler to provide a more applicable solution by directly computing the results. It isn\u2019t necessary to estimate classification probabilities, rank order them, then compute a second model to get the magnitude of the impact of a particular observation.", "There are plenty of options concerning what components, solution procedures and regularization to use.", "The opportunity to be creative, for those so inclined, is open.", "A model like this might be used to:", "If you
