Using real estate to clean illicit proceeds in the United States offers several advantages: prices are often stable and likely to appreciate, and the asset is functional. Moreover, all-cash purchases are an effective way to avoid the bank scrutiny involved with obtaining a mortgage, and an LLC can provide anonymity for the true buyer. Thus, real estate provides a simple and direct path for integrating illicit funds into the legitimate financial system.", "Since 20% of current real estate purchases do not involve financing, this type of money-laundering via residential real estate has become a significant focus of the United States Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).\u00b9 As a part of this focus, FinCEN began issuing Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) in January 2016.\u00b2 These GTOs legally oblige title insurance companies to report a real estate transaction if it meets specific criteria.\u00b3 Applied at the county level, they mostly cover gateway cities such as Miami, New York, and Los Angeles. One county covered by a GTO that has always stood out to me is Bexar County, Texas, the county that surrounds San Antonio.", "Bexar County was a part of Mexico until 1836 and maintains strong cultural ties to the north of the country to this day, with weekend commutes commonplace. Under a GTO since July 2016, the county has recently had several high-profile instances of Mexican politicians and white-collar criminals stashing ill-gotten gains in real estate around San Antonio.\u2074 \u2075 As a former investigative analyst, I have experience with a few of these cases, but there are many more than I was initially aware of.", "Therefore, I used publicly available data from the Bexar County property assessor and the state of Texas to build a model capable of detecting criminal investment in residential real estate in the county. [TLDR of results: I labeled a small subset of data, and a semi-supervised approach improved the F1 score from 0.667 to 0.8]", "The Bexar County Appraisal District makes available (on physical CDs!) its yearly appraisal data for purchase for a nominal fee. Because some of the money laundering instances in the county occurred a number of years ago, I acquired four years of data, 2015\u20132019. Each had multiple datasets for over 600,000 properties, and the particular one I used contains 408 features, which I trimmed down in several iterations.", "To engineer potentially useful features concerning property ownership, I acquired several datasets from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, which required reaching out directly to their Open Records Section.", "I chose one dataset containing active corporate taxpayers and another that provides information on those companies\u2019 officers and directors. I merged these two to create one dataset of companies with their directorship information.", "To combine the company data with Bexar County property data, I merged on an exact name match after performing some basic text cleaning.", "A Dutch study that largely served as inspiration for this project found the three best indicators to identify conspicuous properties in the Netherlands are foreign ownership, the owner being a just-established company, and unusual price fluctuations.\u2076 Therefore, it was critical to create similar features. I was able to replicate the just-established company one by subtracting the company charter date from the property deed date.", "Given the Dutch findings and my experience investigating money laundering, I made several different binary features indicating whether the owner of the property was a company or a trust. For example, if the taxpayer name was included, this was a legal person and not a company. Alternatively, if the name included one of several corporate terms or suffixes, then it was likely a company.", "To approximate an unusual price fluctuation feature, I calculated each property\u2019s year-over-year percentage change in market value, dating back to 2015.", "I also made an explicit feature for if the property met two of Bexar County\u2019s GTO criteria: the property value is greater than $300,000, and the owner is a company.", "Because the public records data I obtained did not have labels for fraudulent activity, I created a small labeled dataset to validate my approach. While a lot of progress has been made within unsupervised machine learning over recent years, semi-supervised approaches have shown great promise when it is feasible to label a small subset.\u2077 Thus, I had to create positive class labels for properties that were involved in criminal proceedings. Using local newspapers and court documents, I was able to label 59 such properties that roughly met these criteria.", "An example of these properties is 1115 Links Cv, San Antonio, which is owned by Red Kaizen Investments LLC. Red Kaizen Investments LLC is one of the dozens of companies named as defendants in the court case against Rafael Olvera Amezcua, a Mexican financier accused of running a sham savings and loans business that defrauded depositors of more than $160 million.\u2078", "In jurisdictions covered by a GTO, 1,082 transactions matched to higher-risk suspicious activity reports (SARs), totaling 17% of all transactions that met reporting requirements.\u2079 \u00b9\u2070 With a back-of-the-envelope calculation, I would expect this to translate to around 700 properties fitting these criteria in the Bexar County data.\u00b9\u00b9 It must be noted that not all of the properties labeled criminal actually meet the GTO requirements, so this should not be taken as an exact metric.", "Despite that, I had a very strong positive class of criminal properties, but over 600,000 properties, while probabilistically non-criminal, were unlabeled. Thus, there was massive class imbalance and a labeling challenge. To address the class imbalance, I relied on precision, recall, and confusion matrices, instead of accuracy. If only 0.1% of transactions are fraudulent, an algorithm can always predict transactions are non-criminal and be right 99.9% percent of the time. Precision and recall allow for capturing the rate of false positives (precision) and false negatives (recall).", "As a quick first pass to labeling a sizable subset of the unlabeled properties, I labeled as non-criminal properties that were owned by the most common 30 property owners in the data (i.e., those 30 that owned the most property). I felt confident labeling these properties as non-criminal because the owners were large homebuilder companies as well as the state and municipal governments. It should be noted, however, that this does not produce a truly representative sample since it is biased toward large property owners.", "After filtering out outlier properties and matching the criminal ones I had manually labeled, I had 5,516 non-criminal properties and 47 criminal ones in the dataset with strong labels.", "The next step in my semi-supervised approach to fraud detection was to pseudo-label 15% of the remainder of my large, unlabeled dataset. First, I trained several baseline models suited to classification tasks with tabular data on the small data subset I manually labeled: support-vector machine, XGBoost, random forest, and gradient boosting. Gradient boosting had the strongest performance on the test data, with XGBoost being the second strongest.", "Gradient boosting uses a series of decision trees to iterate over the previous decision tree\u2019s residual. These 100 weak learners come to form a strong model in aggregate. Typically, I have found gradient boosting a good base model because it is a higher-performing decision tree and relatively fast to train. Moreover, decision trees are a more interpretable machine learning model, which was essential for me to determine which features were most informative to fraud classification.", "Thus, I used this hyperparameter-optimized gradient boosting model trained on the original training data to predict labels for 86,708 properties. Next, I combined this pseudo-labeled data with the labeled data, and, conducting a new hyperparameter search, I now trained a new gradient boosting classifier on this larger dataset.\u00b9\u00b2", "This new model outperformed the baseline one in recall, precision, and F1 score.", "I was pleased that recall was so high while still maintaining a low rate of false positives. The priority in a situation like this is reducing false negatives, but the more false positives, the more manual work has to be done by the compliance analyst.", "Furthermore, the features the model found to be most important in making predictions line up well with the Dutch study.", "The property being owned by a company that was established within 365 days of the property purchase date is my model\u2019s most important feature. The aforementioned Dutch study had this same feature as their second-strongest indicator.\u00b9\u00b3", "My model relied on year-over-year price differences for multiple years as one of the most important features. This roughly maps to how the Dutch study had unusual price fluctuations as its top indicator.\u00b9\u2074", "The property owner owning multiple properties lines up both with my experience in asset tracing as well as one of the Dutch study\u2019s second tier of indicators.", "My approach validated a pseudo-labeling approach to detecting criminal investment, showing that a small subset of labeled data can be leveraged against existing techniques. This both further substantiates the case for this approach for a novel application and suggests a practical path forward in such applications, where access to a fully labeled dataset is prohibitive. Some interesting follow-ups to this would be:", "Thank you, Nina Lopatina, for all the help on this. If you\u2019re interested in NER, definitely check out all the cool work she\u2019s doing.", "The repository for this project can be found here.", "[3] The criteria are: the purchase is all-cash, the purchaser is a company, and the purchase price is $300,000 or more (per the most recent GTO).", "[9] Higher-risk SARs are filed by the financial institution with FinCEN who then investigates the transaction. Higher-risk SARs in Treasury\u2019s context are those filed because of activity involving high-risk foreign jurisdictions, narcotics money laundering, and transnational crime.", "[11] 21,131 properties in my dataset fit the price and owned-by-a-company GTO requirements. Taking the national average that 20% of all properties are purchased without financing, there are 4,226 that meet all three criteria; 17% of that is 718.", "Your home for data science.
