This would not do. I needed a scientific way to prove my friends were more negative than I was once and for all. Using Whatsapp, Python and the NTLK sentiment library I created the following graph:", "Finally, I had proved I was the best amongst my peers. And by the end of this tutorial you will be able to:", "I am going to try to make this accessible, using non-technical tools where possible. You will need knowledge of Python and Pip, though I will dip into some Excel-based solutions.", "Every message and file sent in a WhatsApp chat is accessible to the members of that chat to export. This encrypted data still holds it\u2019s meaning to those within the chat. Before you do this reach out to other members of your chat and check they are happy with your analysis.", "This export is a .txt file. There are a few different formats in this file:", "At this stage we can\u2019t process this data, multiple formats aren\u2019t useful. We want to keep the date, time, user and message content.", "At this point, you have the message data raw and ready to be pasted into an online word cloud builder.", "Now there are a few issues here:", "To resolve these I move over to Python.", "I\u2019ve modified a tool which converts the .txt file to a formatted .csv. It does require pip3 and python3. This will convert data from this form:", "Finally, we have the issues of stop words. These are commonly used words that are considered unimportant to the content of a message. Think words like \u201cand\u201d, \u201cto\u201d, \u201cI\u201d. These are considered important in a lot of Natural Language Processing now, but they make for rubbish word clouds. NLTK can help us here.", "To deal with stop words, and the further issues above I have written up a notebook.", "And now we have the following:", "Sentiment Analysis is a field of NLP focused on identifying opinions in a piece of text. Using the NLTK library we can get the positivity, negativity and neutrality of text.", "A score of 1 for positivity means it\u2019s completely positive. A score of 0 means it has no positivity.
