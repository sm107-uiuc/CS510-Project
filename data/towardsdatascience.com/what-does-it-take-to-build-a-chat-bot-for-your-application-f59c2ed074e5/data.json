What should you think about ? \u2026..", "A lot actually. You have to think about a lot, to name a few \u2014 Let\u2019s consider that your application can Order a Pizza for \u2018take away\u2019 and check the status of the order.", "Before we go any further, You might want to stop me and point out at some platforms like Luis, Dialog Flow, IBM Watson etc\u2026 sure they can help you with #1, a little of #2, limited of #3 and few in #5, but remember the list of requirements to have a good Chatbot goes on further. You can have a great team that can build the rest of the bot, at what cost ?\u2026 At the cost of a great amount of time. You would Ideally want the \u2018go to market\u2019 time to be as short as possible without compromising the quality and functionality. This calls for a tool that already solved all the problems \u2014 Kore.ai bots platform, the conversational platform that enables you to build and manage conversational bots for hundreds of use cases.", "Well, Like any other platform out there Kore.ai also solves #1, #2, #3. And also every point mentioned above and then a lot more. The platform provides a complete Development toolkit required to build and manage a bot without having to build a separate back-end service for the bot. It\u2019s easier to show you, Let\u2019s jump into the platform and build toy bot. If you need more information or help at any point refer to the documentation at https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/chatbot-overview/chatbot-overview/", "Lets say you have a Pizzeria where people can order take outs for one pizza with choice of Crust, up to 3 toppings and some sides. You built an application (just assume that you have it) where people can order online. Now let\u2019s build a bot for this Pizzeria where one can Order one Pizza for take-out with the choice of crust, toppings and sides, it should also be able to check status of the order when asked.", "First Sign up/login at https://bots.kore.ai . Click on create a bot and give it a name, select language (let\u2019s go with English for now) and let the bot type be Standard (check out what each type means in the documentation later). Now, you will land on bot details a page like this", "Explore this page and then head to bot tasks in the menu on the left. In the bot tasks page you will see several bot task types that you can create", "For our Toy Bot we will focus on Dialog Task, these tasks represent a full conversational flow between a user and a Bot as a directed graph. This helps you design complex conversations that involve conditional actions, i.e lets say in the \u201cOrder pizza\u201d task the maximum number of toppings allowed on a pizza is 3, you can check this and inform the user to choose again without having your back-end application involved.", "Now lets create two dialog task :", "Lets look at the finished \u201cOrder Pizza\u201d dialog first and then see how it was built (I will be providing links to detailed documentation which can be ignored for the toy example, but do check them out later)", "On seeing this the your first thought should be \u201cwhat are the nodes in the graph?\u201d. Well, These are called Dialog components and Kore.ai platform provides several types of dialog components, Let\u2019s briefly see what they are :", "One other thing you might be wondering about is \u201cHow are the connections defined?\u201d \u2014 Each node has connection properties where one can define a default transition and if/else conditions as per requirement. For example : Transitions from ValidateToppingCount script node in \u201cOrder a Pizza\u201d dialog task.", "And Wait! what about the information gathered from the conversation, \u201cHow can I access the data ?\u201d \u2014 All the data that is gleaned from the dialog and responses of \u201cservice node calls\u201d is available in \u201ccontext\u201d JSON,Ex entities are at Json path context.entities.<entity name> i.e for the choice of crust (crust entity value) is at context.entities.crust", "Now, Coming back to our Toy bot with \u201cOrder a Pizza\u201d dialog task, you might have figured out the flow by now", "Order pizza dialog is complete\u2026 Or not, what about the Natural Language training ? All Chatbot platforms ask for training data right, what about kore \u2014 Yes Kore does that too, the topic of Kore.ai\u2019s NLP is for another day\u2019s post. As of now the bot is working with its knowledge of English language grammar and just the task name.", "I will remove the service node since its useless and attach the Bot export at the end, which you can import into your account and check it out. Also, I left a few things out so you can try out", "Whats coming in the future post?", "Your home for data science.
