The numerous applications and products of data science attract the attention of many companies and individuals. More and more businesses invest in this field to create value out of data. The \u201csexiness\u201d of the field combined with the high demand drives lots of people to start a career in data science.", "I was one of many who were attracted. After a short introduction, it was inevitable for me to pursue a career in this field. So, I did start learning more and more.", "In the first couple of months, I felt like I was learning a lot which motivated me further. I was collecting certifications, completing online tutorials, reading papers, learning about the underlying principles of algorithms, and so on.", "After some time, I realized that the more I learn, the more there is to learn. Although I had learned a lot, I felt like I was not doing well. I even thought my skills and learning techniques were inadequate.", "If you feel like how I did in your data science journey, don\u2019t worry. I will try to explain why you should not.", "That feeling of insufficiency, some might call it \u201cimposter syndrome\u201d, made me stop and think for a while. In order to keep learning, I had to leave this feeling behind.", "In this post, I explain, in my opinion, the reasons for this feeling and the solutions that helped me focus on my learning journey.", "Data science is an interdisciplinary field that consists of math, statistics, software, and algorithmic thinking. On top of those, depending on what we work on, domain knowledge can be a significant requirement. Thus, I accepted there is too much to learn and it\u2019d be an unnecessary burden to even try.", "My motto became to learn what you need to. I tried to avoid overlearning. It is absolutely normal that my software skills cannot compete with the skills of a software developer. I needed math but not like a person majoring in math.", "Data science is an emerging field. There are different areas to focus but they are not clearly structured and distinguished yet. Consider a person doing a Ph.D. in physics. Can you expect her to focus on the entire field of physics? Absolutely not! To become an expert, the focus should be narrowed.", "I told myself that I\u2019d learn about different areas in data science to a certain level. It is advantageous to have a general idea of how things work and what they are used for. However, I\u2019d not be wise to tear myself down by trying to master each and every concept.", "I might be working as a machine learning engineer at a financial institution doing algorithmic training. Then my focus becomes predictive analytics on time-series data. It does not mean that I only need to learn the dynamics of time-series analysis. The point is we usually need to specialize in only one particular area.", "Another sign that indicates data science is still emerging is the job postings. I have read lots of job postings and what I have come to realize is that even companies are not fully aware there exist different areas in data science.", "I understand some companies cannot afford to hire an entire data science team. But it does not mean they need a person capable of performing any task in the field of data science.", "The extensive list of requirements in job postings made me feel like I need to learn a lot more. These requirements are usually more than what you\u2019d be doing in that position.", "I was able to overcome the requirements fallacy after some time. The tasks you\u2019d be doing at a position actually tell us what you need to focus on. Depending on the area you want to work on, you might create a list of your own requirements.", "NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, SpaCy, NLTK, BERT, statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pyplot, ggplot, tidyverse, dplyr, FastAPI, Streamlit, and the list goes on.", "These are only a small part of the packages and tools that are used in data science. All of them are good at performing some tasks.", "When I started learning, I felt like I needed to practice all of them. As I kept learning, the number of tools that I came across increased. There was no way to catch up.", "Then I realized I only need a few of them. Some of them are doing the same thing in a different way. So, I started to keep following a tool-independent learning process.", "If I absolutely needed use a new tool to complete a task, then I spent time learning it. Otherwise, I tended to use the ones in my arsenal. Another advantage of being consistent with the same tool is that I was able to master it.", "I think most of the learning paths in data science experience demotivation due to the overwhelming amount of materials to learn. It is in our hands to overcome this demotivation period and keep it short.", "I also suggest working on projects. When you focus on completing a particular task, the learning process will be distilled which helps you overcome the difficulties we discussed.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
