Starting as a weak competitor in the data visualization space, its monthly updates have gradually transformed it into a strong contender against Tableau, TIBCO\u2019s Spotfire, and Qlik. However, even with major improvements, some confusing features remain.. One of the most commonly asked questions I get about Power BI involves calculated measures and calculated columns.", "We all leverage calculations in our data models and visualizations. So, these two features are front and center. When understood properly, they will enrich your data model and the insights you share through your reports and dashboards.", "These two features sound similar, if not the same, and both can be accessed from the same location on the ribbon within Power BI. They are often used interchangeably, and subsequent chaos ensues because they are not interchangeable. The differences between them are subtle but significant.", "A calculated column is an extension of a table that\u2019s evaluated for each row. Calculated columns live in the xVelocity in-memory storage of Power BI, just like all the other data you import from a data source. A calculated column is virtually the same as a non-calculated column, with one exception. Their values are calculated using DAX formulas and values from other columns.", "Since calculated columns live at the same level as your tables, they are only calculated when you first define them and during a dataset refresh. An example of a calculated column is deriving the per-unit profit of a product by subtracting the product's cost from the price of the product.", "Per Unit Profit = Products[Price] \u2014 Products[Cost]", "This calculation will be performed for each row in the Products table. The calculated value will be stored in the new Per Unit Profit field.", "2. From the Modeling tab, Calculations section, select New Column.", "3. In the formula bar, enter the above formula.", "Calculated columns can also be created by right-clicking on the table name in the FIELDS PANE and selecting New Column from the context menu. You can also create a calculated column from within the Power BI Query Editor.", "A calculated measure is not treated the same as any other table column. Unlike a calculated column, measures are evaluated on the fly with every change in context. If you change a date filter from 2019 to 2020, all the measures will be calculated again. While this is nice for seeing context-based calculations in real-time, it becomes demanding on your computer\u2019s processor.", "A measure is also intended for use as an aggregation. Every calculated measure must contain an aggregation function such as AVG or SUM. Without an aggregation function, the measure\u2019s formula will display an error.", "2. From the Modeling tab, Calculations section, select New Measure.", "3. In the formula bar, enter the above formula.", "There\u2019s no hard rule for choosing one over the other. In some instances, you can use either a calculated column or a measure. However, there are situations when only one option will work. Remember, if you can use either, a calculated column will consume fewer resources while your users interact with your report. Measures recalculate each time the user changes a filter and can cause your report to respond slowly.", "Another consideration when using calculated measures is the calculated column\u2019s inability to reference them in a formula. Since measures are considered dynamic and outside the xVelocity tables, calculated columns should not use them in their definition. This frequently muddles the efforts of Power BI newcomers. They begin by creating a measure for their highly context-driven report. As the requests for new report features increase, the need arises for more calculated columns. Frustration strikes along with the realization that your measures are in a world by themselves and are useless from the calculated column formula bar.", "One scenario solved only by a calculated measure is needing the calculation to change anytime the context changes. If I want the sales person\u2019s percentage of sales to change for the selected region, it needs to be recalculated based on the total sales per region. That should happen each time the user selects another region in the slicer.", "Conversely, sometimes you can only use a calculated column. Measures cannot be used as filters in a slicer nor as filters at page and report levels. In these instances, if you are using a calculation as the source of your filter, you must use a calculated column.", "I hope this overview of the differences between calculated columns and calculated measures in Power BI is helpful. Even with this explanation, adapting to them and understanding when to use them in their proper spaces can take time. Hopefully, it will happen a little faster for you now. But don\u2019t give up. In the end, you\u2019ll be pleased with their power and usefulness.", "Rod Castor helps companies Get Analytics Right!
