We don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll be able to sit inside at a restaurant. We don\u2019t even know when we\u2019ll be able to mosh at a Korn concert again. But over the course of the last few weeks, there is one uncertainty that I\u2019ve found less tolerable than all the rest:", "We don\u2019t know who the funniest friend in the hit 90\u2019s sitcom \u201cFRIENDS\u201d is.", "Once you realize you\u2019ve been living your life with such a gaping hole in your knowledge base, you can never go back.", "That\u2019s why I decided to make it my mission to harness the cutting edge powers of artificial intelligence and find out if Phoebe\u2019s quirky non-sequiturs are funnier than Ross\u2019s dinosaur jokes.", "Fair warning: Prepare to be surprised!", "If you\u2019re wondering how artificial intelligence can possibly figure out who says something funny, here\u2019s my explanation of the technical aspects of the project.", "In case you were hoping to stay awake instead, here\u2019s a quick demo video showing what it looks like:", "There are two caveats to this approach that I explain at the end of the article.", "Before we get to the main course, a couple appetizers:", "This award goes to Joey. Joey made the audience laugh for a full 30 seconds when going through his fake resume skills with Phoebe in \u201cThe One Where Joey Speaks French\u201d (S10E13). He wrote that he could chug a gallon of milk in under 10 seconds on his resume. Phoebe called him out. He immediately went to the fridge, grabbed a gallon of milk and proceeded to \u201cchug\u201d (i.e. spill down the front of his shirt) for 30 seconds straight. Peak Joey moment.", "The award for the funniest episode goes to \u201cThe One Where the Stripper Cries\u201d (S10E11). I immediately rewatched this episode when I discovered this and it definitely lives up to the hype. The episode is full of high school and college flashbacks starring \u201cfat Monica\u201d, Rachel\u2019s \u201creal\u201d nose, and ridiculous hairstyles all around. Not to mention we find out Ross kissed Monica in college! Meanwhile Joey gets on a game show and gives a performance that only Joey would be capable of. But what puts this episode over the top is Danny DeVito\u2019s outrageous guest appearance as the stripper at Phoebe\u2019s bachelorette party.", "In contrast, the episode with the least amount of laughter turns out to be \u201cThe One with the Invitation\u201d (S4E21). This was a heavier episode that flashed back through the highs and lows of Ross and Rachel\u2019s entire relationship up to that point. Ross was about to marry Emily in England and Rachel had to wrestle with whether she wanted to attend the wedding or not (we all remember how that turns out).", "In terms of the funniest season, the results are quite interesting (some might even say incriminating). As you can see in the chart below, the amount of laughter per season tended to keep going up as the show progressed. Were seasons 9 and 10 really THAT much funnier than seasons 1 and 2? I\u2019ll let you decide for yourself. But this could point to the producers becoming more liberal with the laughter editing as the show went on. Let\u2019s look at the glass half-full and say the writing and the chemistry simply got better as the show went on!", "Now, what you\u2019ve all been waiting for:", "The natural thing to do would be to see which character generated the most laughter throughout all 10 seasons and declare them the funniest. But I think this is unfair. Some characters (ahem Rachel and Ross) speak WAY more lines than other characters (poor Phoebe).", "To level the playing field, we will look at the average laughter generated per line by each character.", "Is anyone surprised here? Monica tends to be the \u201cresponsible\u201d one who keeps things on track. She usually has her hands full correcting the foibles of her more hapless friends and keeping her nice china from breaking. To her credit, everyone realizes this and Ross and Rachel even admit they would ONLY allow Chandler and Monica to raise their child if Monica is in the picture (S6E13). Every friend group needs a Monica.", "This one surprised me. Early in the series, it seemed like Rachel was behind so many punch lines. She was introduced to us as a runaway \u201cdaddy\u2019s girl\u201d and watching her deal with realities like making coffee and getting \u201cone of those job things\u201d was immensely entertaining. But I guess as things became more serious with Ross, she became more serious too.", "It turns out the two characters with the most lines (Ross and Rachel) aren\u2019t that funny! Granted Ross does tend to take things pretty literally most of the time and he is a paleontology professor after all. He definitely has a goofy side and loves his nerdy jokes but he and Rachel were involved in a lot of the serious storylines over the course of the show. So it makes sense that they weren\u2019t always joking around.", "Phoebe missed getting 2nd place by a hair! There\u2019s actually a very big gap between Phoebe and Ross so I officially declare Phoebe to be a really funny character. It\u2019s unfortunate that she didn\u2019t get as many lines as the other characters but it\u2019s true that she often lived far away from the group. That said, she was a constant source of comedic relief with her alternative remedies and \u201cstreet-smart\u201d upbringing.", "Chandler strikes me as a bit cynical sometimes so I wasn\u2019t sure where he would fall. But looking back it does seem like Chandler is always waiting to find the comedy in a conversation. While his humor can often be self-deprecating and sometimes pessimistic, he seems to have the ability to bring levity to even the most serious moments on the show. Maybe that\u2019s why he and Monica were such a good match!", "Ok, show of hands \u2014 who guessed this from the start? The best part about Joey being the funniest character is that he\u2019s not even trying to be funny most of the time. A lot of his humor isn\u2019t really intentional. Yes we all know that maybe Joey is a little \u201cslower\u201d than the rest. But he has an innocent naivet\u00e9 that makes his comments both hilarious and genuine at the same time. It\u2019s actually hard to remember Joey lines that aren\u2019t funny.", "No matter how you slice the data, these rankings pretty much hold.", "One thing to note is that Ross actually generates more laughter than Phoebe throughout the entire show. But he also gets way more lines throughout the show, so it wouldn\u2019t seem right to say he\u2019s funnier than Phoebe. On a per-line basis, Phoebe is much funnier.", "It\u2019s also interesting that Chandler has more lines that are followed by laughter than Joey. It\u2019s just that when Joey says something funny, the audience laughs longer than they do for Chandler\u2019s lines (by 6% on average!).", "So there you have it. Go ahead and check one more uncertainty off your list. Progress! Now for that Korn concert\u2026", "See who has gotten funnier over time. Joey wasn\u2019t the funniest character until Season 5! And Monica has been on an absolute tear since her very serious Season 1 performance!", "Humor is relative. What I find funny you may not and vice versa. Humor is also hard to measure. Luckily, most FRIENDS scenes were filmed in front of a live audience of 300 people. Naturally, when a lot of these people laugh, I assume something is funny. Now of course, laughter can be edited. But for the sake of this article, we\u2019re going to assume something is funny when the audience laughs.", "I only captured spoken lines in this analysis. That means characters don\u2019t always get credit for their non-verbal humor. Fortunately, less than 3% of the laughter in the show is purely non-verbal.", "Your home for data science.
