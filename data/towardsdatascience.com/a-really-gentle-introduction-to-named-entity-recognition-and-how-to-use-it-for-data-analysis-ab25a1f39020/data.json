Sure, but NLP can be useful way beyond its application in Machine Learning projects, as it can bring powerful tools for Data Analysis as well.", "In this article, I will use spacy, one of the most popular libraries for NLP tasks. It\u2019s very well documented and offers models in 10 languages, plus a Multi-Language library. Our dataset will be the book one of the popular Game of Thrones series, and it is available to download here. All the code and graphs came from the notebook that I\u2019ve created specially for you, so help yourself.", "As Data Analyst, I\u2019ve noticed that much of what we learn when we start studying are contents focused into ML modeling, prediction and AI, and there is a lot of cool stuff to learn. However, when it comes for the first job opportunity, normally it will be related with data analysis, data cleaning and data visualization, so we should dedicate a bit more of our attention into sharpening our skills in those areas, and NLP can help a lot into this process.", "Textual data is messy, and very difficult to organize. One of the approaches to help us to understand it is to transform words into tokens, which are numerical representations of a word. Spacy does that brilliantly, and it also predicts the function of a word into a given context, using a sophisticated statistical model that normally works pretty well.", "According to the documentation: \u201cA named entity is a \u201creal-world object\u201d that\u2019s assigned a name \u2014 for example, a person, a country, a product or a book title\u201d. Below you can find an example:", "On today\u2019s example, we are using the Game of Thrones book one, named \u201cA Clash of Kings\u201d. Let\u2019s say you are doing your analysis and among so many characters, you ask yourself, which names appear the most on that book? Well, fear no more, because NER is here to help you!", "To start, let\u2019s check what the data looks like:", "Ok, so it\u2019s a text file where each row is a line. We need to iterate over the lines and ask spacy to select what is a name and save it to into a list. Easy, right? Let\u2019s translate that to code!", "We need first create a NLP object. It loads the model, in that case the English one, and with is with that object that we will transform and predict the words in our text, like on the example below:", "What the code above does is:", "Now we can see the result selecting the top 10 names for our book:", "WOW! Look at that! Remember that we didn\u2019t give any information to the algorithm, it predicted by itself the names and, at least for the top 10, they are all correct. As a plus, we did all that in very few lines of code. Now, just to make this information looks better, why not to create a bar plot?", "That\u2019s it for today. In this article I have shown you that NLP is not just about Machine Learning, but can be also used into analysis. We explored what is NER and how to use it with a practical example that you are more than welcome to try by yourself.", "I hope you have enjoyed reading, please let me know your thoughts in the comments, and see you in the next text!", "Your home for data science.
