With limited resources, it is important for the company to identify which users are more likely to be converted into leads.", "We will mostly be using R to perform the analysis and visualization.", "The data is available on Kaggle. One good thing about this data set is that it comes with a data dictionary, which explains what key columns mean. There are 37 variables and around 10k records.", "There is already a well-written EDA by Ashish with Python. We will be taking the cleaned dataset directly from him, and focus on the simulation and visualization part.", "We will also be dropping these columns, which are mainly related to leads:", "Here we will train an XGBoost model with 10-fold cross-validation, where the target variable is if the user is converted into a lead (0- No, 1-Yes). The code below are taken directly from David Foster.", "Turns out the baseline model already gives good result: AUC 0.9650633.", "Using the xgboostExplainer package, we are able to identify few important variables that could help lead conversion.", "The package creates a waterfall chart which can help us identify the most important contributing factors when it comes to lead conversion.", "For the record below (taken from the test set):", "After reviewing some more cases, we have identified a list of 6 variables that may help convert a lead:", "The core idea here is that if the variables are independent, we could play around with different inputs to see how the predictions will change.", "We already know from Ashish\u2019s EDA that there isn\u2019t any serious collinearity (usually when VIF > 5):", "First we will create a list of percentages and a list of seeds to iterate though. The percentage here refers to the percentage of user base that could be affected. For example, if perc = 0.2, that means we will randomly select 20% of the records (again, from the test data), and add 600 seconds to the Total.Time.Spent.on.Website variable, while other variables remain unchanged for those 20% records.", "The diversified seeding here is just to make sure the simulation is more robust. For every iteration, we will take the median of the predictions. Note that here baseline of median predictions before we simulate anything is around 0.152.", "A side note is that, despite there are no serious collinearity present, when TotalVisits = 0, Total.Time.Spent.on.Website must also be 0 as well. For simplicity, we are ignoring this for now.", "Another note is that here we are only demonstrating a fixed boost on the continuous variables (for example, add 600 seconds), and we can always try different combinations as well.", "For one-hot variables, one way is to split up the 0s and 1s first, and then randomly take a percentage on the 0\u2019s (target) and convert it into 1\u2019s \u2014 which means that the SMS Sent becomes the last activity for those selected records.", "We then repeat the process for the remaining 4 variables, and the aggregated conversion rates are as below:", "Before visualization, let\u2019s also add more details to the final data:", "For the actual visualization, we will construct a heatmap in a table format with the reactable package \u2014 best part? It is compatible with R Shiny.", "High priority questions to ask next:", "We focus on objectives here (what we want to achieve), as opposed to the actual approach we are taking, because it may require deeper analysis and domain knowledge of Online Education to come up with solid optimization plan (for example, to study why certain users are spending 2000+ seconds on the website \u2014 is it because of certain content?).", "Also note that in proper setting, there should be A/B testing to validate correlations revealed by the XGBoost model. But again, the analysis in this blog should only be served as the starting point of lead conversion optimization, and it is an iterative process to refine the analysis with different stakeholders.", "Machine learning model is often perceived as a blackbox, and the community is well aware of this (hence we see packages like xgboostexplainer and shap). Sometimes even the simplest linear regression is hard for others to understand \u2014 and this is where simulation or sensitivity-based analysis can add value. There are also other ways to perform such analysis:", "From variables A, B, C and D; which combination of values of A, B and C (without touching D) increases the target y value by 10, minimizing the sum of A, B and C.", "Your home for data science.
