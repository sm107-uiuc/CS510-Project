If you already know these and the above sentence already made sense, this article may not be for you. If any (or all) of the above sound scary, hopefully I can help!", "This sounds pretty basic, but I want to start on the same page, so allow me to briefly explain what I mean when I say the word function.", "In programming, a function is simply a procedure that takes some number of arguments and returns something. Example:", "In mathematics, we are a little more strict with the definition of a function. So let\u2019s add one restriction to the definition.", "For any given input, x, there can only be one output, y.", "To explain by way of counterexample:", "Why is this not a function? Because if I pass x = 0 two times in a row, I will not get the same answer. That is, for a given input ( x = 0 ) I received a different output ( x + random() ).", "A higher-order function is still a function. It takes some number of arguments and returns a thing. In this case, the \u201cthing\u201d it returns is also a function! Example:", "Things are getting a little more complicated; let me explain. Every time we call our higher-order function, buildAdder, we create a new function based on the argument a.", "In this example, addOne is still a function that takes a number and returns that number plus one. But because of our higher-order function, we could generate many of these adding functions by passing different arguments to buildAdder.", "In the last example, addA is a parameterized function! A parameterized function is a function that acts on some arguments, but the way it acts is based on an external constant. For instance, within the context (scope) of addA, a is a constant value that is set externally. In the case of addOne, a is the constant one.", "The key point here is that addA can be one of many different functions (in this case, infinitely many). The way we determine which of those many functions we are dealing with by its parameter, a.", "Because the value of a dictates the precise function that addA takes on, we need some language for talking about the set of all possible functions that addA can create. To make this concrete, let\u2019s look at some examples:", "A class of functions is the set of all functions that a parameterized function can take. In this example, we see that class1 is a set that contains a function for each integer value. We could write this more concisely like:", "The first class of functions contains all addA for which a is an integer. The next class contains all addA for which a is a real number. The third class contains all addA for which a is a positive real number.", "If we were to compare the size of these sets, we\u2019d see that class2 is bigger than class1. We know this because there are more real numbers than there are integers and because there is a one-to-one mapping of values of a to functions in the class.", "To make it easier to visualize, let\u2019s look at a function of two variables that also has two parameters. We can treat the two variables as a single array variable, or we can treat the two variables independently; it is largely a stylistic choice. Here is an example function of x, where x is an array with two elements:", "Anywhere we point on this grid, we will come up with a new function. That function will be defined by its a, b coordinates, and will behave differently for values of x. One valuable use for this interpretation is to define constraints on our function class. For example, perhaps we only want to look at functions contained within the shaded region.", "A huge amount of what we do in machine learning is finding particular functions. We choose a model class (parameterized function class) and we optimize it (find a certain value for the parameters).", "By viewing machine learning through this lens, it becomes apparent that all we are doing is searching through parameter space for a function that matches our data! To make this statement more clear, let\u2019s imagine an example. Let\u2019s say that I am given this function:", "If I fiddle around with a, b, and c long enough, I should be able to find a curve that pretty closely approximates the curve I was given. How do I find the correct a, b, and c? The answer lies in the optimization literature, but that\u2019s another story for another day. For now, just know that we are searching through the set of all possible functions defined by this class until we find one that looks similar to our data.", "In machine learning, we are often not told the function class used to generate our data. Instead, we have to use function classes that are generic enough to be able to model lots of different functions. For instance the function class y = a*x + b can model any line, but a single line is in no way sufficient to approximate the complex functions of life. So we think bigger and deeper. This leads to the most popular function class: neural networks. Neural networks can model any function!", "One commonly taut\u2019ed fact of neural networks is that they are universal function approximators. Which means that, given enough hidden nodes, they can approximate any function. The precision with which this function is approximated is based on the number of hidden nodes in the network. This means that neural networks are a class of functions that are sufficiently generic to model an arbitrarily complex function. Getting them to do so, however, is an art in-and-of itself!", "Your home for data science.
