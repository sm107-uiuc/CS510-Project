I was overwhelmed by so many positive responses from fellow, veteran scientists. Thank you for all your comments and communications. One example is this generous tweet from Oliver Reichenstein (@reichenstein):\u201c[The] most tenacious article I read in months. Full of great quotable bits. And yes, Feyerabend is entertaining.\u201d But, first prize goes to Joseph Hertzlinger (@jhertzli) who captured the spirit perfectly:", "\u201cEvery time a scientist says \u2018I Don\u2019t Believe in Electrons,\u2019 somewhere an electron dies.\u201d", "Where are the full-throated defenders of Realism?", "The most surprising result was that there don\u2019t seem to be many Realists out there\u2026 or at least any able to assemble an argument. I was disappointed in this, as I was eager to hear what their counter-arguments might be. Why stick your neck out and claim certainty? I prefer humility before the wonders of nature.", "Ok. Now to the fun part. The dissenters\u2026which come in two flavors.", "#1. Don\u2019t Hang Our Dirty Laundry in Public", "There were quite a few responses like \u201cI don\u2019t disagree with you, but such arguments might be misused by the general public.\u201d The argument goes something like this: \u201cIn the hands of the Hoi Polloi, anti-Realism might be used to support flat Earthers, creationists, luddites, anti-vaxers, [or some other real or imagined threat].\u201d These critics seem to be afraid of democratizing Science, in fear of losing public funding or something. Perhaps we should revert to publishing in Latin.", "I have never met a \u201cFlat Earther\u201d and suspect they only exist in the imagination of social media. I have met Creationists, of one stripe or another. I do not fear them, nor do I think they are a threat to medical progress. Most lightly-caffeinated people see no conflict between Science and Faith, but I maintain my opening stance: Science is not a matter of belief.", "A vocal minority became fully unhinged, hurling adjectives like \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201ctoxic,\u201d but with tragic counter-arguments. The most apoplectic responses seem to come from young people and non-scientists. Being charitable, the majority of these seem to confuse anti-Realism with anti-Science. Once more to be clear: provisional acceptance of a theory and its utility is not the same as belief that it is True.", "When I was in college, professors just assumed you had read The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\u00b2, and they were tired of hearing about it. I assumed so as well, as the book sold more copies than most airport novels. I remember one of my professors complaining, \u201cPragmatism is so dominant in America, it is a wonder they still teach Philosophy at all.\u201d (I think he was a Realist and he considered Agnosticism to be lazy). So, it was a surprise to me that many of these readers had never heard of Anti-Realism. In a strange inversion of tradition, the younger generation seems to have replaced the slogan \u201cSubvert the Dominant Paradigm\u201d with \u201cSwear Fealty to the Conventional Wisdom.\u201d", "The most confusing poster explained to me that an \u201celectron is a real mathematical object.\u201d I am not sure where to start on this one.", "Another labelled Complexity Theory \u201cpseudoscience.\u201d I referred to Complexity as it is used in Mathematics, which differs from Science in at least one respect: Mathematical propositions can be proven to be True.", "Another reader imagined he saw Ayn Rand (really!) and dismissed the essay as having a \u201cclassical computation perspective\u201d (presumably this is some kind of Bad Science). He assures us there is A Scientific Method, without revealing to the rest of us the secret sauce. But he did, at least, provide a tour-de-force demonstration of the limitations of the method of abductive inference. He goes on to declare \u201c[r]epeatable findings [are] the fundamental \u2018truth\u2019 in Science.\u201d I am glad he cleared that up.", "I hope most of these objections were just drunk texting. But, as I struggled to understand them, I was reminded once again of Paul Feyerabend when he was asked, \u201cWhy are you viewed as the worst enemy of Science?\u2074\u201d His answer, delivered with a mischievous grin: \u201cI have no idea.\u201d", "Russell Anderson has Ph.D. in Bioengineering and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of California. His academic research involves learning in biological systems (neural, immune, and evolution). He conducted postgraduate research at Los Alamos and Livermore National Labs, University of California (Berkeley, San Francisco, Davis, and Irvine), the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute, and the California Department of Health. He has served as chief scientist at IBM, Opera Solutions, HNC Software, KPMG, NICE/Actimize, HCL, Mastercard, JP Morgan Chase, and Halifax Bank of Scotland.
