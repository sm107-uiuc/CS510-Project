Concretely, they will be explored within the following dimensions:", "So, without further ado, let\u2019s jump into it!", "Data Governance is the most fundamental function within a Data Management Strategy as it is the one that centers and leads the rest of the functions.", "Here, we should make a distinction between two commonly misinterpreted concepts:", "Although Data Governance is a less technical function, it can leverage the power of Metadata and Modelling Tools to define certain aspects of the Management of Data. These tools will be used to understand better the data that will be used and the overall architecture of the Data flow.", "According to DAMA, Data Governance refers to the general management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data used within an organization.", "A Data Governance program establishes processes throughout the organization to provide standards, such as definitions of terms and consistent business rules, in systems and applications.", "It determines the right people to participate in the definition of requirements and establishes definitions of data standards and data usage.", "Data governance ensures that the same data standards and policies are defined and applied throughout the organization.", "To ensure compliance with the defined standards throughout the entire enterprise, a Data Governance organization must be established.", "The organization of data governance involves a combination of multiple levels of business and technology roles:", "Metadata support and Data Quality support tools are used in the implementation of Data Governance. There are very few tools on the market that are considered specific.", "An important functionality for data governance is the design of Workflow that can be used to implement data standards and policies.", "Another important functionality is the design of dashboards for the monitoring and control of Data Governance activities.", "Metadata Management is another of the key functions of successful Data Management strategies. Before discussing it thoroughly, let\u2019s introduce the concept of metadata and its different types:", "According to Wikipedia, Metadata is \u201cdata information that provides information about other data\u201d. In other words, it is data about data, data that provides information about one or more aspects of this data.", "Metadata is used to summarize basic information that will facilitate the tracking and working with the data.", "As an example, we could consider a digital image. Its metadata can be the size of the image, its resolution, where is stored, when has been generated\u2026 etc.", "There are 2 fundamental components within the Metadata concept: Data Element (DE) and Critical Data Element (CDE).", "A Data Element, or DE, is an atomic unit of data composed of a set of attributes:", "The critical data element is the data element that is critical to the success of a specific business area or business process.", "What is the criterion for a data element to become critical?", "It involves managing data about other data such as data models and structures, not the content. It includes managing information about data structures of different models and their associations like:", "There are Business and Technical Metadata, their characteristics are summarized in the following image:", "They describe the data element from the perspective of business use, including information such as a business glossary with terms and definitions, synonyms, acronyms, business rules, and responsibilities. By business metadata we mean:", "They describe data elements from a technology perspective and include information such as logical data models, source and target systems, table and field structures, and system dependencies.", "Operational metadata informs about the axis of applications: frequency, record accounts, and component by component of analyses and other statistics for auditing purposes.", "The technical and business metadata represent the CDE standard, meaning that the critical data element is fully described from the technical and business perspectives.", "The CDE standard is also called the 360\u00ba view of the CDE. By obtaining a 360\u00b0 view of the CDE, optimal conditions are provided for data management throughout the organization, which is the ultimate goal of data management.", "Once this is achieved, it will be possible to answer questions such as:", "Metadata process activities cover the perspective of processes within the perspectives of existing people, processes, and technologies in DM.", "It includes activities carried out to analyze business requirements through interviews with stakeholders and to identify the most relevant CDEs.", "2.- Collect Business Metadata for CDE\u2019s", "For the relevant CDE\u2019s define business terms, synonyms, acronyms, definitions, and taxonomies also define the business rules and determine those responsibly.", "3.- Collect Technical Metadata for CDE\u2019s", "For the relevant CDE\u2019s, Identify the CDE representations in the data systems, determine the data source and data lineage.", "For CDE\u2019s to create associations between business and technical metadata, validate the CDE data standard.", "Ensure compliance with the CDE standard to ensure management of each CDE and used by the defined standard (Data Governance).", "Refers to the process of planning, creating, testing, and deploying information.", "It is important that metadata derived from the life cycle of systems development be defined and be part of the metadata function process.", "This has been all for Part 1 of the Data Management Strategy series, in the next article we will cover the function of Data Quality and Data Architecture.", "If you already like this series so far, do not miss the introduction here and do not forget to leave a clap, so this will motivate me to continue to produce content and it will reach more people :)", "If you liked this post, you can look at my other posts on Data Science and Machine Learning here.", "If you want to learn more about Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence follow me on Medium, and stay tuned for my next posts!", "Your home for data science.
