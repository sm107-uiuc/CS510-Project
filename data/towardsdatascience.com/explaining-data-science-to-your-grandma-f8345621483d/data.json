I have been a Data Scientist for 3 years and I have been struggling for most of these 3 years to explain to my family what the purpose and day to day activities of my job are. First of all, my family only speaks French and Data Scientist does not translate fully to French. Officially, the French government proposed a translation: \u201cexpert en m\u00e9tadonn\u00e9es\u201d. Spoiler Alert, it means nothing to anyone.", "The Machine Learning world is governed by English and explaining it to any French person older than 60 years old, that has never had any connection to the computer or data world, is an extremely painful experience. Moreover, my family is not only French, they are Southern French, which means that on top of not speaking English, they have a temper and very little patience for things they do not understand. Ultimately, their conclusion was left at \u201cShe does something with computer\u201d. To be fair, I do. But nowadays, most people \u201cdo something with computers\u201d, even if it is limited to answering emails on the damn computer.", "As much as it makes me crazy, I need to understand how frustrating it might be for them as well. Older people have been disconnected from technology. It grew so fast, so big, so powerful. It is everywhere in our lives, but it does not mean that every generation is understanding it and its consequences. I cannot be only frustrated, I need to be a little empathetic too. As much as I respect all jobs, I was tired of my family believing that I was able to fix computers and that data was this evil matter that no one could control.", "I believe that as a data scientist, part of my duty is to help people understand what to do with their data and that it is not this evil garbage that everyone can use against them. All we see in the mainstream media is how Facebook uses our data for manipulation or how data from an online dating website leaked and broke (probably already very unhappy) marriages.", "I want to help my family understand that data does not have to be about them and I want them to know that , yes, horrible people can use data to influence elections, but most data scientists want to use data for efficiency and improvements. In some cases, sharing their data is a great decision. For instance, if their hospital asks them permission to share data within their systems, I would like them to know the value behind this decision.", "If you want your family to understand your job as Data Scientist, you need to find something from their daily life that they can really relate to. Start at the beginning, start simple, start logical.", "Here is the list of common things your grand mother might relate to:", "Groceries is the topic I choose the most. Everyone understands it and pretty much everyone has bought pasta and tomato sauce once in their life (unless they are gluten intolerant or have no taste buds.).", "Let\u2019s say that your grand-mother shops at Carrefour (yes, it is a French supermarket). She goes there 3 times per week. Everyone knows that your grand-mother has a special recipe for pasta bolognese, and she eats it at least once per week. However, your grand mother is not the only one, many people love pasta bolognese, or spaghetti bolognese, to be more specific.", "When everyone goes through the checkout, their items are scanned. After a few weeks of shopping, the Data Scientists at the shop can see that spaghetti is an item often bought with tomato sauce. They can also see that very often, we could even say in 50% of the time, people who buy spaghetti with tomato sauce at Carrefour usually also purchase another item: ground beef.", "The job of the data scientists is to get statistics (let\u2019s keep that one simple), make predictions and help others take decisions based on patterns in people\u2019s shopping habits. The marketing team might decide to give some personalized discounts for ground beef to people who only buy spaghetti and tomato sauce, as it might encourage them to change their habits, make some pasta bolognese more often and spend a little bit more in the shop. Due to the findings of the data scientist, they can also decide to change the placement of the items to make grocery shopping easier for your grand-mother, by putting a cooler full of ground beef closer to the spaghetti location. Their decision can be about profit, but it can often be about client or user satisfaction as well.", "In very simple words, machine learning is providing the ability to a system to learn and improve autonomously, meaning without being told exactly what to do. The system learns from experience, almost like a human. In other words, the system can learn from seeing different situations with different outcomes, and seeing them over and over, before trying to reproduce the outcome.", "Let\u2019s take the weather as another example, since your grandma probably watches the weather forecast on TV. Without watching the forecast, people do know that if it feels very humid, there is a high chance of getting some rains within the next hours. People have learnt it because, they have felt humidity many times before seeing the rain happening. Humidity is measurable so we can show a system a lot of data about humidity levels before it rained, and humidity levels on days when it did not rain. After seeing many situations in the data, the system can learn that when humidity is high, there is a 90% chance of getting rain within the next 2 hours. In reality, the calculations are much more complex, and I apologize sincerely to any experienced meteorologist out there, but we are just trying to teach grandma a simple application of machine learning.", "If someone with zero knowledge about data and IT had listened to my story until now, I would leave them off the hook and offer them a cookie as compensation for their time. I would not try to go into deep learning unless they seemed really interested or would start asking about self-driving cars (I would not really expect it from Grandma but I might be wrong). However, even though neural networks, are difficult to explain in details, you can simply mention that they are systems whose connections resemble brain connections, which allows them to learn more complex relationships between situation and outcome.", "Data Science is a young field but statistics is not. People who know nothing about Data Science have very probably heard of statistics, even if they do not watch TV, they will have read newspapers. Don\u2019t go into p-values and ANOVAs. No one is teaching data science, we are just trying to have a grandma understand that we are no aerospace engineer, mastermind ruling the world or help desk for broken Windows 98 PC stations.", "Lastly, one way of helping them understand that you are very far from aerospace engineering is to explain that you are basically doing advanced statistics using computers. You can mention that some people are like surgeons. They work inside the computer, they can fix the physical and internal part of the computer. However, for you, the computer is simply a tool that you work with. It should already be working in the first place.", "Your head might hurt, your job might be reduced to a bottle of tomato sauce and a pack of pasta. The sexiness of it might be far gone and they will have questions that you will find stupid and irritating but hang onto it. When I tried to explain the topic of my thesis, which was recommender systems, my aunt accused me of trying to manipulate people (to be fair, it can be debatable) and to only help the company make more money. I felt slightly upset and irritated. First of all, most jobs would probably not exist if it somehow did not help the company make money in some way. And secondly, I tried to explain the idea of improving user experience through accurate recommendations. I did not do well, user experience means nothing to someone who struggles to find the picture gallery on her smartphone.", "It often turns out better if I answer questions in a simple way and keep it jargon-free.", "Sometimes, it is also worth mentioning that behaviors towards a technology develop differently between generations and that it is okay for them not to understand fully the necessity behind a tool or a feature. One generation cannot live without a TV while another cannot live without a smartphone.", "Technology simply adapts differently to different generations and vice versa, generations adapt differently to various types of technology.", "I decided not to force my family to understand my job but to answer their question openly and with simple answers adapted to their daily life. It might not work for everyone, and it might not be the ultimate solution, but it can help. Hopefully, your grandma will take an interest and no one will ask you to fix their computer at the next family meeting. Who knows, your grandma might even love the Data Science concept and take a great interest in technology, if we give her a chance!", "As a data scientist, I love to write about the topic but also about the communication issues & the storytelling needs surrounding the topic. For more stories, follow me on Medium or Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
