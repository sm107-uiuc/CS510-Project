It was a great experience that ultimately resulted in us winning the 2020 Ontario-Wide Software Engineering Capstone Competition! As school gets underway and students begin new projects, I thought it\u2019d be useful to share some tips that helped me while working on this project.", "Overall, my big takeaway from working on a capstone involving machine learning was that 90% of the work is whipping the data into submission (or becoming friends with the data, depending on your perspective).", "Understanding the importance of clean data, exploratory data analysis, data wrangling was absolutely vital to the success of our project. I think this point is often underemphasized in course work and can lead people to have a skewed perception of the work involved in such a project. So here are a few tools and techniques (with examples) that helped my team keep a healthy relationship with the data and made the project much more enjoyable.", "Google Colab is a tool for coding and running Jupyter Notebooks (often used for machine learning projects) from Google Drive. There are two big advantages of using Google Colab over local Python scripts or even local Jupyter notebooks.", "First, Colab gives you access to a free cloud-GPU which can really speed up your workflow. Second, using Colab allows data storage on Google Drive (every account has up to 15GB) which makes collaboration on data wrangling much easier. To take advantage of these capabilities our team used a shared folder on Google Drive which contained our Colab Notebooks and a shared data folder with gzipped csv files which were outputted by some notebooks and used as inputs by others. Since the Google Drive folder was shared, everyone could easily access the latest data produced by other members of the team.", "Here\u2019s an example of importing a gzipped csv from a shared folder using a Google Colab notebook:", "If you\u2019re using big csv files, I suggest storing them using gzip compression because the pandas package can unzip and read in the file in one line of code and fast.", "In our project, we had 15 active notebook files that had different inter-dependencies, so having one unambiguous place for data storage was very helpful.", "Temperature, wind, and humidity all have a significant effect on whether a forest fire will occur and whether it will spread. Since these values change significantly throughout the day, we had to obtain hourly data from weather stations across Canada over several years.", "Luckily for us, the Government of Canada (Environment and Climate Change Canada) had historical hourly weather data for hundreds of weather stations across Canada, in some cases going back as far as 1866! They even provided a completely free API for downloading the historical weather data in bulk.", "The API to download hourly data required the user to specify the station ID, the year, and the month. So if we wanted data from 150 stations for the last 10 years that would mean 150x10x12 = 18,000 API calls. Doing those calls in sequence would take a long time so we used the aiohttp package to make the API calls concurrently.", "The above code can be used for fetching any sort of csv data available through a URL.", "During feature engineering, our team hypothesized that absolute humidity may provide additional information that would help with the prediction of forest fires. Absolute humidity can be derived from the temperature and relative humidity using a special formula derived here.", "There are several ways to apply this for every hour of the weather data in the pandas dataframe. We could iterate through each row in the dataframe and compute the absolute humidity:", "Although the above code does the job, it computes the function once for every row. For faster results, the pandas apply function can be used:", "Even though this is faster, the pandas apply function is still fundamentally a loop. For truly speedy calculation, we want to apply the create_abs_humidity function to all temperature and relative humidity pairs at the same time. In most of our project notebooks our team used numpy\u2019s vectorize function for this:", "Not a bad improvement. However, during the writing of this post I found out that using numpy\u2019s vectorize still isn\u2019t true vectorization. In fact, we can\u2019t do true vectorization with calculate_abs_humidity because inside that function we use math.exp which can only operate on a single number at a time and not long lists of numbers (vectors).", "Luckily numpy has an equivalent exponential function that works on vectors, np.exp, so if we make a small adjustment to our original calculate_abs_humidity function, switching out the exponential functions, we get:", "All of a sudden we have a function that can take in entire pandas dataframe columns:", "You might say, \u201cDoes vectorization really matter that much? Saving 8 seconds does not seem like that big of a deal.\u201d For small datasets, I agree that it won\u2019t make a huge difference. For reference, the examples above used hourly data for the last 10 years from a single weather station which resulted in 78,888 rows (still relatively small).", "But what if we wanted to calculate the absolute humidity for data from 100 weather stations for the same time period. Now if you are iterating through each row you would have to wait 13 minutes and this is where vectorization begins to make a serious difference. Vectorization also has the added bonus of making your code more concise and readable so I recommend making a habit to use it when possible.", "The eventual forest fire prediction model used in the capstone project was trained on a dataset containing over 16 million rows (each row contained information for a 20x20 km grid on a given day in the last 10 years). Assembling this dataset turned out to be a crucial part of the project and the whole process was made much easier through the use of:", "I hope you have the opportunity to try some of these tools in your next project!", "If you want to check out the repository of the actual capstone project you can find it here: https://github.com/ivanzvonkov/forestcasting.", "Thanks for reading, all feedback appreciated!", "Your home for data science.
