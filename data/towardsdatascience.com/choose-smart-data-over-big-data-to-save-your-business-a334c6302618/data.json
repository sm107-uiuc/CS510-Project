You cannot expect to throw everything into a pot and hope whatever comes out to grow your business. In working with data, the mantra \u201cthe more the better\u201d is an erroneous doctrine. Despite having the fanciest algorithm, you feed it trash and it eventually gives you trash. Choosing an inappropriate data strategy can cost your company a fortune, or even bankrupt the whole operation.", "Every once in a while, Big Data is regarded as a technology buzzword. I\u2019ve seen companies claim they are using Big Data to change the world while they can\u2019t even change the root permission of their MySQL database. I\u2019ve exaggerated on the database part, but I am trying to make my point.", "Big Data is famous for its five Vs: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value. The final V is occasionally underrated and neglected, but de facto is the most critical element of all data systems. Data value doesn\u2019t come after its volume or velocity in the long run but it decides the approach towards the rest. In case your data doesn\u2019t bring any value to your business, do you still bother collecting it?", "You are proud of having hundreds of terabytes of data but you let them root in your data center\u2019s racks. You insist upon hiring the most skilled data team but all you let them do is cleaning and renaming JSON files. That counterintuitive and not-at-all-environment-friendly approach will hold you back from becoming a data-driven business.", "My data is bigger than your data", "Contentedly saying \u201cMy data is bigger than your data\u201d might make you feel in the same league with other Big Data gurus, but here another saying for you to hone: \u201cMy data is smarter than your data\u201d.", "These are two different definitions of Smart Data I\u2019ve encountered on the Internet", "\u201cSmart data is digital information that is formatted so it can be acted upon at the collection point before being sent to a downstream analytics platform for further data consolidation and analytics\u201d \u2014 WhatIs.com", "\u201cSmart Data\u201d means information that actually makes sense. It is the difference between seeing a long list of numbers referring to weekly sales vs. identifying the peaks and troughs in sales volume over time. \u2014 Wired", "The former even states that smart data is indeed coming from smart devices, huh? As a data engineer, it is a far cry from the way I think about smart data. The latter seems to suit me better, but it still doesn\u2019t feel right. I put together a new definition using my own words", "Smart Data is the part of data whose value can be used directly to answer specific business needs or to fulfill pre-defined outcomes. Smart Data fits thoroughly technical specifications and should be employed as it is without any redundant information in the data structure.", "To put it simply, Smart Data is not a separate entity of Big Data, but from the unprocessed data, it would be retrieved with pieces of valuable information. Smart Data is what you put on your PowerPoint presentation, what you project in the decision-making process.", "As surprising as it sounds, Smart Data doesn\u2019t come last but it should be on the initial design of the process. It determines how you collect the data, the way you construct your data architecture, the people you want to hire to get the job done. Using the outcome to decide the income is a lean method to maximize the result and minimize the cost.", "Let\u2019s introduce John and Jack, two young and enthusiastic entrepreneurs. They both commence their businesses in the data world. They wish to leverage out-of-the-box Big Data and Machine Learning tools to change the face of the eCommerce market. They tend to collect every data point of user events on the shopping platforms to build a quintessential shopper journey. However, John and Jack take different steps to fathom the idea.", "John places his bet on ready-to-use analytics tools. He integrates a code snippet on the websites, mobile applications, and starts to see the data right away. Since he cannot control how the data is formed as input to the pipeline, he feeds whatever the analytics tools give him to the data infrastructure. The rest of the pipeline is composed of over-optimized learning models that John hopes to deliver the best outcome. He is proud of hundreds of gigabytes ingestion in his data pipeline.", "Here\u2019s an example of John\u2019s input data", "Jack, a former Data Engineer, goes for another angle. He craves complete control of the data structure. While his peers have already gotten results from their training models, Jack is still struggling to throw in together his own tracking modules. He is sweating it out, but it will give him an appropriate vision of what he has as input data. Jack can have a compact data format to feed his out-of-the-box Machine Learning models.", "Jack\u2019s example data is more condensed and precise compared to John\u2019s", "Let\u2019s do some quick calculations. In his data point, John has 3 NULL values, 1 duplicate field, 4 unnecessary pieces of information, in a total of 8 columns that can be removed. Let\u2019s say in John\u2019s data storage, he uses 16 bytes for an integer, 32 bytes for a long number, and 256 bytes for a string, that add up to:", "765 GB of data rests idle and unproductive inside of John\u2019s Hadoop data center in a single year. That would cost John thousands of dollars for maintaining redundant Hadoop nodes. His cash quickly burns out and he cannot figure out why his machine learning models don\u2019t work with that big of data. As he cumulates hundreds of terabytes in his database, John doesn\u2019t know what to do with that. He fails to control his data.", "Jack, on the other hand, maintains small ingestion in his data pipeline. He has just the right amount of data to feed his training models which can give him positive outcomes. Jack saves tons of money in data storage, and he reinvests in building better algorithms for his application. Jack takes the wheel when it comes to the data structure, and he is proud of his small but smart data.", "There are no exact John and Jack in real life, but somewhere in between. Entreprises are wrestling with their ROI maximization by optimizing their algorithms and hyper-tuning their models. They keep feeding Big Data to their process believing it will learn something useful at the end.", "Without valuable information, Big Data is nothing but fruitless digital pieces and merely a burden to your business. Redundant, unnecessary, and duplicate data is the root of all evil. In a chaotic data era, Smart Data would be our savior, and it doesn\u2019t come last but rather the first of all things.", "My name\u2019s Nam Nguyen, and I write about Big Data. Enjoy your reading?
