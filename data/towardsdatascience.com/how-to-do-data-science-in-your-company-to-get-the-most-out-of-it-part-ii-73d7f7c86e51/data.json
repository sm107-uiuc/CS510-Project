In the last story I\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Building a Data Science Team in a fast-growing company, I will share some of my personal insights on how to overcome struggles and get the most from the data in your company. In the last story I suggested a potential structure and favorable conditions for doing Data Science (Components):", "In this story, I will present some results-oriented project patterns for data science projects (Flow). In the next story, I will summarize learnings and success factors for data science (Grease). All three stories convey experiences that have been made on the way to maximizing the outcomes of data initiatives.", "But let\u2019s start now. In the following I will outline how we manage and lead data projects. This is not an easy tasks, as the natures of data projects can be very different: there are concise questions that should be answered quickly and clearly, and there are very abstract questions that require a broader understanding and a more comprehensive solution. To describe this bimodal nature of data projects, I will distinguish two types of projects: Data Analysis Projects and Novel Data Solutions.", "What are Data Analysis Projects? The company\u2019s efforts should be measured recktlessly at its impact on the company\u2019s performance KPIs. This is important in order to learn what actions to take. According to my observation, there are prospectivly and retrospectivly thinking people: the former first want to understand a topic and then initiate carefully selected measures, the latter want to follow intuition quickly and confirm the results only later. Both perspectives have similar requirements: some issue needs to be analyzed for some KPI to understand the extend, change, performance or difference to back a decision and eliminate biases. However, the point in time when the data needs to be analyzed and the type of questions differ.", "Data Analysis Projects have certain characteristics: the requirements can be set in advance, there is a clear expected result, and the necessary efforts can be estimated in advance to some extent. This is an important feature as the results are very relevant to decision makers and are needed in a timely manner. And because the requirements for Data Analysis Projects are somewhat fixed \u2014 even though sometimes complicated \u2014 predefined workflows can be applied to manage them. This reduces risks, provides transparency towards requesters and enables fast iterations.", "How do we deal with Data Analysis Projects?", "In order to be able to work efficiently on analytical data projects, we try to manage them in a process-oriented way. Although we receive requests through various contact points and in different teams, we coordinate them well. Analysis requests get refined, prioritized and planned. First, we try to understand which data mart can answer the question and what kind of analysis is needed, and then we decide which team processes the analysis. Then we give the requester a first feedback. When the task is performed, we get the data, analyze it, review the results along with the requestors, iterate as needed, and communicate the results quickly and in a timely manner. For most tasks, we use standard processes. This is different from Novel Data Solutions that require different procedures, which I will describe in the following.", "What are Novel Data Solutions? I am referring to novel data solutions when I Speak of one of these moonshot projects, for example trying to predict whether a product with particular attributes and price will be sold or whether a product type ca be identified by its image. Unlike Data Analysis Projects, little is known about how to complete the project. The focus is on fuzzy, complex and general questions of a company (e.g., \u201cwe want to understand our products\u201d, \u201cwhat does a customer want?\u201d). Let\u2019s call them the big questions. By answering such questions, new products and solutions can be developed that have a strong impact on business and customer value.", "Although Novel Data Solutions offer a high value to the company, they have a very different nature: the schedule is often unclear and difficult to estimate. However, great efforts are required to get initial results (sometimes 10 times the normal efforts). The way to get results is unclear and explorative, and the outcome is very uncertain. In summary, these types of projects pose a high risk high gain profile: they can turn out to be not feasible at all, e.g., because the information needed is not included in the data, but they can also have a strong impact on the business. This means that they have the potential to even disrupt and change the entire business. As a result, the projects feel like \u201cexperiments\u201d that are somewhat unusual and self-contained, but have many dependencies.", "How do we deal with Novel Data Solutions?", "Novel Data Solutions can only be led and not managed because of their very complex nature and high dependencies. Planing ahead and setting deadlines seems counterproductive. However, after some experience from our initial pilot projects, we started to manage risks with a few thoughtful optimizations. First of all, we started with very selective priorities to allow only a few and carefully selected projects to get started. This helps to stay very focused. Secondly, we have started working with timeboxes and an initial fast iteration (such as a two week prototype) to gain some experience and understanding of the problem before we get too busy with it. Lastly, we have become big fans of early failure. That is why we have started started to cut through projects from end-to-end right from the beginning with an initial version, to see where the pitfalls lie.", "From the perspective of the complete Novel Data Solution project portfolio we began to collect and incubate a wide range of topics at an early stage, in discussion with all key stakeholders from product management, development, marketing, customer relations and management. This manifests itself in a list of big questions that we revise on a regular basis. This list helps us to develop initial thoughts and hypotheses on a subject first, include the perspectives of experts and the market momentum, until we decide on the next projects to focus on. We have learned to \u201cgrow\u201d Novel Data Solutions step by step rather than planning to hard. But we always coordinate carefully with the running projects, to see where we stand and to be able to control the efforts and risks. We thereby use a kind of sowing, breeding, rejecting or harvesting approach. And this is important to share: do not fix long term roadmaps! Because of the very nature of this kind of projects, do only plan the next step and revise the status quo regularly (at least quarterly) and only afterwards plan the next projects. However, we diversify risks over a clear portfolio of selected moonshots that we run concurrently, as in some cases the outcome can be nothing, but in other cases the outcome can be everything.", "It is very important to communicate well with all stakeholders throughout the whole process. In the beginning, the main goal is to bring business knowledge and context into the project. Later, we want to make risks transparent, find solutions to potential obstacles, and sharpen goals. Towards the end of the prototype development, possible results must be incorporated or tested as part of the company\u2019s products, and concepts and data models must be put to production. However, because of the vague nature of Novel Data Solution projects, forward planning is very difficult, and therefore good communication with all stakeholders has to compensate for that.", "Clearly, both types of projects are difficult to organize together as they can push the conflict between urgent and important to the extreme. Therefore, it is very important to prioritize and protect the desired amount of open and more uncertain Novel Data Solutions. This can be achieved through a \u201cstrong door\u201d, i.e., by limiting the total number of projects currently running and by strictly limiting the number of accepted ad-hoc questions. This helps that the \u201cbig questions\u201d can be addressed in a focused way and that the ongoing projects are not clogged by the more urgent and tangible.", "Learning from our first data projects we developed the following procedure (see Figure above):", "First, a request coming from a business unit or management is evaluated. In this step, we understand whether the task is something that needs to be supported by a statistical model or needs to be analysed in a more linear way, which team could accomplish the task best, how complicated/complex the task is, what priority it has, and what data source is needed. After that, we can redirect the task to right person/team (bypass the quarterly roadmap), or schedule the task for the next quarter, if it is a more complicated task, (through the quarterly roadmap), or we can put the task on the list of big questions, if it is one of the harder questions that does not need to be addressed immediately.", "We regularly review and update the list of big questions that contains \u201cfundamental questions of the business that could be answered using data\u201d. This list contains potential projects that we have gathered over the years from stakeholders, brainstorming, best-practices, and many other sources. The list contains many projects that could offer real potential, but at the same time are very complex to solve (e.g., understanding users, predicting the market, \u2026). These big questions are gradually reviewed and refined in iterations.", "Secondly, in line with emerging business objectives, we get the most promising big questions from the list (\u201cbacklog\u201d) every quarter and plan some of them in our quarterly roadmap (though we know that some questions can take more time than a quarter to solve, but this is a great way to limit the amount of time invested first, and only continue after review). The remainder of the quarterly roadmap will be filled with other initiatives.", "Topics from the roadmap and tasks that have gone through the ad-hoc bypass are then either (1) simply executed in the data team via kanbans in the case of analyses, or (2) scheduled for a flow of the development and machine learning team (if the task requires more development or machine learning work), or (3) a timebox is created for a first prototyp of the topic (if it is very complex and a better understanding needs to be developed first). This timebox is assigned directly to a person or a project team, and the schedule of other tasks leaves room for the assigned timebox.", "To make things transparent, the backlog and boards are open accessable. Moreover, the ongoing and planned projects for the next iteration are communicated within the company regularly. In addition, directly affected product managers or developers are kept in coordination via standups if needed to maintain the flow of information.", "These are my findings on how data projects can be organized so far. In the next part, I will summarize general insights and success factors that will make data-driven initiatives successful. Stay tuned!", "Your home for data science.
