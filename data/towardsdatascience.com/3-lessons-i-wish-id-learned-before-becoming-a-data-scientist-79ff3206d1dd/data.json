I\u2019ve worked mainly in companies where \u201cdata\u201d is a support function to the business, so my experience may well be different from 100% data-driven companies. Also, this is only a personal experience: feel free to disagree!", "The first lesson I learned was one that people had more or less prepared me for. Data is more important than everything: make sure you understand the data before starting. However, when hearing this, I would have never expected the degree of incorrectness that many real-world data has.", "Real world data is often completely wrong", "And it is not only a data problem, but it is also a company problem. Sometimes people seem to pay money to collect data that is just non-sensical. For example, I\u2019ve worked on projects where the goal is the prediction of a target variable which was a percentage of defects on a production line.", "Four months into the project, I found out that the trackers that measure our target value were completely wrong: the operators of the production line used the detectors differently then they should have, resulting in a huge bias in the data. Result: the project got canceled and I could throw away four months of work.", "To know how the data is really generated, you need to ask the right people: your users or your data generating field workers", "Conclusion: data is often wrong. There is huge value in looking at individual observations and deep-diving how the data collection process works. Not in theory, but in practice! Go and visit the data generation if possible. Ask the people who work with those every day to give you an estimate of their usability before starting. You really want to find this out at the beginning rather than at the end.", "My second lesson is about the statistical and machine learning models that we data scientists have in our toolkit.", "Understanding your model is much more important than you think.", "I\u2019ve learned that understanding your model is much more important than you think. In Data Science, we are always talking about accuracy scores. They are very important. Also, improving the accuracy of models is what I get paid for, so we can\u2019t ignore it.", "Some events are super rare and maybe not present in your training data: do you know what your model will do?", "But we all know when we built a model that the accuracy is like the lotto. Sometimes it\u2019s good, sometimes it\u2019s bad. The worst-case: some events are super rare and maybe not present in your training data. This is also known as the Black Swan effect.", "My lesson: the day your production model goes bad and you find out that there is a rare value that occurs sometimes and your model starts making very bad decisions, you will wish you had inspected the actual fit of your model much, much better.", "The worst lesson I\u2019ve had is this: many clients, stakeholders, managers are not at all interested in lessons 1 and 2. Sometimes the hardest part of Data Science is justifying what can or cannot be done and how many times certain projects can take.", "Sometimes the hardest part of Data Science is justifying what you can or cannot do.", "I\u2019ve heard of cases when a model that outperformed on selected KPIs would be sent to prod, whether the data scientist would agree or not. You could say okay the KPI is wrong, but sometimes a client will be very focused on the KPIs rather than on having a reliable solution.", "In Data Science, it is often difficult to know in advance whether a project can work. Justification, communication, and feedback loops are very important in this domain and it is primordial to adapt to different types of clients.", "An incremental way of working improves collaboration with stakeholders and can make the final result much better.", "I\u2019ve learned that an incremental way of working improves collaboration with stakeholders: start with building a minimum solutions \u2014 whether a data analysis or a working model \u2014 and ask feedback from your stakeholders. Then if they want to continue in your proposed direction, add an increment to your product, until your stakeholders find it good enough.", "This increment-and-feedback-cycle practice is based on Agile methodologies and avoids a part of the risk of Data Science projects that is to not have a good solution at the end. You can even base your contracts on this approach by stating a price per product increment or per time spent without fixing the total amount of money beforehand. This can seem risky at the beginning, but it can make your final result much better.", "Thanks for reading. Don\u2019t hesitate to share your learnings in the comments so we can all learn from each other!", "Your home for data science.
