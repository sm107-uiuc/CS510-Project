It makes our life easier by allowing us to store, explore, and manipulate data with a few lines of code. However, there are times when you want to use your function to manage your data. For that reason, I try to write an article to introduce you to some of the attributes we could use for data manipulation with our function.", "Here are the four must-know Pandas Function Applications.", "Pandas encouraged us to use a method chaining to manipulate our data. If you did not know what method chaining is, let me show you with an example below.", "Method chaining is aa continuous function executed in the same line of code. We use a chain method to decrease the line we write and execute the function faster.", "How about if we want to chain our function? Let\u2019s see a simple example below.", "As we can see, we need to execute our function within another function to produce the result. How long it takes to execute these functions?", "It takes 18ms to execute a function within a function code. Now, let me introduce you to a chaining method using thepipe attribute below.", "Method chaining in Pandas object would need the use of the pipe attribute. Each function we want to chain is inputted in the pipe attribute. We can see that the result is similar to the example above. What about the execution time?", "Using pipe attribute for method chaining only took 6ms. It is clear that which one is quicker. It might seem it is not much different in the execution time, but imagine if we working with big data. The execution time would play a bigger part. That is why it is advisable to use pipewhen we method chaining of our function.", "Previously we talked about the chaining method to the whole dataset, but how about if we want to broadcast our function in a row-wise or column-wise? In this case, we could use the apply attribute. Let me show it using an example below.", "By default, the function we input in the apply attribute would be broadcasted to each column. The result is series with the column name as the index and the returning value of the function as the series value.", "We could create our own function as well. In fact, this is why we use the apply attribute. It is because we could implement our function to transform the data in a column-wise or row-wise. Let me show you the example below.", "Using my own function, I get a result of each column mean divided by two. If you realize, the function that I create is accepting one parameter I called col. With this col parameter, I return the mean of each column by using the meanattribute. This means the function that we created for the apply attribute would accepting a series object of each column. That way, we could use any of the series methods in our own function.", "How about a row-wise application? yes, we could apply our function to the dataset in a row-wise manner. Let me show you by a simple example below.", "We could see from the result that we are printing each row of the data where each row is transformed into a series object. The series index is the column name, the series value is the value in each row, and the series name is the index name of each row.", "Just like before, we could create our own function. Let me show you an example below.", "As you can see, we now have a new column called Classification. The values are based on the mpg_classification function we used in the apply attribute. In the case of row-wise, we iterate in each row so the function we input is applied in each row. Each iteration is a series object consists of the row values with the index is the column name. In my function above, the cols parameter would be filled by the series object of each row; that is why I specified which column I use in the cols parameter(cols[\u2018mpg\u2019] and cols[\u2018model_year\u2019]).", "The aggregationor agg allows one to express possibly multiple aggregation operations in a single concise way. For you who did not know what aggregation is, let me just show you with an example below.", "Aggregation using one function is similar to the apply attribute we use before. It applying a function to each column and produce a series object. What makesagg special is how it could take multiple functions.", "With multiple functions as an input, we get a Data Frame object. What is great about agg attribute is that the function only applied to the valid object. If the function we input cannot accept certain data types, it would be ignored.", "Passing a dictionary object to the agg attribute allows us to specify which function is applied to what column.", "All the attributes we learned previously is based on the whole dataset or column/row-wise. How about if we want to apply the function only to each element or value? in this case, we would use the applymap attribute. Let me show you an example below.", "The result is a Data Frame object where the function we input to the applymap is applied to each value in the dataset. We also have map attribute for the series object that is equivalent to the Data Frame applymap attribute.", "In this article, I have shown you four Pandas Function Applications that prove to be useful in our everyday Data Science work. They are:", "If you are not subscribed as a Medium Member, please consider subscribing through my referral.", "Your home for data science.
