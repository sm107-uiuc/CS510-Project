A traditional Data Scientist has a background in a field related to Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineer or Physics. But we also find other professionals coming from a wide variety of fields that do not have a strong mathematical background like linguistics and genomics, just to name a few.", "But regardless of your background, the question we all ask when the interest in Data Science emerges is:", "\u201cWhat skills/knowledge do I need to have to become a Data Scientist?\u201d.", "Many authors have written about the topic, and the list of essential skills is usually overwhelming. In general, it covers the following topics:", "After scrolling through the list, you usually find out that you don\u2019t master most of the skills defined as \u201cessential\u201d. You get frustrated, your Impostor syndrome kicks in and you realize you\u2019ll need thousands of hours of study just to cover the basics to become a Junior Data Scientist.", "\u201cYou probably need thousands of hours of study and hard work to master all the skills needed to become an experienced Data Scientist\u201d.", "\u201cYou can start your career focusing on learning a few skills that are essential for any Data Science project\u201d.", "In order to use this practical approach, we first need to take a look at an important concept to helps us define our priorities on our journey to become a Data Scientist.", "Vilfredo Pareto was an Italian engineer, sociologist, economist, political scientist, and philosopher from the XIX century that first described what is now know as the 80/20 Rule, or the Pareto Principle.", "The idea behind the Pareto principle is that some observable phenomena follow an uneven distribution, with 80% of the results (or effect) coming from 20% of the cause.", "This principle was observed in different fields like economics, epidemics, computing, sports, engineering and many more, sometimes taking extreme values like 90%/10%, 95%/5% or even 99%/1%.", "The idea was synthesized on Richards Kock\u2019s great book \u201cThe 80/20 Principle: The Secret of Achieving More with Less\u201d, where the author describes many strategies to use the principle in order to optimize our life, spending time and energy on what really matters.", "So bringing this idea back to our Data Science learning path, if we could identify a pattern following the Pareto distribution, maybe we could use it to our benefit.", "As you might have heard from somebody with at least a little bit of experience doing Data Science, at least three quarters (sometimes more than 80%) of your time is spent collecting, wrangling and preprocessing data. In other words, you have to dedicate a significant amount of time just to organize your dataset. I know some Data scientists might be lucky to work on an environment where data is well cataloged and curated, meaning they can spend more time on data visualization and generating models and less on the initial steps described above, but this is usually an exception to the rule.", "In most companies, the data is stored in different databases, and you usually have to combine tables using SQL queries, or using APIs to fetch data from distinct sources. Data is then organized and explored using Pandas (or R). In this phase, you\u2019ll take care of missing values, outliers and generate a dataset that can be used on the next steps of the analysis (Data Visualization and model training). That would be a perfect scenario if you knew exactly the structure of your databases and APIs requests, and if all your data was consistent without missing values or outliers.", "In reality, this process takes much longer than you expect, as you iteratively go back to data collection and wrangling many times, until you finally have your dataset ready.", "Based on the fact that 80% of a Data Scientist time is spent doing data collection and organizing the dataset, my advice for you starting your career, independent of your background, is to focus on mastering the skills for Programming, Data Wrangling, and Data extraction.", "If you learn Python, Pandas and SQL you can probably perform at least 80% the daily work of a Data Scientist.", "Going back to our initial list of skills needed to become a Data Scientist, out of a total of 12 skills, you first need to focus on 3 of them: Programming, SQL and Data Wrangling/Preprocessing. As the list could be extended much further if you take into account other technical and soft skills needed, the 80/20 rule could also be applied to describe a day in the life of Data Scientist.", "Just one quick note about my opinion on why you should choose Python over other languages like R, Julia or Scala. The reason I mentioned Python it\u2019s because it is the most popular language for Data Science today and a great first language for anyone trying to learn how to program, as its learning curve is probably one of the easiest.", "Most introductory courses on Machine Learning shows you the available algorithms for doing regression and classification (Supervised Learning) or clustering (Unsupervised Learning). Trying to understand and master each one of these methods and when to use them can be tiring and not really rewarding. Don\u2019t worry! It\u2019s good to know what methods exist and what are the main applications for each one, but you\u2019ll only fully understand each one when you start using it on your own projects.", "As you develop your skill collecting and preprocessing Data, the following steps (visualization and model selection) can be performed with more confidence. From a practical perspective, you\u2019ll probably start working with a specific problem/question related to your company or research project. As you dive deeper into the datasets and define your hypothesis, you\u2019ll have time research the methods and Machine Learning Algorithms that can offer you the best solution. That\u2019s one more argument on why you should focus first on learning the skills needed to collect and organize data.", "I want to reiterate that the goal of this article is not to sell you the idea that you only need the 3 mentioned skills to do Data Science.", "If you focus your energy on learning first Python, Pandas and SQL, you could see practical results faster, and even execute tasks that are usually performed by Data Engineers and Data Analysts.", "And as you are already seeing the practical results of your acquired knowledge, you can keep studying the rest of the skills on the list.", "As you can see from the classical \u201cData Science Hierarchy of Needs\u201d (Figure 2), the base of the pyramid consist of data collection, followed by moving/storing and exploring/transforming data. These skills are usually related to a Data Engineer work, showing the importance of this position on present Data Science projects.", "So without a strong basic knowledge of the skills related to Data processing and wrangling you (and your team) probably won\u2019t be able to perform a successful Data Science project.", "As mentioned in the article\u2019s title, my main goal is to help you decide which skills you need to prioritize when starting to study Data Science. I know the subject can be controversial, as we observe many distinct paths for becoming a Data Scientist. From my personal experience, you definitely have a long journey and optimizing your learning can offer you job opportunities faster. I believe that a strong foundation on the skills mentioned in the article and a relative amount o self- discipline and dedication can bring you incredible results sooner than you expected.", "Your home for data science.
