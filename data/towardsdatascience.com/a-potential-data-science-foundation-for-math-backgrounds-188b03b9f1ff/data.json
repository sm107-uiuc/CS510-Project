Congrats! But maybe you aren\u2019t sure what you want to do in the field yet but you want to get in there yesterday. Many advocate that you should dive into a project of your own to learn what you need. Although this is a good approach you will learn a lot from, you may not be comfortable with this because of a lack of coding background. You may just prefer going through a few courses first to build a foundation for tackling projects.", "That is ok. So let me help you out.", "As someone with a math background (master\u2019s in pure mathematics), this was my issue. I wanted to get into the field but didn\u2019t have enough coding skills outside of a random JavaScript class I took many years ago. I also didn\u2019t know which aspect of data science I liked since the field hadn\u2019t made distinguishing titles for each of the subfields yet.", "Here I will give you my opinion on what courses you could select for a foundation and why. This selection is based on my experience trying to get into the field coupled with my experience as a data scientist now. This could be a useful selection if you still aren\u2019t sure which part of the data science field you want to dive into. I will also provide the exact classes I took following this format at the end of the explanations. If you simply want to see a quick list without explanations, simply look below:", "The purpose of Python or R is to provide you with a means to perform all the cool techniques you get to do in data science. They are a means to an end. The data you will be working with is data you will not be able to manipulate with pen and paper.", "You can try both, but regardless of which language you select, you need to make you have a main programming language skill. The reason why is that the concepts you learn from one language (such as loops, built-in functions, and other programming concepts) carry over to other languages. You can also achieve more comfortably if you are strong in one programming language.", "In my case I chose Python. This language is known for being a great general programming language, meaning it can handle everything including data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, and web development. If you are still iffy about selecting a programming language I feel learning Python is a safe investment. You can also download Anaconda for a quick setup.", "You may not need SQL when learning data science since a lot of the data you could be working with doesn\u2019t take up much memory. But to paraphrase a Google data scientist from this interview:", "\u201cIf the data fits into memory on your machine, you can use anything. Otherwise use SQL\u201d", "I have discovered this in my current position. There are datasets with at least a million or more rows more frequently than not. In order to use it in Python for further analysis or to prep it for a machine learning model, SQL has become essential to work with. SQL is what allows you to filter data down to fit in memory and run smoothly on your machine through Python or R. Regardless of what language you pick above, make SQL your second language.", "Manipulating your data is key to any data science task. It will allow you to view the data in a manner that will uncover an untold story. It will allow you to format your data to make your machine learning model produce optimal results. It is said that 80% of the work done by those in the field is data cleaning and manipulation. You will quickly discover that as you go through particular courses or your own projects.", "Following data manipulation is the need to visualize your data. You need to understand what your data is saying. Again, what is the data\u2019s underlying story? To properly prep the data for a machine learning model you need to understand what the data has in its raw form. Exploratory Data Analysis (aka visualization) is key for all of the above.", "Machine Learning is what solves problems related to performing actions that can not be directly programmed due to unclear variables (and a lot of them). This is where the techniques for the following come from:", "If you are interested in solving these types of problems, then you should definitely learn machine learning. If you are interested in learning how to build software that automates tasks, learning machine learning will help you tackle those automation tasks. Another reason is some basic classification and regression techniques fall into the same techniques you would learn in statistics such as linear regression.", "Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning where the models are built using what is known as neural networks. These neural networks allow for heavy-duty computation to produce results that can be better than the models you would learn in the machine learning course you select.", "If you are interested in anything related to image data or text data, I would recommend you dive deep into deep learning (pun intended). The current advancements related to image and text data are thanks to deep learning and its neural network structures.", "Below is the list of courses (in order) I took following this guide with links.", "Note: These are not affiliate links nor am I sponsored by any of these platforms. Putting this here in case anyone has concerns about that.", "Now you may have noticed that most of these courses are:", "b) Have a similar title because\u2026", "c) They are all from the same instructors.", "This is all true. I found for me that after the first two courses by these gentlemen that I was benefitting from their teaching style. So I stuck with them, and I am glad I did. I was ok with paying for courses because they were about $10\u2013$11 at the time. Udemy always has random sales so you can wait until then. Now the lowest I see is closer to $12 during a sale. The other reasons were that Udemy lets you keep the courses forever and can watch the videos on your phone.", "There are a ton of courses which cover the same material the courses above do in some variation. What matters is pick a course that will benefit you the most. I would advise if you can to try and stick to one platform to make course management easier. But if you are ok jumping between platforms that is fine. If you would like to hear a second opinion on this, check out this video by Kenjee that discusses free courses you can get started with.", "Thanks for reading this post! If you found this post helpful and would like more tips for your data science journey, check out the posts below.", "Again, this guide is based on my experience given I already had a strong math background. Regardless of what you do, make sure that you take the time to practice what you are learning with your own projects asap. Don\u2019t get stuck in tutorial purgatory!", "If you have courses you have tried and were helpful, please leave a comment for others to see. You can be helping someone out in the future with that simple act.", "You can follow or connect with me on Linkedin and Twitter. Open to DM\u2019s on Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
