Stepping out of the academic world 2 years ago and working in a Data Science (DS) role, I have had a chance to witness the emergence and prevail of DL in both domains. While there is no doubt that DL has been outperforming \u201ctraditional\u201d ML methods in many applications/studies, there are more and more academic scientists and ML practitioners calling for a recognition of the fact that DL models and mindsets might be (and keep being) used in an abusive manner (https://towardsdatascience.com/the-machine-learning-crisis-in-scientific-research-91e61691ae76) in both academia and industrial domains. It has become a buzzword that associated methods are used without further consideration or simply a self-questioning: \u201cIs it really the best option for this problem?\u201d.", "I had multiple chances interviewing candidates for Data Scientist roles in my team, and there were a couple of times I asked this question:", "Could you please tell me an example problem that you think or know for sure that DL models will fail?", "The question was, of course, an open discussion and there is no right or wrong answer, but quite often I found candidates being caught off guard.", "There is a myriad of ML toolboxes and platforms now and it has never been this easy to apply an ML model. Again, there is no doubt about all success stories of using DL and I believe there will be more; however, as we all agree that there is no \u201cuniversal\u201d ML model that works for every case, every model has its Achilles\u2019 heel, and DL is no exception.", "Coming back to the interview question, I constructed myself a \u201cthought experiment\u201d (more like a Jupiter notebook experiment in DS language) about a case that naively applying a DL model will fail.", "Let\u2019s create a synthetic dataset. We assume that we are observing measurements from an unknown function, and we would like to build an ML model to predict the target given sampled independent variable, after being trained with labeled data. In reality, the unknown function (sometimes referred to as \u201cGod knows\u201d function) is the natural distribution of the data that generates the measurements that we observer. In this experiment, we use a simple line function, y=a*x+b, as the God-knows function. Then, we add some white noise to the target to simulate the uncertainty in the measurement process.", "As we see, this is a simple dataset with a linear relation between the independent and dependent variables.", "In order to introduce some delusion to the data, we create additional \u201ctrivial\u201d features:", "So, we have added three more features, all are just dependencies of the original one (created with linear and non-linear transformations). Anyone who has been working on ML models in production will be able to point out easily that those trivial features can be filtered out by just looking at feature correlation. One would see a very strong correlation among the 4 features, signaling that only one feature can represent the whole data.", "As we are doing a thought experiment, we want to see how a neural network model performs on raw data without a proper data cleaning and analysis step. Hence, we proceed to feed these 4 features directly into a DL model.", "We do a standard train-test data sets split and train a Keras neural network.", "Next, let\u2019s remove all the trivial features and try again with exactly the same Keras model we constructed above. In other words, our feature space now has a dimension of 1, instead of 4 as before, as we keep only the \u201ctrue\u201d feature. This time, we get:", "A significant improvement in RMSE (compared to 36.048). Thus, we see that a DL model (a neural network in this case) is not immune to bad data.", "Finally, let\u2019s try one of the simplest and most prolonged methods: linear regression.", "Please note that in the code above, x_train has only the \u201ctrue\u201d feature, i.e., has dimension = 1. What a surprise! RMSE is only 9.42. Note that the linear model also did a good job in estimating the coefficient (0.4995 vs 0.5) and the intercept (99.95 vs 100). Also, the RMSE is close to the white noise magnitude (9.42 vs 10), since the linear regression model gets very close to the underlying (God-knows) function y=a*x+b.", "Let\u2019s have a look at this figure copied from a paper of Yoshua Bengio [1]:", "Imagine that you have a 128x128 grayscale image of number 4. Since this is a 128x128 image, the dimension of the data is 128*128=16,384 (one pixel is one dimension of the data). Now, assume that we transform the number 4 in the figure, by rotating or transitioning, each transformed state generates a data point. For instance, we have 100 images of number 4 with different poses. If I plot this 100 data points of this 16,384-dimension data to a 2D graph (16,384 lines of 100 ticks), apparently one can not recognize that this data is just different poses of number 4. As human, we don\u2019t perceive data (and the world) in each individual dimension of the data, we perceive them in abstract and representative level.", "The same underlying principle is applied to the DL family of methods.", "DL methods are designed to recognize representative patterns (usually in low dimension) in a high dimension data space.", "In the example in the paper, the actual degree of freedom (DOF) is only 2 (rotation and transition), but the dimension of the data space is 16,384! This is a very challenging problem for traditional methods, but a DL model would be able to learn higher level of abstract and representative features as the input data propagates up the layers.", "So, does your problem has this nature? In our thought experiment, it surely does not, and by selecting the right model (linear regression) that matches the nature of the data (linear relationship), a simple linear regression beats a neural network.", "This article is based on my knowledge and surely it\u2019s limited, so please feel free to share your thoughts/comments.", "[1] Yoshua Bengio, Learning Deep Architectures for AI (2009), Foundations and Trends\u00ae in Machine Learning", "Your home for data science.
