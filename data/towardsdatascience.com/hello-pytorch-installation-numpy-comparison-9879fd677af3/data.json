To perform deep learning tasks without too much headache one will need a sophisticated library.", "And that\u2019 where PyTorch comes in \u2014 it\u2019s an open-source machine learning library used for tasks such as NLP and computer vision. It\u2019s primarily developed by Facebook, and most importantly, it has a well-polished Python interface.", "Before jumping into code the library will first need to be installed on your machine. The installation itself will be different among users, depending on if you have a GPU or not. If you have it, then please refer back to this article which demonstrates how to install CUDA and cuDNN \u2014 a prerequisite if you want to train deep learning models on a GPU:", "I know it says \u2018TensorFlow\u2019, so you\u2019ll only need to follow the first section of the article.", "CUDA and cuDNN installed? Nice, you can proceed.", "Please navigate to this site and click on options that are relevant to your machine:", "As you can see, the folks at PyTorch.org will generate a terminal command which you have to execute. The GPU version has around 750MB, so it might take a while to download and install.", "Once done, you can open up a Jupyter Notebook environment.", "Imports-wise the only two libraries that will be needed are Numpy and Torch, and those can easily be imported as shown below:", "In the Numpy library, the concept of Arrays is known, irrelevant of whether the array is one-dimensional or multidimensional. In Torch for the same concept, but the name Tensor is used and is used to generalize a concept of n-dimensional arrays.", "Here\u2019s how to declare a 2-dimensional array in Numpy:", "And here\u2019s how to do exactly the same in PyTorch:", "As can be seen, the idea behind declaration is more or less identical, if you don\u2019t take into account the different method names.", "But what more can be transferred from Numpy to Torch? Let\u2019s see how arrays of random numbers can be declared. Numpy implementation first:", "The syntax is once again more or less identical.", "One more common thing data scientists find themself do all the time is to check shapes of arrays. In the field, it\u2019s pretty common to get a shape mismatch error and to avoid that error one needs to know what caused it.", "Here\u2019s how the shape of the array can be checked in Numpy:", "This time in Torch the syntax is actually identical, which is great to accelerate your learning process:", "Great. Some basic stuff was shown and hopefully, you\u2019re now feeling more comfortable with the library. Let\u2019s check more of the common tasks in the next section.", "To perform matrix multiplication in Numpy one first needs to create two matrices that can be multiplied \u2014 ergo the number of columns of the first matrix must be identical to the number of rows of the second matrix.", "Let\u2019s see how it\u2019s done in Numpy:", "Unlike Numpy, Torch uses the .mm() method to multiply matrices:", "If, however, .mm() doesn\u2019t sound as descriptive as you would with, the .matmul() method can be also used:", "If the goal is not to perform matrix multiplication, but instead to do multiplication element-wise, the matrices can be multiplied just as any other regular numbers would be, and the syntax is identical for both Numpy and Torch:", "Some other common operations are to declare an array of zeros with a specific shape. The syntax for doing so is identical in both libraries:", "If, however, you wish to create an arbitrary array of ones with a specific shape, you can use the convenient .ones() function. The syntax is once again identical for both libraries:", "An arbitrary Numpy array can easily be converted to Torch Tensor with the help of .from_numpy() function:", "In a similar fashion, Torch Tensor can be converted to a Numpy array. The syntax is a bit different, so keep that in mind:", "The idea behind this article was to make an introduction to the PyTorch and to compare it to something you are probably familiar with \u2014 the Numpy library.", "Numpy is great, but unlike PyTorch in cannot run on GPU, and all of the deep learning requires GPU to train in a reasonable time. The following articles will be more deep learning orientated, so stay tuned if you\u2019re interested in that.", "However, you should know the basics of the libraries you\u2019re using before actually using them to solve real-world problems, so that\u2019s what this article tried to cover.", "Thanks for reading and stay tuned for more.", "Loved the article?
