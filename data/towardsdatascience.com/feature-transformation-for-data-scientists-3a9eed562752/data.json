These modifications will make Machine Learning algorithms understanding easier, which will deliver better results.", "We\u2019ll cover all the steps for each method, from explanation to code; But first, let\u2019s take a look at what we will learn today:", "You can download the dataset by clicking here. Now, we need to define some parameters and questions to answer.", "This artificial data set simulate some data about the possibility of heart disease, which is our goal. To find out, we have some false medical information, like blood pressure, age, and sodium amount.", "The first thing you want to do when obtaining new data is to check it and look for missing values; Let\u2019s see how it looks.", "I added some empty values \u200b\u200bat random to this dataset, ignoring the heart disease column. As for our method, it is okay to use Pandas functions for small data sets; But if you have bigger ones, consider using scikit-learn.", "In Pandas, we have a nice function called fillna() that, as you can imagine, will fill any empty value. Let\u2019s take a look.", "Simple, right? It will produce the changes below.", "How simple it was! One line of code and that\u2019s it, awesome! But calm down, there is a problem: we define the same value as categorical and numerical, this is not right, so what to do?", "Now, we have the average value of the entire column filling empty spaces in numerical resources and the \u201cmissing\u201d text in categorical spaces.", "Before proceeding, we need to look for discrepancies in our numerical columns, as they can affect the quality of our model. Based on a specific problem, it is best to keep each value, but you need to know how to remove them anyway.", "You can usually use some graphical tools to display them, such as Matplotlib. The type of chart? Histogram and boxplot, usually. Don\u2019t know how to plot your data? I have an article about it: The ultimate guide for Data Visualization.", "We will check our data representation without outliers below.", "For the sake of knowledge, I have attached a single case that changes a person\u2019s age to 134, a rarity.", "You may not be comfortable with the visualizations or just want something more to the point. If you fit the description above, I\u2019ll leave the code to create a DataFrame with only outliers.", "With a lot of outliers, our model will create patterns that use these values, but they are usually just typos, false data, and so on.", "There are usually two common ways to remove outliers: standard deviation and interquartile range. There are more like the Z-score and even manual removal, but let\u2019s ignore them for now.", "Using the standard deviation, we can select only those data that are between +3 or -3 standard deviations from the mean. This value can be adjusted, but it usually ranges from 2 to 4. If you are unsure how to use standard deviations, click here to watch a Khan Academy video.", "To remove outliers in this way, we need to obtain the first and third quartiles. The data must be in ascending order.", "In this phase, we introduce an interval that replaces the original value of all entries. In other words, we changed the age column to:", "Therefore, anyone who meets these criteria will have their age value modified. Let\u2019s see in the code.", "This is extremely useful for reducing overfitting, but it comes at a cost: we punish the accuracy of our Machine Learning Model. You have changed the entire column with several possible values \u200b\u200bfor just three results. It is not a problem in our specific case, but use it well.", "It is much easier to code our data set with any tool in the scikit-learn library, but this is a Pandas manual, so we will do this manually.", "The computer reads numbers, even the most complex ones. It is much easier to understand numerical data rather than categorical, which is why we do this.", "After encoding, we can verify Pearson\u2019s correlation; It usually ignores categorical features. Let\u2019s take a look.", "As you can see, we are beginning to receive important information from our data:", "Machines don\u2019t understand scale as we do. You can easily find the difference between your salary and your weight, knowing that it is impossible to weigh as much as you receive monthly, but the computer does not; That\u2019s why we scale the entire data set. In a basic way, there are two ways to scale: Standardization and Normalization.", "Also known as Z-score Normalization, this method resizes our data to have a median of zero and a standard deviation of 1. In the end, no matter how different their values \u200b\u200bare, they will have the same representation.", "It is extremely useful, reducing the effects of overfitting resources, so use it.", "Also known as min-max normalization, this method resizes our data to a fixed value between 0 and 1.", "As a final part of this manual, I want to show the results when applied to a Machine Learning model. First, let\u2019s start with the Exploratory Data Analysis.", "We don\u2019t have to worry about Data Cleaning, as our data set is ready. Let\u2019s jump right into the preview.", "Question 1: How does our age affect the systolic index?", "Question 2: How many heart disease patients have hypernatremia?", "Visualization: How is our data spread?", "Do you like these images? I have another article here on Medium that teaches you how to create beautiful data visualizations! Take a look later if you want.", "As it is not a project that focuses on each step of the Machine Learning model workflow, I will leave the basic score of three randomly obtained algorithms. This is a classification problem, don\u2019t forget. Our evaluation method will be an accuracy score and a confusion matrix.", "Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have enough data to improve our model, and our first model (RandomForest) may be overfitted. Don\u2019t forget this: the more data you have, the more capable your algorithm will be. Let\u2019s check the confusion matrix.", "Look at this! RandomForest was excellent! But pay attention now: the last two have false positives and negatives. Our last two models sometimes predicted it wrong. This is not good, in fact. It can certainly be improved.", "If you have any difficulties with the production of Machine Learning models, don\u2019t worry, I have an admirable article about it. Full of images, remarkably pleasant. Take a look, if you want.", "If you are interested in how I created all these graphics and codes, you can:", "I hope you enjoyed this content and can apply your new knowledge with mastery!
