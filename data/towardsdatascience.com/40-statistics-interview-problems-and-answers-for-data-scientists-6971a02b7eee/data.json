So, I crawled the web and found forty statistics interview questions for data scientists that I will be answering. Here we go!", "You would perform hypothesis testing to determine statistical significance. First, you would state the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. Second, you would calculate the p-value, the probability of obtaining the observed results of a test assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Last, you would set the level of the significance (alpha) and if the p-value is less than the alpha, you would reject the null \u2014 in other words, the result is statistically significant.", "Example of a long tail distribution", "A long-tailed distribution is a type of heavy-tailed distribution that has a tail (or tails) that drop off gradually and asymptotically.", "3 practical examples include the power law, the Pareto principle (more commonly known as the 80\u201320 rule), and product sales (i.e. best selling products vs others).", "It\u2019s important to be mindful of long-tailed distributions in classification and regression problems because the least frequently occurring values make up the majority of the population. This can ultimately change the way that you deal with outliers, and it also conflicts with some machine learning techniques with the assumption that the data is normally distributed.", "Statistics How To provides the best definition of CLT, which is:", "\u201cThe central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger no matter what the shape of the population distribution.\u201d [1]", "The central limit theorem is important because it is used in hypothesis testing and also to calculate confidence intervals.", "\u2018Statistical power\u2019 refers to the power of a binary hypothesis, which is the probability that the test rejects the null hypothesis given that the alternative hypothesis is true.

The control group lives their lives normally. The test group is told to drink a glass of wine every night for 30 days. Then research can be conducted to see how wine affects sleep.", "Mean imputation is the practice of replacing null values in a data set with the mean of the data.", "Mean imputation is generally bad practice because it doesn\u2019t take into account feature correlation. For example, imagine we have a table showing age and fitness score and imagine that an eighty-year-old has a missing fitness score. If we took the average fitness score from an age range of 15 to 80, then the eighty-year-old will appear to have a much higher fitness score that he actually should.", "Second, mean imputation reduces the variance of the data and increases bias in our data. This leads to a less accurate model and a narrower confidence interval due to a smaller variance.", "An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations.", "Depending on the cause of the outlier, they can be bad from a machine learning perspective because they can worsen the accuracy of a model. If the outlier is caused by a measurement error, it\u2019s important to remove them from the dataset. There are a couple of ways to identify outliers:", "Z-score/standard deviations: if we know that 99.7% of data in a data set lie within three standard deviations, then we can calculate the size of one standard deviation, multiply it by 3, and identify the data points that are outside of this range. Likewise, we can calculate the z-score of a given point, and if it\u2019s equal to +/- 3, then it\u2019s an outlier.Note: that there are a few contingencies that need to be considered when using this method; the data must be normally distributed, this is not applicable for small data sets, and the presence of too many outliers can throw off z-score.", "Interquartile Range (IQR): IQR, the concept used to build boxplots, can also be used to identify outliers. The IQR is equal to the difference between the 3rd quartile and the 1st quartile. You can then identify if a point is an outlier if it is less than Q1\u20131.5*IRQ or greater than Q3 + 1.5*IQR. This comes to approximately 2.698 standard deviations.", "Other methods include DBScan clustering, Isolation Forests, and Robust Random Cut Forests.", "An inlier is a data observation that lies within the rest of the dataset and is unusual or an error. Since it lies in the dataset, it is typically harder to identify than an outlier and requires external data to identify them. Should you identify any inliers, you can simply remove them from the dataset to address them.", "There are several ways to handle missing data:", "The best method is to delete rows with missing data as it ensures that no bias or variance is added or removed, and ultimately results in a robust and accurate model. However, this is only recommended if there\u2019s a lot of data to start with and the percentage of missing values is low.", "First I would conduct EDA \u2014 Exploratory Data Analysis to clean, explore, and understand my data. See my article on EDA here. As part of my EDA, I could compose a histogram of the duration of calls to see the underlying distribution.", "My guess is that the duration of calls would follow a lognormal distribution (see below). The reason that I believe it\u2019s positively skewed is because the lower end is limited to 0 since a call can\u2019t be negative seconds. However, on the upper end, it\u2019s likely for there to be a small proportion of calls that are extremely long relatively.", "You could use a QQ plot to confirm whether the duration of calls follows a lognormal distribution or not. See here to learn more about QQ plots.", "Administrative datasets are typically datasets used by governments or other organizations for non-statistical reasons.", "Administrative datasets are usually larger and more cost-efficient than experimental studies. They are also regularly updated assuming that the organization associated with the administrative dataset is active and functioning. At the same time, administrative datasets may not capture all of the data that one may want and may not be in the desired format either. It is also prone to quality issues and missing entries.", "There are a number of potential reasons for a spike in photo uploads:", "The method of testing depends on the cause of the spike, but you would conduct hypothesis testing to determine if the inferred cause is the actual cause.", "You can tell that this question is related to Bayesian theory because of the last statement which essentially follows the structure, \u201cWhat is the probability A is true given B is true?\u201d Therefore we need to know the probability of it raining in London on a given day.

Two common things include randomization, where participants are assigned by chance, and random sampling, sampling in which each member has an equal probability of being chosen.", "A confounding variable, or a confounder, is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and the independent variable, causing a spurious association, a mathematical relationship in which two or more variables are associated but not causally related.", "A/B testing is a form of hypothesis testing and two-sample hypothesis testing to compare two versions, the control and variant, of a single variable.
