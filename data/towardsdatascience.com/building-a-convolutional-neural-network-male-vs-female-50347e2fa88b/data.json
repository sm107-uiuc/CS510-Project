This concept arose in an attempt to simulate the processes occurring in the brain by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943.", "Neural networks consist of individual units called neurons. Neurons are located in a series of groups \u2014 layers (see figure below). Neurons in each layer are connected to neurons of the next layer. Data comes from the input layer to the output layer along with these compounds. Each individual node performs a simple mathematical calculation. \u0422hen it transmits its data to all the nodes it is connected to.", "The last wave of neural networks came in connection with the increase in computing power and the accumulation of experience. The advancements in Computer Vision with Deep Learning has been constructed and perfected with time, primarily over one particular algorithm \u2014 a Convolutional Neural Network.", "A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-engineered, with enough training, ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics.", "The architecture of a ConvNet is analogous to that of the connectivity pattern of Neurons in the Human Brain and was inspired by the organization of the Visual Cortex. Individual neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the Receptive Field. A collection of such fields overlap to cover the entire visual area.", "For a computer, an image is just an array of values. Typically it\u2019s a 3-dimensional (RGB) matrix of pixel values.", "For example, a 4*4 RGB abstract image representation would look like this.", "Where each pixel has a specific value of red, green and blue that represents the color of a given pixel.", "CNN processes images using matrixes of weights called filters (features) that detect specific attributes such as vertical edges, horizontal edges, etc. Moreover, as the image progresses through each layer, the filters are able to recognize more complex attributes. The ultimate goal of CNN is to detect what is going on in the scene.", "Let\u2019s go step by step and analyze each layer in the Convolutional Neural Network.", "Input- A Matrix of pixel values in the shape of [width, height, channels].", "Convolution- The ultimate purpose of this layer is to receive a feature map. Usually, we start with a low number of filters for low-level feature detection. The deeper we go into the CNN, the more filters (usually they are also smaller) we use to detect high-level features.", "Pooling Layer- Similar to the Convolutional Layer, the Pooling layer is responsible for reducing the spatial size of the Convolved Feature. This is to decrease the computational power required to process the data through dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, it is useful for extracting dominant features which are rotational and positional invariant, thus maintaining the process of effectively training of the model.", "There are two types of Pooling: Max Pooling and Average Pooling. Max Pooling returns the maximum value from the portion of the image covered by the Kernel. On the other hand, Average Pooling returns the average of all the values from the portion of the image covered by the Kernel.", "Activation- Without going into further details, we will use ReLU activation function that returns 0 for every negative value in the input image while it returns the same value for every positive value.", "Fully Connected Layer (FC Layer)- In a fully connected layer, we flatten the output of the last convolution layer and connect every node of the current layer with the other node of the next layer. Neurons in a fully connected layer have full connections to all activations in the previous layer, as seen in regular Neural Networks and work in a similar way.", "The last layer of our CNN will compute the class probability scores, resulting in a volume of size [1 * 1 * number of classes].", "There are various architectures of CNNs available which have been key in building algorithms which power and shall power AI as a whole in the foreseeable future. Some of them have been listed below:", "Here, we are going to use VGG16 Model.

The best way to find a model that\u2019s appropriate for a specific case is to start with some basic design and iteratively improve it.", "Let\u2019s begin with a very simple and minimalistic model of the VGG-16, with a few notable changes.", "Step 5. Setting up several parameters like loss history, early stopping, etc", "Here, I\u2019m using Keras\u2019s early stopping callback to end training when the validation loss stops improving, otherwise, the model will overfit.

Let\u2019s see how well our model performed", "As we can see above, our model learned to successfully identify both males and females. Its predictions are very confident in the majority of the cases and they are lower only for anything that\u2019s unusual. It\u2019s definitely expected behavior because our model has been trained on less amount of such uncommon data.", "We\u2019ve learned the underlying concepts of how computers see by implementing simple yet very powerful image classification system. Possibilities of improvement in this field and Computer Vision, in general, is boundless, and I encourage you to dive into it and implement such solutions on your own.", "In results.csv, there is one more \u2018Age\u2019 column which we dropped in starting.
