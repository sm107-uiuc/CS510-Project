The steam engine improves productivity and manufacturing for faster delivery of goods, services and passengers. Automated steam production aids human workforces. Creating rail links often used slave labour and presented the workforce with long hours and dangerous conditions. [1]", "1970. The first arcade game: \u201cComputer Space\u201d uses basic artificial intelligence (AI); essentially randomising the players\u2019 enemies so that they are seemingly intelligent \u2014 introduces AI to entertainment and the public domain \u2014 encouraging players to return, entering more coins to continue playing. [2]", "1993\u20132007. Early robotics revolutionise manufacturing processes \u2014 automating manual labour in factories at considerable scale. [3]", "1995\u20132005. Information technology allows automated tasks to be prevalent in offices and homes. [4]", "2015\u20132065. Automation, AI and machine learning (ML) will be used, at least partially in every part of human activity.", "2020+. Automated vehicles and delivery drones are just a small representation of an autonomous future.", "Much of the recent automation in finance, retail, legal, healthcare and human resources, to name but a few, have been through robotic process automation (RPA) \u2014 permanently removing repetitive tasks from humans and allowing employees to focus on their \u2018human strengths\u2019, including emotional intelligence, reasoning, judgment and creativity (Lhuer, 2016). Repetitive tasks can be codified and do not require higher-order cognitive functions to complete. In financial services, RPA tasks predominately replace middle and back-office functions in operations, information technology, finance, risk management and human resources. Return on investment from an RPA implementation is high and is found to vary from 30% to 200% in the first year (Lhuer, 2016).", "Unlike autonomous vehicles, most automation over the next forty years will be principally \u2018invisible\u2019 \u2014 that is the automation of our data, we produce every nanosecond of every hour. Much like Harroway\u2019s definition of a cyborg; a creature both animal and machine who populate worlds ambiguously natural and assembled \u2014 the coupling of organism and technology with a command that was not formed in the chronicle of sexuality (Haraway, 1985). Humans already exist in symbiosis with automation and rely heavily upon it. Examples include; The automation of our data provides supermarkets with information to stock its shelves; financial institutions automate money transfers, mortgage loans and more; processing our medical data providing and spotting potential diseases; abstracting data from crime scenes; automating traffic signals; processing and producing official documentation, such as, passports and driving licences.", "Automation of recruitment systems has come under criticism in the media and highlights some of the different representations presented to the public. For example, some machine learning programs learn how to complete tasks based on selected data. The programme scans resume text, while others analyse video interviews or performance on a task. Data from the prospective candidates are graded and processed \u2014 often against a group of current employees \u2014 designated as qualified or desirable by a human having similar roles and responsibilities.", "These tools often do not eliminate pre-existing human bias (Goodman, 2018). In the case of Amazon\u2019s automated recruiting project; the tool disadvantaged candidates who followed specific education pathways \u2014 likely not attended by many existing Amazon employees (Goodman, 2018). The tool similarly decreased the acceptance score of resumes that included female devalued status keywords in a male-dominated culture, such as, qualifiers (\u201cnearly,\u201d \u201ckind of\u201d), intensifiers (\u201creally,\u201d \u201cvery\u201d), self questioning (\u201cOften completing tasks within time?\u201d) and extreme politeness (Rubin and Greene, 1992). The tool increases the acceptance criteria when identifying male-centric wording, such as, illative connectives (\u201ctherefore,\u201d \u201cso\u201d), intensifiers (\u201ca lot,\u201d \u201cquite,\u201d \u201creally\u201d) and controlling (\u201cexecuted,\u201d \u201ccaptured\u201d) (Rubin and Greene, 1992).", "Goodman\u2019s article \u201cWhy Amazon\u2019s Automated Hiring Tool Discriminated Against Women\u201d is biased towards her firm and acts as a mechanism for the promotion of its services. The claim that algorithms \u201creplicate and even magnify the biases that exist in society at large\u201d could be, in part, valid. However, there is no consideration that automated recruitment versus \u2018human\u2019 recruit is more biased than automation. Human recruiters can be inexperienced and judge candidates more based on their own experiences, or lack of.", "Automated recruitment is an especially useful illustration on which to reflect on the challenge (and importance) of arriving at common ethical standards in global culture. Standards in global ethical policies and the development of automation remain uncertain in the acceptance defined standards are carried out, if at all, at a micro-process level where automation is bespoke to individual companies and individuals geographical location.", "As this \u2018invisible\u2019 automation becomes more accessible for anyone to develop automated processes who owns it and who determines what the automation will decide or not. Take mortgage loans as an example; how does an automated process not discriminate against applicants when it is primary task is to save the automation owner money?", "A responsible automation strategy incorporates an interrogation of the impact at each step of evolution, from the existing process to post-automation. Since automation is critical for organisations that wish to provide always on-demand services for its customers, colleagues and stakeholders, it should be created responsibly including consulting with its affected community; offer transparency; aid and empower humans; be governed and monitored by humans; be inclusive and non-bias; consider long-term implications. Responsible automation should be questioned and realised throughout each entire process lifecycle.", "Automation has differing interpretations between automation owners and the media gaze of science fiction interpretation. Films, such as The Terminator (1984) demonises automation to the extent of the near extinction of humans. The agenda of each both media and automation owner is different, and this influences to inadequate reporting and misrepresentation (Miah, 2005).", "In the two graphics, the automated process appears to select applicants based on their racial background. The human recruiter has selected more applicants and rejected seemingly random candidates. What we don\u2019t consider is the process behind these selections as we have no information to why the candidates were rejected. Without understanding either method, it\u2019s difficult to assume, however public discourse will often criticise automation over humanity.", "The rise of automation and technology has been an emerging cultural discussion in the last decade. In part, the interest of automation is a significant concern in public understanding, which has been a priority in digital transformation policy discussions. This toolkit utilises the ethical implications of how communities can address the challenge of the developing automation landscape, considering the case of replacing jobs and conscious and unconscious biases. It critically appraises the automation landscape and suggests possible best practices in business and public engagement. This toolkit attempts to communicate to nonexperts the deliberations of ethical automation. [5]", "Why should automated systems be governed by humans?", "Much in the same way that governments, organisations, law enforcement, hospitals are governed by laws, rules, and elected bodies \u2014 so should automation.", "Why aid and empower humans? They are slow, need time off and have a tendency to be inaccurate.", "Humans are also better than automated tasks at generalising, spotting errors and identifying anomalies. Humans are, mostly, empathic.", "Automating everything all at the same time will, undoubtedly, cause issues. Humans are sociable animals and as such, require other human contacts interactions, especially in difficult circumstances.", "Automation should be as accountable as humans, if not more so. Having clear, fair and accessible guidelines for the automated processeliminates problems and reassessments.", "Why engage with the local community?", "Checking prototypes and theories with local communities can often reveal unexpected results. Engaging with the community encourages champions of process and eliminates error and creates new problems.", "Supporting inclusivity means ideas are evaluated equally, regardless of individual characteristics, backgrounds and unconscious bias. Diverse perspectives maximise innovation for the benefit of society and the automated process.", "1. History of technology advancements in society has rarely had an ethical past. Even today, Apple AirPods, a status-symbol of disposable technology with a half-life of 450 years, are constructed in horrifying circumstances. The plastic AirPods are a combination of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, and sulfur with tungsten, tin, tantalum, lithium, and cobalt. These elements are extracted, heated and refined by humans who breathe in the airborne particles which deposit in their lungs. The materials are shipped from some of the poorest countries in the world, such as Vietnam, South Africa, Kazakhstan, Mexico and Indonesia to factories in China (Haskins, 2019) \u2014 echoing the construction of the transcontinental railroad from the east to the western United States.", "During its construction, Central Pacific began hiring Chinese labourers, at the time were considered to be inferior, due to pervasive western racism. The 64,000 Chinese labourers toiled under brutal working conditions in the Sierra Nevada desert for meagre wages in contrast to their Civil War veteran and Irish immigrant counterparts (HISTORY, 2018).", "This automation toolkit aims to discourage the repetition of these events from history and current practice.", "2. One of the first examples of, mass-public facing, artificial intelligence (AI) to paying consumers; the video arcade game, Computer Space, encourages repeatable and addictive gameplay \u2014 users control a space rocket to blast asteroids and Non-playable character (NPC) flying saucers. Computer Space, housed in its 1970s perception of futuristic yellow plastic, created a market for video games \u2014 succeeded by the likes of Pong (1972), Space Invaders (1978) and Donkey Kong (1981).", "Video-game addiction stems from Computer Space and has been of constant concern for parents and teachers since (Feeley and Palmeri, 2018). Games, such as Fortnite with over 200 million registered players and a billion-dollar business in its own right has many detractors declaring \u2014 \u201cThis game is like heroin.\u201d (Feeley and Palmeri, 2018) Among other addictive claims by those affected. Fornite is free to play and is available on the majority of devices with a screen. While free to play Fortnite\u2019s creators, Epic Games have cashed in by selling in-game digital items, such as rare weapons and \u2018skins\u2019 that can be purchased using credit or debit cards. There are also \u201cloot boxes\u201d where players purchase in-game items without knowing what these contain. Dutch gaming regulators released a study stating that this \u2018blind\u2019 purchases amounted to gambling (Feeley and Palmeri, 2018).

An illustration of the general public understanding of robotics and automation \u2014 this factory robotic arm is instantly recognisable. These preconceptions are often skewed, given people\u2019s tendency to remember unfavourable information about a topic better than favourable information (Gilovich, 2007). This ordering of information described as \u2014 \u201cresponse order effects\u201d (Schuman and Presser, 2000) \u2014 \u201cthe earlier in the list an acceptable answer is, the more popular it will be\u201d (Tourangeau, Rips and Rasinski, 2008).", "4. As computing hardware became affordable, access to software and digital services broadened. Initially, with \u201cthick-client\u201d (software installed on the end-users machine) software and more recently \u201cthin-client\u201d software that permeates in \u201cthe cloud,\u201d for example, Google Docs, Spotify and Netflix \u2014 these services may require an app or software download, however, content is predominantly stored remotely in huge data-centres in undisclosed locations.", "This shift in accessing data paradigms of how content is accessed has largely stayed static. Security and content ownership have become more abstract and complicated, whereby different laws apply to different global citizens. A recent example of this is Google\u2019s suspension of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei\u2019s access to updates of its Android operating system (Badshah and Kuo, 2019). The US government added Huawei to a trade blacklist that has implications for users around the world who will not be able to update the Android software or access apps like Google Play, Google Maps and Google Mail on new versions (Badshah and Kuo, 2019).", "5. The ethical automation toolkit is a preliminary version \u2014 encouraging collaboration and requires further involvement from the public, automation developers, end-users, stakeholders and software developers.", "As part of this process, Paul Wilshaw consulted with several organisations, automation developers, end-users and software developers to encourage different understandings of an \u201cautomated process\u201d. For this toolkit, an \u201cautomated process\u201d is an organisational process that exists in another form where disjointed systems and software have a majorly manual process. The \u201cautomated process\u201d creation intends to replace part or all of the existing process.", "6. Elements for an ethical automated process; humans tend to rely on \u201chabitualized schemas\u201d (Cacciatore, Corley and Scheufele, 2011) to interpret their surroundings and better understand and appraise that experience. In a study, Burri (2009) found that citizens turned to analogies and personal experiences in order to make sense of uncertainties (Cacciatore, Corley and Scheufele, 2011). Felt et al. (2008) regarded that particular technology and how the public perceives that technology can play a significant role in shaping the communally public understanding (Cacciatore, Corley and Scheufele, 2011). Slovic et al. (2004) explain that an \u201cexperiential system\u201d linking associations gained through experiences and emotional responses.", "As an automated process replaces an existing process, it can be challenging to disassociate the emotional responses that are attached.", "This toolkit aims to question the ethical position of the automation and include diverse experience principles in order to learn and gain a greater understanding of future innovation.", "Cacciatore, M., Corley, E. and Scheufele, D.
