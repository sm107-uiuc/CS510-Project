If you\u2019re not familiar with Duplex, it\u2019s essentially an AI that helps complete tasks over the phone (e.g., scheduling an appointment, booking a reservation, etc.).", "The problem. Maybe it\u2019s just my generation, but I\u2019d rather text than have to make a phone call, as texting means I can send the text and quickly get it off my mind. This isn\u2019t always possible, however, as many tasks tediously require making a phone call to a business. Here\u2019s where Duplex comes in.", "The idea. The overaching idea behind Duplex is that you just ask the Google Assistant to, for example, book a reservation at a certain restaurant and input a few parameters like the number of people, the date and time, and a name to put the reservation under. Once you do this, the Google Assistant will automatically use Duplex to make a phone call to that restaurant and book the reservation for you, sending a confirmation once this is done. Duplex will try to do this while imitating a human so that the phone conversation is natural (and doesn\u2019t alarm the person on the other end).", "Here\u2019s an example of the system making a call to schedule a hair salon appointment.", "And here\u2019s another example where Duplex is calling a restaurant.", "Duplex\u2019s successes. In these examples, I was really impressed by how well Duplex can actually imitate a human. The voices sounded like real people, and Duplex was even adding interjections like \u201cum\u201d to make it sound more humanlike (and there is truly no better way to sound human than to say \u201cum\u201d). Duplex can also manipulate the latency of its response. For instance, if the person says \u201chello?\u201d then you have to respond quickly, but if they say a really long sentence, you have to take some time before responding to mimic thinking time. Despite its power, Duplex still made some small errors in these example calls (e.g., when Duplex says \u201canything between 10 AM and 12 PM\u201d in the first call, the \u201c12 PM\u201d has an unnatural and robotic inflection), but these are not even really a problem, as they are minor enough that no one on the other side of the phone would think much of it, if they even notice it at all.", "Areas for improvement. And even though Duplex can handle basic tasks very well, there are always some edge cases that need further investigation. Duplex may not be able to easily handle complex statements [example] or problems with background noise or sound quality. These cases will need to be further improve on. For now, in cases where Duplex is unable to complete its task, a failsafe is built in to hand off to a human operator to complete the task.", "Duplex\u2019s ties to NLP. Of course, being able to imitate a human during a phone call requires some insane NLP. First, there needs to be an accurate speech-to-text translator to be able to even understand what the person on the phone is saying. Next, another model has to interpret this in the context of the goal of the phone call. And then a proper response has to be created. Finally, a text-to-speech model needs to translating this response into a humanlike voice saying it on the phone. These steps need to be constantly repeated throughout the phone call in real time, so the models need to be both accurate and fast.", "Necessary NLP models. To do this, Duplex uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) combined with Google\u2019s Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology, parameters of the conversation (e.g., desired time, names), and a text-to-speech (TTS) system. Notably, these models have to be trained on narrow domains. For example, there would need to be separate training for making an appointment and booking a reservation \u2014 Duplex isn\u2019t trained as a general chatbot, and any new areas that Google wants to use Duplex for would require new training.", "Conclusion. The system is already being rolled out and will be gradually improved upon. Even though there are improvements to be made, I\u2019m still very impressed by how Google has been able to combine multiple NLP models and create a usable application that works as well as Duplex. I\u2019m sure that NLP has a bright future if we can keep making new innovations in this way, since individual models are great, but combining multiple models to form a powerhouse system is probably where the future of applying NLP in the real world lies.", "Your home for data science.
