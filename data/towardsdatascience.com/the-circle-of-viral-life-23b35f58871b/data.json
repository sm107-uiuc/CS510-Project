This is due to the fact that their inner structure is sophisticatedly geared towards generating new mutations as they spread to living creatures (hosts) in a plethora of different pathways: airborne, waterborne, bird migration, feces, and so forth. Inspiringly, the essence of evolution is revealed when mutations in the genetics of viruses provide them with the ability to become sophisticated as they adjust their survival skills over the years. I learned that viruses are not just a bunch of molecules, but actually a unique type of particle named virology, that can only be truly understood within a multidisciplinary context of biology, physics, geography, and even climatology and economics (think of how much power viruses have that they can cause general lockdowns).", "Viral transition is the path the virus achieves among different host species. Animal to human viral transmission is called zoonosis. Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted in any context in which there is contact with or consumption of animals, animal products, or animal derivatives. The following modes may give you a clue: food and water, farming, ranching, husbandry, pets, hunting, live animal market, etc. And this is only a glimpse of what is actually going on \u2026", "Within the framework of this research I focused on four viruses of two families: Coronaviridae (MERS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses) and Orthomyxoviridae (influenza A: H1N1 and H3N2 viruses), and discovered the next topics as the best match to the questions that I dealt with:", "Before diving into arithmetics (which is the easy part \u2026), I would like to share my personal concern: I am concerned about us as a nation and our reaction to medical emergency situations caused by worldwide epidemics. Why does the public still suffer from epidemics like the on-going SARS-CoV-2 even though it is not a \u201cbrand new\u201d virus (just a mutation of the previous virus in the coronavirus family)? Is it because we have yet to find a way of preventing transmission? Let me remind you of the following previous epidemic events. A prominent epidemic occurred in 1918 when influenza A was endemic in Homo sapiens (the first case was discovered in 1902 in Gallus). What\u2019s more, viruses of the coronavirus family are \u201cold\u201d as well, first being collected from avians in 1941, pigs in 1952, and more recently in Homo sapiens in 2003 (in China). This virus is well known as SARS (and is still active). A similar virus structure was collected in 2008 in Saudia Arabia, known as MERS, which involved the presence of the illness in a large number of camels.", "On the one hand, it seems that humanity in the 21st Century has developed technology in every imaginable field to meet almost every challenge: from metal tools to landing on the moon and artificial intelligence. At times it feels as if human ingenuity has no bounds. Yet, on the other hand, we remain reliant on conservative, even extreme methods such as general closures and enforcing the wearing of stuffy masks (has anyone thought of developing a mask with which one can breathe freely ?\u2026). Bottom line, these \u201coff the shelf\u201d solutions are not adequate and in my opinion ridiculous. It means that we were not prepared, despite all the clear red signals and signs.", "In these most difficult times, teams of scientists from varying backgrounds have gathered to \u201cfight back\u201d and \u201csave the world\u201d by developing solutions such as vaccines, medications and large scale data science projects estimating the \u201ctrack\u201d of the epidemic. However, I am doubtful that these heroes have everyone\u2019s lives in mind. When saying \u201ceveryone\u201d I am also referring to nonhuman animals such as: camels, pigs, avians and all the living creatures that we as humans keep, tend to, and breed for our own needs (food, clothing, labor, entertainment, and so on). It is my personal desire that all animals should be free. Until then, we should at least learn how to avoid transmission of viruses between their kind and our kind.", "Is the genetic \u201cmechanism\u201d of all living creatures in the aggregate acting as ONE viral system? What are the invariants between hosts in terms of the recreation of the virus structure and the generation of proteins ? All of these questions have led me to explore the genetic similarity between multiple host species.", "It turns out that this article is not about a new machine learning technique, but a unique research and perspective. Nevertheless, I assume you have some basic knowledge of neural networks, dimensionality reduction, big data analytics and biology. If the biological part is not clear to you, I recommend reading the literature review section in my blog: Studying the Genetics of COVID-19, and if you are not familiar with neural networks on genetic data, visiting my blog: Bridging the Gap Between Genetics and Neural Networks would be a good start for you.", "In order to perform a large scale machine learning experiment, I gathered the publicly available data of viruses consisting of as much diversity of host species as possible in the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI (if you are not familiar with NCBI, read my blog: Hacking the Genetics of Viruses).", "Before performing any calculations on the data, I selected a few informative details about the viruses. I plotted the epidemic scale and proportions without any data manipulation according to the additional sections that are gathered jointly with each genetic sample. The plots present each virus\u2019s geographical location and host species prevalence, normalised and multiplied by 100. As can be seen, Homo sapiens is the first to be diagnosed in all viruses except for the H1N1 virus which was first collected from pigs. Bats are the second to be diagnosed in the coronavirus family. Camels were the most affected species suffered from MERS virus in 2016, while viverrids got first place in 2006, and European minks equalized the amount of Homo sapiens diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. As for the geographical locations, H3N2 was first collected in Asia and second in South Africa while H1N1 was involved in all the examined locations in 2009. The fifth graph is focused on Asia in order to distinguish between the locations in which the viruses were first isolated. Notice that the contribution of avians and pigs to humanity in terms of herd immunity as being suffered from influenza A is well demonstrated for either virus.", "For each virus family, two experiments were tested on sequences of type DNA or proteins. When considering DNA samples the model achieves 98.4% accuracy for influenza A, 92.2% for coronavirus, and when dealing with proteins almost 100% accuracy is achieved for either virus. Notice that I examined two sizes of test data sets. The results show that greater performance is achieved with more samples, perhaps because the diversity in the data is higher in that case.", "The behavior of the training and validation losses is correct, not overfitting nor underfitting, it means that during a training session the validation loss is lower than the training loss. Another observation on this behalf is the learning rate behavior in the coronavirus proteins experiment in which a low number of epochs is required to generalize the data (after about 250 epochs the validation stops decreasing and achieves its maximum accuracy).", "The conclusions I think worth mentioning in this framework are first in the technical aspect: the high accuracy that has been achieved means that the DNA and proteins sequence-variance between host species is similar up to 8% misclassified error. In addition, the use of alignment tools is unnecessary if using neural networks and approximately the same sequence lengths (which holds true within most viral families). This is great news, since in many cases \u201cless is more\u201d. Second, the transmission factors are explored in this research and emphasize the need for caution and sanitation when (and if) we handle nonhuman animals. The high densities and poor sanitary conditions which are commonplace in animal agriculture may need to be reconsidered. Moreover, unnecessary contact like using animals for entertainment purposes such as camels wrestling (widely spread in Arab culture) and \u201ceducational\u201d purposes like petting zoos (there is nothing educational about showing the public how to force a living creature to live in a cage without freedom).", "Transforming the way we interact with nonhuman animals may hold substantial moral and environmental benefits, besides the transmission of viral diseases as discussed in this post.", "In any event, my recommendations for further research would be to study how the consumption of products from animals diagnosed with coronavirus may affect the human body, for instance: unpasteurized milk or raw meat. Another question that may arise is how to re-engineer the way we treat farm animals, and re-examine how animals are kept and treated in cowsheds, pig pens, or hen houses.", "The world has become a better place thanks to technology. Happiness is shared nowadays among more people than ever \u2014 it is about time to let other species experience happiness or at least something similar to it, as well. As a Buddhist prayer says: \u201cMay all sentient beings be free of suffering and its causes\u2019\u2019.", "Dear readers, it\u2019s my pleasure that you read (or hear) all that.
