Still, the solution won\u2019t be live until winter, and when it releases, it may be limited to symptom reporting.

So, we need to identify the pinch points,\u201d says an IoT supplier", "Despite the lack of standardization surrounding the myriad contact tracing and Covid-19 safety measures, concerns over privacy, the lack of end-user adoption, private industry isn\u2019t waiting for a cure-all as cities ease restrictions and businesses reopen.", "Amazon has just unveiled a solution that applies artificial intelligence and machine learning to the video camera footage in their buildings to identify high traffic areas to improve employee social distancing, according to a company announcement from Brad Porter, vice president in charge of robotics and engineering. The solution, called \u201cDistance Assistant,\u201d is now live at a handful of their buildings, and they have plans to open-source the software.", "And other employers are exploring ways that app-based location data, consumer mobile apps running on Android and iOS, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) beacons can be used to improve safety and support economic recovery. \u201cRetailers are asking us how to maintain safer and more efficient environments,\u201d says Audwin Cash, senior vice president with Acuity Brands, an IoT location services provider to retail, airports, and industrial companies.", "Solutions like Acuity\u2019s are typically utilized for in-store navigation: those \u201cblue dot wayfinding\u201d apps that provide route guidance to customers indoors, or for store associates to quickly pick products from shelves for \u201cClick n Collect\u201d orders. They can also be used to provide anonymous aggregate footfall analytics, to help companies see where customers or associates spent the most (or least) amount of time, which helps improve merchandising decisions.", "But recently, the dialog has changed.", "\u201cIn the past few weeks, we\u2019ve been working on collision detection systems for retailers.

So, we need to identify the pinch points,\u201d says Cash.", "Those pinch points could be represented as colorful blooms on heat maps \u2014 the graphical dashboard visualizations used by businesses to anonymously observe population density and adherence to social distancing guidelines or to determine areas that should be sanitized based upon high traffic.", "A report from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health outlined requirements to ease social distancing to return to work and school in the United States and more importantly, to get the economy moving. Of the top priorities, their health experts say the US needs 1) ready access to rapid diagnostic tests, 2) immunity identification, and 3) the ability to trace all contacts of reported cases to identify and alert those who might have been exposed to Covid-19.", "The challenge is making contact tracing real at scale. To support this demand, Johns Hopkins estimates a need for $3.6 billion in emergency funding and 100,000 additional people.", "According to a National Public Radio survey, the current 37,110 contact tracers still fall far short of this need, and given their current case counts, only seven states and the District of Columbia are staffed to contain outbreaks.", "\u201cEnvision if an employee reported that they were sick, and then we could identify who else worked a shift with them,\u201d says Cash.", "To tackle contact tracing at scale using technology, Apple and Google announced a partnership proposing a decentralized model. Their solution utilizes Bluetooth on smartphones to log other devices using the same platform if they\u2019ve come in close proximity. If a person tests positive for coronavirus, it will alert any others that have crossed their path in a 14 day period.", "But the Apple-Google system is so closed that health officials say the software will be of little use, with only Alabama, South Carolina, and North Dakota confirmed to use the technology. Sixteen other states ruled out the development of contact tracing apps entirely.", "\u201cI think if you ask most people, \u2018Do you trust Google to respect your privacy?\u2019. . . they don\u2019t trust Google,\u201d said Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, a sponsor of a bipartisan bill unveiled in June to regulate contact tracing apps.", "Beyond the skepticism of officials globally, the approach faces an additional hurdle of any mobile application: awareness and adoption. A Washington Post-University of Maryland survey finds that nearly 3 in 5 Americans would be unwilling or unable to download the Apple-Google contact tracing app once released, and 43% are generally skeptical of a tech company\u2019s ability to protect individual privacy.", "That\u2019s not enough, according to a University of Oxford study. To be effective at stopping the pandemic researchers determined that at least 60% of the population would be required to use digital contact tracing apps.", "One exception, however, has been Vietnam and its population of 95 million, which has experienced no deaths due to coronavirus to date, due mainly in part to a nationwide mandatory contact tracing program. Their strict version of the program publicly identified patients in print and television to inform the general public of the subjects\u2019 previous destinations, so that citizens could contact local health authorities if they had visited at the same time.", "If each state develops contact-tracing apps using different protocols, interoperability becomes an issue for citizens who travel across state lines.", "In Singapore, where authorities rolled out one of the first contact-tracing apps, up-take has only reached 20 percent. In Norway, that was only marginally better at 21 percent adoption.", "A mandatory program in the United States is altogether unlikely, and the publication of patient identity would run afoul of numerous privacy laws and health regulations. But for the states that do enact some form of tracing via mobile app, the challenge is consistency. If each state develops contact-tracing apps using different protocols, interoperability becomes an issue for citizens who travel across state lines.", "Some governments have rushed, stumbled, and then failed to earn public trust with their efforts. Analysis of North and South Dakota\u2019s Care19 mobile tracing app after launch found it violated its own privacy policy by sharing citizen location and other personal data with Foursquare. Through a spokesperson, Foursquare said that they did \u201cnot use the data in any way and it is promptly discarded,\u201d and this data leak was closed in June, according to the analysts that first discovered the issue.", "Employers can\u2019t wait any longer and are investigating other methods to bring about the recovery: initially with temperature checks and employee self-surveys before reporting to work.", "Retail has a capability right now that even the healthcare industry is lacking: opt-in location-aware apps on iOS and Android used by millions each day which could support contact tracing.", "Wearable device manufacturer Fitbit recently unveiled a solution that combines health metrics, symptom checking, and questionnaires. Their Fitbit Care Ready for Work program is aimed at employers, who can review dashboards to monitor employees\u2019 readiness to return to work, which can help inform workplace protocols, business continuity, and company risk profiles, according to the Fitbit health solutions webpage.", "Utilizing a mobile app and biometric device may provide more advanced warning than the onsite temperature checks. \u201cWearable devices are powerful because they measure nuances in biometrics potentially indicating the onset of illness that cannot be detected during a regular physician office visit,\u201d said Dr. Michael Snyder, Director of Stanford\u2019s Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine, in the Fitbit public announcement. \u201cWhen measuring heart rate, even an increase of two heartbeats per minute could be indicative of a significant immune system response, which is why wearable devices can be important tools in assessing the overall health of employees as they prepare to return to work, especially when evaluating pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of COVID-19.\u201d", "In contrast to Amazon\u2019s use of video cameras, the early Acuity pilots detect collisions and clusters using iOS or Android-powered smartphones that communicate with smart lighting networks in the ceiling.", "And this is prompting new conversations, with the potential to contact trace in the workplace. \u201cThe potential of finding associates clustered in a store is a possibility. And we are having exploratory discussions about extending that scenario,\u201d shared Cash. \u201cEnvision if an employee reported that they were sick, and then we could identify who else worked a shift with them.\u201d", "Employers are attempting to tackle social distancing, but their contact tracing solutions still only inform those in the workplace. The challenge of accurately tracking location and contact outside of work buildings still remains as an unlock for the economy. And, with more workers shifting to work-from-home, these solutions are less likely to make a dent outside of factories, manufacturing facilities, and distribution centers.", "Businesses could solve for the adoption challenge, anonymous tracing at mass scale, and provide broader impact for the economy because retail has a capability right now that even the healthcare industry is lacking: opt-in location-aware apps on iOS and Android used by millions each day which could support contact tracing.", "These mobile apps wouldn\u2019t be intended for the transmission of personally identifiable (PII) or health information (PHI), but instead limited to location data and an anonymous device marker. In contrast, a Fitbit transmits more personal data to the cloud.", "Concerned about sharing mobile location data from your phone? You do it now. Primarily, retail apps have been used for browsing products, managing shopping lists, and order pickups. The Kroger iPhone app explains in a settings page that enabling location tracking \u201cenables a smoother, more efficient pickup experience and personalized in-store shopping.\u201d Using geofencing and indoor positioning, they also guide customers to products with navigation (\u2018wayfinding\u2019), or to notify with personalized offers.", "For example, an in-app discount for corn flakes might activate as you walk down the cereal aisle. By using Bluetooth beacons or smart lighting networks that communicate with your Apple iOS or Android mobile device, some positioning systems can achieve location accuracy of up to four inches. And then that real-time data is ingested into advanced data models to produce a hyper-personalized and location-relevant offer. Many apps also use location tracking over GPS or WiFi and can operate in the background both inside and outside of stores with user consent.", "So what if a consortium of retailers anonymized their customer positioning data and used AI for the public health crisis rather than using the technology on mobile devices for location-aware digital coupons? Imagine Target, Walmart, Kroger, Walgreens, CVS, and other major retailers collaborating for a get back to business campaign with a data-sharing effort.", "Retailers have the building blocks: 1) millions of loyal customers, 2) location-aware mobile applications delivered from the Apple and Google Play app stores, 3) the consent to share anonymous location data, and 4) they are trusted brands that serve millions daily with grocery and wellness needs.", "Given retail has delivered safety guidance, expanded hiring, remained open for the sale of essential goods, and is conducting COVID testing to fill a public void, gaining user adoption and consent for anonymous location data sharing might not be so tough, as compared to the tech giants.", "Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens combined are trusted to fill over three billion prescriptions each year. As essential goods and services providers, many of them have been relied upon by consumers to put food on the table and to provide health and wellness advisory services, even prior to quarantines. And if Walmart continues its rollouts in Georgia, it may be your new trusted provider for chronic and acute health care.", "Consider the existing user base; CVS has 62 million loyalty program members. Walgreens surpassed 50 million app installs in 2019, of 90 million loyalty program members. And at US retail giant Walmart, nearly 265 million people visit their stores each week with a monthly app audience of 86.05 million users. Even with customer overlap between major retailers, that\u2019s a massive foundation for app adoption.", "In contrast to Apple\u2019s app or government-led scenarios, end-users instead might be encouraged to opt-in (or out) at a retail partner level based upon personal preference and comfort with each organizations\u2019 privacy policies, similar to the way individual settings are applied in iOS for notifications or location tracking by app.", "Even still, this would require central management of the anonymized partner signals and a secure interface for users to input and manage their COVID related tests.", "And if not Apple-Google, this begs the question as to who might act as the nexus of a centralized hub from commercial partners with access to reams of mobile telemetry. \u201cMost retailers have so far, steered clear of customer data and anything related to PII. To make something like that work, you\u2019d need a trusted third party to arbitrate the data exchange,\u201d says Cash.", "Who might that be? The Washington Post-University of Maryland poll sheds some light here. Survey respondents signaled a higher level of trust in universities (56%) and public health agencies (57%) than tech companies (43%) in protecting anonymity with contact tracing apps.", "So if retail consumer health companies partnered with a trusted public health agency, they might be able to tackle a vital need for contact tracing: anonymously collected location data.", "Just because we have a capability, doesn\u2019t mean we should rush without caution. There are several technical, ethical, and legal considerations to make this real. Different technologies exist from GPS to Bluetooth, WiFi, and visible light communication, each with varying degrees of accuracy. Some, like GPS, aren\u2019t always consistent indoors.", "Next, consent and privacy should not be taken lightly. Most apps have a terms and conditions clause that grants the publisher rights to share data with third parties. However, this is typically limited for marketing purposes or to optimize app experiences with diagnostic data.", "Fitbit\u2019s Privacy Policy does include notification to users that their de-identified data could potentially be used for research, such as the kind used in a two-year study that identified improvements in real-time surveillance of influenza-like illnesses using wearables.", "\u201cI think if you ask most people, \u2018Do you trust Google to respect your privacy?\u2019. . . they don\u2019t trust Google.\u201d", "Lawmakers want to go further. The \u201cExposure Notification Privacy Act\u201d would require companies to develop contact tracing apps to collaborate with public health officials. It would also dictate that data collected would not be used for commercial purposes and allow users to delete their data at any point.", "Last, this provocation should only be explored with the following tenets: the solution must seek first to \u201cdo no harm,\u201d it must only be used for the purposes of contact awareness, it must protect the rights and privacy of users, and it must anonymize their identities. But, if managed ethically and securely, a coalition of retailers and a health partner might accelerate the economic return using a standardized contact tracing approach.", "Your home for data science.
