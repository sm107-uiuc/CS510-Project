This post is the second part of the series \u201cLinear Algebra for Data Science\u201d, I advise you to go through Part 1 so that you don\u2019t miss the flow.", "My aim here is to share with you my understanding of the topics with relevant details which I believe will aid in understanding the lectures in a better and nuanced way.", "In this part, I will mostly talk about four fundamental subspaces of Linear Algebra and how they relate to each other.", "If V is a vector space on the field of Real numbers, defines as and W is a subset of V, then W is a subspace of V. For example, let the vector space V be the real coordinate space R\u00b3 and W be the set of all vectors in V whose last component is 0. Then W is a subspace of V. In terms of matrices, let A be a 3 by 2 matrix, then the column space is a subspace if R\u00b3 and row space is a subspace if R\u00b2.", "The Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang describes the action of an m by n matrix A. The matrix A produces a linear transformation from R^n to R^m but this picture by itself is too large. The \u201ctruth\u201d about Ax = b is expressed in terms of four subspaces (two of R^n and two of R^m). The first step is to see Ax as a combination of the columns of A. This step raises the viewpoint to subspaces. We see Ax in the column space. Solving Ax = b means finding all combinations of the columns that produce b in the column space.", "From Part 1, we know that dimension of column space is equal to the dimension of row space and is equal to the rank r of Matrix A, i.e. dim(C(A)) = dim(C(A\u2019)) = r.", "We also saw, to compute the basis of the column space, we need to reduce the matrix A in its row echelon form and pick the columns corresponding to the pivot elements. Now let\u2019s see how to calculate the basis for the other three sub-spaces.", "Before proceeding forward, let\u2019s be consistent with the notations we will be using:", "To find the basis of the Row Space we first reduce the matrix in its reduced row echelon form and pick the rows in R which constitutes an identity matrix of size equal to rank r. As shown in the figure above, the basis of the row space is the first two rows. So, here the basis of row space is the first two rows of R.", "Please note, the row space remains unchanged in the transformation of A to R but the column space changes.", "To obtain the basis of Null Space of A, we need to solve the homogenous system of equation, Ax = 0. We first obtain the reduced row echelon form matrix corresponding to the matrix A then find the coefficients corresponding to the free-variables (variable corresponding to non-pivot columns in the reduced row echelon form). Let\u2019s try to understand with the help of an example:", "The Left Null Space can also be seen as the Null Space if A\u2019. So, in this case, we solve A\u2019 y = 0. You may we wondering why \u201cLeft\u201d Null Space? Well, there is no mathematical reason behind it but just to justify our choice let\u2019s build an explanation (all credits to Prof. Strang!). Let\u2019s take transpose on both sides of the equation A\u2019y = 0. It is now equivalent to y\u2019 A = 0. Please note, here the vector of Zeros is a row vector now. Since y\u2019 now appears to the left of matrix A, we call this space the Left Null Space.", "One obvious way to find the Left Null Space is to solve the equation as we did for Null Space but wait, DRY! (Do Not Repeat Yourself!). Let\u2019s do it in another way! Yay!", "We know from our second formulation that y\u2019 is now a row vector to the left of A and it produces a row vector of Zeros on the right-hand side. Let\u2019s use that.", "Remember what we did while determining the row space, we transformed our matrix A to R. Let, augment an m x m Identity matrix to m x n matrix A and perform the same steps, this will now transform [ A | I ] to [ R | E ], where R is m x n and E is m x m. Let\u2019s just take a min and observe what happened\u2026 We applied the same row transformations we applied to matrix A to get R to matrix I to get E. It means, E[ A | I ] = [ R | E ] or EA = R", "Please Note: When A is invertible, R = I and E = inverse(A)", "As the above equation, EA = R is the same as solving y\u2019 A = 0, and from the matrix R we can see that rank(A) = 2. So, the dimension of left null space = 3-2 = 1, i.e. dimension of column space-rank. Hence, the basis of Left Null Space of A corresponds to the row in E which produces the zero row in R, which is [ -1 0 1 ].", "Now, after seeing the Big Picture, you can guess why it is called the \u201cBig Picture\u201d. It is the essence of all the four fundamental subspaces all at a place! So let\u2019s note what information does it contain:", "I hope this was helpful. See you next time.
