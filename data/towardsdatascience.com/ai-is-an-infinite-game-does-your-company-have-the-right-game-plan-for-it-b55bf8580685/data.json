How do you engage with this game changing technology and what do you need to stay competitive in a market in which AI and machine learning concepts are constantly evolving and moving the benchmarks for your business?", "I believe there is something fundamentally wrong with many current approaches. AI adoption programs are often still driven halfhearted or even as alibi activities for the market and investors. But such a demanding environment requires a proper long-term vision and strategy, that is strong enough to drive the necessary business and organizational changes. This is what Sinek describes as \u201cinfinite\u201d mindset. In contrast, \u201cfinite\u201d AI strategies focus much more at the challenges at hand, like winning in your current market by for example adding a single intelligent feature to your product or beating current competition with automation-based cost reductions. This can be a smart way to start but without committing to a longer-term vision is it just confusing the much-needed focus on strategic investments to set up your organization for the journey.", "However, it is important to emphasize that AI should not be seen in isolation. It is the spearhead of a much larger Eco-system of digital technologies and concepts that are currently changing the world around us.", "For a couple of years now, the IT industry has been talking about the broader adoption \u2014 or even industrialization \u2014 of AI capabilities. We can see significant advances both in base technologies, data and solution ecosystems as well as concept adoption towards multiple industries. And the expectations are still high. A PWC study from 2017 predicted for example: \u201cAI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030, more than the current output of China and India combined\u201d", "What we don\u2019t see just yet is how the vast global investments in AI are anywhere near of producing respective results for the majority of businesses. Some data savvy companies are succeeding with their efforts and setting new benchmarks in industries such as travel, insurance, investment or entertainment. However, many organizations are still struggling to cope with the new world of AI, and a lot of AI initiatives still do not get any further than a proof of concept or a prototype state.", "But why does this represent a challenge, if trial and error are a natural part of any innovation processes? The problem is that many of these companies are not at all shaped for iterative innovation processes and are therefore likely to discontinue their efforts before they have had a chance to mature. A rigid culture of so called \u2018quick wins\u2019 and \u2018fast results\u2019 limits the opportunity space for impactful AI and data-driven innovation. Leveraging data-based automation or creating intelligent user experience requires both turning established processes upside down and new levels of flexibility for infrastructure and applications. This is a major challenge for any legacy system or mind set.", "An infinite business mindset focuses on creating the right conditions for executing a long-term strategy, rather than winning the short-term game at hand. This makes sense in a context where the rules of the game are constantly changing as they do for an emerging field such as AI. I am convinced that the understanding of the mechanics of infinite games can provide companies great leverage to be more effective with their AI efforts.", "So, why is AI adoption an infinite game \u2014 and how do you play it?", "Through years of engaging with advanced analytics, data mining, machine learning and AI concepts, my personal and professional passion has been in applying these concepts into real-world business applications. Together with a lot of great colleagues a great deal of learning has emerged on the way. Yet, a lot of companies still run into very similar challenges when scaling up their AI concepts and organizations.", "In my opinion, this is often caused by a misunderstanding about the game that we are in. This does not just lead to wrong decisions; it often triggers the wrong discussions in the first place. Just think about make-or-buy and technology strategies, team composition or market strategies and how they would change in the light of a longer-term strategic commitment. AI-initiatives are often started with plenty of goodwill and excitement both from the management and the organization. However, it often seems to come as a surprise to the management that individual AI projects seldom have a positive short-term or even mid-term return on investment. The start-up investments and needed maturity time for AI-based solutions require a longer investment perspective that covers multiple generations of the concept and includes related use cases. Project teams and data scientists are much better allocated at creating capabilities to serve a long-term AI-enablement of the organization rather than building a point solution for a small number of predefined problems.", "There is no defined start, middle or end of AI adoption, there is just a process of evolving capabilities and extending data sets and use cases.", "Elements of an \u2018Infinite\u2019 AI-adoption strategy", "So how do you plan for something that is constantly evolving, including technologies, eco system and not to forget user adoption?", "AI adoption is not only a challenge for product and services organizations but as well for technology and business service providers when including AI into their consultancy and infrastructure practices. Such initiatives often start with adding data scientists to existing analytics teams and/or adding new skills to their existing data savvy consultancy teams. This can result in a very powerful combination of skill sets that can support the whole data value chain from backend applications, data infrastructure, analytical to data science components.", "This is a huge asset and in high demand in the marketplace. But it is no guarantee for success. Many of such consultancy offerings struggle to get over a critical mass with their AI initiatives and need to get financed by the traditional bread and butter projects over years.", "One reason for this problem is a stronger application focus for AI concepts and the related need for software development and user experience skill sets as part of AI teams. AI concepts are most powerful if they can drive decisions or process automation, which in turn requires close integration with business applications and processes. This is a major difference from traditional analytics and reporting concepts that usually focus on the presentation of insights towards end users.", "Even though many service providers have already established such multi-disciplinary teams, the majority of them has challenges to scale up AI related consultancy practice. In my opinion, a success factor for establishing a successful and scalable AI consultancy offering is to specialize on one or several dedicated AI use case areas in the offering and then build related competency clusters around these. A good data scientist can work with any type of use case but scaling a business service requires to build up a shared IP-stack around a range of use cases, a selected industry or a selection of AI concepts. This is the basis for progressing the method and tool stack and sharing best practice across the team, which is evenly important for the related marketing and sales processes. AI sells through the use cases and related benefits and not through the methods or tools used. AI concepts as such might be exciting for experts but their value is hard to explain to end users. A consultancy practice with a dedicated industry or use case focus is much better prepared to lead a customer dialogue towards new AI-enabled capabilities and related business opportunities.", "AI adoption is not something that happens in isolation. It is always limited to a company\u2019s culture and strategy. Only if the entire company is ready to play and know the rules of the infinite game, will it be able to apply it in a new area. In his book \u201cThe infinite game\u201d, S. Sinek defined some general elements that enable infinite strategies that I believe provide a good starting point:", "\u00b7 Advance a just cause Whatever your business is, in order to provide long-term motivation for your people you need to identify and pursue a genuine \u2018just cause\u2019 for your business. A just case can be something that directly or indirectly is for the benefit of society, human development or supports for example planet and nature protection. At the first glance might it be easier to see how such a just cause should look like for NGOs or social and governmental organizations. However, all organizations are part of society at large and can therefore pursue a just cause. It could be a contribution to healthy meals in schools, providing financing for other business to advance regional economic development. Other companies are dedicated to exploring technology innovation that can advance society-critical tasks such as climate protection or social inclusion, increasing people\u2019s productivity. A just cause is what inspires us to want to keep playing the game today, next month and maybe in ten years.", "\u00b7 Trusting teamsMutual trust in your teams is more important for long term organizational success than rules and performance systems. Mutual trust creates a productive working environment for all individuals in which they can feel mentally safe. A trusting team will reinforce a supportive learning culture, which is essential for multi-disciplinary teams to function optimally. Data science projects are highly dependent on the ability of critical evaluation of process and results both in the team and in the organization. A final solution is often the result of numerous iterations and changes of direction and approach. This type of creative and critical collaboration requires a very high level of trust and respect between the team members.", "\u00b7 Worthy rival In his book, Sinek makes an important distinction between competitors and worthy rivals. Competitors are someone you are trying to beat in the \u201cfinite\u201d competition for a contract or a customer. A worthy rival is someone who can challenge and inspire you in the long run. Together you define and develop the market you are in. According to Sinek, Apple in the 1980 is a great example of a \u2018worthy rival\u2019 mind set, when they introduced a small personal computer while everybody else, especially IBM, were still investing in the living room-sized business machine. IBM stepped up to the game and responded to the challenge by introducing their own PC after only 12 months of development. Apple then made an astonishing PR move and welcomed IB with a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal that read: \u201cWelcome to the most exciting and important marketplace since the computer revolution began 35 years ago. [\u2026] Putting real computer power in the hands of the individual is already improving the way people work, think, communicate and spend their leisure hours.\u201d (S. Sinek, The Infinite Game, 2019)", "In the emerging markets driven by AI and Data Intelligence it is important to set your own strategy but also picking your worthy rivals to follow closely and then compete with. At the same time, it is important to understand that it will need all or most of the current players to establish the eco system for this huge and fast-moving new space. More important that competing with everyone is to define which role you want to play in it and how you can benefit from the others", "\u00b7 Existential flexibility There is a common narrative in the IT-market that companies have to embrace flexibility in order to harvest the transformational capabilities that lie in AI adoption. Even though I very much agree to this, I would like to add that an infinite mindset is the essential enabler for flexibility at a strategy level. Only a focus on the long-term vision and purpose will provide the freedom to rethink both methods and strategies. In contrast, short-term finite business strategies leave little room for real creativity.  The business mindset of a company often manifests itself directly in the priorities for organizational AI-adoption. Finite adoption strategies often start with a focus on cost reduction and an automation use case for a routine operation. While this might work well and deliver some short-term results to the company, it doesn\u2019t provide substantial leverage for driving and evolving the business model itself. Companies with a finite mindset often perceive themselves as chased by the innovators and disrupters of their market, while infinite players manage to unlock the potential of new technologies that allow them to redefine themselves.", "\u00b7 Courage to lead Existential flexibility refers to an to ability and willingness to change your whole business model and replace conventional ways of doing things, often while the current business model still is successful.  Leaders with an infinite mindset will spot strategic opportunities that will advance their cause, but only strong leaders will be able to resist the temptations of short-term wins and save choices. It requires courage to invest in a new strategy while the existing one seemingly is still working well. Therefore, a normal business reflex is to drive people to preserve the current state. But in the long run, all efforts to protect and subsidize the old strategy or way will weaken the organization\u2019s financial and mental ability to change.  Sinek also makes a good point when asking where the courage to lead should come from. It seldom is the result of a personal live-changing moment. Normally, courageous leadership is the sum of small steps and decisions, inspired and guided by a just cause and driven by worthy rivals.", "Many people in the current top level research community on AI are convinced that we are still in the very infancy of AI technology adoption and that we are still far from being able to imagine the related changes to business and society. I recommend for example the great article from Computer scientist and Machine Learning researcher Michael I. Jordan \u201cArtificial Intelligence \u2014 The Revolution Hasn\u2019t Happened Yet\u201d. Therefore, I believe that the single most important skill for companies in such an environment is to embrace change as part of their culture.", "AI adoption is an infinite game \u2014 let\u2019s play that way also.", "Simen, Sinek \u201cThe Infinite Game\u201d, Penguin Business 2019", "Sizing the prize; PwC\u2019s Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution, PWC 2017", "Michael I.
