Most business owners are aware of the value and usefulness of applying data science to gain a competitive edge. Data mining produces undiscovered insights that lead to an action plan for a successful business strategy. To make the most of applied data science, it is important to have useful data and for a business person to understand the typical data science development flow.", "Let\u2019s explore two case studies how a retail/restaurant chain and a healthcare insurance company used applied data science along with machine learning to conduct data mining and discovered useful insights for business strategy innovation.", "A chain of retail stores and restaurants collected inventory and sales data for many years. This database served as the information resource used by a data science consultant to train a machine-learning model. The consultant helped the business owner identify and achieve strategic goals.", "The existing database was the resource used to generate a demand-forecasting model to make future predictions of sales. An adaptive selective model predicted demand for the upcoming week by analyzing data from the past two and one-half years of retail sales. The data mining used autoregressive models combined with external data sources. That enabled forecasting of demand for any particular product at any time. By using this solution, the company was able to optimize inventory and warehousing to have available supplies on hand as needed and be more cost-effective.", "In this case, the goal was to secure authorized access to highly-personal healthcare data to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations. The company was advised to use multimodal biometric authentication that required a user to pass both facial and voice recognition to gain authorized access.", "The data science consultant recommended adding enhanced security features to the system that included optical character recognition (OCR) for driver\u2019s license verification, a deep learning system to prevent facial recognition spoofing, and security challenges based on NLP. These improvements resulted in the creation of an Enterprise-Verification-as-a-Service (EVaaS) system.", "Business owners want to know how to use technology to achieve business goals. They are less interested in the details of how the technology works. They are more interested in the cost and the results of the implementation of applied data science to their business processes.", "Here are the steps of a data science software development project.", "A data science consultant understands the needs of a client and the client\u2019s customers. The consultant identifies a client\u2019s problems. Recommended solutions produce the most value and serve the needs of the client\u2019s customers. The consultant must understand how data science applies to the business model and what data will support the implementation strategy.", "It helps if there is existing data gathered over many years to work with, to train the machine learning model. The consultant evaluates the data to understand its structure and its usefulness from a strategic perspective.", "If no database exists to work with, then, a data science consultant explores the client\u2019s goals and main-use cases. These serve as the basis for a technical design for data collection. Options for acquiring data include gathering it directly and investigating if any third-party databases exist, which may be useful. Perhaps, suitable pre-trained models exist. If they do, this reduces the expense and efforts needed for model training, significantly. It may be possible to generate synthetic data as a substitute for real data.", "With pre-trained models, the accuracy adjusts based on the data inputs, which are specific to the new project. As a model \u201clearns,\u201d results improve. At the inception, it is not possible to predict the accuracy and quality of a machine learning model. This requires a reiterative process that uses experimentation and calibrates results during the development process.", "Allow about one week for a data science consultant to evaluate the business inputs and goals. This evaluation is usually no cost as a part of the pre-contract proposal stage of a project.", "Business goals are metrics to measure improvement. Technical objectives are benchmarks to measure system performance. Success metrics are a combination of both.", "When using demand forecasting, business goals that rely on customers\u2019 behaviors, such as \u201cincrease sales by 20%\u201d have no guarantee. What can be guaranteed are technical objectives, such as \u201chow much inventory is needed if sales increase by 20%.\u201d", "As an example, a client may desire a forecasting model that predicts product demand for the upcoming week with 70% accuracy based on the analysis of data from the past five months. This prediction will be the basis for creating additional measurements, tasks, and hypotheses.", "As we saw in the project for the retail/restaurant chain, the goal was to optimize inventory, warehousing, and purchasing. Data mining the sales statistics from the past allowed the consultant to predict the future purchases of goods. Analysis of a single dataset solved the problems of inventory, warehousing, and purchasing as well as predicting sales revenues.", "Every task develops from a hypothesis, such as \u201cinventory management improves by using sales forecasting\u201d to set appropriate inventory levels for each item. The hypothesis suggests a guide to follow. By evaluating the results accomplished when exploring the data collection that answers the hypothesis, a decision becomes necessary.", "If the hypothesis is correct, then the machine learning model undergoes fine-tuning to improve the accuracy of the results. Substantia effort focuses on this.", "If the hypothesis is incorrect and shows there is no value applying the hypothesis to a particular dataset, then, the approach, hypothesis, or dataset must change.", "The required level of accuracy is unpredictable as it depends on the dataset. The accuracy is limited due to the budget spent that is cost-effective for the business goals. It is a poor strategy to overspend on achieving an accuracy level that is higher than necessary. There is no point in requiring system accuracy that does not create value-added results for a business.", "Managing a data science project is achievable by using a combination of classic Agile principles with a cross-industry process for data mining (CRISP-DM) model.", "A standard cycle focuses on one hypothesis to generate precision for the tasks and results. This cycle is a set of four sprints, each lasting one week. During the first two sprints, of understanding the business and the data, the first hypothesis forms the baseline, to build upon, with future hypotheses to improve results.", "With the proper hypothesis, it is possible to make raw data actionable. For this to happen, the following steps are necessary:", "In the demand forecasting example given above, the data underwent review, clean up, and organization. This data determined the benchmark for the most frequently sold items. Not all data had the same value. To achieve a useful result, the data used for the model had to be relevant to the exact hypothesis posed. Data science consultants organized a representative sample of the data for analysis. Analysis of all the data did not happen at once.", "In the multi-modal biometric security system example, one goal was to better identify a user by using a real-time comparison of a driver\u2019s license photo and a selfie photo. A pre-trained model for facial recognition was useful to establish a baseline.", "There was a challenge caused by using the dataset for the driver\u2019s licenses. The image quality for licenses was much lower than the high-resolution selfie files and the images of the faces used for the pre-training of the model. Because the goal was to compare these two types of images, it was important for a dataset to match the requirements of the hypothesis.", "Having too much data does not ever happen since it is possible to select a subset sample from a large database. However, if there is not enough data of the correct type(s), the training process will fail and the model will not learn. If there is a need for more data, we collect it or move on to a different hypothesis.", "If a hypothesis fails due to a lack of sufficient data to test it, then, we start the cycle again with a new hypothesis. This type of failure is an inherent and unavoidable risk.", "In the project for the retail/restaurant chain, it was vital to know how the different types of products sold. The data needed was the amount purchased during each period and how long the items stayed in inventory in the warehouse before a sale. The larger the number of items analyzed by the model, the less accuracy was achieved. Nevertheless, retraining the model for different items was possible. This improved results.", "Before selecting the data used to train a model, it is a wise strategy to decide how to test the model\u2019s accuracy. It is possible to randomly separate most initial datasets into two sets. One is for training and the other is for testing.", "For example, to predict sales with 97% or more accuracy for one month, the hypothesis was that the model needed five months of historical sales data. Once sufficient proof of this hypothesis existed, the model was successful and the forecasting system was ready for deployment.", "There are two phases to model deployment. The first phase is to deploy the model in a test environment using real data. The model makes predictions for short periods and the accuracy is checked. For example, if the historical data is five months of prior transactions, then the appropriate prediction period could be one week or one month. It would not be appropriate to use a prediction period of one year, as that would introduce inaccuracies and take too long to verify.", "After the model passes the analysis test, the deployment elevates to the real-time production environment.", "In the case of the retail/restaurant chain, the demand forecasting model ran on a test server in a test environment for enough time to prove its average accuracy of 97%. Then, it integrated with the company-wide system for use by each location using the relevant data from that location.", "The four stages of a data science software development project need repeating any time business processes and new statistical approaches make a specific machine learning model outdated. Luckily, data science continues to advance with many cloud-based services and pre-trained models available, which are useful. This makes it easier for software developers to create new models and test them. Integration with existing enterprise software is becoming easier, with faster software project delivery that reduces time-to-market for new deployments.", "Your home for data science.
