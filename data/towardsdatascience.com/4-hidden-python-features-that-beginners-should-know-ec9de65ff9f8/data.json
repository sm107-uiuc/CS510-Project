You will never finish learning how to program in Python. You might constantly discover new features in Python that are useful, and you might be overwhelmed by the amount there is to learn.", "There does not exist a single book or website that contains everything you need to know about Python. Not even the official documentation. The possibility of Python is basically infinite.", "I have been coding in Python for years, and have been discovering interesting Python features that are quite unique. Things that you would not be able to find in other programming languages. Here are 4 hidden Python features that Python beginners may find them useful.", "Are you familiar with conditional statements in Python?", "while loops, tick.for loops, easy.if else clauses, you nailed it.", "What about for else clauses? What?", "The codes in the else block will run only if the for loop is completed without encountering a break statement. If you do not know what break is, then check out the following article for more information.", "So how is this for-else loop useful? Maybe the user has 3 attempts to enter their correct password in a for _ in range(3): loop, and only the correct password activates the break statement. The else block contains the consequence of entering wrong passwords in 3 consecutive wrong guesses, for example locking the user from using the system.", "You want to check if the value in a is within the range of 0 and 100, so you would make two comparisons and combine them using and. 0 <= a and a <= 100. This is easy.", "But you can chain the comparisons and write them in a more human-readable and intuitive way 0 <= a <= 100. The interpreter would split them and read the comparison operations like 0 <= a and a <= 100.", "We can slice a list a using the syntax a[start:stop:step], with an optional third step argument. It reads slicing a portion of the sequence that starts at start, ends at stop, with a step size of step. The step size has to be an integer, and can be negative.", "We can reverse a list simply by a[::-1] by setting the step argument as -1. The step is 1 by default if not specified, which implies no element skipping or list reversing.", "How do you swap values of two objects in Python? Easy! You just create a temporary object temp, just like how you would have done it in other languages.", "But this is not very readable and far from elegant. But you could actually swap the values with ease using one simple line in Python.", "Why does it work? The interpreter first evaluated the right-hand side and created a tuple (a,b) in the memory. The left-hand side is then evaluated where two elements in the tuple are unpacked and assigned to b and a respectively. It essentially swapped the objects assigned to a and b.", "Thank you for reading! Do you find those features interesting and useful? Leave a comment below!
