Six of us decided to work on the question of the cost of civil servants.", "Our public policy question initially focused on the cost of civil servants in France. In order to successfully answer our research question, we attempted to find accurate and reliable data on the Internet, however, we quickly realised that a lot of datasets were either not available, incomplete, or not in the right format. For example, a database we found on the OECD website provided detailed data on budgetary spending of many OECD countries, but not of France. Other sources which seemed to provide the information we were looking for either had outdated links, or were not accessible due to a lack of the right credentials.", "A Cour des Comptes\u2019 document provided charts, however the data used for the charts was inaccessible, and therefore unverifiable. This sheds light on transparency issues and may lead some people to question the truth of the given information that is given to people already filtered and \u201canalysed\u201d. By giving access to simplified information to the people, anyone is theoretically supposed to easily read and/or understand that piece of information but it prevents individuals who would like to to actually dig dipper and use that \u201copen public data\u201d for academic reasons or just to verify it.", "We tried shifting our topic to focus on the cost of civil servants\u2019 pensions, hoping we would find quality data for this more specific topic. We ended up facing the same issue with that category. The data was either missing or already treated in a way for people to read it simply without having access to the initial numbers.", "Even the French portal for Open Data (data.gouv.fr) provided inaccessible or unusable data. For instance, many inputs from the Caisse nationale de retraites des agents des collectivit\u00e9s locales on the website were not downloadable.", "Therefore, we were forced to pick a new research question. Armed with a better understanding of the importance of complete/clean datasets, we attempted to tackle another pertinent public policy issue: crimes. We chose crime as an issue because of its far-reaching consequences for the general welfare, and because the geographical analysis of this data appeared relevant. Our goal was to analyze relevant data and patterns behind burglaries, as well as to better understand the differences between departments to identify critical factors such as: the density of the police force, types of housing, and level of wealth of the neighbourhoods. This time, we were aware of the fact that our research question would quite possible have to be slightly adjusted to the available data we could find.", "To create a full overview and explore patterns throughout the entire country we analyzed the police reports\u2019 data describing the numbers of police files for 107 different crimes by department, for each month since 1996. The data was up-to-date, complete, accessible and was also provided with a description of how the data was collected, interesting to figure out biases that could influence the numbers of the dataset.", "Although the data provided by police reports was complete and of good quality, we were aware of its potential limits. First, not all crimes are declared and thus not included in the database. Second, the date refers to the time they were reported and not the time they occurred. Finally, the crime registration processes have evolved over the past few years, namely with the implementation of the LRPPN in April 2015, implying that part of the evolution in the number of crimes may actually be due to the evolution of registration processes. We tried going around these limits by focusing on a category of crime that should not be too concerned by the issue of police data underestimating the real number of crimes.", "Considering that most insurance companies require victims of burglaries to file a police report in order to get reimbursed, we decided to focus on burglaries. Figures and statistics published online and data provided by the French Ministry of the Interior confirmed that thieves still target residences of individuals to operate burglaries. Brought back to the scale of metropolitan France, the rate of burglaries corresponds to an average of 667 recorded burglaries per day. In other words, a burglary happens every two minutes.", "One of the reasons why we decided to focus on that category (more specifically burglaries targeting main residences) is that fact is it getting easier and easier to track down people\u2019s activities nowadays, have information about where they live, their habits and when they potentially go on vacation for instance. Moreover, in order to not be biased by the evolution of crime registration processes, we chose to focus on the two most recent years in the database, 2017 and 2018.", "From the complete police crimes dataset, we filtered the data based on the total number of burglaries by department. We merged this data with the population of each department, provided by the INSEE. Because burglaries are related to population, we furthermore calculated the ratio of burglary to population as more accurate basis of comparison. Then we integrated these datasets with the average property value in these departments, measured in average price per square meter. As we couldn\u2019t find datasets on housing prices neither on the data.gouv.fr nor on the INSEE websites, we had to create them manually, using estimations from http://paris.notaires.fr for the Ile-de-France region and from https://www.efficity.com for the rest of the d\u00e9partements.", "Finally, to visualize the data, we used the Khartis map app developed by Science Po\u2019s Atelier de Cartographie. After visualizing the data, we used a multiple linear regression to model the relationship between property values and burglaries, while checking for population.", "The correlation coefficient between the burglaries/population ratio and housing prices in France in 2018 is relatively high (0.5). The result of the regression confirm this positive relationship between the housing prices and burglaries, significant at the 99% significance level. Even when controlling for population size, the housing prices variable is still positively correlated with the number of burglaries and still statistically significant (also at the 99% level). We also checked for multicollinearity and heteroskedasticity, and found no evidence of multicollinearity but slight heteroskedasticity. When correcting the heteroskedasticity, we found our results remained statistically significant.", "We ran the regression for the Ile-de-France region, but did not have enough observations for the correlation test results to be significant. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions on the potential link between burglaries and property values in the Ile-de-France region.", "Although the French state is relatively one of the best suppliers of Open Data, the data we found online did not provide us with ready-to-use data. The challenging process, from obtaining the appropriate data for the right research question, to processing the data for further use, has significant implications for the development and subsequent implementation of public policy. In our design experiment we strove to apply the knowledge we gathered by computing our datasets.", "First, in order to foster a diverse and innovative set of policy solutions to our problem, we attempted to promote the free flow of ideas by brainstorming. We put ourselves in the shoes of the involved stakeholders to better understand all parties\u2019 perspectives, and approach the issue in a comprehensive way. This important step increased our awareness of the complexity of the processing of data, from the beginning of the creation of the data by a homeowner calling the police station to file a report, to the processing of this data by a police officer writing up a report for colleagues or superiors. Then, by writing down our ideas, exchanging them amongst each other, and elaborating upon each others\u2019 ideas, we were able to agree upon our top pick: a platform that allows citizens to track cases of burglaries and be a more active participants in the data filing process.", "The database would be accessible both online and by mobile with a simple user friendly interface, to allow stakeholders multiple routes of access and channels of communication with the authorities and insurance companies. Drawing upon the lessons learned from the incomplete and/or difficult to use data, this solution increases the simplicity and the quality of collecting data, as well as the transparency, potentially leading to a more efficient use of public police resources.", "To conclude, our experience of the complexity of accessing datasets has lead us to be more aware of the lost potential that these non-accessible data represents, both for citizens and public stakeholders. Through our journey, we were yet able to work with complete databases, which allowed us to study the recurrence of burglaries depending on department, that we studied in relation to the price of housing. Using a design thinking model, we outlined possible policy solutions for the French government to improve the collection of data, as an easy and monitored report process for burglaries. Ultimately, the quality of the data collected could improve the knowledge of burglaries\u2019 patterns, helping the police force to tackle them down.", "Your home for data science.
