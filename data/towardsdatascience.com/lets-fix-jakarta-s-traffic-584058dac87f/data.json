A recent survey ranks Jakarta the 7th worst in the world. The facts are astounding \u2014 the number of motorcycles on the road today hovers around 14 million but is expected to jump to 66 million by 2020, a 370% increase if nothing is done. However, addressing this challenge has not gone without notice or remedial action. Jakarta\u2019s governor and the central government have already attempted several ways to reduce traffic congestion. One of them is the odd-even traffic policy, which attempts to reduce traffic by regulating the number of vehicles on the road in the city on any given day. While it is a commendable effort, it only scratches the surface of trying to solve the bigger jam. President Joko Widodo recognized this and published an executive order to create a more focused effort to improving public transportation as a long-term solution to urban mobility.", "Here is a look at the actual order. Please forgive me if you do not speak Bahasa\u2026just trust me. ;)", "\u201cPERATURAN PRESIDEN REPUBLIK INDONESIA NOMOR 55 TAHUN 2018 TENTANG RENCANA INDUK TRANSPORTASI JAKARTA, BOGOR, DEPOK, TANGERANG, DAN BEKASI TAHUN 2018 -2029\u201d", "In chapter 2 \u201cSASARAN DAN KEBIJAKAN PENYELENGGARAAN TRANSPORTASI JABODETABEK\u201d, it says the maximum walking distance to any public transportation stop should be 500 meters.", "So I began with a simple question:", "What percent of the city (area) is not within this distance (based on road distance \u2014 not just radius which would imperfectly reflect how far you would have to walk)?", "I started by collecting all current Jakarta public transportation stops including Angkot (Minivan), Minibus, Medium-sized Bus, Transjakarta and Train. There are more than 19,749 stops in total.", "Next, I mapped out an area that is within 500 meters walking distance from each stop. For example, I simulated a 500-meter walkable path from a Transjakarta commuter stop in Kelapa Gading. The simulated path is the actual street route that has to be connected with the Transjakarta stop. The street path could be a main road or street alley (Jalan Gang).", "Below is a visual depiction this analysis:", "Why did I choose the road/path route instead of a radius?", "A radius around a point does not often predict how far a person would have to walk. Yes, it is theoretically possible that a person could reduce the walk by cutting across properties, jumping fences, running through buildings, or other tactics that we could not predict in any case (and of course, we\u2019d never advise a person to do this to shorten their walk). Because radius represents a less likely scenario, I felt using actual roads would be a more accurate way to predict walking distance.", "I then merged the transportation stop data with the 500-meter route data and created the following simulation. This depicts how much of the city is covered within the current public transportation ecosystem.", "I wanted to have a better look at where the gaps were in the city. So, I widened and merged all stop locations in Jakarta and plotted them back on a map. This allowed me to better identify and differentiate between covered and uncovered areas. I then removed all public stop locations for visual cleanliness purposes. Now we can see the remaining areas that are not covered by public transportation stops.", "Running some basic analytics on the data behind the map, I estimate that 45% of the area is unreachable by a public transportation stop. This represents an area covering approximately 300 million square meters (out of a total of 655 million square meters in the city).", "One caveat: it is likely that at least part of this area would not be a place you would typically need to walk from. For example, if you are standing on a busy highway that is 600 meters from a stop, then you are technically \u201cuncovered\u201d. However, it is unlikely that you would ever need to walk from there (unless your car broke down or something of that nature). Hence, while I may be over-representing uncovered areas slightly, it probably isn\u2019t far off.", "In the end, the data design on this has broad applications for improving urban mobility challenges. It should also make us all aware and continue to learn and ask questions.", "Why did the executive order set the rule at \u201c500 meters\u201d ?", "It serves as a starting point, but perhaps a better question is \u201cwhat is a reasonable distance to walk?\u201d. The consequence of setting this objective is important to consider. If 250 meters is the criteria, then the uncovered area will be substantially higher, requiring a much higher level of investment. If we set the range longer (say 750 meters), the government\u2019s investment will be lower, but then people may not use public transportation.", "Would people prefer a shorter walking distance or shorter waiting time?", "Instead of investing in new stops, the solution may be additions to the public transport \u201cfleet\u201d. Perhaps this isn\u2019t even a trade-off consumers think about, but shouldn\u2019t we know before we invest billions into the system?", "I\u2019d like to credit my colleague, Raihan Saputra, for his analytical support and GO-JEK for being a company that prioritises social impact. These have been key motivators for me to explore this challenge and tackle this project. My hope is that by making our understanding of this issue more empirical and fact-based, we can improve the mobility of Jakarta residents.", "Interested in doing more of these? email research@go-jek.com", "Your home for data science.
