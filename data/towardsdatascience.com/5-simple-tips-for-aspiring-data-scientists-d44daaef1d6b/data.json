In this story I will go through 5 simple tips that I often give in response to these requests. Hopefully you will be able to implement them into your data science career exploration.", "There is no point in doing all the hard work to become a data scientist if you finally get there and find out that you don\u2019t actually like it.", "You might really enjoy doing a bunch of online courses or working on projects to build an impressive data science portfolio. That is all well and good, but learning new skills and working on challenging problems really are the fun parts of being a data scientist. If you don\u2019t also like explaining difficult concepts to people and negotiating with other teams, you may not enjoy a lot of the day to day work of a data scientist.", "If you would like to read more about what it is really like to be a data scientist you can check out my other stories. Furthermore, I recently wrote about an example work flow for a data science project.", "This leads onto my second piece of advice\u2026", "Talk frankly with data scientists who are in the field that you are interested in. If you do this, you are much more likely to get a realistic view of what a data scientist really does.", "Think about what your dream data science job is and ask your friends and network to see if anyone knows someone who already does that job. If you have a kind introduction, you are much more likely to find that person helpful and approachable.", "When I was working towards becoming a data scientist, I was introduced through friends to several working data scientists. They had a background in academia and had transitioned into data science as I hoped to do. Those conversations were so helpful. All I wanted from these relative strangers was to meet them and talk briefly about what they did and their experience making the transition. They were happy to oblige.", "The conversations that I had with working data scientists were invaluable in my journey into the field. I gained a lot of clarity about what sort of a data science job I actually wanted.", "For example, I talked to a machine learning specialist and realised that was not the direction that I wanted to move in. Not only would it have taken an extraordinary amount of specialised training, I was just not that interested in the nitty gritty of algorithms. Similarly, I talked to a data analyst who did website analytics and found that was not where my passions lie either.", "However, when I talked to a data scientist who was involved in building data products my interest was really sparked. She was clear about the fact that the majority of her day was writing SQL and going to meetings, rather than running complex analyses. Yet, her descriptions of her work resonated much more with me.", "I was so pleased with how generous these people were with their time given that they did not know me from a bar of soap. Since then I have tried to pay it forward and talked to several aspiring data scientists about my experiences in the field. I guess writing this story is a step further for me and a way to reach a lot more people.", "Whether it is information you\u2019re after, or an introduction or a recommendation, it is always best to be straightforward. Explicitly ask for what you want.", "In my experience, if you ask people for a small specific favour that is not too difficult to grant, they are more likely to help you out. I know that when people ask me for help learning data science, I am much more likely to say yes if they have a specific ask that is within my power. If people are vague, I find it much more difficult to say yes because I don\u2019t know exactly what I am in for.", "For example, if someone is introduced to me through a friend asking to meet me for half an hour and ask me a list of questions they have prepared about the skills they should learn to become a data scientist, I would be inclined to say yes. In fact I have done just that on several occasions. Yet, if that same person, with that same introduction were to ask me to help them become a data scientist, I would be much more reluctant. Saying \u2018help me become a data scientist\u2019 is too vague. I want to know up front what you really want from me.", "This is a big one for me. One of my pet peeves is when people pretend to know or understand something that they really don\u2019t. It is not helpful to anyone. If you don\u2019t know the answer to a question, just say so. I will have much more respect for you that way than if you try to fumble your way through an answer where you drop lots of long and important sounding words, but don\u2019t really say anything.", "Further, if you just say that you don\u2019t know or don\u2019t understand, that gives you the opportunity to learn. Possibly from that very person you are talking to. That way next time somebody asks you the same question, you will actually know the answer and be able to provide it with confidence.", "I don\u2019t know but if I had to make an informed guess it would be\u2026", "At least that way you get the chance to demonstrate the knowledge that you do have, even if you don\u2019t know the exact answer to the question.", "There are a lot of reasons you might want a career in data science. However, if it is because of the money and prestige, think again. Not that you don\u2019t get good money and a certain amount of respect, but if you don\u2019t love it, the work is extremely frustrating.", "Like any kind of experiment, not all data science projects work out that way you would hope. You are also often beholden to other stakeholders in the company you work for. You may not always get to tackle the problems that you want to or that most interest you. Rather you are more likely to have to work on problems that provide value to your employer.", "\u2026or if you can at least tolerate all of the above on a daily basis, then data science might be the right career for you.", "There are lots of different types of data scientists. Finding the right kind of data science job when you have never had one before can be difficult. You don\u2019t know exactly what you are in for until you give it a go in real life.", "Even though it can be confusing, I would recommend being thoughtful about what data science jobs you go after.", "For example, there are lots of data science jobs in areas like finance and insurance. To me that kind of domain is just not interesting at all. But if you geek out on those sectors, then you should have plenty of data science jobs to choose from.", "On the other hand, if you are like me and have quite specific areas of interest, I would recommend that you stick to your guns and try to get a job in that area. Not only will it be easier to get a job if it is in an area you are enthusiastic about, but you may also have some domain area expertise that could help you on your job hunt.", "Personally I am most interested in healthcare, biology, education and teaching. So I have only ever considered jobs in those fields.", "The actual area of focus that a company has might be less important for you when choosing a job, especially if you just love statistics and algorithms. If that is you, then make sure you focus intently on the job titles and descriptions. Go for a machine learning specialist role or something algorithm or statistics heavy otherwise it might be difficult for you to be satisfied with your work.", "What about if I just work in a field outside of my interests to gain experience?", "\u2026you might ask. If you go to work in a finance or insurance company just to gain experience, you may pigeonhole yourself into that industry. Your experience might be wrong for the area you actually want to work in.", "Then you may have to work on transitioning all over again.", "I hope that these five tips help you on your journey to become a data scientist. It is a wonderful career that I really enjoy but does not suit everyone. Some truths of the job can sometimes get lost in the hype around data science. If you follow my tips, I hope that they help you to clarify if data science is right for you and which pathway you should take to getting your first data science job.", "In addition to data, my other passion is painting.
