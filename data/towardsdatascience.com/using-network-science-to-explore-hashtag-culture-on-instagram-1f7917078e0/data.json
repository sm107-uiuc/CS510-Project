After we have searched for all the posts containing a specific hashtag, the first step is to capture all of these unique URL\u2019s for posts that contain that hashtag.", "I found the best way to do this is through using a combination of Selenium WebDriver and parsing the html on the fly, extracting each posts href attributes to a data structure as we scroll through all the content.", "As this part of the Instagram site is highly dynamic requiring consistent scrolling to load new images, using some kind of browser based automation such as Selenium WebDriver is the only feasible way of capturing the data. This means it can take a little while to get all the links.", "Once you have a list of all the links, you can then use a combination of urlopen and html parsing (I use Beautiful Soup) to get the data for each Instagram post.", "Once you have the html for each post and parse its content, you will find that data for Instagram posts has a consistent structure resembling a dictionary / JSON style format", "The main output of the InstagramScraper class is a Pandas DataFrame containing a host of variables by post.", "Most of these variables are self explanatory and offer all kinds of options for exploratory analysis beyond hashtags.", "Now that we have our scraped data and have a nice and tidy Pandas DataFrame we can begin to think about processing our data in preparation for building our network and visualising our graph, which is where things get really fun.", "I have built a second python class called InstagramGraph which also contains a pipeline of methods that allow you to analyse an Instagram dataset and ultimately model the hashtag data as an instance of a NetworkX graph object using Plotly visualisations.", "The key processes within this class are:", "The code block below outlines a pipeline from the InstagramGraph class which contains a suite of methods that create new features in our data.", "There are several methods here, some are linguistic (e.g. determining the language of a post) although most of the processes within this method generate extra descriptive metrics such as median post count by user, total hashtag count by post and median hashtag use by user.", "Whilst some of these new features/metrics aren\u2019t directly related to graph building it\u2019s alway worth generating more data points where you can as it offers a chance to do some exploratory analysis of the subject matter which might provide more context about what our graph model reveals. It also might inspire some other ideas for analysis that you hadn\u2019t initially considered.", "The langdetect library in Python allows us to access the Google Translation library over an API and gives us the ability to identify language in our text.", "Note \u2014 due to a limit on Google Cloud API requests this can run quite slow when processing a large volume of data. For the purposes of example, this is fine; if you want to productionise this you may want to think about a faster alternative and consider paying.", "As we can see the majority of the Instagram posts for #happiness are in English \u2014 over 80% of our data set.", "A look at some distributions show that the data on user post frequency is extremely positively skewed; there are handful of outlier accounts that post very frequently (up to 140 times) whereas the majority of posters are posting only once.", "To extract our hashtags I have created two methods that do the job for us. One method takes a string input and returns a list of hashtags. If people have failed to include a space between their string of hashtags, the code can account for this and \u2018unpack\u2019 them into individual hashtags.", "Analysis of hashtag frequency by post indicates that whilst frequency by post tends to follow a uniform distribution , there are some outlier posts that contain an unusually high number of hashtags. Further exploration shows that this partially seems to be driven by people who have posted multiple times across the dataset (high frequency posters). So broadly speaking, those that post more often also tend to use more hashtags in their posts.", "A second method then takes this list of hashtags and looks to lemmatise the input, where appropriate. For those unfamiliar with lemmatisation, this is the process where we can reduce a word to its root lexical form. For instance if we have the hashtags #happiest and #happier \u2014 these are both inflections of the verb #happy. Therefore lemmatisation reduces these inflections back to #happy. I\u2019ve used an instance of a spaCy model to perform the lemmatisation.", "Ok, so the next step is to select the data we want to model. The code outlines a pipeline from the InstagramGraph class which contains a suite of methods that allow us to select the data we want.", "Whilst Instagram is an international platform, for simplicity we might want to consider filtering out non-English posts. As we saw previously, over 80% of the data for #happiness is in English so it makes sense to focus on this subset of the data.", "Verified users tend to be either brands, celebrities or online shops i.e. \u2018people\u2019 who likely don\u2019t represent the average Instagram user. Depending on your objectives for this analysis, you might want to consider removing verified users from your data.", "A cursory inspection of high frequency posters reveals that these are sometimes unverified accounts that are using Instagram to sell stuff under a non-verified status. Do we feel this represents that audience we are interested in understanding? If so we can leave them in, if not \u2014 we can filter them out prior to building our graph.", "I thought it made sense to have the option to lemmatise the scraped hashtags where possible as it reduces the amount of data needed to build the graph \u2014 we don\u2019t necessarily need all that extra data.", "Now that we we have selected the data we want to model, we can build the graph. The pipeline we use for this is below:", "There are three main processes that take place in this pipeline:", "This simply extracts hashtags from our DataFrame into a list of lists \u2014 each sub-list representing a post from our #Happiness data set. By having the input as a simple list of lists, we can easily re-purpose this graph building approach to other sources of data in future where we can wrangle the raw data in a similarly structured / list of list format", "The next step is to take our list of lists and use this to generate the nodes and edges that exist across the entire data set. Remember the nodes are the unique hashtags in the dataset and an edge is created if any two hashtags are mentioned together in the same post.", "The method saves two generated DataFrames as attributes \u2014 a DataFrame containing all the nodes and a DataFrame containing all the edges.", "The next stage is to add these nodes and edges into an instance of a NetworkX graph object (G).", "Once we have created our NetworkX graph object \u2014 we can then use various calculated graph attributes to enhance our node data even further.", "Now we have an instance of a NetworkX graph object that has been built with our node and edge data that we extracted from our #Happiness dataset.", "We can now use Plotly to visualise the hashtag graph as a connected scatter plot.", "There are a few arguments that I have set up that allow for a degree of customisation to the visualisation.", "I think it makes sense to use node size to convey some other variable \u2014 the default is \u2018adjacency_frequency\u2019 i.e. how many other nodes a node has edge connections with. In this instance a smaller node would represent a hashtag with fewer edges and contrastingly a larger node would have more edges. We can emphasise this point even further by applying a colour scale that is correlated with node size.", "NetworkX has a few different graph layouts. The kamada kawai layout arranges nodes in a way so that there are as few overlapping edges as possible. Therefore this has a tendency for the nodes to be arranged in a way that conveys clusters \u2026but most importantly tends to be the easiest layout to interpret. There are alternatives such as the circular layout or random layout but these are harder to make sense of in my experience.", "There are two colour themes, light and dark.", "We can see quite easily how there are several well connected hashtags in the #happiness graph(hashtags that have more node connections). Smile, life, family, motivation, party\u2026these are all hashtags that are frequently mentioned across the network.", "As we can see, the force directed layout has a tendency to push groups of hashtags together that are well connected . If we plot the graph again but colour nodes using their community label we can better visualise how communities fall out.", "There seems to be three easily identifiable communities in the #happiness network. We can explore which specific hashtags contribute to each of the communities using sunburst visualisations. Click on the wheel to interact with the clusters.", "Community detection identified three clusters interpreted as:", "I hope you enjoyed this practical walk through on how to extract hashtag data from Instagram and analyse it using principles borrowed from Network Science.", "My main aims with this project were:", "I chose #happiness as a case study because hopefully this is something that we can all relate to. However the code works for any hashtag. As long as you can gather sufficient volumes of data to model \u2014 there are observable relationships for anything. You could consider brands, places, events and even people.", "You don\u2019t even need to use Instagram; the code can easily be repurposed to use all kinds of meta data beyond Instagram\u2026.Twitter, LinkedIn even TikTok could be a possibility.", "As I mentioned before, the code is available on my GitHub so please feel free to take, use, evolve and improve.
