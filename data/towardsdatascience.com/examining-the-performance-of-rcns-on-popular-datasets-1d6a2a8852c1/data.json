So, how good are those ideas that are inspired by neuroscience? In this article, we examine the performance of RCNs on different tasks along with an ablation study the authors made of the ideas they introduced. All of this article is based on the paper of RCNs [1] and its supplementary document unless otherwise stated.", "Note: All the figures and tables in this article are taken from [1].", "The first test of RCNs is on text-based CAPTCHAs which it handles neatly. 500 reCAPTCHA images were used to set the value of some hyperparameters including the font that the RCN was going to be trained on. Yes, the RCN wasn\u2019t actually trained on reCAPTCHA images directly but on single letters with 10 transformations done to them, as you can see in figure 1, yielding a training dataset of a total of 260 images. Remember that intermediate layers are still trained on SHREC 3D dataset and are not included in these numbers.", "This resulted in a model that provided answers to reCAPTCHA at an 84.2% success rate while human workers reached an accuracy of 87.4%. It is to be noted, however, that the answers are accepted if they produce a string with similar length to the ground truth and with 0 or 1 wrong characters. This success rate logically breaks text-based CAPTCHAs as, for example, you don\u2019t want a bot to create fake accounts on your website with this success rate. Whether the breaking of text-based CAPTCHAs is a feat or not is for another discussion, but the definite feat here is the data efficiency and the ability to generalize to unseen conditions as will become clearer in the remaining experiments.", "To see how it compares to ConvNets, the authors built a reCAPTCHA control set and built a ConvNet model based on a 2013 paper by the Street View and reCAPTCHA teams at Google [2]. The paper claimed to reach an accuracy of 99.8% on difficult examples but with a training set \u2018in the order of millions\u2019. Instead of millions, the RCN authors trained the ConvNet on 79,000 images and added residual connections since the paper is old. The ConvNet and the RCN of the previous paragraph scored comparably. However, on increasing the horizontal spacing between the characters in the test set, a spacing that wasn\u2019t in the training set but should make the letters clearer and easier to identify, the ConvNet\u2019s performance decreased dramatically while that of the RCN increased as you can see in table 1.", "To showcase the high data efficiency of RCNs, they tested it on the one-shot learning Omniglot challenge. The dataset consists of 20 symbols with each symbol having a single training image and a single test image. You can see that their results are still impressive in the 3-years progress report of the Omniglot challenge as shown in table 2 taken from that report [3]. In your assessment, you should take into consideration that RCNs haven\u2019t been refined throughout decades from different researchers, unlike ConvNets. It is to be noted that BPL isn\u2019t a general-purpose architecture like RCNs which is why it performs so good.", "Another important experiment done in the RCN paper is the test on noisy variants of MNIST. The experiment went as follows. They trained 3 models on clean images of the MNIST dataset: an RCN on 1,000 images, a CNN on 1,000 images, and a CNN on 60,000 images. Then, they tested the performance of each model on the MNIST test images but added 6 different types of noises on them with different intensities as you can see in table 3. The advantage of RCN in this test is clear from the numbers as it beats ConvNets consistently. But, I still want you to remember that RCNs are pretrained on 10K images of the SHREC 3D dataset.", "Additionally, the authors made an ablation study to see whether the lateral connections and the backward pass are useful or not. In this study, they tested the performance of an RCN on noiseless MNIST with different configurations as you can see in table 4. This test shows that for high data efficiency, all of the ideas in RCNs are quite useful.", "There are more experiments done by the authors including testing RCNs on the ICDAR challenge, on different CAPTCHA datasets, on reconstruction from noisy MNIST images, and classification of 3D objects. However, they won\u2019t be covered in this article, but I might include them in a follow-up article that will include a more critical analysis of RCNs and what we can learn from it.", "You might have a burning question of why RCNs aren\u2019t applied in real-life if they are data efficient. There are multiple reasons for that, but the two main reasons that even the authors acknowledge is that it isn\u2019t meant for large scale datasets and that it assumes that the background is a single thing and doesn\u2019t contain information. Here are these two reasons in the authors\u2019 own words:", "\u201c\u2026 because RCN stores prototypes of every training sample in its penultimate layer (for classification), scaling to very large datasets, like ImageNet and other object recognition benchmarks where CNNs (e.g. AlexNet) are state-of-the-art, may be intractable \u2026 \u201c", "\u201c In real images, the background context provides invaluable information about the objects that are potentially present in a scene. This information is currently ignored by RCN, which models only the foreground objects and ignores the context. On the other extreme, CNNs aggregate foreground and background information without distinction (such that it is possible to fool a CNN by showing an object out of context) \u201c", "Why write various articles on them then? Because those two cons aren\u2019t present in all datasets (think OCR of under-resourced languages) and because it is normal for ideas to have a lot of limitations in their start like Capsule Networks.", "That\u2019s all for this article. If you want to learn more about RCNs, you can check its paper [1] and the supplementary material document, or you can read my article talking about the structure of RCNs.", "[1] D. George, W.
