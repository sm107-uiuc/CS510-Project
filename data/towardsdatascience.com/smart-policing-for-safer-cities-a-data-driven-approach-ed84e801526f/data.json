With such a well-funded and well-staffed police department, one would expect San Francisco to be among the safest cities in the world.", "But with an overall crime rate that is 141% higher than the national average, San Francisco is more dangerous than 96% of the cities in the United States, making it truly one of the most dangerous places to work and live in (AreaVibes, n.d.).", "In recent years, voices on recruiting even more police officers have gotten louder and louder (Kreutz, 2019). This is a puzzling phenomenon because SFPD is more than amply staffed by any means, with one police officer for every 419 residents, as compared to Singapore\u2019s 614.", "In our project, we seek to identify the underlying problems and transform SFPD into a smart and modern police force, by researching and introducing best-in-class practices, powered by analytical and predictive techniques.", "We would start off by using Tableau, a data visualization software, to bring in fresh insights on the overall patterns and trends of the crimes happening in San Francisco, across locations, over time.", "Next, we would use the various available modules available in RStudio and data science techniques to construct two predictive models:", "Finally, we zoom in on the pertinent issue of crimes against juveniles and crimes committed by juveniles through Tableau visualizations, while also employing time-series forecasting techniques to predict future figures. The end goal: to deter future juvenile crimes.", "With this thorough analysis, we aim to provide valuable insights that will help the SFPD achieve their overarching goal of minimizing crimes and maintaining a safe environment for San Francisco\u2019s residents.", "Crime hurts: they cause fear and hatred that drive communities apart, they discourage domestic and foreign investments, they create uncertainty and inefficiency, along with a whole slew of socio-economic problems.", "Yet, crimes are a pertinent issue in modern society and governments are actively trying to keep crime rates low to promote the safety of their country and cities. Specifically, crime has always been a problem for San Francisco, especially when it was famous for housing notorious criminals in Alcatraz.", "With a crime rate of 64 per one thousand residents, San Francisco has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to other communities of various sizes \u2014 from the smallest towns to the very largest cities. One\u2019s chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime in San Francisco is 1-in-16, and within California alone, more than 99% of the communities have a lower crime rate (NeighbourhoodScout, n.d.). Additionally, the crime wave has only gotten more severe with the implementation of Proposition 47 (Sandberg, 2019), which in 2014 downgraded possession of illegal narcotics for personal use, and theft of anything under $950 in value from felonies to misdemeanors.", "In a 2011 Gallup poll, 38% of Americans said that they would be \u201cafraid to walk alone at night\u201d within a mile of their residence; this figure translates to more than 86 million adults. In the same poll, 47% said that they worry about their homes being burglarized, and 44% are worried about thefts of or from their motor vehicles. Corresponding figures for other crimes were: experiencing identity theft, 67%; getting mugged, 34%; getting attacked while driving your car, 19%; being sexually assaulted, 22% \u2014 including 37% of women; and getting murdered, 20% (Saylor, 2012). This situation is even more aggravated in San Francisco, with Street Behavior being ranked as the top concern among local residents, according to the 2018 Dignity Health CityBeat Poll.", "A victim of a crime may experience different kinds of effects, including physical effects like injuries, psychological effects like anger and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and economic effects like paying for medical expenses and time off from work. A study done on the effects of crime concluded that the emotional effects of victimization do not differ much when we compare victims of different types of crime, including non-violent and violent crimes (Shapland & Hall, 2007). This observation goes to show that crimes, no matter mild or serious, have an adverse effect on individuals.", "The implications of crime go beyond individuals and affect communities as a whole. In San Francisco, property and low-level crimes are aggravating the destruction of the retail market. With rampant theft and lack of security, landmark Mission District stores are closing (Brock, 2019), while mom-and-pop businesses find it hard to survive when wracked by constant thefts. The high crime rates and lack of security have also resulted in San Francisco being labelled as a non-viable market (Phillips, 2019), discouraging new businesses from setting up due to fear. Other possible implications include the rise of home insurance premiums and property prices being affected (BBC, n.d.).", "Against high crime rates, every individual, family, community, and organization is a victim.", "Based on the problems and implications mentioned above due to crime, our team has decided to focus on the 3 most important outcomes that the stakeholders such as the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) and the local government can achieve, by taking action on insights derived from an analysis of past crime history.", "Every year, the SFPD spends a significant portion of its budget on patrolling activities. Between 2017 and 2018, patrolling activities took up 58% of SFPD\u2019s budget, amounting to US$339.2 million (Campbell, 2018). From 2012 to 2016, the SFPD had seen a 49.3% increase in police calls for services, from 300,919 to 449,181 respectively. However, daily car patrols are understaffed or overstaffed based on the point in time for different districts, indicating non-optimal use of resources.", "In research commissioned by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, the response times for calls for service for some areas were found to be \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d. In districts like Mission and Southern, the median response time exceeded two hours: a caller reporting a suspicious person in a vehicle in the Mission district might wait 179 minutes (Barba, 2020), as compared to a median wait time of 30 minutes if the caller is in the Richmond district.", "We believe that by understanding the distributions of the incidents across San Francisco, manpower can be allocated more effectively \u2014 both within and across police departments \u2014 to enhance operations. To achieve this, we have decided to focus on the geographical location of the crimes and the time distribution of crimes.", "The SFPD has 10 districts within the city of San Francisco, and each district provides policing services for the catered zone by manpower allocated by the Field Operations Bureau. According to a Performance Audit Report (Campbell, 2018) prepared by the San Francisco Budget and Legislative Analyst, the SFPD\u2019s current practice (Appendix 1) to allocate police officers \u2014 such as tracking call volumes \u2014 does not fully reflect the actual workloads as it does not account for time spent by units in responding to the calls.", "Currently, the districts are facing problems of high response times for calls for service, which may be due to higher complex crime occurrences at different districts or distance required to travel. It is plausible to identify new insights that may improve efficiency of manpower allocation by understanding the location distribution of crime each district responds to.", "The SFPD currently utilizes a 10-hour shift and a 49-day rotation schedule for patrol officers assigned to the Police districts. However, this shift schedule creates wide discrepancies in the total number of officers that are actually available for a shift on any given day within a Police district. There could be overstaffing of car patrol officers at a certain shift, but an understaffing in another shift (Appendix 2). There could also be variations of staffing within the same shift across different districts (Appendix 3). More efficient staffing allocation can be achieved if we can identify which shift and what day of the week generally requires more staffing due to higher crime rates.", "The various types of crimes imply different states of mind in the criminal, and as a result, they have different variations of occurrence throughout the day (Kuang, 2011). Crimes of passion and crimes of opportunity often have different time frames of occurrences \u2014 Crimes of passion generally can happen throughout the day whereas crimes of opportunity occur at specific timings when the likelihood of being caught is lower. Knowing the different time occurrence of different crimes would allow SFPD to know which shifts to allocate more police officers in order to combat more serious crimes.", "Police patrol consists of proactive/preventive patrolling and reactive patrolling, both of them having very different characteristics. Preventive patrol purports to increase police presence in areas of expected crime in order to act as a deterrent. As mentioned earlier, the top concern in San Francisco is street activities. Such activities are typically carried out in public, can be easily spotted and thereby easily deterred if police officers appear at the right place at the right time.", "Currently, preventive patrol routes are determined a priori, based on theoretical street network usage (centrality measures) and historical crime data (Wu & Lum, 2017). Yet this approach fails to account for the following considerations:", "We hope that through analytics, we can help SFPD answer these three questions. This would allow them to plan more effective preventive patrolling routes.", "Crime Screening is usually handled by a Crime Manager or an equivalent decision-maker (British Transport Police, 2017). They allocate cases based on their priority which is determined by a scoring system. Research conducted by numerous police departments has demonstrated that scoring systems based on solvability successfully screen out cases with a low probability of being solved and identify promising cases (Dempsey & Forst, 2017).", "We hope that using analytics, we can provide additional input to enhance the measure of solvability for SFPD\u2019s current scoring systems. This allows them to maximize the investigators\u2019 time and effort and therefore crime resolution rates.", "As one of society\u2019s most vulnerable classes, special attention needs to be paid to the welfare of juveniles. It is often said that children are the building blocks of society, and how they turn out will determine the future of the country. Taking note of this, we have identified some important outcomes to be achieved relating to the categories of crimes against juveniles and crimes committed by juveniles.", "Crimes against minors typically come with heavy punishment, and with good reason. Together with the obvious physical and psychological harm that is caused, such crimes often result in the impaired development of victims\u2019 brain and nervous systems, higher rates of developing unhealthy, high-risk behavior, and heightened risk of becoming criminals themselves in the future (WHO, 2019).", "A study conducted by the United Nations concluded that the annual economic impact of physical, psychological and sexual violence against children (such as medical treatment, counselling and loss of productivity) adds up to US$124 billion on the low end, with an upper bound of up to US$585 billion (Pais, 2015). This is a considerable amount that cannot be understated, and thus a key goal should be to lower the prevalence of such crimes as much as possible in order to minimize the resulting negative social and economic costs to the city of San Francisco.", "The issue of reintegrating ex-convicts back into society has always been a pressing one for every country. As they are released, they face a multitude of challenges that actively deter them from being productive members of society, ranging from societal discrimination, inability to find a proper job, and inability to keep up with changes in technology, among many others. Without the ability to return to a normal lifestyle, they are thus pressured to turn back to crime to support themselves. This problem is further amplified for juvenile criminals, given that they are likely to miss out on school, and a normal childhood. Research has shown that the younger a child was at the time of their first criminal offense, the higher the recidivism rates are (Sentencing Advisory Council, 2016). Deterrence, in this case, is the most effective way to reduce juvenile crimes.", "While juveniles pay for crime by being incarcerated, taxpayers too bear some of the burden. Locking up a juvenile cost states up to $407.58 per person per day, and up to $148,767 per year (Sneed, 2014). This is a significant expenditure that can definitely be reduced through minimizing the crime rate so that the state can invest the cost savings into more productive areas.", "The primary dataset is obtained from the City and County of San Francisco website and contains Police Department Incident Reports (City and County of San Francisco, 2020) spanning from January 2003 to May 2018. There are 13 columns, with more than 2.21 million records:", "With 15 years\u2019 worth of crime classification data, a comprehensive analysis could be done to learn about the factors and variables that affect crime rates. With these insights, we will be able to suggest adequate measures to the relevant stakeholders, so that they can contain and deter future crimes. Low crime rates would ensure the safety of the residents and this would help in the social stability within the city of San Francisco.", "We will make use of visualization techniques to provide straightforward tools that the SFPD can easily adopt in their daily operations, with a gentle learning curve. These visualization dashboards can reflect live data and be adjusted according to the needs of the SFPD for greater understanding.", "To understand the general manpower demands of different districts, a basic crime density map (Figure 1) in San Francisco was generated, and areas with the most prevalent crime rates became evident \u2014 namely Northern, Southern and Central districts. These may show indicators of greater demand for police manpower.", "To gain greater insights on manpower usage, we generated a visualization (Figure 2 left) of crime locations that each district responds to. From the visualization, we can tell clear distinctions of the districts\u2019 cases; multiple exceptions were noted whereby the districts responded to cases beyond their respective zones \u2014 which may indicate non-optimal use of the district\u2019s manpower, or the lack of manpower in corresponding districts that require assistance from other districts.", "For instance, we can see that Bayview district (Figure 2 right) handled cases from almost all other districts in San Francisco, particularly so in the crime hot-zone in the North, South and Central districts. From this, it may be possible that the aforementioned districts may be lacking the necessary manpower to deal with the higher and more prevalent crime incidents. This may also translate to Bayview district being overstaffed and it might be more optimal to reallocate the excess manpower to those understaffed to optimize resources.", "The visualization technique will provide easy visualization of the crime incidents and categories at each district (Figure 3), allowing the ease of allocation of manpower within each district for greater use of its manpower and to address each category of crime more effectively.", "Notwithstanding the above, all categories of crime incidents the SFPD responded to can be visualized according to the respective districts that handled them (Figure 4), and this provides the SFPD Field Operations Bureau an overview of the crime situation for them to allocate the relevant manpower across the districts more effectively.", "For instance, violent crimes such as assault, robbery and forcible sexual offences may be crimes that have paramount impact, and efforts should be made to curb these crime incidents. This allows close monitoring of these \u201cred-flag\u201d crime incidents and the necessary responses and responders to tackle these issues, such as counsellors.", "To better aid our analysis, we classified the timings by time frames instead of the actual hours of the crime reported. This helps us in limiting the number of factors for analysis. Additionally, this is in line with the five current patrol staffing schedules adopted by SFPD where officers work 10-hour shifts.", "First, through a basic visualization (Figure 5) of the count of crimes in the five timeframes, we can see the variations of crimes throughout the day. The 1am shift has the least crime rates while the 4pm shift has the most. With crimes starting to peak from the 11am shift, SFPD can assign more staffing to the 11am shift so that the two timeframes (11am to 4pm and 4pm to 9pm) with the highest crime rates can be equipped with sufficient officers.", "Subsequently, we analyzed further and looked at more factors that can help in staffing allocation:", "Looking at the crime rates across the different time frames in the different police departments, it can be observed that the 4pm to 9pm time frame has the highest crime rates, which is consistent with the results generated earlier.", "The Southern police department has the highest rate of crime rates throughout all time frames amongst the police departments. Hence, it is important for the SFPD to ensure that the Southern police department is sufficiently staffed in order to combat crime. The SFPD can look into reassigning officers from districts with lesser crime rates like Park and Richmond to districts with more crimes in order to better utilize resources.", "Next, we looked at the distribution of the crime rates across the different days of the week (Figure 7). We can observe that there are no significant differences in the reported criminal cases across the different days of the week. The two days with slightly higher reported cases would be Wednesday and Friday.", "With the lack of disparities amongst the days, the SFPD should ensure that there is no under allocation of officers on any day. If there were to be overstaffing in other days of the week, SFPD can look into deploying officers over to shifts in these two days in order to maximize manpower.", "Finally, we further analyzed the data by looking into the distribution of serious crimes across the different time frames (Figure 8). California has been operating under the Three Strikes Sentencing system since 1994 (California Courts, n.d.). The Three Strikes law requires a defendant convicted of any new felony, having suffered one prior conviction of a serious felony to be sentenced to state prison for twice the term otherwise provided for the crime. To aid in our analysis, we would classify crimes that would be constituted (Sigal, 2011) as strikes under the Three Strikes Sentencing system as serious crimes.", "Based on the results, Assault, Drugs and Vehicle Thefts are the most prevalent serious crimes in San Francisco. The trend of the incidents within each category also follows the general trend observed earlier where crime rates would start peaking from 11am onwards and taper off after 1am.", "SFPD can ensure that for the 11am, 4pm and 9pm shifts, there are sufficient competent officers in order to attend to these cases. Research has shown that having more officers around can help in reducing the crime levels (Klick & Tabarrok, 2005). By stationing more officers during shifts with more serious crimes, potential offenders would be deterred from committing crimes for fear of getting caught.", "Police departments around the world are increasingly reliant on software like PredPol, which uses a machine learning algorithm to predict \u201chot spot\u201d crime neighborhoods \u2014 before the crimes occur (Huet, 2015). PredPol has offered police departments the ability to glean insight from enormous amounts of data quickly and cheaply. These insights can then be used to optimize officer patrol routes.", "When police forces have limited manpower, a tool like PredPol, which can quickly make data-informed recommendations about when and where to allocate that manpower, brings about a step-change in policing efficiency (Amina, 2018).", "In this part of our project, we have set out to predict the types of blue-collar crimes that are likely to occur across different neighborhoods in San Francisco at any given time, on any given day. Such insights would help the SFPD to optimize their patrolling decisions, and in the process, transform them from \u201cresponders\u201d of crime to \u201cpreventers\u201d of crime.", "We have chosen to predict blue collar crimes because these are often directly observable, and thus, can be most effectively deterred by police patrols. In contrast, white collar crimes like embezzlement are much harder to detect through patrols and more complex to deter.", "The predictive technique we have chosen is XGBoost, a Gradient Boosting Classifier, with built-in early stopping. In comparison to Random Forest, XGBoost also builds an ensemble of classification trees, but in a sequential manner, where new trees are trained using data which previous trees have performed poorly on.", "With built-in early stopping, we implemented a watchlist using trainset and testset. As the training commences, the evaluation metric, trainset mlogloss, will decrease over time. But once this metric starts to climb back up, an indicator of overfitting, we would end training and take the model with the lowest trainset mlogloss.", "We have used 6 predictor variables: day of week, police district, month, day of month, hour of day, and region id. Note that region id was absent from the original dataset. It was obtained when we decided to map San Francisco into a 10 X 10 grid, consisting of 100 regions. This mapping decision was made as studies show that crime tends to be geographically concentrated, but that these \u201chot spots\u201d are often dispersed throughout a city (Weisburd, 2018). Since San Francisco is 121.4 km2, each region will be approximately 1.21km2, a reasonable patrol area.", "Our predicted variable is crime category. This is a factor variable that includes 13 types of blue-collar crimes, such as assault, arson and robbery.", "Our final model is an ensemble of 1053 classification trees (81 iterations * 13 categories), with a trainset mlogloss of 1.527106. To measure model usefulness, we have the model predict the top 3 most likely crimes for each row of testing data, before comparing output to the actual category of crime that took place. 79.44% of the time, the predicted list contains the actual crime category.", "For the SFPD, this translates to the ability to predict the types of crimes that are likely to happen across different areas of San Francisco. With this information, they can better decide where and when to deploy their manpower so they can deter blue collar crimes most effectively. For example, if the top 3 most likely crimes for region 55 at 2pm tomorrow are all serious crimes, then the SFPD can schedule, in advance, a patrol in that region at that time tomorrow.", "For the police officer, this means less stressful and more productive hours. Patrolling can be both a physically and mentally strenuous activity for police officers, as it requires long hours of attention and alertness. Using our model, police officers can go on their patrols with confidence, knowing exactly the types of crime to prepare and look out for.", "To better understand how predictor variables contribute to our model, we made use of the xgb.plot.importance function to plot the top 5 most important variables (Figure 10):", "We noted how region, a more granular slicing of districts, is ranked as the most important.", "Additionally, upon further research, we found that District Tenderloin, the second most important variable in our plot, is dubbed by StreetAdvisor as \u201cthe most dangerous spot in SF\u201d, with rampant street-crimes. In a research that SFPD did on their own, out of the top 10 statistical areas in San Francisco for violent crimes, 7 are in Tenderloin.", "These findings confirm our earlier research on how crimes tend to be geographically concentrated. Furthermore, Month, Day and Hour are shown to be important here, meaning that different types of crimes tend to happen at different times, this further justifies the practicality and effectiveness of our model.", "According to a well-cited paper (Gill et al., 1996), crime allocation involves two principle decision making points in the \u2018career\u2019 of a crime complaint (Figure 11).", "With our dataset, we can predict its resolution probability based on the different details of the crime report. This allows us to adopt a statistical standpoint to gauge its solvability and can be part of the \u201cinput from other systems\u201d factor which can help influence the assessment of crime reports and consequently the allocation of cases.", "A quick exploration reveals many levels of the Resolution column and their count (Figure 12 left). We believe that for crime assessment, it is more important to know if it is solvable than it\u2019s specific resolution. Therefore, we preprocessed this column to a binomial solvable/not solvable (Figure 12 right).", "Since this is a binomial classification problem, we decide to proceed on with the following models to obtain these accuracy scores.", "We utilized the automatic 10-fold cross validation for CART and a 75/25 train-test split for the other models. We created our CART and XGBoost models by inputting all the predictor variables as they have an in-built feature selection algorithm. Unfortunately for logistic regression, we have to do so manually. Our 1st Logistic Regression model, which takes in all predictor variables, has a low test set accuracy of 47.3%.", "To improve this accuracy, we looked at the significant variables in Logistic Regression 1 and the variable importance feature in CART. Both models indicated that Descript, Category and PdDistrict are important variables. This makes sense as different types of cases and the police department district may have different solvability rates (Appendix 5).", "We proceeded to train the Logistic Regression 2 model and obtained a higher testset accuracy of 84.5%. Overall, our models have a mean testset prediction accuracy of around 85%, which indicates that these models are feasible.", "Using the 3 classification models, we are able to obtain the predicted probabilities of a case being solvable. From this, we can rank these cases based on their solvability, which can be used as an \u201cinput from other systems\u201d. SFPD can use this to streamline their assessment and allocation of cases \u2014 cases with higher solvability rates can be assigned to junior detectives while those with lower rates go to the more experienced officers. This can help generate efficacy in the utilization of the workforce and thus boost case resolution rates.", "We have listed 3 probabilities that SFPD can consider based on their objectives:", "A key limitation of our models will be the assumption that the data provided is accurate. The research paper stated that crime reports\u2019 \u201cworth can be undermined by their poor written quality\u201d even if they \u201care prepared according to specific standards\u201d.", "In conclusion, we hope that by predicting the solvability of crimes and obtaining the corresponding probabilities, we will help better the decision-making process in the allocation of crimes by providing a new input to this process. We are not looking to change the case allocation policies of SFPD.", "We subsetted and extracted two relevant portions from the dataset, one containing all the instances with juvenile victims, and the other containing all the instances with juvenile perpetrators. This was done by sieving out all the cases that contain \u201cJUVENILE\u201d and \u201cCHILD\u201d in the description, before allocating them into the correct datatable for analysis to be done.", "A quick visualization of both datasets on Tableau showed some important trends:", "There is an alarming upward trend of assault cases on juveniles since 2008 (Figure 14), with most of the descriptions of these cases being \u201cCHILD ABUSE\u201d. This tells us that the majority of the offenders in such cases are parents who fail to take proper care of their children, and more has to be done to ensure that households within San Francisco are safe.", "Sex offenses on juveniles make up the second greatest percentage of juvenile victim cases and is steadily rising. While kidnapping and suspicious activity occurrences generally fluctuate around a yearly mean of 70 and 45 respectively, family offenses which cover descriptions such as \u201cABANDONMENT/DESERTION OF CHILD\u201d and \u201cFAILURE TO PROVIDE FOR CHILD\u201d have seen a steady decline.", "Reference can be taken from the previous efforts to reduce family offenses as they proved to be successful in decreasing the numbers of such cases, be it through education of parents or television campaigns. Such measures could be implemented separately to target the increasing assault cases in a bid to decrease the yearly occurrences.", "Crimes committed by juvenile perpetrators are increasing at an astronomical rate (Figure 16). Due to the limitations in the dataset, we were not able to identify the type of crimes that were done under the \u201cSECONDARY CODES\u201d category. With more detailed data, the police department should be able to identify the underlying cause of the rapid rise of this category of crimes.", "Taking a more detailed look into the instances of crimes with juvenile perpetrators (Figure 17), a distinct pattern could be identified: the number of cases dip drastically in the middle and at the end of the year. This could be attributed to the American students\u2019 summer and winter breaks, where they get extended holidays of 9\u201310 weeks away from school (Karnes, 2019).", "If the absence from school really is the cause for the lower number of crimes committed, then more has to be done within the schools\u2019 ability to educate, and thus deter juveniles from committing such crimes.", "A time-series forecast was done to predict the number of crime cases involving juvenile victims and juvenile perpetrators. This month-to-month forecast will enable the stakeholders to be better prepared for a spike in cases due to seasonality trends. A train-test split was done such that all the data from 2003\u20132016 made up the trainset and will be used to forecast 2017\u2019s crime counts. The cases in 2017 were used as the testset, and the data from 2018 was left out as it was incomplete.", "The forecastHybrid package, which combines auto.arima(), ets(), thetaf(), nnetar(), stlm(), tbats(), and snaive() by using weights based on in-sample errors, was used to create the model that best fits any dataset (Shaub & Ellis, 2020).", "The first model (Figure 18) was done for all the cases within the dataset, without subsetting.", "With the blue-highlighted portion being the forecasted values, the testset RMSE is 479, which represents only 3.7% of the mean number of cases in 2017 (12,898).", "The second model (Figure 19) was done for juvenile victims. The testset RMSE was 9.5 and the mean number of such cases in 2017 was 55.3.", "The third and final model (Figure 20) was done for juvenile perpetrators. The testset RMSE was 14.2 and the mean number of such cases in 2017 was 52.4.", "With these rolling-monthly-forecasting models and a better understanding of the types of crimes that juveniles are involved in through visualization, the San Francisco Police Department can better prepare for the cases as they come by. As most of the juvenile perpetrator cases occur during the school term, schools can be better equipped to deal with these crimes, while also stepping up their crime-prevention syllabus to educate the young as a form of deterrence. The effectiveness of these measures can be evaluated by the total cost the state has to incur at the end of each year, and this acts as an indication of the usefulness of analytics in helping to solve these problems.", "We understand that our current dataset only accounts for crimes up to May 2018. Since crime patterns change over time, there is a requirement to retrain our models in order to keep them relevant. One possible solution is to implement a recurrent neural network to take into account temporal changes. Also, we can easily visualize these crimes on the dashboards by reuploading the newer datasets to Tableau.", "Besides the factors that are available in the dataset, there could be other variables that can help in predicting crime. During our initial exploration, we text mined the addresses of crime occurrences for the presence of \u201cBlock\u201d. Hence, whether the crime occurred at a Block could be another variable that we could input into our models. Another factor could be weather (Glorfeld, 2018). A research that was done in Chicago had shown that cases of aggravated assaults and batteries increased when the weather was warmer than average. Based on our initial exploration of data (Appendix 6), Block had a significant impact on predicting the category of crime. Factoring in more variables would allow our models to be more comprehensive. This would empower the SFPD with information to be more effective in preventing and solving crimes.", "The proposed solutions may lead to the prioritization of certain categories over others, based on the respective outputs/results from the predictive models. This may pose ethical concerns over how the police departments should handle their cases, whereby there exists no one benchmark to prioritize an incident over another, particularly so for violent crimes. This is a paramount concern given that police officers are civil servants sworn to protect its people, and their ethical conduct will greatly impact public trust (Fitch, 2011). One possible solution will be to establish a protocol to explicitly demarcate scenarios where one case is deemed to be more \u2018important\u2019 than the other, so that police officers will have a set of rules to adhere to establish priorities \u2014 beyond the models\u2019 predictions.", "In our project, we have focused on optimizing manpower scheduling, crime prevention through proactive patrolling, and allocation of investigation duties. Additionally, we have also given special attention to juveniles, one of society\u2019s most vulnerable classes, by identifying the important outcome to be achieved when it comes to prevention of juvenile-related crimes.", "History, wealth and panache, San Francisco is a truly world-class city. We are confident that with our contextualized insights and predictive models, we can transform the SFPD into a world-leading police force and turn San Francisco into a safe and enjoyable place for all her residents to live, work and play in!", "BBC.
