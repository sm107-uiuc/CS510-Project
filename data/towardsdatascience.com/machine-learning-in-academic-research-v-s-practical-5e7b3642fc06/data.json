As a PhD graduate, I came from the academic aspect of this area. However, since I started trying to apply my \u201cknowledge\u201d in practice, I found that there is a considerable amount of difference between building an ML model to solve a business problem and writing a paper.", "Academic research usually focuses on the theory only. We used to try to improve the precision of a model by a fraction. Even if we made only a small step in a specific topic, it does not prevent us from writing an excellent academic paper and publishes it.", "Practically, it is not enough to focus on a single aspect of machine learning for an industry-based project. We usually need to solve the problem in certain steps, which is shown as follows based on my past experiences:", "Therefore, these common phrases below are critical for a typical industrial ML project:", "In this article, I will introduce these phases in the rest sections, and present the reasons why these steps are necessary to solve a practical problem and what are the differences between academic research and industrial project in terms of them.", "Before we can start to solve a problem, we need to model the problem, because practical problems are usually complicated. It is one of the significant differences between practice and academic research. While we are focusing on the theory for academic research, it is common to use some public datasets. This could save our time and budget in terms of collecting data, as well as enable us to start from the same baseline of other similar research which facilitates the evaluation later on.", "Problem modelling starts with information gathering in order to understand it, and then abstracts the problem into something predictable.", "Specific steps we need to do for problem modelling", "As far as I am concerned, there are a lot of data scientists and machine learning engineers who usually start with Feature Engineering for an ML problem, which is not considered an appropriate process.", "There are many reasons why the problem modelling should not be ignored, but I found that the following two sub-steps are the major ones.", "There are so many types of evaluation methods, such as confusion matrix, ROC/AUC, MAE and MSE. In an academic research project, it is common to select anyone that makes sense, and the most important is that your algorithm shows the best results under these metrics compare with the others. This is actually not embarrassing to say, because I believe all the researchers want to emphasise the improvements that they have made, although they may also want to show some limitations in the \u201cfuture works\u201d section. Generally, this is how evaluation metrics are utilised in academic research, to emphasise the contributions.", "When it comes to the industry, it will be dangerous to evaluate your model in this way. You may show your boss how the model is advanced under specific evaluation metrics. However, if you do not choose an appropriate method that is best suited to the problem, the model may end up with very effective in experiments (when you show it off to your boss) but not in practice (production usage). Imagine that if your model is to classify patients to determine whether they have got a disease, it could result in massive impacts or even life-threatening outcomes if the model does not work well practically.", "Therefore, we need to select evaluation metrics that can best reflect the problem space, as well as can produce the most similar fluctuations with the original dataset. Choosing a correct metric can make sure you have an appropriate way to evaluate your model against not only your test dataset but also your practical usage. Also, it will dramatically improve the efficiency of the ML model iterations.", "In academic research, most of the time, the small sample dataset will not be an issue unless your research topic is on training a good model using limited samples. However, it is quite common in practice to only have a small sample size. It could be because your information system has had a cold start or your business does not have too many users yet, or simply caused by some restrictions such as privacy policies that do not allow you to have enough samples.", "Suppose we have only 100 entries in our sample dataset, two different models were trained based on this dataset. Model A has 98% accuracy, while model B has 92% accuracy. Can we simply say that model A is \u201cbetter\u201d than model B? The answer is NO.", "The sample dataset is too small, so it is not confident enough to determine which model is more advanced than the other. Cross-validation is one of the techniques to increase this confidence. The most common method is Hold-Out, which splits the sample dataset into a training set and a testing set. There are also some other methods such as K-fold cross-validation and bootstrap Sampling. These cross-validation techniques help your model to be closer to practical usage with a relatively smaller sample dataset.", "If your academic research topic is not about feature engineering, you probably won\u2019t be bothered by this. You may download a public dataset such as MovieLens, etc. Then, train a model using your algorithm and compare it with the models that are trained utilising other algorithms on the same dataset to show how your algorithm is advance. However, feature engineering is always necessary for an industrial ML project, because the dataset that is gathered will be unique to your business and most of the time cannot even be directly utilised to train a useable model.", "For example, a manufacturing plant may have 100+ sensors that are related to a piece of equipment, and you are asked to train a model to predict when the equipment is going to have anomalies. You may found that there might be only 20 sensors that contribute to the \u201canomalies\u201d during the feature engineering phase. Also, some sensors might not work on their own. It has to be transformed together with other sensors to be correlated to the \u201canomalies\u201d of this equipment. So, it is almost impossible to have an original dataset ready for use in practice. Feature engineering is compulsory for most projects in order to find meaningful features before the model can be trained well.", "Often, there are various factors that machine learning engineers need to apply different principles and methods to perform the feature engineering tasks, such as different models were selected in the problem modelling phase or the business logic itself.", "Therefore, after we finished problem modelling, data filtering and cleansing, it is time to start feature engineering. This is a crucial but difficult task, which usually relies on experiences on ML as well as a thorough understanding of the domain knowledge. It is not exaggerated to say that most of the successful machine learning projects have excellent feature engineering.", "Although feature engineering is important, it is still not the only factor contributing to a successful industrial machine learning model. That is, selecting different models could result in entirely different predictive results. In other words, if the model we chose for the problem is inappropriate, it might be extremely inefficient to iterate the model to become practical, or most likely, never have a useful model.", "This would be rarely bothered me in academic research because most of the time, we will analyse a specific type of ML model. We may even look for an appropriate dataset to make sure it is better suited to the model, rather than the other way around. However, in an industrial ML project, we are solving a particular problem so that we cannot choose the dataset. So, we can only select models for the dataset which is provided.", "We should select different models in different scenarios. For example, the logistic regression may be suitable for a boolean type predictive target, the random forest is usually appropriate for some classification problems, and deep learning is often the best one for image/voice recognition.", "Therefore, after a series of feature engineering tasks, we also need to consider which type of models can learn the latent patterns from the features with the best potential outcome. It is no doubt that choosing an appropriate model need to have a deep understanding of most of the popular models and great industry-based experiences.", "Similarly, unless your research topic is about models assembly, then you will not worry about it. However, when it comes to an industry project, you would find it quite effective to assemble different models for an ML problem.", "As mentioned in the Model Selection section, we need to select an appropriate model that is best suited to the problem. However, it is also because different models have their strengths to capture different types of latent patterns from the features. Most of the time, we need to assemble multiple models to have a more optimal model.", "There are various assembling methods of ML models, such as Weighting, Voting, Bagging and Stacking. Similar to model selecting, model assembling also relies on a deep understanding of the models and the personal experiences of the data scientist to optimise the assembled model.", "In summary, there are obvious differences between academic research and industry-based projects with regards to how to utilise machine learning models.", "For academic research, we usually focus on only one aspect of machine learning and try our best to improve this single aspect. With the other aspects that are not concerned in our research paper, we may put zero or only little effort into them.", "For an industry-based machine learning project, don\u2019t be trapped if you come from an academic background. That is, don\u2019t focus on only a single aspect, but follow the typical phases to model the problem, perform feature engineering, select suitable models and assembling for optimising.", "Let\u2019s build PRACTICAL machine learning models!", "If you feel my articles are helpful, please consider joining Medium Membership to support me and thousands of other writers!
