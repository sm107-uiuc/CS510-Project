I also give some notes about data science interviews!", "If you\u2019re reading this, then you\u2019re most likely going through the grind of preparing for technical interviews (software engineers, data scientists, etc).", "By now you should know that tech interviews are not like regular \u2018old school\u2019 interviews \u2014 we can\u2019t just woo the hiring manager with our charm and talk out of our ass \u2014 we actually have to perform!", "While these jobs are in high demand, the rejection rate for applicants is high, and that\u2019s even if you can get past the initial screening steps to get to the on-site interview.", "The thing is, if you can make it to an on-site interview, that means the company actually WANTS to hire you \u2014 you now just have to make their decision justified. So if the hiring managers want you to succeed, how come so many candidates fail the final on-site interview round?", "I believe that a lot of people who get to on-sites actually do know their stuff and would probably be great employees\u00b9, they just aren\u2019t prepared for the performance that is the on-site interview (that\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve used that word now\u2026).", "What\u2019s another industry who\u2019s hiring process requires multiple pre-screenings and a strenuous \u2018on-site\u2019 performance?", "More specifically, the professional orchestral music industry.", "The main difference in the hiring process between tech companies and orchestras is that orchestral positions are significantly more competitive and often have tens of extremely talented and qualified instrumentalists fighting for one position in the orchestra.", "In tech, there are so many positions up for grabs and hiring managers desperately want them filled! They don\u2019t waste time by offering on-site interviews to people who aren\u2019t qualified or tick the minimum boxes \u2014 so if you get an on-site, they now just want to see how you perform \u2018on the job\u2019.", "This is a process also known as auditioning.", "I think tech candidates need to start thinking about technical on-sites as auditions rather than interviews.", "With this in mind, I\u2019m going to share some practice principles that professional musicians use to prepare for their auditions and performances and I believe we could\u00b2 approach our technical auditions with the same spirit.", "One thing that makes studying for these interviews particularly tough, is that there are so \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb many \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb topics \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb to cover \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb. It can be overwhelming, to say the least.", "This issue has been identified and addressed to some degree with excellent resources like LeetCode, HackerRank, Interview Query and the many, many other online coding sites and books. This is great, and really helps address the \u2018what\u2019 to study portion. However, how do you know your study plan is effective and will actually get the results you want?", "Preparing for these interviews is more than just being \u2018good at your job\u2019. I\u2019ve seen seasoned professionals (who really are great at what they do) get rejected after on-site interviews.", "The tech interview is a whole game of its own, requiring its own skillset different from the job itself.", "I realised the need for a more structured study approach to these interviews when I saw the plethora of tech YouTubers and bloggers sharing their tech interview experiences. The biggest take-away I heard over and over again was", "\u2018It\u2019s hard, you\u2019ll get about 20 rejections before you get a job offer, but just keep practicing.\u2019", "That just simply didn\u2019t sit right with me.", "If you\u2019re getting rejection after rejection\u00b3, that means you\u2019re doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result (i.e. the definition of insanity).", "I noticed the advice from a lot of these \u2018tech gurus\u2019 was", "\u2018Just do as many problems as possible, just do them all, and do really hard ones and if you keep getting stuff wrong then just do easy ones so that you keep your confidence up, but just keep doing new problems every day!!! You\u2019ll eventually get it! Have faith!\u2019", "And then you have the ones who just try to overwhelm you with their incredible intelligence (vomit) and make everything seem 100 times more complicated than it actually is just to make themselves look smarter...", "All-in-all, I realised there was no structured advice or suggestions as to how to tackle technical interview preparation other than \u2018just practice\u2019.", "Before becoming a data scientist, I had a successful career as a professional pianist and music educator. In the professional music world, there is an intense focus on mastery. No one wants to just be \u2018good\u2019, they want to obtain mastery of their instrument. Thus, musicians spend a huge amount of time refining their practice habits to be as efficient as possible to achieve expertise in their field.", "During my music career, I became fascinated with pedagogy and understanding how experts become experts. There is a huge amount of literature on this, but I will not bore you with the details here!", "The study plans I create are designed to implement a process called \u2018deliberate practice\u2019. It\u2019s a technique I learned over my music career and imposed in my own practice as well as my students\u2019 practice routines.", "The man who formalised this area of study is Dr Anders Ericsson\u2074, and he details most of his work in his book Peak (which is one of my favourite books \u2014 highly recommend).", "I want to point out that this whole idea is based on \u2018mastery\u2019 and becoming an expert at something. This is usually applied to professions such as professional athletes, musicians, fighter-pilots, chess players etc. who are wanting to excel and become masters in their respective fields.", "But, this can actually apply to any context you want to get better at \u2014 you can apply these principles to becoming an expert at making the perfect cup of coffee, folding your clothes, picking your nose\u2026", "In this context, our objective is becoming an expert at the technical interview. However, by default, you will also excel at your job as a whole, just by the nature of the process.", "In Part II of this blog series, I\u2019ll dive deep into the specifics of deliberate practice and in Part III, I\u2019ll provide some ideas of how to structure a study plan for the technical audition.", "\u00b9Of course there are always exceptions to this \u2014 one main exception being that not every candidate is a good cultural fit, which a lot of companies value very highly. Let me also add though that you can apply deliberate practice to prepare for your culture fit interview as well, but I do believe that this should be backed by genuine motivation to want to work for the company and belief in the company\u2019s values.", "\u00b3I am making the assumption here that you are otherwise qualified for the job. I\u2019m not talking about being rejected for a job where you don\u2019t have the educational or experience minimum required.", "\u2074You might be familiar with the \u201810,000 hour rule\u2019, made famous by Malcolm Gladwell. Well, Andres Ericsson was actually the one who produced the research on the magical 10,000 hours to expertise, but Gladwell made money off it by turning it into a buzz phrase and failed to acknowledge the importance of Ericsson\u2019s findings. Ericsson stresses the fact that mastery or expertise is achieved after 10,000 hours of deliberate practice in a given field. This cannot be stressed enough. In fact, Ericsson calls out Gladwell\u2019s conclusions of his work \u201c\u2026 a popularised but simplistic view of our work \u2026 which suggests that anyone who has accumulated a sufficient number of hours of practice in a given domain will automatically become an expert and a champion.\u201d", "Your home for data science.
