I\u2019ve decided to brush up my visualisation skills by playing around with some fun data. In this article you will find:", "I will uncover the relationship between views, ratings, deaths per episode and epic Battles! Spoiler alert: If you think you know what large audiences like, think again!", "The first dataset used to collect the ratings and views per episode can be found in Kaggle here.", "The second dataset I used summarises the deaths per episode and can be found on Data World here.", "Further information on how I joined these two dataframes according to season and episode can be found further down.", "The first thing I wanted to be able to visualise was the rating per episode, and its evolution across seasons. For this, I used a Seaborn heatmap.", "We can clearly see that Game of Thrones has excellent ratings for the first seven seasons, with visible higher ratings for the final episodes of each season. A considerable drop occurs when we reach season 8. I don\u2019t like criticising\u2026 But here\u2019s a couple of reasons that could have contributed to the poor ratings\u2026", "Let\u2019s take a look by plotting a bar plot of views per seasons. This bar plot was used using plotly express. Here is a step-by-step tutorial of how to use this recently updated new library.", "Bar plots are extremely effective when trying to visualise categorical data that has less than 10 categories. With more than this, the plot will be cluttered and hard to understand. I prefer using bar plots when dealing with categorical data because we can easily visualise the difference between categories by simply looking at the size of the bar. Additionally we can divide the categories by colour.", "There is a clear linear increase of views starting at 2.3 million in season 1 and 12 million in season 8. This explains why the budget escalated from 6million USD in the first season to 15million per episode in the final season. Unfortunately the hypothesis I had formulated is proven to be wrong as the season with the worst ratings has the most views!", "One of my hypothesis, was that episodes with more action, would translate into more views and it would receive higher ratings from the public. To visualise this relationship, I decided to implement a scatter plot that correlated the number of views and the ratings.", "Scatter plots are great for showing the relationship between multiple variables since we can see the distribution of the raw data. By colour coding the groups we can view the relationship for different groups of data. To visualise three variables, we create another parameter like point size, or colour for example.", "The first thing I did was merge the two dataframes (views and deaths). I created a common column encoding the Season and Episode. The result takes this format (1, 2) for Season 1, Episode 2 for example.", "Using the groupby function I sort by episode and keep the columns \u2018views\u2019, \u2018Rating\u2019 and \u2018Death Count\u2019 in store.", "Each circle on the plot represents an episode in the series. The size and colour are linearly related to the number of significant deaths in the episode. The information provided by this visualisation did not lead to any conclusive results. The content of the episode must strongly influence the ratings, and not just the deaths! This is what I will look into in the next section.", "My second hypothesis is that audiences LOVE battles. Who doesn\u2019t enjoy men and women in shiny armours fighting for their loved ones. Let\u2019s see if this can be corroborated with data.", "I couldn\u2019t find a dataset containing the main battles of the series. I decided to create one manually, this took about 8 minutes using the following website.", "I merged the \u2018Battles\u2019 dataframe with the dataframe containing views and ratings. I decided to keep the scatter plot visualisation, but added a marker for each episode containing a battle.", "Crystal clear, isn\u2019t it? Ratings are consistently higher for episodes with Battles. The only exception remains the final season episodes which rank lower, this can be seen due to the colour of each point corresponding to the season.", "If you like my work, I\u2019d greatly appreciate if you followed me Medium here.", "If you have any questions, suggestions or ideas on how to improve, please leave a comment below or get in touch through LinkedIn here.", "All the code can be found in the GameofThrones.py file on Github here!", "Your home for data science.
