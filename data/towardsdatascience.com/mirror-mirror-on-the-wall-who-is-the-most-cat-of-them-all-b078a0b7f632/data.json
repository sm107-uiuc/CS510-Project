Usually, the process of training a neural network goes something like this:", "To train such a neural network, we require lots of training data. Each item in the training data consists of an image and a label (which tells us what object is shown on the image).", "The network is shown the image and produces some output (red box). This output is compared against the expected result (green box). Given \u201chow wrong\u201d the network was, it is updated to do better next time.", "The output of the neural network is a list of numbers. The length of the list is equal to the number of different objects the network can detect (2 in the image above). Each number in that list corresponds to the probability that this object is present in the current image.", "We have seen how neural networks are trained to work for image classification. But what exactly has it learned?", "There is an excellent blog post that describes a way to visualize just what the individual parts of the neural networks have learned:", "Extending the idea of this article, we can use the network to generate an image that yields the highest confidence in a specific class. For example: \u201cGenerate an image for which you are most confident that it\u2019s a cat.\u201d", "The image below shows the slight change in the training process that needs to be done to achieve this:", "Instead of starting with a random network, we start with a random image. The expected result is the one that assigns 100% confidence to the class that we want to visualize.", "The initially random image is then updated to fit this expected result a bit more. Running this procedure for a couple of times (hopefully) reveals what the network thinks a cat looks like.", "For this experiment, I used a neural network that was pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. This datasets consists of more than 14 million images, each belonging to one of 1000 classes.", "I was able to get the visualization procedure running on GoogleColab. If you need help doing your own DeepLearning experiments on Colab, here is a blog post giving a detailed walkthrough on how to set up your environment:", "My implementation heavily relies on this this notebook:", "Now that everything is set up, I started the experiment. Generating one image for each of the 1000 different classes in imagenet took a couple of hours, but thankfully GoogleColab held up and didn\u2019t crash.", "Most of the generated images are not very interesting. I sifted through the whole stack (yes, through all 1000 images\u2026.) and picked the best ones.", "Below are my top picks, roughly sorted into categories. Enjoy!", "(If you don\u2019t have time for all the pictures, scroll to the bottom. The very best of is down there)", "These images typically show multiple occurences of one object, stacked on top of each other.", "These images typically not only show the object from which they were generated, but also some sort of surrounding scene.", "Ah yes, animals.
