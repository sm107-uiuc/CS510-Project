We need to recalibrate the algorithm to get more defenders, but for the sake of time I will just post the current team selection to give you guys an idea of which players might be a good investment in the long run if they keep getting close to 90mins of playtime.", "Below are the TOP 10 Players per position for the pts_per_90min Stat. Some interesting names are starting to pop-up here to discover players, who didn\u2019t get a lot of minutes during GW1-GW2, but have started to pick up playtime over the last few weeks \u2014 Adrian from the GKs, Calumn Chambers, Joel Matip, Arthur Masuaku from the DFs, Kevin DeBruyne, Alex Iowbi and Harry Wilson from the MDs, and Sergio Aguero, Tammy Abraham and Jordan Ayew from the STs. We might decide to invest in some of these players this GW even if their ROI is not up there yet because of not enough playtime, assuming that these players will be getting close to 90min of playtime most games in the future.", "Again we did better than average last week, but not much better than that with 61 total points. I was considering making Abraham captain instead of Sterling, which would have been a good move, but alas\u2026we all know the agonizing pain of \u201ccould have, should have\u201d in the EPL Fantasy way to well :)", "First we will look at the FDR_score(next 3 opponents difficulty) to decide which teams we might want to exclude picking players from:", "Because of high average opponent strength over the next three games, our algorithm will not be selecting players from the following teams \u2014 Watford, Leicester, Sheffield Utd, and Norwich (Sorry Pukki fans :P ). Good teams that seem to have a relatively easy schedule for the next three games are \u2014 Man City and Burnley.", "Next we will look at who the Top 10 ROI players are by position:", "Reminder that our algorithm takes in adjusted budget per team formation and tries to maximize spend per position for the main 11 players, and then get you subs which are good ROI value. This week we will be playing a 4\u20133\u20134 formation. Based on current ROI scores, filtering out any team with AVG opponent difficulty (FDR \u2265 3.56) over next three games and removing injured players from the list of available picks, our algorithm picked the team below as currently optimal for spending the full $100MM budget:", "Not a bad looking configuration at all, given that Man City have a pretty easy schedule coming up. We considered playing our wildcard, but we usually don\u2019t like to play that too early in the season and especially after international teams break, because sometimes coaches give rest to major players that might come back tired or with minor injuries.", "That being said below is our team for this coming week:", "Ended up spending 8pts to get Adrian, De Bruyne and Ayew, but we think it\u2019s worth it in the long run given Adrian\u2019s cheap price and Man City\u2019s easy schedule. We really wanted to get Aguero as well, but only a full remake of the team, including wildcard use would have allowed that.", "Looking at Best / Worst defense and offense can be used in a few different ways \u2014 for example if a best offense team is playing a worst defense team, you might want to captain your attacking mid or striker. Also, you might want to give preference to DF and GK from the best defensive teams when looking at the algorithmic recommendations for these positions.", "Below you can see the teams, sorted by cumulative player ROI. Note that an active player is any player that has played at least 25% of the total possible game time. For example, total possible minutes = num_weeks * 90 mins = 4 * 90 = 360. So, we are counting any player that has played a total of at least 90 minutes as active on that team.", "As a whole team Chelsea, Spurs and Bournemouth are underperforming from expectation from last season and on average they players seem to be overpriced. City, Liverpool, Leicester, Everton, and Man Utd seem to be well-priced so far according to current performance. Burnley and and Wolves also are up there in terms of avg_player_roi because of the cheaper cost of their players.", "First time we spent 8pts for 3 transfers, so curious to see if they will pay off in the next 2\u20133 weeks. Keeping our fingers crossed for more clean sheets by Adrian and lots of action coming from Kevin DeBruyne. Hopefully Ayew squeezes in a goal or assist here and there.", "As always \u2014 thank you for reading and good luck this weekend!", "Your home for data science.
