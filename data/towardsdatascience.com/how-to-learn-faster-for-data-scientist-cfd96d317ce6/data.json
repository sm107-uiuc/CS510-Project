This rate varies for different people, however the process of learning is quite similar of which you can learn more about in the link below.", "The familiar saying of \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility\u201d does not quite capture the fact that we yield extreme power within us. However, when we flip this saying on its head it states that power can be found when we have taken responsibility. Great responsibility for what you ask? What we focus on, the meaning of things, our mistakes, our accountability. Our present results are a manifestation of our past decisions and to ensure we achieve our desired results in the future we ought to take responsibility of the present moment.", "\u201cWith great responsibility comes great power\u201d \u2014 Jim Kwik", "If you want to be a better learner, think FAST.", "Babies are super learners! I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have my 1 year old niece (as of writing) that I can observe, so there is no need for a thought experiment. I\u2019ve seen her go from being carried everywhere, to crawling, to standing, to static dancing, to walking, to dynamic dancing, to climbing stairs, to opening doors and now speaking 3 words \u2014 \u201cdisgusting\u201d, \u201cyucky\u201d, and \u201cuh-oh\u201d. Hence, much of my examples may be in relation to my observation of my niece. Nevertheless, this will not stop us from doing a simple form of transfer learning to apply these examples to Data Science.", "There are 3 things that we ought to forget for us to become better learners, and for those of us that are married in our community\u2026 No, your Wife is not one of them. In no particular order:", "When we are young we are total sponges. The earth is our science lab. Let\u2019s imagine if my niece had it lodged in her psyche that she already knew how to walk the moment she was born \u2014 some disaster that would be. Her bones would instantly fail her because she quite simply does not have the facilities for that.", "Yet, this is what we do! When we feel as though we already know something, it\u2019s easier to gloss over that information when we review it. To become a better learn, we must forget what we already know.", "How much faster would I of understood a inner-workings of a deep neural network if I took the time to get to grips with Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.", "\u201cYour mind is like a parachute; It only works when it\u2019s open\u201d", "#2 - What is not Urgent", "I dare you to speak to my niece whilst she is watching Mr Tumble on CBeebies.

Unfortunately, I am apart of the significantly larger portion of people that is not so lucky in this department. But, if you are in this group of people note that this is not our flaw, it is our power. When we are thinking about multiple things our mind is literally all over the place, flicking attention between task. Alternatively, when we focus on one task and forget all others we enter into an extremely delicate place called the present.", "If you remember from the prelude, it is what we do in this place that will determine the results we achieve in the future.", "\u201cWhen we forget what is not urgent, we provide ourselves with an opportunity to achieve better results in the future by entering the present.\u201d \u2014 Kurtis Pykes ;)", "My niece fell over after her first two steps and not for one minute did I think she thought walking is not for her because she stood straight up and tried again.", "Here are some limiting beliefs I\u2019ve heard from beginning Data Scientist \u2014 feel free to add your own if you\u2019ve heard some interesting ones:", "These statements may be facts, however it is not true that these reasons are what is stopping you from becoming a Data Scientist \u2014 it is your beliefs.", "\u201cIf you fight for your limitations, you get to keep them\u201d \u2014 Jim Kwik", "I wouldn\u2019t call myself an academic.
