According to this post on Quora, the most painful part is the data: because it\u2019s incomplete or unreliable.", "When you scroll down, another response is that it\u2019s hard to persuade business leaders to buy into the work of a data scientist.", "Responses on YCombinator\u2019s hacker news point in a similar direction. For one respondent, the biggest pain is dealing with people who don\u2019t respect statistics and data science. For another, it\u2019s awful when people ask them for simple black-and-white answers to complex questions.", "Art is like a pain reliever. Don\u2019t believe me? Read on.", "If you believe me already, you\u2019ll find everything in a nutshell at the end of this article.", "So you have missing or incomplete data. What\u2019s going on in your mind right now?", "You\u2019re probably thinking about creating interpolations or extrapolations to make this whole thing work. And you\u2019re worried that your beautiful conclusions will be rejected because, for any non-Data-Scientist, it\u2019s built upon speculation.", "Stop worrying. Now. Humans are not as prone to logical thinking as you believe. At least, those humans that are not Data Scientists.", "You know that interpolation and extrapolation are not a flaw and certainly not mere speculation. But other people don\u2019t know that. So you need to convince them in other ways.", "Make your data beautiful. More importantly, make your results beautiful!", "Most Data Scientists come from computer science or related backgrounds. They\u2019ve learned how to talk to machines, but not how to convince humans. The good news is that there are plenty of tools to help.", "You\u2019ll be surprised at just how much more people \u2014 even pretty rational people \u2014 will appreciate your results if you pimp them with some colors and shapes in the right places.", "Many Data Scientists cite inconsistent and unreliable data as a pain because it\u2019s so time-consuming. Once the first wave of enthusiasm about your job is gone, you\u2019ll feel more like a janitor and a lot less like a scientist.", "Are you disappointed? Think about all your previous job roles and how flashy (or not) they sounded. Then think about all the dirty work that was hiding behind that flashy job title.", "Art is one of the fields where the discrepancy between flashy outsides and grim insides is omnipresent.", "Think of your top five artists \u2014 be it in music, painting, literature or any other area. I bet you that quite a large number of these have faced adversities that were way worse than anything you\u2019ve ever experienced.", "Sure, most of these artists have made it big. They\u2019ve had some terrible experiences in life, but now they\u2019re well-known for their art, and they live a lavish life. While you\u2019re still cleaning data.", "Now think of the artists that you may personally know, that might not have made it big yet. The truth is that for every artist that has made it big, there are 1,000 artists in the underground that will never make it.", "Artists who create amazing things that nobody will ever see. That nobody will ever listen to. Whose work, however brilliant, will fade in the ether of time. Whose names will be just another entry on the long list of the graveyard of starving artists.", "Now, look at yourself. Your job as a data janitor isn\u2019t exactly inspiring. Your clients aren\u2019t even grateful for your dirty deeds. But at the end of the day, this might help you build models that will bring insights for your clients. And if they don\u2019t, at least you\u2019re getting paid.", "Unlike the millions of artists who create inspiring work every day that will never inspire anyone. Because nobody will see it.", "Think about that the next time you complain about data cleaning.", "This is a pain that almost every Data Scientist will encounter sometime in their career. A client will give you a heap of complex data and ask you to produce answers in a simple black-and-white fashion.", "As a scientist, it\u2019s against your ethos to oversimplify. So how will you produce a simple answer?", "Think about that again. Does the client really want a simple answer? No. The client wants an answer that he can understand.", "So your job is not to oversimplify your results. Your job is to make them understandable. That\u2019s where you ask an artist.", "You can look at a painting or listen to a song without previous knowledge and still make a connection. You can\u2019t do that with science.", "Science is about long, arduous studies until you arrive at a conclusion. Art is about playful experimentation until you arrive at something that resonates with you and others.", "Art gives you a sense of understanding even when you haven\u2019t understood.", "In order to make your client happy, process your result with some artistic techniques. You don\u2019t need to reduce complexity. All you need is to transform it into something that resonates with the client.", "Your client will need to be able to learn from your results without being a Data Scientist themselves. Art is the tool to achieve that \u2014 think visualization, but also broader creative aspects.", "This will involve some additional work. But your client will fall in love with you.", "You\u2019re a Data Scientist. Your favorite occupation is sitting somewhere alone with your laptop and building a beautiful model based on a dataset. The universe is simple: You. Your laptop. Your model.", "But you\u2019re human, and you need to interact with people. So who do you go out with? Other Data Scientists, of course.", "You have plenty of common interests, and your different skillsets enhance one another. You learn from one another. You grow from one another.", "But Data Scientists don\u2019t need one another.", "You need business leaders. You need people who pay you for your work.", "The problem is, they have no idea what they\u2019re paying you for. They have a problem \u2014 for example, getting more customers. And they know that the solution is somewhere in the heap of existing customer data. But they don\u2019t know how. You need to extract it.", "But you\u2019re a scientist. You know that research is hard and takes a long time. You know that as soon as you\u2019ve solved one question, you\u2019ll be faced with another. You know that what you do is complex. Really complex.", "That\u2019s why you hate deadlines. You hate setting goals. You love to roam around, freely seeking the eureka-moments.", "Artists also love roaming around. They love the freedom of doing whatever they want. They hate deadlines. But they have one advantage over you:", "When a scientist gets faced with a business-y rule, they get paralyzed. Think deadlines or corporate goals. If the goal is to hand in a report this Friday, they\u2019ll finish it in six months. Data scientists don\u2019t want to deal with this kind of stuff.", "When an artist gets faced with a rule, they get creative. They might not break the rule, but they\u2019ll work their way around it. If they need to hand in a report by Friday, they might even hand it in a day earlier. But they\u2019ll make sure they\u2019ve chosen a fancy font and printed it on bright pink paper. You can\u2019t be average!", "Combine the best of both sides. Your existence depends on making your clients happy. So you\u2019ll have to adhere to their rules. Don\u2019t break deadlines. Don\u2019t miss corporate goals. But bend the rules a little bit \u2014 not too much, just enough \u2014 to add your personal spice. It\u2019s your work, after all.", "You\u2019re a scientist, not a salesperson. You\u2019re okay with adding your personal spice to your work \u2014 be it an insider joke, a funny meme or whatever inspires you. But you can\u2019t and don\u2019t want to think like a businessman.", "You fear that it will compromise your work. You\u2019re a scientist and your integrity roots on thinking like a scientist. Business logic would just clutter up your mind.", "I\u2019m not asking you to think like a businessperson while you\u2019re cleaning or analyzing data. If business logic were needed for that, your client would have done the job themselves.", "But the question is how you present your work. A businessperson hired you, so the final presentation of your results should be tailored to their needs.", "What happens in between getting the task and doing the final presentation is your thing. But your objective must always be to add value to your client.", "Even while preparing your final presentation, you don\u2019t need to think in business logic. But you need to think in terms that make sense to the client.", "Don\u2019t try to impress business people. Impress the humans behind the business fa\u00e7ade.", "Think not: \u201cWhat will they think when they see this result?\u201d", "Think instead: \u201cWhat will they feel when they see this result?\u201d", "Use fonts, colors, shapes, and visual effects. Make your work as polished as possible. Your client will love you for it.", "You\u2019re a scientist, and science is what you do best.", "But sometimes it\u2019s worth widening your horizon to other disciplines. This will give you new perspectives on your job. Learning about art will help you to:", "You\u2019re not an artist, but you can learn from them.
