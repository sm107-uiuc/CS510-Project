I\u2019ve heard this many times, but I\u2019ve always wondered how we can make this claim. Specifically, what data supports this claim and what does this data tell us about underrepresentation in these areas? In this article, I will explore and analyze the gender disparity among higher academia in computer science/engineering by answering the 3 questions below:", "This is part of a larger project by Ursatech Berkeley", "At Ursatech Berkeley, we give back to our campus community by providing pro-bono consulting services within the UC Berkeley community and lending our expertise to university-affiliated groups.", "Our client\u2019s main objectives is to uncover and mitigate the roadblocks that prevent minority groups from pursuing successful academic and professional careers in CS/Engineering. In order to assist with this goal, UrsaTech will pursue a data analysis project that involves scraping the web to amalgamate and identify patterns within university demographic data. This will help us determine how students progress through CS/Engineering programs in undergrad, graduate programs, and/or faculty positions. My focus for this project is gender.", "I met a female computer scientist for the first time in college. She was my professor for my summer lab research! Prior to this, I never actually met a female engineer or computer scientist. As I continued my education, I began to notice the small number of women professors in my college\u2019s computer science/engineering department. If my school\u2019s department looks like this, what do the other CS departments in the US look like? Specifically, how does the representation of women CS Faculty compare to men CS Faculty in the US?", "I gathered samples from 7 different CS university departments below.", "If repeated, I would aim for a larger sample size.", "I wrote the following functions below to web scrap data from MIT, Stanford, and Cal. The other schools\u2019 data were scrapped by my fellow teammates.", "I initialized the gender column to be all male and then changed it to female accordingly for each school. There may be some bias as I manually determined if the individual is a male or female based on their picture provided by the university.", "The following is an example of how I scrapped faculty names from Stanford.", "After collecting and cleaning the appropriate data, I found the proportion of female faculty members within the CS departments of each school. The rest of the code to process the data is linked in my github at the end of the article.", "Using a 5% significance level, we get a p-value of 2.82e-07 from our hypothesis test. The probability of observing the sample data (Figure 1), given the null hypothesis is true, is 0.0000282%. Since the p-value is less than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis. The test suggests that the percentage of women in CS faculty positions is not equal to the percentage of men in these positions.", "Why is that? How does the gender demographics for qualified candidates for CS faculty positions look like?", "The number of women in CS faculty is much less than men in the US. Are there significantly less qualified women for CS professor positions? How does the proportion of women who receive their doctorates in CIS, who qualify for CS faculty position, compare over time?", "Notably, the proportion of Computer & Information Science (CIS) doctorate recipients remain relatively the same from 2009\u20132018, with 80% men and 20% women. The data\u2019s trend suggests there has not been an increase in women representation in CIS doctorate degree recipients since 2009.", "This led me to further question women representation overall in Engineering as you progress higher in academia.", "Note: There was no dataset specifically for computer science population demographics so I focused on engineering overall.", "If there is a smaller percentage of women receiving their doctorates in Computer & Information sciences, how does the representation of women vary from undergraduate to graduate engineering programs?", "The proportion between female and male engineers in higher academia has been shrinking since 1979. However, there remains a large difference between the number of women engineers and male engineers in higher academia. The higher up in academia, the greater the gap in representation between women and men in engineering.", "Note: The following analysis is only within the US population", "The sample of the proportions of CS Female faculty at MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Cornell, Carnegie Mellon, Princeton, and Yale suggest that females and males are not equally represented in CS faculty departments in the US. Upon closer inspection, there is a wide gap between the number of qualified Computer & Information Science (CIS) male and female doctorate recipients who qualify for CS faculty positions. The proportion of CIS doctorate recipients remain relatively the same from 2009\u20132018, with 80% men and 20% women. The data\u2019s trend suggests there has been little increase in women representation in CIS doctorate degree recipients since 2009. On the other hand, the proportion between female and male engineers in academia has been shrinking since 1979. However, there remains a large difference between the number of women and male engineers in higher academia. The higher up in academia, the greater the gap in representation between women and men in engineering.", "College is the time to expose our future generation to a world of opportunities! It wasn\u2019t until college when I met a female computer scientist that I gave coding a try. For me, seeing female representation mattered. For many others, college may be the first time they see someone who looks like them in a career they are thinking of pursuing. I note that a limitation in my study is that I seek to have more data. As for next steps, I would like to expand the perspective / gather more data and look into other factors such as ethnicity, age, residency, health conditions, and so on. In addition, I wish to investigate what barriers prevent more women from entering CS/engineering in higher academia.", "The full code for this project can be found in my github.
