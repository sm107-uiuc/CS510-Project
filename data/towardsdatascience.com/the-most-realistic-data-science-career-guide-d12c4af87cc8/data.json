We ask less about how to get into Data Science, but wonder \u201cshould I stay?\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d In this article, I share some insights on some non-trivial, but practical, options \u2014 4 archetypes of Data Scientists \u2014 and their pitfalls (also useful for aspiring data scientists). Finally, you can find a live survey at the end to see where the community is heading.", "Update on May 4th, 2020: I included a link to an article that discusses the survey results. Please find the link in the survey section.", "If your role is impacted by COVID-19 and you\u2019re based in Canada or open to moving here, join this open Talent Help List for potential opportunities in Tech. Stay safe, we will get through this soon.", "Disclaimer: This post is not endorsed or sponsored. I use the term Data Science and ML interchangeably.", "Like What You Read?

If not, what should I do next?\u201d My friend asked.", "Like the sound of gathering and smell of fresh restaurant food, the question of how to get into data science seems a bit distant now. In fact, you can find ~3 billion results on Google with a ridiculously specific step-wise guide (only ~2 billion on \u201chow to make money\u201d).", "Yet, my friend\u2019s question lingered. Deep down, the tension is driven by two factors: 1) expectation vs. reality of data science \u2014 it can be more boring than we expected, and 2) the role vs. our aspiration.", "To know where we want to go, you must know where we are. To get a bigger picture of the alternatives, many of us may turn to the question of \u201cwhat is data science?\u201d If you Google this phrase, we will likely come across something like this:", "This categorization makes sense, but it doesn\u2019t really capture the reality and nuances of the day-to-day work and the nature of the company. These two factors are arguably the most important when we make professional decisions.", "There is a better way of thinking about this. So, let me present to you the Archetypes of Data Scientists.", "Before we start, it is important to consider my background and journey, so you can translate my insights based on your own reality and constraints.", "In short, I witnessed the evolution of Data Science by consulting for large enterprises, befriending many types of Data Scientists, and building ML products at an AI start-up that ended up being acquired.", "My opinion is only one data point (hopefully it\u2019s a useful and unique one), so keep your eyes out for others\u2019. I hope the survey at the end helps.", "So, what is Data Science? It depends on the size of companies (enterprise or start-up) and the primary responsibility of the role (client-facing or internal focused).", "When you interview for a data science role, despite the title and job description, it\u2019s likely to fall into one of the following four oversimplified and subjectively labelled groups.", "How can you use this? The Archetype shows you the possibilities. It allows you to see where you are right now and what the immediate options are. For aspiring data scientists, you can use this to figure your best starting point.", "Next, you might ask: how do I know if the new role is better for me?", "To help you decide, here are some pros and cons of each role.

Work on very \u201cimportant stuff\u201d because clients pay the high fee for results. Every project can be different in case you are bored or frustrated. Very clear promotional path and requirements (e.g. Analyst, Manager, to Partner). Exposure to senior executives, a wide range of topics in early careers, and lots of ambitious people.", "The Bad: Business value out weights everything (e.g. scientific innovation and cool algorithms). Demanding hours across all seniority. Some firms may not consider Data Scientists for the traditional Partnership track (you might feel sidelined, but don\u2019t worry, most people are very respectful). Lots of alpha personalities.", "Best Fit: Business-oriented people with some technical training and aspiration to run your own \u201csmall business\u201d within a big company. Students who are just starting out, looking for mentors, and want to learn the best lingos and don\u2019t mind being worked really hard.", "Technical sales or project lead roles at AI-focused start-ups or medium-sized companies (e.g. Dessa, Element AI, H2O, Cloudera, Palantir).", "The Good: You can work on some cutting edge use cases because clients typically look to you for innovation, instead of delivering (boring) long term, large scale transformation projects. A bigger voice on important strategic and product decisions. Be nimble and innovative.", "The Bad: Some clients may not trust you with large projects (e.g. get more budget), which is the flip side of being \u201cnimble & innovative.\u201d May need to do lots of \u201cfree\u201d work to win client trust. Less back-office support compared to bigger firms. Product vision can be influenced by investors (if you have the wrong VCs) or the sunk cost mentality, instead of true market demand.", "Best Fit: People who want to grow with the company in the early-stage, live the entrepreneurial dream, and already have a solid business network, domain expertise, and/or reputation. Not good for newbies because you need to hit the ground running.", "People with Software and/or ML background who work with Engineering to build IP, demos, and support sales calls at AI product companies.", "The Good: Work on interesting and practical problems without having to deal with too much client politics. Shorter-term projects. Get to influence or define how the products should be designed as an \u201cinternal user.\u201d Build cool stuff for the clients or internal.", "The Bad: Likely to get pulled into a client- or user-facing role, which creates tension in competing priorities and time management. Hard to find the right balance between \u201ccutting edge\u201d vs. \u201cimmediately practical.\u201d Might get sucked into doing endless customer support work.", "Best Fit: People who are product-oriented, engineering-focused, but some times hacky. Seasoned professionals with domain expertise in certain technology stack or workflow. Students who have an open and curious mind, enjoy technical challenges, and can get sh*t done.", "Okay, families can be complicated, so this group needs to be broken into two segments: the Unsung Heros and the Super Geeks.", "People from traditional BI, Analytics, and Modelling groups within enterprises. They mostly work with lines of businesses or functions (e.g. Marketing, Risk, Finance, etc.) They were the Data Scientists before the term was coined.", "The Good: Very focused work. Close to real business operations. Have access to unique datasets. Have access to operationalized and large scale infrastructures. Great work-life balance. Have influence or power to make investment decisions.", "The Bad: Things can be slow and boring at (most) times. Often don\u2019t get the recognition of having the sexiest job of the 21st century. Internal politics. Slow(er) career trajectory. Get locked into certain roles or projects.", "Best Fit: People who found their passions in life or enjoy investing time in specific domains. People who don\u2019t care about the hype. People who have lots of patience and resilience.", "The stereotype of the \u201cgolden child\u201d in Data Science. People who work at R&D in major companies, such as Google Brain / DeepMind, Facebook\u2019s FAIR, Uber, and Walmart Research, etc.", "The Good: Work on very intellectual topics. Have access to unique datasets and problems. Be able to push the envelope with the resources of the big firms. Get lots of recognition and praise.", "The Bad: Strong tension from having to demonstrate \u201cbusiness value\u201d. Business priorities can limit or influence research topics. Might get suck into \u201cboring\u201d implementation if the research demonstrated value.", "Best Fit: Academics. Engineers with a very strong taste for academic research and educational background. Graduate students who are looking to publish and get some industry exposure.", "Now you have a good grasp of what\u2019s possible, ask yourself these questions:", "In the next article, I will share a few common and unconventional paths and their challenges.
