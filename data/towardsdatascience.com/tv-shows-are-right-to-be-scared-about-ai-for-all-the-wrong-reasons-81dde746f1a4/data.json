Dick\u2019s Electric Dreams, a cautionary tale about the encroaching control technology has over its users:", "\u201cneXt is a propulsive, fact-based thriller about the emergence of a deadly, rogue artificial intelligence that combines pulse-pounding action with a layered examination of how technology is invading our lives and transforming us in ways we don\u2019t yet understand.\u201d", "However, as far as I could tell from its trailer, the show\u2019s story-arc couldn\u2019t be further from that summary. The trailer opens with an Alexa look-alike, and all seems well until it gains a will of its own, wreaking havoc and rebelling against its users and human creators with the subtlety and verbosity of a Bond super-villain. This attempt at an H.G. Wells approach of portraying societal fears in the form of an \u201cinvader\u201d figure may have worked for War of the Worlds or Godzilla. However, using AI in this context is actively misleading us about real-life concerns regarding AI and decision-making algorithms, many of which significantly impact human lives in the non-fictional reality we\u2019re living in.", "To be clear, data privacy is a component. You should be concerned about where your data, the backbone of AI, is going. It\u2019s becoming increasingly inevitable that by being an active participant in society, you will be forced to hand over a very sizable portion of your tastes and behaviors to data-gathering companies. These companies\u2019 sole purpose is to squeeze as much value as they can from the data, and there is little we can do about it without becoming digital hermits.", "Did you know that not only can you be tracked and identified through clicks and online searches, but also your physical actions? Those starting to cover their laptop webcams may be on the right track, but might not have heard of behavioral biometrics: techniques through which details such as the cadence of your typing on a keyboard or the travel patterns of your mouse can tie you back to your identity (learn how to stop that here).", "Now I\u2019m not saying that you shouldn\u2019t try to minimize your digital data footprint. Moreover, conversations surrounding data privacy efforts should also focus on public outcry for stricter safety and privacy policies. On a recent episode of the Vox podcast \u201cRecode Decode,\u201d Gabe Weinberg, CEO of DuckDuckGo, argues that opting-in to data tracking should be the default, rather than the obscure opt-out approaches many data companies implement. A popular point of view many European countries have agreed on through policy that needs to be adopted worldwide.", "Data companies have realized that not only can they use their assets and tools for data collection and behavioral predictions, but they can now deploy their insight to shift behavior, effectively rigging our future actions to result in optimal benefits for them. In the book \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\u201d author Shoshana Zuboff argues the endgame for capitalist behavioral analytics may not just represent a threat to our privacy, but our very free will \u2014 a deterministic landscape of preset decisions and self-fulfilling prophecies. Zuboff argues:", "\u201cSurveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Although some of these data are applied to service improvement, the rest are declared as a proprietary behavioral surplus, fed into advanced manufacturing processes known as \u2018machine intelligence\u2019, and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do now, soon, and later. Finally, these prediction products are traded in a new kind of marketplace that I call behavioral futures markets. Surveillance capitalists have grown immensely wealthy from these trading operations, for many companies are willing to lay bets on our future behavior\u201d", "The implications for non-regulated data tracking and manipulation under the control of a capitalist mindset should be evident. From threats to our very behaviors to democracy itself, we don\u2019t need a computerized super-villain to imagine a genuine and present AI threat. A robust and ethics-based approach to implementing data policies is fundamental if we want to make it out of this new digital golden age with our autonomy intact.", "Biases exist everywhere, and algorithms aren\u2019t helping, they\u2019re exacerbating the problem by obscuring it. Data and algorithms are not an objective reflection of our world; they carry with them the very same prejudices, biases and misunderstandings from the cultures and organizations that created them. Except they hide inside packages that encourage a lack of accountability for these biases making it easier to justify using determinism mistaken for objectivity. By implementing systems that decide whom to prioritize for medical care, whom to suspect of a crime or what content to recommend to children online, we are increasing that lack of accountability without addressing pressing concerns.", "Rachel Thomas, a professor at the University of San Francisco Data Institute and co-founder of Fast.ai has spoken and written at length on this subject:", "\u201cOur algorithms and products impact the world and are part of feedback loops. Consider an algorithm to predict crime and determine where to send police officers: sending more police to a particular neighborhood is not just an effect, but also a cause. More police officers can lead to more arrests in a given neighborhood, which could cause the algorithm to send even more police to that neighborhood (a mechanism described in this paper on runaway feedback loops).\u201d", "Computer vision algorithms perform poorly on people of color compared to those of European descent, due to the overwhelming majority of facial data being from people of European descent. Most collected behavioral data comes from rich parts of developed world countries, autofill algorithms are more likely to suggest STEM-related occupational terms for men and housekeeping terms for women. These stereotypes are not a result of malicious intent, but societal and personal biases reflected in the data\u2019s breadth and width. Regardless of origin, however, they need to be addressed.", "Far from arbiters of objective truth, algorithms and data are carriers of our biases, which are plentiful. The lack of understanding from those that execute, deploy, consume and regulate them leads us off the cliff by prejudiced, manipulable machines of our creation. Ethical considerations have been a crucial part of AI\u2019s core since its inception. As a result, waiting until the damage has been done, or trusting that the threat of hefty financial penalties is more than just a band-aid fix on a larger problem, is a mistake.", "Sadly, solving these problems won\u2019t be as easy as calling on the scruffy dogged detective to defeat Alexa\u2019s evil cousin, like the \u201cneXt\u201d TV show would have us believe. There is no \u201cother\u201d here, no rogue AI from an experiment gone wrong, just the endorsement of our societal prejudices and misgivings, packaged into shiny lines of code.", "We already know how to handle biases. Humanity has been intelligent enough to recognize and correct them (to varying degrees) before. The challenge is our ability to apply these solutions to systems that we once imagined fair or objective. In doing so, the next step is to establish limitations and accountability for people responsible for each step in the data process \u2014 its collection, storage, exploration, modeling and deployment. Also, we need to always be aware of how easy biases are to miss, and understand that algorithms may make mistakes \u2014 frequent, and more impactful than expected. Ultimately achieving success means being prepared to course-correct the issue proactively, if not flat out discard the algorithm before the damage is irreversible.", "At an InfoQ presentation, Rachel Thomas outlines some solutions to problems we discussed above, such as:", "In the end, leave the black-and-white scenarios for weeknight science fiction TV shows.", "Your home for data science.
