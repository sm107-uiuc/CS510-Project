Because it has created an internal representation of the shape of a cat and a dog.", "This learning that the model has done. What is it?", "This is its inductive bias, the basis of its performance.", "Initially, when you create a neural model and before you feed it data, its ability to approximate anything is infinite.", "Any data you feed to it thus, starts constricting that infinite power of approximation to do some specific task. You define boundaries for your deep learning model in terms of data. You tell it: This is what your work is; if you deviate from it, you will be penalized.", "You define boundaries for your deep learning model in terms of data.", "The model starts to constrict itself and starts to apply itself to the data in front of it. It starts to find that one general hypothesis (a tentative explanation that can be confirmed by investigation) that would help it to do its work optimally. Essentially, the model starts to look for the answer to this question.", "What is that one thing I should know that everything else shall be known?", "Initially, it may try to learn everything i.e. it would try to learn a specific hypothesis for each training example you are giving it.", "For example, in the above photos of the different breed of dogs, we can see how varied they are.

Because these specific hypotheses only work for a particular training image.", "The forward pass of the deep learning model is equivalent to the creation of these specific hypotheses.", "But, this is not our goal. That is the reason, we perform training i.e. we correct the model in a way that rejects these specific hypotheses.", "We penalize the model if it favors specific hypotheses as they lead to a higher value of the loss we use and a lesser value of the performance measure (say, accuracy).", "The backward pass of the deep learning model is equivalent to the rejection of these specific hypotheses.", "Every single cycle of the forward and backward pass leads to the rejection of some specific hypothesis for a more general one. As more of these cycles, keep on happening, the model reaches a more and more general hypothesis that will allow it to do its task optimally.", "The final hypothesis i.e. the most general hypothesis that the model reaches is its inductive bias. The most general hypothesis is the one that has the least number of constraints upon. Here, lies both the discrimination and generalization capability of the neural networks.", "The most general hypothesis that the model reaches is its inductive bias", "The general hypothesis is how deep learning models can perform very-well on unseen data because the hypothesis derived is so general that it encompasses almost all the permutations and computations of the problem network was trained on.", "Why deep learning models require a large amount of data?", "This also hints at why they are so much data-hungry because they want to derive the best general hypothesis for a given problem so they need to see more and more variation of the data so they can incorporate those variations in its general hypothesis.", "In short, the better the inductive bias, the better the predictive power (the capability to perform on unseen data) of the neural network.", "The concept of inductive bias is not just applicable to deep learning, it also drives the performance of all learning algorithms in existence.", "\u201cThe eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.\u201d\u2015 Robertson Davies", "In this post, we understood the concept of inductive bias and how it is the basis of the reign of the deep learning models.
