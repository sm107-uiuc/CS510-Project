How to allocate the most important\u2026 | by Eva van Rooijen | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Scarcity of the Digital Age", "description": "Scarcity. It is the reason why we have to make decisions. How to make sure we use the overload of information to our advantage?"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Scarcity. It is the reason why we have to make decisions. We can simply not have it all. Even though the menu is filled with mouth-watering dishes, we know we cannot (usually) eat them all. Other examples of scarce resources are money, time and energy. In this article, I introduce another scarce resource whose allocation could use some of your awareness.", "Our brains pay attention to the world around us in different ways. We can pay selective attention to a single observation. This requires the active ignorance of other distractors. We can also pay divided attention to multiple inputs.", "Lately, we are dealing with many more sensory inputs than we used to. Our lives became so much simpler whilst our brains seem to be busier than ever. Recommender systems know exactly what to show to get our attention.", "When we do pay attention to certain sensory input, the goal is to process this and get some value out of it. The value here could be in terms of entertainment as well as informative. Nonetheless, an overload of information makes the processing all the more complicated.", "Thus, it takes focus to receive information as well as to process it. The growing amount of information we are exposed to increases the demand for our focus. At the same time, we cannot simply \u2018increase\u2019 our focus. Focus can be improved through several techniques. However, this is not easy nor unlimited. This increasing demand and fixed supply make our focus a scarce good.", "In Economics, the optimal allocation of goods is calculated by setting the added value of one unit equal to the added cost of one unit. The problem that arises is, what is the value of focus? This cannot be captured in monetary units. Focus brings progress and mental clarity, it helps you get things done.", "Following Simon Sinek\u2019s example, we start with why. \u2018Why do you want to focus on x?\u2019. To measure the value of focus, I look at the value of accomplishing the task I am focused on. Is it learning something I am interested in? Working towards my personal or business goals?", "If these words make you cringe, I am sorry. These concepts did not really speak to me either. However, I decided to take it seriously and took a \u2018Personal Leadership\u2019 course. Uncovering my personal values and connecting these to my interests and goals helped me to focus on the things that matter, to me.", "There is no escaping. Even though I recommend taking time to carefully reflect and think about your values, interests, and goals. You have to take action. Taking action will help you progress in two ways:", "Either you improve by learning from experience, a mentor or a course, or you realize you have to make an adjustment. Both are a step forward.", "Once you know what input you need, you can turn this story around and exploit the overload of information. Harnessed with your awareness of your needs and scarcity, use your focus wisely.", "To conclude this article, the abundance of data is numbing our focus. We are overwhelmed by entertainment, information, social messages and so on. All this input has to be processed and our cognitive processes cannot handle it.", "The processing of information is what Data Science is all about. Data Science is the way to turn large amounts of data into insightful bits of information. The largest difficulty is to make society acknowledge and use Data Science.", "Once our society becomes data literate, we can use techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction to process information for us. We can also build models that simulate overwhelming processes. Once such a model fits, we can tweak inputs to analyze singular events as opposed to all at once.", "Your home for data science.
