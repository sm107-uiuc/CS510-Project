You can even use CNNs to sort Lego bricks if that\u2019s your thing. Despite the growth in popularity, many developers learning about CNNs for the first time have trouble moving past surface-level introductions to the topic.", "In this series of articles, I will introduce convolutional neural networks in an accessible and practical way: by creating a CNN that can detect pneumonia in lung X-rays.*", "This four article series includes the following parts, each dedicated to a logical chunk of the development process:", "Part I: Introduction to the problem + understanding and organizing your data set (you are here)", "Part II: Shaping and augmenting your data set with relevant perturbations (coming soon)", "Part III: Tuning neural network hyperparameters (coming soon)", "Part IV: Training the neural network and interpreting results (coming soon)", "Although this series is discussing a topic relevant to medical imaging, the techniques can apply to virtually any 2D convolutional neural network. While this series cannot possibly cover every nuance of implementing CNNs for every possible problem, the goal is that you, as a reader, finish the series with a holistic capability to implement, troubleshoot, and tune a 2D CNN of your own from scratch. I intend to discuss many essential nuances of constructing a neural network that most introductory articles or how-tos tend to leave out. When important, I focus on both the why and the how, and not just the how. I also try to avoid overwhelming jargon that can confuse the neural network novice.", "This first article in the series will spend time introducing critical concepts about the topic and underlying dataset that are foundational for the rest of the series. It is recommended that you read this first article carefully, as it is setting up a lot of information we will need when we start coding in Part II.", "Prerequisites: This series is intended for readers who have at least some familiarity with Python and an idea of what a CNN is, but you do not need to be an expert to follow along. You should at least know how to set up a Python environment, import Python libraries, and write some basic code.", "If you are an absolute beginner (i.e., don\u2019t know what a CNN is), I recommend reading this article before you start this project:", "*Disclaimer: this is not a medical device, is not FDA cleared or approved, and you should not use the code in these articles to diagnose real patients \u2014 I don\u2019t want the FDA writing me a letter!", "Instead of discussing a topic that\u2019s been covered a million times (like the infamous MNIST problem), we will work through a more substantial but manageable problem: detecting Pneumonia. Before starting any project, it is vital to have some domain knowledge of the topic. While you can develop a neural network that has some surface-level functionality without really understanding the problem at hand, the key to creating functional, production-ready neural networks is to understand the problem domain and environment.", "Pneumonia is a condition that affects more than three million people per year and can be life-threatening, especially for the young and elderly. The World Health Organization consistently ranks pneumonia as the \u201clargest infectious cause of death in children worldwide.\u201d [1] Pneumonia is commonly diagnosed in part by analysis of a chest X-ray image. Such X-ray images are interpreted using subjective and inconsistent criteria, and \u201cIn patients with pneumonia, the interpretation of the chest X-ray, especially the smallest of details, depends solely on the reader.\u201d [2] With modern computing capability, neural networks have become more accessible and compelling for researchers to solve problems of this type.", "Analyzing X-rays is one type of problem convolutional neural networks are well suited to address: issues of pattern recognition where subjectivity and uncertainty are significant factors.", "Now that we have some understanding of the problem domain, let\u2019s get started. We will add to our domain knowledge as we work.", "The data set we are using in this article is available here. [3] The original publication of the data set is here [4] for those who are curious, and the official repository for the data is here. [5]", "The data set contains 5,863 images separated into three chunks: training, validation, and testing. Each chunk is further divided into \u201cnormal\u201d images (images without pneumonia) and \u201cpneumonia\u201d images (images classified as having either bacterial or viral pneumonia). The breakdown of images in the data set is as follows:", "Notice the imbalance of pneumonia vs. normal images. This data set contains roughly three pneumonia images for every one normal image. This is typical for medical image data; because patients are exposed to possibly dangerous ionizing radiation every time a patient takes an X-ray, doctors only refer the patient for X-rays when they suspect something is wrong (and more often than not, they are right). We will try to address this problem by boosting the number of normal X-rays when we augment the data set later on in the project.", "Below are two examples of images within the data set: one classified as having signs of bacterial pneumonia and one classified as normal.", "While you may not be able to determine which X-ray contains pneumonia, you should be able to look for the other differences in the radiographs. They have different exposure levels, different contrast levels, different parts of the anatomy are centered in the view, the resolution and dimensions are different, the noise levels are different, and more. This is a key concept.", "Looking at your data set and the variation in images besides the classification targets (i.e., \u201cpneumonia\u201d or \u201cnot pneumonia\u201d) is crucial because it tells you the kinds of variety you can expect in a production environment. This variety is indicative of the types of perturbations we will need to apply later to augment the data set. Perturbations are slight changes we make to many images in the set in order to make the data set larger and simulate real-world conditions, such as adding artificial noise or slightly rotating some images. Data set augmentation is a key aspect of machine learning in general \u2014 especially when you are working with relatively small data sets, like this one.", "You should also look for bias in your data set. In this particular instance, all of the images in this data set are of children. That means that the data set does not apply to a massive swath of the population: adults! If I had not pointed out this critical detail, you probably would have assumed we are dealing with images of adults. Be very careful to understand the assumptions you make when you select or create your training data set. Those underlying assumptions should reflect the use-cases you are trying to address with your neural network model. In this case, we cannot use this data set to train a neural network model to detect pneumonia in X-rays of adult lungs, because it contains no X-rays of adult lungs!", "Another more clear example of bias is the classic \u201cschool bus\u201d identification problem. If you are writing a neural network that will detect American school buses, what does the data set need to include? The default assumption might be something like \u201cit needs to include school buses and city buses, and probably charter buses.\u201d The real answer is: it probably needs to include a representative sample of many types of vehicles of just about every make and model because it needs to learn what is not a school bus definitively. Always consider what possible images your neural network will analyze, and not just the intended goal of the neural network.", "In this case, it is fair to assume that our neural network will analyze lung radiographs, but what is a lung radiograph? What else might a lung radiograph include?", "There are many lung diseases out there, and it is incredibly likely that some will show signs of pneumonia but actually be some other disease. Do not assume that real-world data will be as cut and dry as something like \u201cpneumonia\u201d and \u201cnot pneumonia.\u201d For example, atelectasis, infiltration, and certain types of masses might look to a neural network that was not trained to identify them as pneumonia, just because they are not normal!", "Assuming that the \u201cpneumonia\u201d and \u201cnot pneumonia\u201d data set will suffice could potentially tank a real-life project. Learning to identify and reflect on your data set assumptions is an important skill.", "Taking into consideration that the data set we are working with here is flawed if our goal is to detect pneumonia (because it does not include a sufficiently representative sample of other lung diseases that are not pneumonia), we will move on. In a real-life scenario, you will need to identify this kind of dilemma and address it in your data set.", "Finally, you should look for quality labeling in your data set. In this project, we will assume the underlying data labels are good, but if you are building a neural network model that will go into production, bad labeling can have a significant impact on the upper limit of your accuracy. For example, in this case, we are performing binary classification because either an X-ray contains pneumonia (1) or it is normal (0). If the doctors whose data is used in the data set did not verify their diagnoses of these patients (e.g., double-check their diagnoses with blood tests, sputum tests, etc.), then we could have underlying labeling issues. It is also possible that a doctor diagnosed a patient early enough that a sputum test came back positive, but, the lung X-ray does not show evidence of pneumonia, yet is still labeled as positive. This could throw off training. Understanding the problem domain will guide you in looking for problems with labeling. If you do not understand the problem domain, find someone who does to assist with this part of building your data set.", "In this case, we will (perhaps without sufficient justification) assume that the labels are good. You can read the publication associated with the data set to learn more about their labeling process (linked at the top of this section) and decide for yourself if this assumption is justified.", "Note: More massive data sets, such as the NIH Chest X-Ray data set with 112,000+ X-rays representing many different lung diseases, are also available for use, but for this introduction, we should use a data set of a more manageable size and scope. Training and manipulating a huge data set can be too complicated for an introduction and can take a very long time to tune and train due to the processing power required.", "There are no hard rules when it comes to organizing your data set \u2014 this comes down to personal preference. However, there are some things you might want to take into consideration:", "This is important because if your data is organized in a way that is conducive to how you will read and use the data later, you will end up writing less code and ultimately will have a cleaner solution. For example, if you are going to use Keras\u2019 built-in image_dataset_from_directory() method with ImageDataGenerator, then you want your data to be organized in a way that makes that easier. It just so happens that this particular data set is already set up in such a manner:", "Inside the pneumonia folders, images are labeled as follows:", "Normal images are labeled as follows:", "We will talk more about image_dataset_from_directory() and ImageDataGenerator when we get to shaping, reading, and augmenting data in the next article. For now, just know that this structure makes using those features built into Keras easy.", "2. How many labels does each image need?", "Another consideration is how many labels you need to keep track of. If possible, I prefer to keep the labels in the names of the files. In many cases, this will not be possible (for example, if you are working with segmentation and have several coordinates and associated labels per image that you need to read \u2014 I will do a similar article on segmentation sometime in the future).", "So what do you do when you have many labels? Most people use CSV files, or for very large or complex data sets, use databases to keep track of their labeling.", "For this problem, all necessary labels are contained within the filenames.", "3. How will you divide your data?", "Every data set should be divided into three categories: training, testing, and validation.", "The training data set is used, well, to train the model. This is the data that the neural network sees and learns from. This data set should ideally be representative of every class and characteristic the neural network may encounter in a production environment.", "The validation data set is used to check your training progress at every epoch of training. It will be repeatedly run through the neural network model and is used to tune your neural network hyperparameters. It is incorrect to say that this data set does not affect your model because it is not used for training \u2014 there is an implicit bias in any model whose hyperparameters are tuned by a validation set. You, as the neural network developer, are essentially crafting a model that can perform well on this set. Therefore, the validation set should also be representative of every class and characteristic that the neural network may encounter in a production environment. If it is not representative, then the performance of your neural network on the validation set will not be comparable to its real-world performance.", "This data set is used to test the final neural network model and evaluate its capability as you would in a real-life scenario. Because of the implicit bias of the validation data set, it is bad practice to use that data set to evaluate your final neural network model. This data set can be smaller than the other two data sets but must still be statistically significant (i.e.; it should adequately represent every class and characteristic that the neural network may encounter in a production environment \u2014 are you noticing a trend here?).", "Now that we know what each set is used for let\u2019s talk about numbers. Ideally, all of these sets will be as large as possible. There are no hard and fast rules about how big each data set should be. Having said that, I have a rule of thumb that I like to use for data sets like this that are at least a few thousand samples in size and are simple (i.e., binary classification): 70% training, 20% validation, 10% testing. You can then adjust as necessary to optimize performance if you run into issues with the training set being too small.", "In instances where you have a more complex problem (i.e., categorical classification with many classes), then the problem becomes more nuanced. You need to design your data sets to be reflective of your goals. In those instances, my rule of thumb is that each class should be divided 70% into training, 20% into validation, and 10% into testing, with further tweaks as necessary.", "Again, these are loose guidelines that have worked as starting values in my experience and not really rules. In many, if not most cases, you will need to rebalance your data set distribution a few times to really optimize results.", "In this instance, the X-ray data set is split into a poor configuration in its original form from Kaggle, with:", "So we will deal with this by randomly splitting the data set according to my rule above, leaving us with 4,104 images in the training set, 1,172 images in the validation set, and 587 images in the testing set.", "In this article, we discussed the importance of understanding your problem domain, how to identify internal bias in your dataset and your assumptions as they pertain to your dataset, and how to organize your dataset into training, validation, and testing groups. Now that we have a firm understanding of our dataset and its limitations, and we have organized the dataset, we are ready to begin coding.", "In the next article we will cover:", "[5] D.
