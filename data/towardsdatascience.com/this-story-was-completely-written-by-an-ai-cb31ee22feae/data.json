All the problems that were going to be solved by AI were at the cutting edge of human cognitive capacity.\u201d", "Maybe that\u2019s because tech companies didn\u2019t know it back then. Those efforts began after the advent of the PC in the mid-1980s, a decade before Microsoft and the rest of the world really woke up to the power of AI. Today, AI is taking on myriad new roles. It is working behind the scenes to keep factories running, doing medical diagnoses and diagnosing emotional disorders, speeding up deliveries, identifying people in images at the Olympics and photo-matching over 10 million foreign flags. AI is also being deployed for heavy-duty political campaigns and sold on to countries trying to develop a countrywide infrastructure.", "Still, AI doesn\u2019t operate on a linear schedule. Rapid advances in data, and in the computational power it requires, led to an explosive growth period. These days, computers can reliably identify a stock market drop in a matter of milliseconds. It\u2019s easy to get lost in that pace. The problem for those outside the companies developing and deploying AI is how do they keep up? Ghavami and a group of a dozen executives from McKinsey spent the past year working with AI pioneers like Google, IBM, and Stanford.", "The good news is that self-driving cars and other ways to reduce traffic accidents are far more complicated than what we\u2019ve come to think of as \u201cwearable,\u201d says Michael Jackson, a senior research scientist at Google who worked on the search giant\u2019s self-driving cars.", "\u201cThere are many, many hours of driving that have yet to be mapped,\u201d Jackson says.", "The other side of the evolution of the technology is that the biggest race to develop AI comes from a company that remains far away from Silicon Valley \u2014 an Asian powerhouse that is also the nation with the deepest R&D and the most expensive software engineers.", "China is a major influencer in AI. Xi Jinping, the president, has characterized the rise of AI as a national security threat \u2014 or perhaps a challenge to freedom of expression \u2014 that will be used to weaponize or censor content online.", "AI has to work at the corporate level, too. It is in the interests of big companies to have it both understand their problems and be able to predict what they will be concerned about in the future.", "\u201cMany problems will be unsolved at scale without human-grade applications of artificial intelligence,\u201d says Charley Wragg, a professor of artificial intelligence at Stanford University, who is heading a collaboration with McKinsey. In other words, it will be left to algorithms to solve the problems their human masters have not been able to.", "Yes, humans should not do their jobs without some level of state supervision, Ghavami says.", "\u201cAt the same time, if we expect people to be exceptional and superhuman,\u201d Ghavami says, \u201cit\u2019s important to understand why they\u2019re so good at things and how, specifically, they do it.\u201d", "In the year of the Rosetta Stone, that lesson has taken center stage.", "Yep, everything you just read was generated by an AI!", "This text was automatically generated by Grover from the Allen Institue of AI. And this was the input I gave it:", "Using just these few inputs Grover was able to generate an entire article all on its own.", "Grover was created as a tool to generate Fake News. Why? It turns out the researchers created it to defend against fake news.", "By having these systems researchers are able to detect the habits and traits of AI-generated text. The hope is that through further researcher automated systems could be developed to detect articles that were generated by an AI.", "You can read more about why it was created here. But here\u2019s the excerpt that explains why having Grover helps us detect fake news,", "\u201cCounterintuitively, the best defense against Grover turns out to be Grover itself, with 92% accuracy, demonstrating the importance of public release of strong generators.\u201d", "For clarification, by accuracy, the researchers are referring to the accuracy of Grover to detect fake news generated by an AI.", "More and more we see governments and bad actors flooding social media with fake news, fake policy comments, and support for fringe ideas as tools for propaganda tools.", "Language models like Grover and others will be important to help detect and flag these posts in an automated system with better and better accuracy over time. This will be especially important for large social media websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, where targeted propaganda can be easily deployed.", "Grover uses a Language Model similar to the architecture of GPT-2 and is trained on millions of real news articles from the New York Times to BBC News.", "GPT-2 was specifically created by OpenAI to be able to generate continuous text from an input (usually a sentence or two) provided by the user. GPT-2 itself is trained on 8 million web pages and has over 1.5 billion parameters. This equates to about 40GB of plain text data.", "GPT-2 can be generalized for applications like:", "If you\u2019d like an in-depth explanation of GPT-2 here\u2019s a video on how it was trained,", "The beauty of GPT-2 is that it learned all this on its own with the help of unsupervised machine learning.", "This means the model can just use the text provided to it to learn and doesn\u2019t require any data to be labeled. It does this by using statistical text prediction. After reading a few words, the model will predict the next word based on the probability of what the next word should be and the context of the past few words. It can then check its answer by looking to see if it matches the next word or not in the training data.", "While GPT-2 is a state of the art language model, it still isn\u2019t at the level of a human just yet but as research progresses it may one day far surpass even us.", "If you liked this article check out some of my others!", "Your home for data science.
