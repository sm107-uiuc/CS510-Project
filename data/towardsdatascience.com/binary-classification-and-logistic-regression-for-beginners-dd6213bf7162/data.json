This article also assumes familiarity with how gradient descent works in linear regression. Need a refresher? Read this:", "Another way of asking \u201cwill Sarah be admitted to magnet school\u201d is:", "\u201cWhat is the probability of Sarah being admitted given her GPA and entrance exam score?\u201d", "The mathematical way of representing this question is:", "This equation reads \u201cprobability of y equaling to 1 given x parameterized by theta\u201d.", "x is the set of features, which in this case, are GPA and entrance exam score.", "\u03b8 is the parameters that describes how much GPA/exam score affect probability.

The probability of Bob being admitted is also somewhere between 0 and 1.", "We want our model to maximize P(y=0 | x; \u03b8) for John, and P(y=1 | x; \u03b8) for Bob, and P(y=0 | x; \u03b8) for Elise, etc. In logistic regression, we want to maximize the probability of all the data points given.", "In linear regression and gradient descent, your goal is to arrive at the line of best fit by tweaking the slope and y-intercept little by little with each iteration.

Red line or green line?", "To answer this question, find where P(y | x) land for each GPA. For all your GPA values, you want P(y | x) to be as close as possible to the observed value of y (either 0 or 1).

We take log of L(\u03b8) purely to make the algorithm computationally easier.", "Because we\u2019re trying to maximize a number here, the algorithm we\u2019ll use is called gradient ascent. This is in contrast to gradient descent used in linear regression where we\u2019re trying to minimize the sum of squared errors.", "Note: you can also use gradient descent in logistic regression. After all, maximizing likelihood is the same as minimizing the negative of maximum likelihood.", "To get the gradient ascent formula, we take the partial derivative of l(\u03b8) with respect to theta.", "If you were doing gradient descent instead, you take the partial derivative of negative l(\u03b8) to arrive at the formula.", "I\u2019ve implemented logistic regression with gradient ascent in the gist show below.", "Through a series of trial and error tweaking the learning rate alpha and initialized values for theta, I found the parameters [-109.99, 10.655, 0.821] to be a good fit for the model.", "Using these parameters, the probability of Sarah being admitted is:", "(Remember Sarah\u2019s GPA is 4.3 and her exam score is 79).", "P = 0.665.
