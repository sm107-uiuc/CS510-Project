The Monday of second week of Wimbledon is arguably the most exciting day for tennis during the entire year. On Monday, 16 of the best Men and Women tennis players will compete for a place in the quarterfinal of Wimbledon. There will be plenty of sports commentators and analyst making predictions about who will make it to the final 8, final 4 and eventually be the winner.", "However, I have not come across any prediction made using Machine Learning/ Artificial Intelligence. So I thought this will be a great opportunity for me to implement some of the machine learning skills that I have been learning to predict the matches that will be played in the second week of Wimbledon. More specifically I will implement a simple 2-Hidden Layer Neural Network to predict the outcome of the matches.", "One of the most important part of Neural Network, or for that matter any prediction model is to create feature that can explain the outcome variable. Features like player ranking, overall winning percentage, winning percentage on grass will help explain the result of a tennis match to most extend. Additionally the form of the player captured by winning percentage in the last 52 weeks and head to head record can further help in predicting the result. Overall I create 21 features that serve as the input layer of the Neural Network and below are the 5 features that I believe are the most important.", "Note: For each of the features I calculate the difference between the two players. For example Ranking = (Ranking of player 0)\u2014 (Ranking of player 1).", "Before I describe the implementation of the Neural Network, below is a snippet of what the data with features looks like.", "My data consists of all Wimbledon matches from 2010 to 2018. To keep things simple and more readable, I always have the higher ranked player as player 0 and lower ranked player as player 1. Thus an outcome of 0 indicates that player 0 won (not an upset) and outcome of 1 indicates that player 1 won (an upset).", "Next, I split my data into training and test (dev) data, in order to optimize the Neural Network based on the training data and validate it on the sample test data. Below code builds the neural network.", "Below are some the details of the neural network.", "- Number of Layers: 3. (2 Hidden Layers)- Number of Neuros in each layer: 64->32->1- Activation relu->relu->sigmoid- Stop if validation loss does not improve for 500 epochs- Save the best model which gives the minimum validation set loss", "One important thing to note here is that after certain rounds of epoch as shown in the below graph the neural network starts to overfit the training sample. i.e. it gains accuracy on the training sample at the same time loses accuracy for the test sample. Thus in order to make good predictions, it is important to avoid using a neural network that is overfitting. Thus, I use the model that gives the minimum validation set loss.", "The best model has the below accuracy level on the test and training set, which seems pretty reasonable as a benchmark to predict a tennis match.", "Once I have a trained neural network and have saved the best model. I can use the best model to make predictions of the upcoming matches. Below is a snippet prediction of the scheduled and potential matches in table and bracket format starting from round of 16.", "The Neural Network predicts Novak Djokovic to be the ultimate champion beating Roger Federer in the finals. The closest match according to model will be between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in the Semi Final. With that in mind if Djokovic plays Federer in the Final he has a 70% chance of winning whereas if he plays Nadal in the Finals he has a 59% chance of winning according to the model.", "I will update this article once all the matches are played to see how the model performed. However, the point of this articles is not to build a Neural Network that gives the most accurate prediction but rather the point of this article is to explore ways in which Neural Network and other machine learning techniques can help answer simple questions using data. The question in this article being \u201cWho will win Wimbledon this year?\u201d", "The code and data used for the article is available in the below github repository.
