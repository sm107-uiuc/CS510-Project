One of the important questions weighing on voters\u2019 minds: How well can those candidates do in a general election?", "A second and equally important question: What will happen to the composition of the Senate? This is likely to be the main limiting factor on policy change with a Democratic president \u2014 and will also likely have a significant impact on the balance of power in the judicial branch no matter which party controls the presidency.", "I will attempt to answer these questions with a simple data-driven open-source model, using polling data (from FiveThirtyEight\u2019s poll tracking) and past election data (Senate and presidential data from Leip\u2019s Atlas; within-same-state comparison data from Wikipedia, Ballotpedia, and various state websites).", "Even for those optimistic about Democrats\u2019 chances of winning the 2020 presidential election, there are reasons to be pessimistic about Democrats\u2019 chances at gaining a Senate majority. Democrats need either a presidential candidate with large coattails or strong Senate candidates who can outperform their presidential candidate.", "The first step in modeling an election is to build a baseline estimate of what the 2020 election is roughly expected to look like with a generic Democratic candidate. To do this, I\u2019ll put together data from previous elections to create a plausible set of baseline models.", "The first and most obvious method of modeling the 2020 election is to assume it will be just like the 2016 election. The weighted average model weights past elections based on recency (halving the weight of an election every four years) and number of votes (square root). Thus, higher-turnout elections are weighted more strongly, and the model gives predictions similar to 2016.", "The trend model extrapolates from the previous six elections using a linear regression for each state, based on five elections (1996\u20132016). The 2018 wave model adds the 2018 House elections to the trend model. As we go from left to right, the models shift from more Republican to more Democratic.", "Commonly accepted wisdom is that long-term trends favor Democrats; on the other hand, American history is full of cyclic and countercyclic ebb and flow.", "The next step is to adjust the models for each candidate. The baseline models are treated as estimates of how a Democratic candidate would perform.", "To make this adjustment, I used the differences between a candidate and the typical (median) Democrat in the same state and year, or in the same poll. Each of these is taken as an estimate of the difference between that candidate and a generic Democratic candidate.", "These polls are then weighted using the size of the poll and its date, going through the same exact weighting functions that are used for past elections in the weighted average model. The baseline model is then added back in with a fixed weight, which makes the prediction slightly more conservative if evidence is lacking.", "So, for example, the fact that Michael Bennet earned 48.1% of the vote in Colorado in 2010 when the typical Democrat earned 44.7% of the vote gives us an estimate that Michael Bennet would earn an extra 3.2% of the vote compared to a generic Democrat. This information is combined with all other pieces of information available \u2014 in this case, another election in 2016 and three recent national polls \u2014 to produce a state-specific estimate of the difference between Michael Bennet and a generic Democrat.", "For modeling Colorado\u2019s presidential election, Bennet\u2019s previous Colorado elections and polls are counted at full weight, along with our baseline model for Colorado. The national polls\u2019 weights are discounted by a factor of 0.25. For nearby states, like New Mexico, the model multiplies the weights of both the national polls and the Colorado elections by 0.25. For more distant states, like Florida, the Colorado elections are multiplied by a weight of 0.05.", "In Michael Bennet\u2019s case, what little information we have is positive, so the model predicts that he would gain compared to a generic Democrat.", "Many candidates, including Michael Bennet, have done better than a typical Democrat in their home state and so gain a home state advantage in the model \u2014 in line with conventional wisdom (e.g., see this paper).", "In general, we can separate the candidates into three groups based on the strength of our information.", "First, we have candidates that have featured in a lot of head-to-head polling: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Pete Buttigieg. Under the method described above, polling data plays a larger role for these candidates than their past election performance.", "Biden and Sanders have polled better than Warren and Buttigieg. This difference has been remarkably consistent over time \u2014 much more than the margins between Democratic candidates and Trump, which varies significantly both over time and from polls with different house effects.", "Since Biden and Sanders also have done better than the typical Democrat in their past elections, while Warren and Buttigieg have done worse, the model unambiguously predicts that Biden and Sanders would do better than Warren and Buttigieg.", "Any of the Democratic candidates could win or lose the election, and it\u2019s worth noting that even our best estimates have a lot of uncertainty to them, especially this far out. It may be the case that some of these candidates have hidden weaknesses or hidden strengths that haven\u2019t yet emerged into polling. The Electoral College is chaotic, and a few points here and there can make a very large difference.", "It may be the case that some of these candidates have hidden weaknesses or hidden strengths that haven\u2019t yet emerged into polling. It\u2019s also worth noting that the larger number of uncommitted voters in the models of Pete Buttigieg\u2019s performance is paired with lower name recognition. Correspondingly, we should place less confidence in the model\u2019s ability to predict his performance based on polls: Many voters have yet to form an opinion of Buttigieg.", "However, while name recognition plays a role in distorting polling numbers, other candidates with similar or lower levels of name recognition have polled better than Pete Buttigieg in head to head polls \u2014 most notably Beto O\u2019Rourke, whose head to head polling was clearly better in spite of similar national name recognition.", "Out of the twelve major candidates, seven have run for statewide office in the past, including the four front-runners who have featured in many head-to-head polls.", "Second, we have candidates who have not featured in as many national polls, but who have run for statewide office: Amy Klobuchar, Michael Bennet, and Deval Patrick. For these candidates, my models lean heavily on past election performance in their home state to infer national performance.", "As we can see in the above chart, this produces favorable results for Michael Bennet, strongly favorable results for Amy Klobuchar, and negative results for Deval Patrick. Klobuchar\u2019s performance in elections in Minnesota has been truly exceptional, significantly outpacing that of every other Democrat running alongside her. Additionally, Minnesota is near several battleground states \u2014 Iowa, Wisconsin, and Michigan.", "There are five other candidates of note who have never run for statewide office before \u2014 and who also have not featured in very many head to head polls. This includes Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, Tom Steyer, Michael Bloomberg, John Delaney. In this case, our model does not say very much \u2014 there simply isn\u2019t enough information. Even worse, what little information we have is potentially heavily impacted by low name recognition.", "Historically, it would be unusual to nominate a candidate who has never run for statewide office. Personally, I think Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard have the strongest ability to appeal to those who would not normally vote for Democrats. Thanks to the bad press she has attracted and her well-placed enemies within the party, Gabbard may have some difficulty holding onto Democratic votes.", "Now, what we\u2019ve seen is a very sparse sample of a very large and complex space of possible results. How robust are these results? That is to say, how well do they hold up under small changes to individual models? The Electoral College is a chaotic system, and the change of a small number of votes can produce surprisingly large changes in outcomes.", "We can run multiple simulations, adding random tweaks to the data. If those tweaks link nearby states, we can capture the way that regions often shift together.", "One way to look at this is to look at the distribution of outcomes for each candidate. The fact that Amy Klobuchar was rated more strongly wasn\u2019t a quirk of the choice of baseline; it is because the model includes past electoral records, and Klobuchar has an exceptional electoral history.", "In fact, none of the differences we observed by looking across six specific models disappear when we add noise to our simulation. A difference of just a few percentage points in likely total national support can make a large difference in outcomes in the Electoral College.", "Elections for the Senate in presidential years are strongly affected by presidential coattails. The Democratic presidential nominee will have an effect on the composition of the Senate; logically, a stronger candidate will help win more Senate seats.", "There are 35 seats up for election, including two in Georgia; the previous election for most of those seats was in 2014. Republicans hold 23 of these seats. In principle, this means that Republicans are vulnerable; however, most Republican incumbents are strongly favored for re-election.", "As a group, the four middle baseline models (Republicans winning a majority of somewhere in the 51 to 55 seat range) are in line with the expert predictions offered by Larry Sabato, Politico, the Cook Political Report, and most other expert prognosticators. However, only the 2018 wave model avoids any unusual baseline forecasts; West Virginia, Alabama, and Alaska are all difficult states for Democrats.", "It may be worth noting that this model also is one of the most optimistic models with respect to the presidential election: The 2018 wave model predicted that even the weakest Democratic presidential candidates would likely win the presidential race.", "Even if Democrats win the presidency in an election that goes similarly to how the 2018 midterm went \u2014 something that is by no means assured \u2014 it will be very difficult for them to win even a narrow majority in the Senate.", "There are is one major wildcard worth noting: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders represent states with Republican governors \u2014 meaning that if they leave the Senate, they will likely be replaced, at least temporarily, by Republican appointees. Both states are likely to elect a Democratic replacement in a special election, but special elections of this sort are particularly difficult to predict in advance (c.f. Massachusetts 2010, Alabama 2017); I\u2019ve counted this as a half seat for each of the two major parties for the purpose of reporting results.", "These predictions are highly plausible \u2014 and in spite of significant differences in vote totals, very similar for all candidates in terms of seats won. To win a Senate majority, Democrats need to outperform the expectations built by recent history, particularly in the South.", "With a clear choice of reasonable baseline model, it\u2019s easy to add noise to the Senate models \u2014 and this turns out to create a clearer difference between candidates. Most candidates\u2019 median results are slightly higher than their baseline prediction before noise, which is a fact that deserves some explanation.", "In the 2018 baseline model, most of the battleground states are projected to re-elect a Republican senator by a narrow margin. Adding noise to the model shows that Democrats are likely to pick up an additional seat somewhere \u2014 perhaps Montana, perhaps Maine, perhaps North Carolina.", "It\u2019s worth repeating that the 2018 wave model is, overall, a fairly optimistic model for Democrats. This is a model that suggests Democrats have a chance at winning Senate seats in states like Texas, where no Democrat has won a statewide election in decades.", "It\u2019s not the only \u2014 nor the most sophisticated \u2014 model of likely election results; but it does underline the large impact of a difference of just a few percent in the overall national vote.", "We\u2019ve tried to compare the Democratic contenders in terms of their ability to win votes. Both the Electoral College and the Senate are decided by winner-take-all elections at the state level, so a small national shift of a couple of percentage points can have dramatic effects.", "There is a clear pattern among the front-runners. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have performed better than a typical Democrat in elections in their home state and also perform better than a typical Democrat in head to head polls. Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg have performed worse, both in past statewide elections and in head to head polls.", "With other candidates, we have less information. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s consistently strong performances in statewide elections in Minnesota are truly exceptional, but this isn\u2019t coupled with much from national polling. Evidence for Michael Bennet\u2019s electability is positive, if limited.", "For candidates who have not run for statewide office before and haven\u2019t featured in many national polls, such as Andrew Yang, we simply don\u2019t have a lot of good information yet.", "Dr. Tomas McIntee is a mathematician and occasional social scientist with stray degrees in physics and philosophy."],
