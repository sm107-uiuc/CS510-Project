It can be used to reduce feature space dimensionality and produce uncorrelated features. As we will see, it can also help you gain insight into the classification power of your data. We will take you through the process of exactly how PCA can be used in this way. Snippets of Python code are provided and the full project can be found on GitHub.", "We\u2019ll start by brushing up on the theory. We won\u2019t go into much detail as there are loads of great resources if you want to understand how PCA works[1][2]. The important thing to know is that PCA is a dimensionality reduction algorithm. This means that it is used to reduce the number of features that you use to train models. It does this by constructing Principal Components (PCs) from many features.", "The PCs are constructed so that the first PC (i.e. PC1) explains the most variation in your features as possible. Then PC2 explains most of the variation in the leftover variation as possible and so on. PC1 and PC2 can often explain a significant proportion of the total feature variation. Another way of thinking about this is that the first two PCs can be good summaries of the features. This is important as it allows us to visualise the classification power of data on a 2-Dimensional plane.", "Okay, so let\u2019s dive into a practical example. We\u2019ll be using PCA to explore a breast cancer dataset [3] which we import using the code below. The target variable is the result of the breast cancer test \u2014 either malignant or benign. For each test, many cancer cells are taken. Then 10 different measures are taken from each of the cancer cells. These include measures like cell radius and cell symmetry. To get the final list of 30 features we aggregate these measures in 3 ways. That is we calculate the mean, standard error and largest (\u201cworst\u201d) value for each measure. In Figure 1, we take a closer look at two of these features \u2014 the mean symmetry and worst smoothness of the cells.", "In Figure 1, we see that these two features can help differentiate the two classes. That is the benign tumours tend to be more symmetrical and smooth. There is still a lot of overlap so a model using only these features would not do a very good job. We can create plots like this to gain an idea of how predictive each individual feature is. Although, with 30 features, there would be quite a few plots to analyse. They also don\u2019t tell us how predictive the dataset is as a whole. This is where PCA comes in.", "Let\u2019s start by doing PCA on the entire dataset. We do this using the code below. We start by scaling the features so they all have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1. This is important as PCA works by maximising the variance explained by the PCs. Some features will tend to have higher variances because of their scale. For instance, a distance measured in cm will have a higher variance than the same distance measured in km. Without scaling, the PCA will be \u201coverpowered\u201d by those features with high variances.", "Once the scaling is done, we fit the PCA model and transform our features into the PCs. As we have 30 features, we can have up to 30 PCs. For our visualisation, we are only interested in the first two. You can see this in Figure 2 where have used PC1 and PC2 to create the scatter plot. We can now see two distinct clusters which are much clearer than before in Figure 1.", "This plot can be used to build intuition for the predictive strength of your data. In this case, it suggests that using the entire dataset will allow us to separate malignant and benign tumours. However, there are still some outliers (i.e. points not clearly in a cluster). This does not mean we will make incorrect predictions for these cases. We should remember that not all feature variance is captured in the first two PCs. A model trained on the full feature set could produce better predictions.", "At this point, we should mention a caveat of this approach. PC1 and PC2 can explain a significant proportion of the variance in your features. However, this is not always true. In some cases, PCs can be considered bad summaries of your features. This means that, even if your data will separate the classes well, you may not get clear clusters as seen in Figure 2.", "We can use a PCA scree plot to determine if this would be a problem. We create the scree plot for this analysis, seen in Figure 3, using the code below. It is a bar chart where the height of each bar is the percentage of variance explained by the associated PC. We see that, together, only around 20% of the feature variance is explained by PC1 and PC2. Even with only 20% explained, we still get two distinct clusters. This emphasises the predictive strength of the data.", "We can also use this process to compare different groups of features. For example, suppose we had two groups of features. Group 1 has all the features based on cell symmetry and smoothness features. Whereas, Group 2 has all the features based on perimeter and concavity. We can use PCA to gain an intuition about which group would be more useful for making predictions.", "We start by creating the two groups of features. We then conduct PCA on each group separately. This will give us two sets of PCs and we select PC1 and PC2 to represent each of these feature groups. The results of this process can be seen in Figure 4.", "For Group 1, we can see there is some separation but there is still a lot of overlap. In contrast, for Group 2 there are two distinct clusters. So, from these plots, we would expect the features in Group 2 to be better predictors. A model trained using Group 2 features should have a higher accuracy than one trained using Group 1 features. Now, let\u2019s test this hypothesis.", "We use the code below to train a logistic regression model using both groups of features. In each case, we use 70% of the data to train the model and the remaining 30% to test the model. The accuracy on the test set for Group 1 was 74% and, in comparison, the accuracy for Group 2 was 97%. So the features in Group 2 are better predictors which is what we expected from the PCA results.", "In the end, we see how PCA can be used to gain a deeper understanding of your data before you start modelling. It will give you an idea of what sort of classification accuracy to expect. You will also build intuition around which features are predictive. This can give you an advantage when it comes to feature selection.", "As discussed, this approach is not full proof. It should be used alongside other data exploration plots and summary statistics. For classification problems, these could include Information Values and Box Plots. In general, it is a good idea to look at your data from as many different perspectives as possible before you start modelling.
