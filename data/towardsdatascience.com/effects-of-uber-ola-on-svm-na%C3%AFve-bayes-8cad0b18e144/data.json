Supervised machine learning is called a subfield of machine learning. As computers derive models from labeled training data. Recently, the field of machine learning has seen a rise in the popularity of probabilistic and statistical models. This paper focuses on showing the effects of SVM & Na\u00efve Bayes on our datasets. We gather 3000 tweets from Uber & Ola and we first clean it. The two algorithms have a set of words predefined in the library which it uses to find from the tweets. The words associated are positive, negative, or neutral. These algorithms find the words associated with these sentiments & then compare them. It later bifurcates it & does analysis in the form of graphs, diagrams. We check three things here while watching the effects of the two algorithms. The data on which the algorithm is applied is training data. Once for particular datasets in our case for the first 500 tweets, we train the data. Then we gradually increase the number of tweets i.e. we next train 1000 tweets & increment it to 3000 tweets. The first 500 trained tweets then are used as trained data, the new datasets or tweets are the testing data, and this testing or training data is compared with the tested or trained data.These are the following things we watch for in our effects from the algorithms. First the accuracy, second precision, third recall value. Accuracy defines how accurate is the model selected for the datasets. Precision talks about how perfect or precise are the method or how effective is the algorithm on the data sets. Does it also depend on how the data is like? Does the tweet have multilingual content (in the case of India) Is the data clean? Are there stop words? White spaces etc. Recall value checks whether the accuracy predicted is correct or isn\u2019t?! Finally, we represent the diagrammatic presentation of accuracies, confusion matrix, formulas & accuracy outputs.", "Machine Learning is very popular which uses computer science and statistics. Machine learning enables computers to understand data & devise new techniques to implement new algorithms. The process of developing algorithms that enable the machine to learn to perform a task in a particular manner is called Machine Learning. Now we have a vast variety of methods & techniques in machine learning for various functions. The two machine learning algorithms we have used for our data sets are SVM (Support Vector Machine) and Naive Bayes algorithms. SVM is suited for extreme cases, it is a frontier that best segregates the two classes (hyperplane/line). SVM\u2019s can be used in multi-dimensional data sets where data points are referred to as vectors. It is more often used in regression and classification problems. Naive Bayes follows a probabilistic approach to solve problems considering different factors. Even Naive Bayes is used for the classification of datasets, prediction-based problems, and review system problems. These algorithms are multi-purpose used and have been used previously to solve a wide variety of problems.Previously people have used Twitter sentiment analysis for various data sets, but we haven\u2019t come across Twitter sentiment analysis for Uber and Ola datasets. The idea behind doing Twitter sentiment analysis for Uber & Ola is the vast amount of data sets available. This will help us understand reviews of customers using the services of the cabs & give insights about the same. Support Vector classification aims is to understand a computationally efficient way of separating planes and learning how a \u2018good\u2019 separating hyperplane differentiates in a high dimensional feature. SVM is considered to be more accurate than Naive Bayes for different data sets. But in our data sets, Naive Bayes is more accurate & is helpful for large amounts of data sets. In Naive Bayes, each variable/function is independent of each other which is why the accuracy increases, unlike SVM which is dependent or related to each other. We focus on three important factors while determining the output\u2019s first accuracy, second precision & third recall value. Accuracy comparison amongst the two data sets helps us understand the effect of data sets on the two algorithms. Thus, using Twitter sentiment analysis, we find the best algorithm which gives the best accuracy for our data sets.", "The Algorithm considered in this project for classification purpose is SVM & Na\u00efve Bayes", "Support vector machines (SVM) is a supervised machine learning method and is a binary classifier. As an important example of the kernel method, SVM divides the data into different categories based on the classes with the help of hyperplane. As a supervised learning method, the algorithm is trained with labeled training data. SVM is known to be robust with a very large number of feature selection and smaller sample sizes which allows learning both simple and highly complex classification models.", "The Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm reduces the complexity of the Bayes theorem by assuming conditional independence over the training dataset. The principle that is followed by the algorithm is that every pair of features that have been classified is independent of each other. The probability of the feature is considered with the probability of an individual feature occurring divided by the probability of the remaining feature.", "The two algorithms used in the paper are Support Vector Machine (SVM) & Na\u00efve Bayes. The algorithm comparison between the two is decided based on the accuracy of both for example: in terms of accuracy if one algorithm gives better values it might be good for the particular datasets. Also, the other factor-dependent is Recall & Precision. Recall can be calculated on Positive & Negative also Precision can be calculated on Positive & Negative. Depending on all the values obtained after calculation, the best algorithm can be chosen.", "The formula for accuracy, recall & precision is", "In the above Table, the overall accuracy of two algorithms on two different datasets is calculated with the help of the confusion matrix. It can be seen that the SVM in both the datasets performed good but in comparison to Na\u00efve Bayes on both the datasets was not that good, as Na\u00efve Bayes in both datasets outperformed SVM.", "The above Table, explains the Precision comparison of positive tweets for respective datasets as it can be observed that Na\u00efve Bayes performed better with both the datasets.", "The table explains the Precision comparison of negative tweets for respective datasets as it can be observed that SVM performed better with both the datasets.", "The table displays the Recall comparison for positive tweets on test datasets and Na\u00efve Bayes performed better in comparison with SVM.", "The table displays the Recall comparison for negative tweets on test datasets, in this SVM, was giving better accuracy but Na\u00efve Bayes still outperformed both the datasets.", "The study aims to evaluate what effect does the datasets make on the classification algorithm and what accuracy, precision & recall values we get from it. In this paper, we used the two-classification algorithm SVM & Na\u00efve Bayes and as we can see from the above results, Na\u00efve Bayes outperformed both the datasets with an accuracy of 86.65% in the case of Uber & 73.64% in the case of Ola. Also, the datasets were increased with the interval of 500 to understand different accuracy, with that the precision of positive & negative tweets was calculated which showed that in case of positive tweets Na\u00efve Bayes was good and in case of negative tweets SVM was good. Similarly, the recall values of positive & negative tweets were calculated with that we saw that in the case of positive recall the Na\u00efve Bayes performed well and in the case of a negative recall, the Na\u00efve Bayes performed well. The Na\u00efve Bayes fits perfectly with the datasets we used in this research.", "[1] CHRISTOPHER, Burges JC. 1998. A tutorial on support vector machines for pattern recognition.
