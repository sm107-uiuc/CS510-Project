This ranges from predicting stock market sentiment based on tweets, to predicting the intent of a customer to automatically generate responses. Google\u2019s Word2Vec works well, but has a large problem.", "It requires a massive dataset. When google trained the Word2Vec Network, it used thousands of documents that it had special access to. It would be a nightmare to find, normalize and then use enough data of that quality for the program to work properly, making it futile to try to implement this into my own projects", "After thinking for a while, a formulated a technique to convert words into vectors, using a completely different concept than the word-grouping method that Google used.", "Let\u2019s work back from the end goal that we have: converting a word into a vector. Getting a vector as the direct output of the program is difficult, due to the fact that training the system for two variables of equal weightage (as in the case of a vector). So we can start by knowing that our final output will be a singular value. This value will still be converted into a vector, the first value being -1 or 1 (representing the positive or negative sentiment) and the second value being any value (representing the magnitude of the sentiment).", "If we generate a value for each word, we can use gradient descent to change this value, so as to calculate the correct sentiment every time.", "How is a propagation executed? Simple! Multiple all the values for each word in a tweet. Sigmoid this value, resulting in a value between 0 and 1, 0 being negative and 1 being positive.", "These libraries are necessary for the program to work.", "Change the XXXXX to the directory in which the dataset is stored. You can get the stock sentiment dataset from this link.", "Extracting the X and the y values of the dataset is simple, as it is in a similar form in the dataset.", "I have removed links, hashtags and company names from the dataset, so as to prevent the model only picking up sentiment from how well a company is doing at the moment.", "I also need to generate a list of unique word, so that the vectors can be assigned by index.", "Basically, calculating the gradient based on the other words in the tweet, I can alter the vectors in the correct way, so as to get a higher accuracy when predicting the sentiment of a tweet.", "This program allows us to see the severity and sentiment of the vectors, to observe the different conclusions that the program is drawing. Playing around with this and observing the results and finding obvious faults will improve results, after editing the way the dataset is cleaned and normalized.", "If you are still not convinced of using vectors to evaluate words, consider this property of vectors: Vectors have a magnitude, that can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. In all the vectors that we have looked at, they are all relative to the origin.", "If we consider the X axis to represent the severity of the sentiment, and the y axis as the positivity/negativity, we know that the origin would be completely neutral. By calculating the magnitude of the vector, it calculates how much the opinion deviates from the origin, or how extreme the opinion is.", "Here is the function that calculates this:", "If you want to see more of my content, click this link.", "Your home for data science.
