Imagine how that\u2019d make you feel! Now you have the option of creating a pipeline that accepts the dataset from the user and directly provides the model file (pickle file) using GitHub Actions.", "GitHub Actions helps us automate any software development workflow from code commit to deployment. Here we can write individual tasks known as actions that do a specific job for us. In this article, I am going to show you how you can create an action to build a Classifier model automatically when a dataset is given. Also, the action can be published on GitHub Marketplace making it available to others (to use our custom action).", "If you are new to Workflows and Actions, you can visit my previous article on GitHub Actions to get a brief overview.", "We don\u2019t want to make mistakes when we are designing a workflow, so let\u2019s make a plan for our custom action with a checklist.", "We need a Dockerfile in which the action will run. The necessary dependencies are installed which are required for model training and an Entrypoint is defined here.", "As I said earlier, this file helps us to define the inputs and outputs of the action. In our case, I am taking the input from the user for classification after the model is trained. We will also use the actions.yml file for branding our action in the Marketplace with icons and colors.", "The script is the main core part that makes the actions perform a task. Here we can use environment variables, access secrets, and any event data. We could consider using Python, Ruby, Java, C# for scripting.", "In the current action, we access the dataset uploaded by users in their GitHub repository through an environment variable GITHUB_REPOSITORY. Once we get the data, the output variable is encoded. I have used SVM for classification. As the model is built, it will be stored in the container for later use.", "NOTE: Here we are assuming that the dataset is clean and there are no missing values. The script can be different for different tasks, you can customize it accordingly. We can also perform several jobs like Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, and so on.", "Once all the necessary files are created and uploaded to GitHub, the repository should look as shown below.", "GitHub is smart enough to detect the action.yml file and will ask us whether we want to publish the action to Marketplace. Click on Draft a release.", "Before publishing, make sure you have enabled Two Factor Authentication for your GitHub account.", "If everything is fine, you can see the above console. Now provide the required details like primary category, description, tag name, etc. as shown below.", "Click on Publish release after filling the necessary details.", "Click on the Marketplace at the right-left corner.", "TADAAA!! Our action is released and now appears on Marketplace.", "Now that we have the action published in the Marketplace, let\u2019s see how we can use it in our workflow.", "When you click on Use latest version, a prompt will be displayed. We need to copy the code and use it in our workflow as shown below. For simplicity, I have used the Iris dataset to train the model and classify the flower. I have provided the inputs for testing the model.", "Now create a repository and upload the dataset to train the model. The name of the dataset file must be dataset.csv (in my case).", "Now Go to Actions on GitHub Console and click on set up a workflow yourself.", "Click on Start commit, give a commit message (optional) and click on Commit new file.", "Once you click on the Commit new file, the workflow beings. Go to Actions and you\u2019ll find the workflow with the same name as the commit message you gave earlier.", "Click on the workflow and you\u2019ll see the console output. You can see the output of your model for the given input and Accuracy of the model. On the top right corner, you can click on Artifacts and download the model file and use it on our local machine.", "This workflow gets triggered on push event i.e., whenever the user uploads the dataset or makes any changes to the dataset, the GitHub Action \u2014 Auto ML Classifier will build the model for us. This action can come handy when there\u2019s a problem building a model on our local machine. Also by adding various stages one can test the model and deploy it or deliver the application to users in various versions.", "The full code for Auto ML Classifier Action can be found on GitHub here.", "The full code for testing the action is found on GitHub here.", "In this article, we have seen how to create a GitHub Action that automates the building or training a Machine Learning Model once the dataset is provided. Also, the created action was published to Marketplace in the article. By using GitHub Actions we can achieve full-fledged continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) capabilities built right into the service.", "I\u2019ll be happy to hear suggestions in case you have any. I will come back again with another intriguing topic very soon. Till then, Stay Home, Stay Safe, and keep exploring!", "If you would like to get in touch, connect with me on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
