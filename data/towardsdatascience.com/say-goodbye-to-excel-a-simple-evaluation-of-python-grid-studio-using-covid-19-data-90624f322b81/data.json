A Simple Evaluation of Python Grid Studio Using COVID-19 Data | by Christopher Tao | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Say Goodbye to Excel? A Simple Evaluation of Python Grid Studio Using COVID-19 Data", "description": "Python Grid Studio, a Python-based spreadsheet application. Alternative to Excel and Google Sheets. Data Analysis, Data Analytics, Data Science and Data Visualisation tool."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://github.com/ricklamers", "anchor_text": "Rick Lamers", "paragraph_index": 27}], "all_paragraphs": ["Recently, I found an excellent open-source project \u201cGrid Studio\u201d. This library combines the advantages of the spreadsheet and Python in terms of data analytics.", "OK, this library can satisfy all your requirements.", "Before everything, let\u2019s have a look at how it looks like. Grid Studio is a Web-based application. Here is the Web UI.", "The UI is divided into 3 main panels.", "Therefore, with this library, you can use the code area to write your Python code and run it line-by-line just like Jupyter/iPython, and the \u201cPython out\u201d window will show the results. Also, you may synchronise your Pandas data frame to the spreadsheet to have an instant look.", "Let\u2019s start with the installation of Grid Studio. You will need docker on your local machine to run the source code. If you don\u2019t have a docker desktop at the moment, you can download it from here:", "After that, clone the repo at GitHub:", "Then, simply go to its root folder and run the starting script:", "It may take a couple of minutes to wait for docker to pull all the components. After that, you will be able to access the Web UI at", "I don\u2019t like to write examples for the sake of examples. So, let\u2019s use some real data to do some basic data analysis using Grid Studio.", "We can get COVID-19 confirmed cases data here:", "Download the data as a CSV file, which contains COVID-19 data for all countries in the world.", "We can directly read online CSV files via the link. Here I think there is an improvement of Grid Studio. That is, it does not like Jupyter Notebook that can instantly print your variables. If you want to print your variables, you have to use theprint method.", "Another limitation is that it looks like the spreadsheet does not support datetime type very well. During the testing, I found that it cannot display pandas column with datetime64[ns] type. So, I would like to convert the dateRep column into integers.", "Firstly, let\u2019s filter the data by country. For example, I\u2019m interested in Australian data only.", "Then, we will select only the dateRep, cases and deaths columns.", "After that, sort the data frame by the date so that we can calculate the cumulative cases and deaths.", "Now, we should have 5 columns in our Pandas data frame, which are date, new cases, new deaths, cumulative cases and cumulative deaths. Let\u2019s render the data frame into the spreadsheet.", "Grid Studio makes it very easy to do this. By calling its API sheet, we simply specify the top-left cell that the data frame will be rendered, and then pass on the data frame variable.", "If you would like to show the headers, you can also specify header=True in the sheet method.", "When the data is in the spreadsheet, we can use it just like the other regular software such as Excel and Google Sheets. I won\u2019t demonstrate the formula features such as SUM, AVG and etc. that everyone would be familiar with.", "One of the most useful features is that you can easily export the spreadsheet into CSV. That means we can use the power of Pandas data frame to easily download and transform the data, then export to use other software to do further analytics.", "Another one I believe that is quite useful is plotting the data using matplotlib by clicks. For example, if we want to plot the daily new cases, just simply select the \u201cnew cases\u201d column and right-click on it as shown in the screenshot below.", "Then, on the bottom right corner, you can find the plot in the \u201cPlots\u201d tab.", "In fact, Grid studio has done this plot by auto-generating code. Here is the code that is generated for the above chart.", "So, we can add some annotations if necessary. For example, we can add a title to this chart:", "Similarly, we can plot the 4 columns separately using the same procedures. The following 3 more charts were generated by simple clicks and adding titles which took me 30 seconds in total!", "It is clear that using Grid Studio to perform some simple data analysis would be very quick and convenient. Thanks to Rick Lamers who is the author for his amazing idea.", "While I really like the idea of this application that combines spreadsheet and Python, I have to say that it is still far away from mature. At least some limitations and potential improvements need to be resolved and implemented in my opinion:", "If you feel my articles are helpful, please consider joining Medium Membership to support me and thousands of other writers!
