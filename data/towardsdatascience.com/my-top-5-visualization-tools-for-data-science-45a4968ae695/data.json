We spent a lot of time doing manual processing and didn\u2019t have much time left for finding insights or making recommendations. Over the last decade, we have seen the rise of a myriad of modern tools when it comes to data visualization. Technology has come a long way.", "In this article, I will first list my top 5 visualization tools for data science, and then explain when to use them depending on your audience.", "Excel is used everywhere by everybody. I have never met any analytics professional who hasn\u2019t used Excel. Believe it or not, even today, some data scientists are predominantly using Excel for their day to day work.", "The benefit of Excel is obvious: it\u2019s everywhere. If you want to share a piece of work with someone, you never need to worry about if they can open the file or not.", "Moreover, ad-hoc tasks liking tweaking a number here or there are so easy. Everything is transparent. You can see exactly what each cell is doing.", "Because of these two advantages, I believe Excel still has its place in the foreseeable future.", "I started using Tableau around 7 years ago. We had to build a business case for it as it\u2019s not free. Is it worth the price tag? Definitely!", "Here are a few things that I can do easily in Tableau which I can\u2019t in Excel:", "Tableau has a lot of other features. For example, you could build interactive dashboards and make them available to a lot of other users. This is how you can cut down the workload of a BI team and make people self-sufficient, instead of coming to you for help every time something minor needs to be changed.", "The main use case for me is exploratory data analysis. In my opinion, nothing beats Tableau in this area.", "To get an idea of what Tableau is capable of delivering, here\u2019s a recent data visualization I produced for the Coronavirus outbreak:", "In many aspects, Power BI is similar to Tableau. I may be biased, but after using it for some time, I found that in some areas the user experience is not as good as Tableau.", "For example, if you want to reorder a variable in a chart, you need to create a custom order which is explained via 11 screenshots in the tutorial below. In Tableau this can be done in 1 to 2 steps via drag-and-drop, saving you a lot of time.", "Having said that, I think Power BI does dashboards better, and most importantly, there\u2019s a free desktop version (which doesn\u2019t allow collaboration with your team but is often good enough for one user).", "If you don\u2019t have the budget but still want to be more efficient, Power BI is the answer.", "If you know R or Python, you could benefit from the rich set of interactive charts offered by Plotly. Most of the charts you can do in Tableau can be replicated in Plotly.", "\u201cIf I have Tableau or Power BI, why do I need Plotly\u201d?", "Imagine you are monitoring the mix of business by quarter for an insurance portfolio. There are 20 different categorical variables including region, product, gender, etc.", "Assuming you are quite proficient, and each chart takes you 2 minutes to do in Tableau. That\u2019s 2*20=40 minutes.", "Doing this using Python and Plotly is different. You may need to spend 10 minutes to write the code for your first chart. (Yes, programing is harder than drag-and-drop!)", "Next, you spend 5 minutes to write a loop to create a chart for each of the 20 variables. In total, that\u2019s 10 + 5 = 15 minutes.", "With the benefit of a for loop, the amount of effort grows by much less than a factor of 20. Moreover, you can now save the code and reuse it for your future projects.", "Typically I use Plotly in Jupyter Notebooks which I can share with my colleagues.", "Say you\u2019ve built a machine learning model to predict the profitability of each insurance policy. Rather than having the model sitting on your hard drive collecting dust, you want every underwriter in your company to use it in their daily work. To do this, you can build a Dash based web application.", "Here\u2019s another example of what you can build with Dash: Using the historical Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) match results, Jason Chan built a machine learning model to predict future match results. Rather than stopping here, Jason deployed the model for everyone to use.", "Note: If you prefer R to Python, you should try R Shiny.", "Having seen the top 5 visualization tools, you might be tempted to use the most advanced solution (Dash) in every use case.", "This is like having seen the predictive power of Deep Learning, you might be tempted to throw every other technique into the bin and use Deep Learning for every single project you do.", "This is a very bad approach.", "We need to consider our audience and tailor our visualization approach to match their needs. It may be helpful to put them into a few different groups.", "These people are the key decision-makers of the organization. They don\u2019t have a lot of time. They are more concerned about insights and recommendations, rather than technical details. Their mind is always looking for answers to these questions:", "What should we do and what risks am I taking?", "To them, I believe the best visualization method is putting a few PowerPoint slides together to answer these questions directly.", "You can use Tableau or Plotly or even Excel to create the graphs. It doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is you need to answer the key questions directly and succinctly. Otherwise, your audience will be disengaged, which means your hard work doesn\u2019t translate into actions and gets wasted.", "These are the people who use your tools. Let\u2019s see some examples in the insurance industry:", "Outside the insurance industry, you might have repairers of a bike-sharing platform, where they reply on an interactive dashboard to find nearby broken bikes to collect and check.", "Regarding tools, if your organization has already invested in Power BI or Tableau, then it makes sense for you to follow the existing approach.", "If you want to build something from scratch and take advantage of the full flexibility, you could use Dash.", "For this group of people, I prefer delivering Plotly graphs using Jupyter Notebooks.", "I like them because I can deliver reproducible analyses easily. Everything including code, output, and graphs are in one place, making it very easy for people to conduct peer reviews.", "For simple ad hoc analyses, I also use Tableau and Excel extensively.", "While the above 3 groups typically represent the most important stakeholders, occasionally you may encounter stakeholders falling outside these groups.", "If they are technical people, you could follow the same approach as Group 3. If they are non-technical, Excel, Tableau or Power BI may be a good choice. Just make sure your audience has access to the software and knows how to use it.", "We have seen the pros and cons of the top 5 visualization tools for data science.", "There is no single tool that dominates over all the others. However, for a given audience, some tools are more appropriate than others.", "As data scientists, we spend a lot of time looking into data and building models, but have we spent enough time thinking about our stakeholders? Who are they? What\u2019s their technical capability? How can we deliver the results in a manner that\u2019s most engaging to them?", "To unleash the full power of data science, we need to try our best to turn our data-driven recommendations into real-world actions \u2014 whether it\u2019s making the product line more profitable, or capturing more fraudulent cases or maximizing revenue.", "To do this, we must start by studying our audience carefully and selecting the most suitable delivery method for them.", "Your home for data science.
