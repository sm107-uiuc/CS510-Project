However, in real-life scenario, the data distribution is mostly skewed and some of classes appear much more frequently than others. So, when facing such disproportions we must design an intelligent system that is able to overcome such a bias.", "Here, we will work with a multi-class problem where data are taken from UCI ML library as shown below.", "Here, we have different chemical compositions in the features and different type of glasses as multi-class. The problem presents chemical compositions of various types of glass with the objective of the problem is to determine the use for the glass.", "We can observe that the data is somewhat unbalanced. Each class runs from 76 for the most populous class to 9 for the least populous. The average statistics can be dominated by the values for the most populous classes and there\u2019s no reason to expect members of other classes to have similar attribute values. The radical behavior can be a good thing for distinguishing classes from one another, but it also means that a method for making predictions has to be able to trace a fairly complicated boundary between the different classes.", "Let us view the box-plot on normalized data. We have normalized the data using mean and std. deviation.", "Significant numbers of outliers can be observed here. We have a multilevel classification problem. More so, the data is somewhat unbalanced.", "We will use normalized data for plotting parallel co-ordinate plot to keep the scale uniform. Moreover, because the dynamic nature of parallel co-ordinate plot calculation plays a big role in display.", "The green blue lines group together fairly well and are well separated from the other classes along a number of the attributes. Moreover, green lines are at the edges of the data for several attributes \u2014 in other words, outliers along those attributes. The middle blue lines also group together but toward the mid\u2010range in value.", "PPS finds more pattern in the data and detects linear or non-linear relationships. The score ranges from -1 to 1 and indicates if there is a strong linear relationship. PPS use a cross-validated Decision Tree and calculate a suitable evaluation metric. To know more, please visit here.", "The non-linear relationships are identified by \u20180\u2019 values. The targets are not included in the correlation map because the problem has targets that take on one of several discrete values.", "From exploratory analysis, we get a good understanding of the trade-offs for this problem, leading to some guesses about what algorithm will give the best performance. Here, data-size is small and problem is somewhat complex considering multiple classes are involved with an imbalanced data set.", "We probably need a non-linear tree based algorithm to target this use case. We are going to try Decision Tree (DT) which segment the feature space into a number of smaller regions, by repeatedly splitting the features at a certain value. To do so, DT use a greedy algorithm together with some heuristics to find a split that minimizes the combined impurity of the children nodes. Out of many algorithms which comes under DT, we shall try Random Forest here.", "Random Forests use trees, which split the data into groups (repeatedly) according to whether a case is above or below a selected threshold value on a selected feature variable. Input outliers don\u2019t have extra influence. Output outliers will affect the estimate of the leaf node they are in, but not the values of any other leaf node. Output outliers have a \u201cquarantined\u201d effect on Random Forest. Evan Elg", "Because of imbalanced classes, we opted for stratified sampling during train test split.", "We want to evaluate the effect of the number of observations in our training set on some metric (accuracy, F1, etc.).", "It is actually visualizing the performance (e.g., accuracy, recall) of our model on the training and during cross-validation as the number of observations in the training set increases. We have plotted the accuracy of our fitted classifier at 100 different training set sizes ranging from 1% of observations to 100%. The increasing accuracy score of the cross-validated models tell us that we would likely benefit from additional observations. This is a slow process.", "Following codes taken from sklearn guide:", "We will use one-versus-all approach which has a distinctive advantage with the labels.", "Across the board, we can see that our model provided good insight into classifying types of glasses given the data set we have.", "This suggests that, probably not much value in the computational cost of training a massive forest. So, we can retrain out model with less number of trees to evaluate the performance.", "It is always advisable to compare with other models with the same data set. However, multi label classification has become a very important paradigm in the last few years. With the advancement in ML algorithm, in recent version of RandomForest, there is no need for cross-validation or a separate test set to get an unbiased estimate of the test set error. It is estimated internally, during the run. Each tree is constructed using a different bootstrap sample from the original data. About one-third of the cases are left out of the bootstrap sample and not used in the construction of the kth tree. Moreover, it would be a good idea to train a logistic regression model using the stochastic average gradient (SAG) solver to compare.", "Note: The programs described here are experimental and should be used with caution for any commercial purpose.
