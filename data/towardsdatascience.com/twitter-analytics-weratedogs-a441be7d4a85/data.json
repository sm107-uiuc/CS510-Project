For one of its wrangling projects, I was given an opportunity to go through the whole data analysis process \u2014 collecting the data, cleaning the data, analyzing the data and finally visualizing the data.", "The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people\u2019s dogs with humorous comments.", "Most of the focus of this project was on data wrangling. So what exactly is data wrangling?", "Data wrangling refers to the process of cleaning, restructuring and enriching the raw data available into a more usable format.", "I have used various python libraries in this project, below are the ones I got started with.", "The data for this project was in three different formats:", "1.Twitter Archive File \u2014 WeRateDogs: WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and shared it exclusively for use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.", "This was extracted programmatically by Udacity and provided as a csv file to use.", "2. Image Prediction File: The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog is present in each tweet according to a neural network is stored in this file. It was hosted on Udacity\u2019s servers in tsv format and had to be downloaded programmatically using the Url.", "Python\u2019s request library was used to gather this data from the web. Requests is a versatile HTTP library in python with various applications. One of its applications is to download or open a file from web using the file URL.", "3. Twitter API \u2014 JSON File: By using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, I queried the Twitter API for each tweet\u2019s JSON data using Python\u2019s tweepy library.", "Tweepy is an open source Python package that gives you a very convenient way to access the Twitter API with Python. You can find more details on setting up an app in twitter and accessing Twitter API using Python.", "Further, each tweet\u2019s entire set of JSON data was stored in a file called tweet_json.txt.", "Each tweet\u2019s JSON data is written to its own line and then the .txt file is read line by line into a pandas DataFrame.", "After gathering the data, the three tables were saved and assessed Visually and Programmatically. With both the assessments I looked for Unclean data in all the three DataFrames, i.e. for Tidiness and quality issues.", "Quality: Low quality data is commonly referred to as dirty data. Dirty data has issues with its content. The Data Quality Dimensions are Completeness, Validity, Accuracy and Consistency.", "Tidiness: Untidy data is commonly referred to as \u201cmessy\u201d data. Messy data has issues with its structure. Tidy data is where:1. Each variable forms a column.2. Each observation forms a row.3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.", "Visual Assessment provided me with issues such as Non-descriptive column headers and repetitive columns in the three Datasets.Programmatic Assessment actually gave me most of the quality issues such as incorrect data types and duplicate data that were present in the three datasets. I then documented the gist of my assessment in the python notebook.", "Cleaning means acting on the assessments we made to improve quality and tidiness.", "Improving quality doesn\u2019t mean changing the data to make it say something different \u2014 that\u2019s data fraud. Quality improvement means Correcting when inaccurate, Removing when irrelevant and Replacing when missing.", "Similarly, improving tidiness means transforming the dataset so that each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.", "I followed the programmatic Data Cleaning process i.e. Define, Code and Test. I converted my observations from the assess step into defined problems, translated these definitions to sophisticated code to fix these problems, then tested the three datasets to make sure the operations worked.", "After cleaning the data, I found out that there was no need for three data sets. All the data could be easily converted into a single file. So, I concatenated the three DataFrames on a common attribute twitter_id, to create the twitter_archive_master.csv.", "Using this freshly cleaned WeRateDogs Twitter data, interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations were created to communicate back the findings.", "WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people\u2019s dogs with humorous comments. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators though is almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \u201cthey\u2019re good dogs Brent\u201d. WeRateDogs believes almost all dogs deserve a 10 or sometimes more than that. Each tweet\u2019s retweet count and favorite (i.e. \u201clike\u201d) count are another interesting parameters.", "So, what to do with these ratings? With dogs, the best common question has to be which is the most popular dog? Can we get any relationship between Retweets, Favorites and Ratings? I have analyzed the data to get answers to these questions.", "Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn have helped me with some cool visualizations for my analysis.", "Analyzing my data based on the first predictions gave me the top 10 most popular dog breeds.", "Golden Retriever is the most popular dog. These dogs have most tweets on them, which has led them on our most popular list.", "We have the jpg_url of dogs in our data. Pythons io module is used to manage the file-related input output operations. I have used Pillow, the friendly PIL fork \u2014 Python Imaging Library to get the image of our most popular dog Golden Retriever that tops the list as per the count.", "Amazingly many of the tweets have been retweeted. Some of the tweets have nearly 40000 retweets.", "I tried to find out if there is any relationship between the Retweets, the ratings, and the favorites through a Correlation plot, one of the coolest plots in python. I used the seaborn library to generate a heatmap.", "There is no clear relationship between the retweets and the ratings. But there is a strong positive correlation between Favorites and retweets i.e a linear relationship between the retweet counts and the favorite counts. The same can be confirmed by the below scatterplot.", "So, the insight here is retweets usually are the favorites, but we cannot say that all the retweets are favorite or vice a versa.", "During my analysis, I found that there is a strong linear relationship between the Favourites count and the Retweets count of a given Tweet.Golden retriever is the most popular dog and it along with Labrador Retriever, Pembroke, Chihuahua and Pugs complete the top 5 common dog breeds in the data.", "Many other parameters in this Dataset can be analyzed for different insights and visualizations. Since the primary focus of this project was Data Wrangling, more time was spent in that section.", "For Udacity, I had to submit two reports along with the Python notebook. The first report was an internal document, the wrangle_report, that briefly describes the wrangling efforts and the second one was an external document (like a blog post or magazine article, for example), the act_report, that communicates the insights and displays the visualizations produced from the wrangled data.", "A data wrangler knows their data intimately and is always looking for ways to enrich the data. I have done the same using amazing Python Libraries. This project was one of my most fun data experiences, so much that I decided to write my first blog on it. You can view the project, along with my reports on my Github.", "Your home for data science.
