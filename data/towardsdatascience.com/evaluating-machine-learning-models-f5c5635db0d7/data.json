This is the crucial moment for a data scientist, when they find out whether they\u2019re going to see their work take flight, or whether it\u2019s back to the drawing board. It\u2019s also an important process for the decision maker, as wrongly approving an algorithm can result in disruption and cost if crucial mistakes are only caught after the fact, or worse don\u2019t get caught at all.", "Understanding the key factors in making that decision is therefore important both for the data scientist developing algorithms, and for the people who are going to be relying on them. In this blog we\u2019ll talk through some key components of this decision, using a model built for the purpose on open source IMDB data.", "Context is king when understanding a model, so let\u2019s spend some time sketching that out. Let\u2019s say our model is being built on the request of a movie studio executive disappointed with a string of movies with lack-lustre reviews. The idea behind the model is that it will be used to predict the review score of a movie when it is being pitched, and so give the movie commissioning team more information on whether to approve or reject the pitch.", "We\u2019ll use the IMDB user ratings as a guide for quality for our model. This is a rating assigned by users of the site, with anyone being able to leave a rating (let\u2019s leave aside the question of whether that\u2019s actually a good metric for quality for now!). After a couple of weeks of crunching the numbers, our data scientist has a model to present to the movie executive, using a random forest regression model. Is it good enough to be used by the team? Read on\u2026.", "The most natural question to ask is how accurate is the model. This seemingly simple question can be approached in a number of ways, and it\u2019s easy to throw a barrage of accuracy metrics out there but still leave stakeholders none the wiser. Here are some tips on presenting this in a way that will help both you and your stakeholders get a grip on what your model is really capable of:", "Picking the right metric is a question of understanding how the model will be used. In our case:", "Let\u2019s say for now that the last option is closest to how the model will be used. For this reason we\u2019ll pick R2 as that gives a good feel for how close an individual prediction will be to the true outcome.", "Now we\u2019ve selected our error metric we can confidently tell our stakeholder that the R2 for our model is 0.3 (on the validation set of course). It\u2019s hard to say from merely quoting this what\u2019s going on though, so visualizing the metric can go a long way to giving stakeholders a more tactile sense of accuracy. For R2 the most sensible visualization is probably a scatter plot, which you can see below.", "Model Predicted rating vs. Actual Rating on validation set (2020 movies)", "This tells us a lot more than just a simple R2 metric. Firstly we can see that though there\u2019s definitely a relationship between the prediction and the actual result, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around any given prediction.", "Also, we see that there\u2019s a \u201cbunching\u201d of the predictions around the average 5\u20137 ratings which we see less of in the actual results. This reflects a lack of predictive power in the model: it doesn\u2019t have enough information to differentiate high from low so it \u201cguesses\u201d results around the average score as that will give it the minimum R2. This also means that it will generally understate the difference in average review rating between portfolios of movies, as it will drag both a portfolio of good movies and bad movies towards the mean value.", "The best way benchmark your algorithm is to compare it to how decisions would be made if your algorithm wasn\u2019t used. In our case, instead of rolling out a complex model to our movie commissioning team, it may be easier to come up with a simple heuristic, say: \u201cthe movie rating will be similar to the average of the rating of the last five movies made by that director\u201d. This works as it\u2019s easy to understand and can be quickly assessed by anyone with an internet connection. So how does our algorithm do?", "In this case, the heuristic gives an R2 of 0.14, so is about half as accurate as our model. That\u2019s good news, and gives us some confidence that our model is adding value over more simple approaches.", "Standard model accuracy metrics like R2 and RMSE can be quite abstract, so it can often be valuable to create metrics that are more tactile and closely related to how the model will be used. In this case, a good metric is the average actual rating of the top 100 movies with the highest predicted rating, which is 8.92. This is better, as it gives a clear real-world view of what the model will achieve.", "Again, we can compare this with our benchmark heuristic, which gives a similar value of 8.13, so our algorithm is 0.79 better by this metric. Is this enough to justify the algorithm roll out? That can depend, but now our movie commissioner can make a trade off of \u201cif I spend the necessary time/energy to get my movie commissioning team to adopt this, I\u2019ll get on average 0.79 higher ratings for my movies\u201d.", "In many cases it\u2019s necessary to assess not just overall accuracy, but accuracy for different groups or sub-sections of the data. In our case we may want to check the model is not treating male or female directors differently, a not uncommon problem that our movie commissioner is keen to avoid. Looking at the R2 we see 0.29 for female directors and 0.3 for male directors, so it seems the model is pretty much equally accurate for these populations, which is good news. Of course that\u2019s not the whole story on bias, and we\u2019ll touch on this more later.", "Now we have a good handle on how accurate the model is, let\u2019s get to know how it \u201cthinks\u201d a little better.", "It\u2019s common for people to switch off at this stage, especially given the somewhat nerdy image of data science and the much-publicized \u201cblack box\u201d nature of many algorithms. Despite the complexity though, a lot can be done to give a non-technical audience a feel for how a model is making decisions.", "Firstly, there\u2019s a feature importance plot. Most ML packages make a form of this available, which indicates how much each variable is being used by the model to make decisions (in the case of a random forest, how much the feature decreases impurity when splitting on that feature).", "Here we see some expected behavior, and some weirdness. Many of the important features relate to how previous movies by the director, writer or actors have rated, which makes sense. However, the length of the movie appears to be the most important factor in the model, which doesn\u2019t sound right. Let\u2019s use a partial dependence plot to understand what\u2019s going on:", "Here we see what the issue might be: there appears to be two \u201clevels\u201d of review score, one for \u201cshorts\u201d i.e. 10\u201330 minute mini-movies, and one for more normal length features. It seems that, on average, shorts get higher reviews than full length features. This may well be a real phenomenon with shorts either attracting a different reviewer audience, people liking shorter films, or some unseen feature that is more prevalent in the \u201cshort\u201d movie category. On the face of it though, film length doesn\u2019t intuitively feel like it should impact quality, so we may decide to remove this feature provided it doesn\u2019t heavily impact accuracy, a decision that can be discussed with our movie commissioner.", "We can also check some of the other high impact features to see if the model is treating them in a sensible way. Let\u2019s take the next most important variables, the mean rating of the director\u2019s last 5 movies, and the mean of the actor\u2019s last 5 movies (weighted by how highly ranked in the movie billing the actor is).", "Both of these give fairly sensible and intuitive results, the higher rating the actors and directors have had in the past, the more likely future movies by them will get a high rating. Looking closer does reveal some interesting behavior however: there\u2019s an S shape to the variable impact, implying that beyond a certain level good previous ratings don\u2019t matter. With the director\u2019s most recent movies this S curve decrease in impact mostly happens where there\u2019s little data, but for the mean actor rating we see that quite a lot of the movies occur after the variable stops having a significant impact, implying beyond around 6.5\u20137 it doesn\u2019t significantly influence average rating. Bad actors can tank a movie, but great actors can\u2019t make a mediocre movie great.", "In summary then, our model is not that dissimilar to the heuristic we calculated earlier, only it takes into account a wider range of similar heuristics, takes the length of the movie into account (unless we remove this feature). Of course, one could go into more detail here, but this gives a good overview for our movie commissioner.", "For all the clever visualizations and interpretation techniques, there can often be little substitute for just showing the model in action on some examples to give people a feel of how it\u2019s working.", "One should take care in picking examples, it can be very tempting to go \u201coh that\u2019s a weird result, let\u2019s hide that\u201d, but that\u2019s a bad habit. Firstly one would be misleading the stakeholder on how the model will actually perform, but also exposing oneself to later criticism: if you show some of the bad results up front and the model still gets approved, the stakeholder can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned. However, if you\u2019ve hidden inconvenient results the stakeholder may reasonably ask why they\u2019re seeing odd outputs only after agreeing to deploy the model.", "Whilst there should always be an element of randomness in picking examples, using a purely blind random selection may not be the best approach if one is only going to show a few, as the odds of them being unrepresentative are quite high. Instead, there are more guided approaches worth discussing.", "Firstly, one can pick well known examples that the stakeholder is likely to be familiar with, like below where I\u2019ve picked randomly from the top 50 most popular (by vote count) movies of 2020. This has the advantage of being something the stakeholder can engage with and have an opinion about, and so mean you\u2019re more likely to get meaningful feedback and nuggets of context you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have got.", "Alternatively, if there aren\u2019t obvious examples, one can pick the most representative in certain categories, for example the \u201ctypical\u201d action movie or romance, in the case of films. If the categories aren\u2019t obvious, a clustering algorithm can be used to identify sub-populations in the data to sample from. This has the advantage of allowing one to identify the centroid and so enabling you to pick the most mathematically representative example from a given cluster.", "Now we\u2019ve got our examples, we see some good predictions (\u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d) and some not so good ones (\u201cExtraction\u201d). Whilst one can\u2019t draw general conclusions from these, they can make the general conclusions shown in previous charts more real.", "Note that I\u2019ve put the heuristic we discussed earlier in as well, so one can see how predictive that is. This is useful as we see that though the model outperforms the heuristic in aggregate, it won\u2019t always outperform it (e.g. \u201cGretel & Hansel\u201d, \u201cSonic\u201d, and \u201cExtraction\u201d). Whilst statisticians have had it drummed into them that an average performance improvement is not a guaranteed performance improvement, a few examples can help clearly make the point to those who haven\u2019t been\u2026 er\u2026 lucky?\u2026 enough to have that training.", "One of the main things on a stakeholder\u2019s mind is in what way the model will change how their teams, systems or processes function. When a model optimizes it usually doesn\u2019t do so in a neutral way. Rather, models aim to improve a specific outcome in part by favoring some groups and disfavoring others. Therefore, it\u2019s important to understand and communicate to the stakeholder what the impacts might be.", "For example, we saw in the feature importance plot that the model paid particular attention to horror movies. Does this mean they could be disfavored by the algorithm? This could be a key point for our movie commissioner to understand, as this may mean that in using this model less horror movies get made. Let\u2019s look at that in more detail along with the gender of the director and the short/full movie distinction that we also touched on earlier:", "Here we see that the model doesn\u2019t penalize female directors, though these remain under-represented in the data. Also horror movies do better rather than worse out of our model, so again little concern there.", "On \u201cshorts\u201d however we see a much more pronounced impact, the model has identified that shorts generally get higher scores than full length movies, and so is really pushing those kinds of movies even beyond what we see in the actual results. This may not be what the movie commissioner wants, and so would be a key consideration in deploying the model. One option might be to have separate thresholds or quotas for shorts and regular movies, all the way through to forcing a similar distribution of scores for shorts and full length movies in the output.", "One can do this with any set of metrics or features. The skill here is in determining which output characteristics are relevant to the model context, and what the stakeholders are likely to be interested in.", "Hopefully you now have a pretty good understanding of how the model is functioning, and whether you\u2019d want to use it in the wild. There\u2019s no right answer here, it\u2019s a question of how valuable the gains are and how those trade off against the complexity and consequences of rolling out such a model (this author would lean to the heuristic on the basis that it\u2019s simpler and doesn\u2019t perform that much worse).", "The overarching point here though isn\u2019t about movies or this particular model, but in the steps and approaches one can use to explain a model to a non-technical stakeholder, and also the right questions to ask as a stakeholder when an ML model is presented to you. To recap:", "As AI is integrated into more and more of our lives and professional environments, it\u2019s vital for people to learn the right questions to ask of these algorithms to ensure they\u2019re actually adding value and not causing unintended harms under the surface. Great data science often uses black box algorithms, but it should never be a black box.", "If you\u2019re interested in exploring these ideas further I\u2019d highly recommend a few of the papers and blogs below, as they\u2019re a sample of the literature the author has drawn inspiration from in writing this blog.", "Your home for data science.
