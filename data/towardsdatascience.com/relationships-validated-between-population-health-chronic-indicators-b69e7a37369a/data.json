The beginnings of the exploratory data analysis started with understanding the columns and rows of data and what was relevant for further analysis.", "In this post, we are going to dig deeper to understand these 400K rows and 17 categories of topics, which requires a bit of data wrangling of the dataframe into a format for pivot table summary and visualization. After looking at the previous df_new.head(), I don\u2019t think we will use the following columns, which results in a smaller set of 15 columns:", "Table 1: Summarizing by Topic, Question, and Value", "Using a pivot table (much like Excel), let\u2019s summarize each Question and its related values. To inform each of the questions and values, we\u2019ll create multiple indexes from the category of each question (Topic), the QuestionID, Question, the unit of the data (DataValueUnit), and the type of the data relevant to the stratifications later (DataValueType). Pandas Pivot_table requires numeric values, and defaults to averages (numpy.mean). Further, I\u2019ve dropped columns LocationID and YearStart since I won\u2019t be using these later, and rounded to two decimals for readability:", "Table 2: Using Groupby with Stratification, Question, and Value", "Alternative to the pivot_table, I can create a similar summary table using groupby(). I want to show a bit more information on the stratification in the resulting dataframe.", "Table 3: Summarizing by Question and Location", "An interesting approach would showing the data by each state (LocationAbbr) with the data values. The following pivot table includes additional indexes that provide context to the numbers such as the unit and type.", "Now we\u2019ve seen the tables present the data values by question, by stratification, and by location. That\u2019s still a lot of information! Let\u2019s understand what the question indicators say about itself. What are the relationships between each pair of question indicators? This is where visualization of the data will paint a picture to understand the overall relationships.", "Originally, I started out using the pivot_table from Table 3 but the axis labels were too long and difficult to read. Backing up slightly, we\u2019re going to create a different pivot_table (df_new_qloc2) based on the new the column QuestionAbbr to take the first 37 characters of Question:", "By transposing df_new_qloc2 pivot table, we\u2019re ready to apply the correlation method .corr() and visualize the data. Using the code from the seaborn documentation, we can plot a correlation matrix heatmap. This visualizes each pair of indicators to understand where the positive correlation pairs reside. Since a correlation matrix yields duplicate views above and below the diagonal, we\u2019ll mask the upper half of the heatmap for simplicity by creating an array of zeros using np.zeros_like() and returning the indices of the region above the diagonal using triu_indices_from(). Using matplotlib, we set a large figure size to allow zooming in on the jupyter notebook. The cmap sets the colormap for the figure (more options here). Lastly, sns.heatmap() renders the heatmap with the mask.", "Even with some tweaking, the information is dense and could be more user friendly to read (we\u2019ll address this in the next post). Still, the heatmap axes show the topic, QuestionID, and the abbreviated question QuestionAbbr. We can see some areas with more positive correlation in pink and more negative in green. Visually, there are areas in the Cardiovascular (CVD) and Cancer (CAN) that appear to have higher correlation. It\u2019s helpful to see this presentation but ultimately, we will want to have a more granular look by creating a list of top correlation.", "Table 5. Top Correlation Table of Indicator Pairs", "Taking only the QuestionID, LocationAbbr, and DataValueAlt out of df_new, I created new_qloc2_1_corr table. Using linear algebra, we can vectorize the arrays by multiplying the new_qloc2_1_corr correlation dataframe and the lower half of an array the same shape as the prior dataframe but with values of one\u2019s. The .stack() puts the array into a list and .sort_values() sorts the list into the descending order. Top_corr consists of about 36k items.", "With a few additional steps to reset the indexes, change the column names, and adding a few new columns based on the QuestionID, we have a dataframe with the top correlation pairs. Since there many duplicate pairs by the topic, I\u2019m going to de-duplicate and not include the same pairs of indicators by topic category which results in about 33k items:", "At this point, we see themes emerging from the indicators. Table 5 shows us that there are certain patterns based on the topic categories. For example, those QuestionIDs (QID1 and QID2 columns) within Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD); those within CKD and Diabetes (DIA); those within CVD and DIA; those within Overarching Conditions (OVC) and prior indicators; and finally, those within Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COP) with DIA and CVD.", "Does this make sense overall that we are seeing relationships among these indicators such as CVD, CKD, and DIA?", "Cardiovascular disease includes a number of heart related diseases, including arrhythmia (improper irregular heart beating), high blood pressure (high force against artery walls), cardiac arrest (sudden loss of function), coronary artery disease (damage of major blood vessels), and congestive heart failure (chronic condition where heart doesn\u2019t pump well). It\u2019s a very common disease that stems from blocked blood vessels and impacts 1 in 4 Americans. According to the CDC, risk factors that increase this disease include diet, obesity, diabetes, excessive alcohol use and physical inactivity.", "Chronic kidney disease is the lengthy disease of the kidney and its loss of function leading to failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It\u2019s also a common disease that affects 1 in 7 Americans. According to the Mayo Clinic, risk factors that increase this disease include diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, cardiovascular disease, older age, and certain ethnic backgrounds. In patients with kidney disease, cardiovascular disease tends to be \u201cunderdiagnosed and undertreated\u201d (Said S, Hernandez GT. The link between chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. J Nephropathol. 2014;3(3):99\u2013104.). When the kidneys don\u2019t function optimally, this requires the heart and cardiovascular system to work harder according to the American Kidney Fund.", "Diabetes mellitus relates to the disregulation of the glucose in the body, and includes a few diseases such as Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. While Type 1 cause is unknown such as family background and environment, gestational diabetes usually comes and goes with pregnancy. Type 2 diabetes has similar risk factors to above diseases, including physical inactivity, age, family background, high blood pressure, weight, polycystic ovary syndrome, and abnormal cholesterol / triglyceride levels (Source: Mayo Clinic). Having diabetes leads to various complications including cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease.", "The answer is yes! This dataset is consistent with the literature showing that there is high correlation among cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes.", "In the final blog post of the series, we will continue this insight to better understand the following:", "Hope you\u2019ve enjoyed reading to this point and feel free to drop me some ideas and suggestions!", "Your home for data science.
