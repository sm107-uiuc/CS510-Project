The article mostly targets who are eager to gain deeper insight into the astonishing world of Bayesian Inference. It is worth noting that before introducing the concept of Bayes\u2019 Theorem, milestones will be discussed for which minimal knowledge of probability theory is prerequisite. Once, the mathematical base of the algorithm has been understood, implementation will be downhill all the way.", "Probability is the branch of mathematics that axiomatize and formalize the probability measure of the outcome of the sample space. Sample space is the set of the events such as getting 5 on thrown dice.", "Conditional probability is a probability measure of an event A given that another event B already occurred. Simply, if 2 events are interrelated, having piece information about any of them will influence the probability measure of another one. In equation 1.1 below, conditional probability measure of event A given event B is described.", "Equation 1.1 can be described as a division of the area of the intersection of the events A and B to the whole area of subspace B.", "The portion of the adults who are men and alcoholic is 2.25%. What is the probability of being an alcoholic given being a man?", "To paraphrase the question, the probability of being a man and alcoholic of a randomly selected individual is 2.25%. What is the probability of being alcoholic if you already know that an individual is a man?", "Assuming that 2 genders are distributed evenly, the probability of being a man implies 0.5. By putting all given parameters into equation 1.1 we get 4.5%", "Basically, having additional information about the gender of the individual increases our probabilistic certainty from 2.25% to 4.5%.", "Chain rule is a probabilistic phenomenon that helps us to find the joint distribution of members of a set using the product of conditional probabilities. To derive the chain rule, equation 1.1 can be used. First of all, let\u2019s calculate the joint probability for 2 events \u2014 A and B.", "Using the same principle, we can also find the joint probability of 3 events \u2014 A, B, C.", "By comparing patterns between equations 1.2 and 1.3 general equation to calculate the joint probability of N number of events can be determined.", "Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other.

Thus, as event A and B are independent, the probability of getting 5 for both events A and B is:", "Events A and B are conditionally independent given C if and only if, given the knowledge that C occurs, knowledge of whether A occurs provides no information on the likelihood of B occurring, and knowledge of whether B occurs provides no information on the likelihood of A occurring. [3]", "Basically, R and B are the events of persons A and B getting home in time for dinner, and Y is the event of a snowstorm hitting the city. Certainly, the probabilities of RR and BB will depend on whether YY occurs. However, just as it\u2019s plausible to assume that if these two people have nothing to do with each other their probabilities of getting home in time are independent [4]", "The pattern in equation 3.1 can be applied to N conditionally independent events as well:", "Bayes\u2019 Theorem is a powerful tool that enables us to calculate posterior probability based on given prior knowledge and evidence. It\u2019s the same principle as doing a training on data and obtaining useful knowledge for further prediction.", "For Machine Learning classification and prediction tasks, we are usually given feature vector X = (x1,\u2026,xn) and corresponding class labels y = (1,\u2026,m). Feature row vector can be assumed as a joint probability of the features. Thus, equation 4.1 becomes:", "Now the features of the vector X will be assumed as independent events to simplify the model complexity. Then 4.2 will be further simplified by appropriating equation 3.2.", "Indeed, the independence assumption is the main reason why the approach is called \u2018Naive\u2019. Because in the real-world applications, it is highly probable of features being related to or dependent on each other. Despite the \u2018naive\u2019 assumption, simplification of the model complexity sometimes results in a surprisingly useful performance.", "The equation 4.3 will help us to predict the class of the given feature vector x (x1,\u2026xn) by comparing the measure of the posterior probability for different class parameters \u2014 y.

However, considering the value range of the measure of the probability is between 0 and 1, having the product of several of them can lead to the problem of the arithmetic underflow [5].

For example, If the corresponding feature value for class 1.0 is 1.898, what is the likelihood of having 1.0 if the feature value is 1.897?", "The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3 and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement, then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.[7]", "Simply, in probability theory as well as in nature Normal Distribution approximates the pattern of the deviation of random quantities from the \u2018true\u2019 (mean) value.

The above-mentioned pattern of the Normal Distribution can also be seen here.", "By considering the general distribution pattern of independent random variables, we\u2019ll assume that for each class the values of the feature columns are distributed normally as well. Thus, the mean of the values of the columns for each class will represent \u2018true\u2019 feature values for the class. The closeness of the feature vector of an unknown to the mean feature values of some class will represent how they are likely to be the same. To represent the measure of this similarity we\u2019ll use Gaussian Probability Density Function (Gaussian PDF).", "Figure 3 represents the distribution of the features of 2 classes.
