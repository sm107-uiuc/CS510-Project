A conflict ensued between the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics and the Ukrainian government. The conflict is very complex and involves innumerable variables. People have written books, articles, and all types of opinion pieces about the conflict. I was curious about what the data show.", "After some effort, I stumbled upon The Humanitarian Data Exchange: https://data.humdata.org/. There\u2019s a lot of really interesting data available there. Luckily for me, a very nice and fairly granular data set concerning the Ukrainian conflict was available. Each row in the data set represented a kinetic event. The data spans from the Euromaidan revolution of 2014 up to 2018. I read the data into R and munged it a bit by removing some columns I wasn\u2019t interested in (I left that part out of the code below). We\u2019ll begin by checking the data for na\u2019s (make sure you load the tidyverse!):", "The \u201cadm_1\u201d variable contained information on what oblast the event occurred in (think of an oblast like a large US county). I was concerned about na\u2019s in that specific column. The first line of code told me I had 119 na\u2019s there. I was able to subset the data in the second line of code and learned that all of the na\u2019s were events in the \u201cDonets Basin Area\u201d based on the information in the \u201cwhere_coordinates\u201d column. I replaced the na\u2019s in the adm_1 columns with \u201cDonets Basin Area\u201d and then renamed some columns:", "For the purpose of this analysis, KIA = Ukrainian forces killed, EKIA = separatist forces killed. The rest of the variables are pretty straightforward. I first wanted to explore what the largest number of Ukrainian losses in one event was:", "Whoa! There was an event were government forces lost 366 service members. Let\u2019s explore that further.", "This line of code gave me all the data for that specific event. It occurred on September 2nd, 2014 in Ilovaisk in Donetsk Oblast. The Battle of Ilovaisk is significant because it is alleged to be the first time regular Russian troops crossed the border and participated in the conflict. Continuing on, let's look at the distribution of KIA.", "The data is very asymmetrically distributed. Events like The Battle of Ilovaisk where a very large number of deaths occurred are creating a long tail to the right. Let\u2019s normalize the data.", "I decided to take this concept and make density plots for both KIA and EKIA:", "What these plots are saying is that most of the events have one or fewer casualty on either side. However, there were some heavy engagements which lead to heavy losses. This is why we have the long tails.", "The next question is, where has the fighting been concentrated? Let\u2019s create a barplot to give us some background:", "It looks like Donetsk Oblast is where the heaviest fighting has taken place. However, it\u2019s unclear how much of the fighting labeled under \u201cDonets Basin Area\u201d actually occurred in either Donetsk or Luhansk Oblasts. I think a better way to understand this data would be to plot it on a map using R!", "That\u2019s better, no? The area of the circles indicate the number of dead for each event (including KIA, EKIA and civilian deaths). You can see concentric circles forming around the areas where there were multiple engagements between belligerents. The Circles around Kyiv near the center of the map represent the Euromaidan Revolution. There is also a small circle near the bottom which represents an event that happened in Odessa around the time of the Euromaidan Revolution, as well. Let\u2019s have a closer look at just Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts (colloquially known as the Donbass).", "Donetsk Oblast is on the left and Luhansk Oblast is to the right in the above image. As you can see, a majority of the fighting occurred in Donetsk or right on the border. The largest circle on the map indicates the Battle of Ilovaisk, as was mentioned before.", "Conflict is an unsavory reality in society but it produces some interesting data to explore. Hopefully, this article helped you out with some code or illuminated your understanding of eastern European geopolitics a bit. I\u2019d love some feedback on the article, so leave a comment if you\u2019d like!", "Your home for data science.
