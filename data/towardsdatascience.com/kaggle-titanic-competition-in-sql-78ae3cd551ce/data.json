In this article, I\u2019ll use SQL (Postgres) to conduct my exploratory analysis and create a transformed feature training set for my machine learning model.", "Although Python or R is the current de facto language for data science and machine learning, having a solid foundation in SQL, at times, will help you iterate faster and allow you to explore your data quickly. At the end of the day, most of the data we work with lives in a relational database. Having the ability to write SQL queries fluidly will allow you to tackle data with ease and quickly get you started on your analysis.", "Although Python would be my preferred approach, I wanted to see if I could do all my exploratory analysis and feature engineering in SQL. My goal is to show how powerful and complementary SQL can be to one\u2019s workflow. Although one obvious limitation of SQL is the ability to visualize data natively, you\u2019re still able to get big gains by quickly writing queries and outputting results. Let\u2019s get started!", "In my follow-up article, I complete my supervised classification model with Python and share my highest score achieved on Kaggle\u2019s Public Leadership Board. Check it out here!", "My research into the sinking of the Titanic revealed that women and children were prioritized over others in transporting passengers into lifeboats. This notion will play a big role in how I group and analyze the Kaggle dataset.", "Additionally, there are discussions of whether to keep training and test datasets separate or combine them for feature engineering and selection. In most cases, the former will make sense to avoid data leakage.", "The common practice is putting aside the test dataset, forgetting about it, and only using the training dataset to impute and engineer features. For this exercise, I have decided to combine the training and test so that I have more data to work with to predict survival. This is a fixed universe, and we are not expecting new data to flow into the prediction pipeline.", "To get started, I downloaded the train.csv and test.csv files from Kaggle and imported the files to two tables I created in the Postgres database. Next, I combined the two tables to create my first working table (titanic_train_test_raw).", "To insert records into my tables, I opened psql on my terminal by typing \u201cpsql postgres.\u201d This is PostgreSQL command-line tool. I ran the following two psql copy commands to insert the CSV files into my tables.", "To better understand the data, I calculated the survival_rate for every feature available in the training set. I\u2019m not sharing the entire output here because I\u2019ll share them piece by piece throughout the article. However, this allowed me to develop a mental image of what features might be worth digging deeper and getting a feel for each feature's relative importance.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at missing values and see what potential features need estimating or even drop due to sparsity. The missing value calculations are done with a combined train and test data. Because test data does not have the Survived target feature, the combined Survived column has 31.93% of its values missing. Also, Age, Cabin, Fare, and Embarked are missing 20.09%, 77.46%, 0.08%, and 0.15%, respectively.", "From the training dataset, I calculated the survived % versus not survived %. Out of the 891 passengers in the training data, only 38.38% of them survived. Also, this analysis allowed me to see that the target class is not too imbalanced \u2014 it\u2019s approximately a 60%/40% split.", "3. Survival by sex and age", "Female passengers had the highest probability of survival versus male passengers. By sex alone, training data tells us that the survival rate is approximately 74.2% for women while 18.89% for men.", "Using pure SQL, I created 10 bins (age_cohort) to group different ages. I\u2019m not going for any precise division of age groups, and thus the number of bins is arbitrary, but create enough to see relevant patterns. And one of the most critical pieces of information emerges from this view. While the female survival rate remained high across all age cohorts, men nine years of age or younger had a survival rate of almost 60% (line 9 in Data Output). By sex alone, men\u2019s survival was under 20%, but by slicing the data with age cohorts we see that a subgroup of men had a relatively higher survival rate \u2014 children.", "4. Survival by fare and average fare per passenger", "To quickly get a sense of fare correlating to survival, I used ntile window function to evenly bucket passengers into 6 bins and created statistics for closer examination. This is a quick and dirty binning method because the same fare amounts could fall into different bins as shown by fare_min and fare_max.", "At a glance, survival_rate looks to tick up as fares become more expensive. At the same time, fare_mean and fare_stddev jump pretty dramatically from bin 5 to 6. The highest fare_max price is $512.3292, while the lowest fare_min is $0. There is some noise in the fare column. What continuous to hold is that female survival is much higher than men\u2019s. Based on the fare_grouping attribute, female survival is 2x \u2014 9x higher than men\u2019s (survival_ratio).", "I soon discovered that the fare represents the ticket's total cost and not the fare per passenger. For example, ticket PC 17755, there are four passengers. The Cardeza is a wealthy family traveling in first class with their two employees, Miss Ward and Mr. Lesurer.", "To get a sense of how much per fare cost, I divided the fare amount by the total number of passengers on each ticket and grouped the averages by Pclass. When examining the ticket feature, I saw families, mixed groups, and individuals attached to individual tickets. As a result, rather than using [SibSp (siblings & spouses) + ParCh (parents & children) + 1 (PassengerId)], commonly used by other Kaggle folks to calculate the family_size feature, using the number of passengers on each ticket generated a smaller standard deviation and gave me confidence that this would provide a relatively more accurate average fare per passenger.", "On average, the first-class fare per passenger came out to be about $32, second class fare per passenger about $12, and third class about $8. This averaging removed quite a bit of noise built into the original fare feature. And fare_mean looked to be highly correlated to Pclass. Thus, having both features, Pclass, and fare_per_passenger, might be redundant. Later on, we might want to drop one of these during the model build.", "5. Survival based on Title from original Name feature", "There are 17 unique titles, and some have high survival rates; however, most suffered from infrequency. There are only two passengers in the training data with the title, Major, and one passenger with Sir. To make each grouping relevant and impactful for modeling, I rolled up infrequent titles into four \u2014 Mr, Mrs, Miss, and Master \u2014 and thus creating a title_grouping feature. For example, Mlle, which is an abbreviation for Mademoiselle, rolled up into Miss.", "The title Master is interesting because it has a relatively high survival rate, and there are quite a few of them in the training data. During this period, boys were given this title until they reached adult age. Now we have a way to identify boys using the title_grouping while all girls and women are rolled up into Mrs. or Miss.", "I calculated the survival rate by each title_grouping, and numbers are very telling. By carving out the boys from the male group, men\u2019s survival rate drops. In contrast, boys\u2019 survival is nearly 60%. I\u2019ll encode this feature into numeric values during the final training dataset prep work.", "6. Survival based on being a woman or a child", "I came across Chris Deotte\u2019s article about a feature he created called \u201cwoman-child-groups\u201d based on grouping passengers with family names (surnames) and titles. Essentially, it focuses on group survival. With that in mind, I created a binary feature flagging if each passenger is a woman or a boy. The is_woman_child = 1 captures all women and children while is_woman_child = 0 captures all adult men. This flag might be redundant with title_grouping and potentially contribute to overfitting the model, but let\u2019s see how this works out.", "7. Survival based on cabin level (a.k.a. deck)", "Some of the readings I did for this showed that the majority of the third class passengers were located in cabin levels F and G. With that, it made sense to look at cabin levels more closely, although 77% of the values were missing. I hypothesized that lower cabin levels decreased a passenger\u2019s chance of survival.", "After doing some analysis, I observed a decrease in survival rate when passengers were part of a lower class and lower cabin levels. I created a logic to approximate each passenger\u2019s cabin level using Pclass and Embarked, which I\u2019ll dive deeper into in the feature engineering section.", "Embarked alone doesn\u2019t quite tell you a story of survival as shown below, but I believe it can be used to create new features that will have relatively higher predictive power. Titanic initially stopped at Southhampton, England, and then moved on to Cherbourg, France. Finally, stopping at Queenstown, Ireland, before sailing off to New York City.", "On a quick side note, there are two passengers with missing Embarked values, but I looked up these passengers and they both boarded the ship at Southhampton (S), England.", "I assumed a correlation between the embarked location and the deck (cabin_level) the cabin was located. In other words, every boarding location was for a specific set of cabins, and there was some form of organization around which cabins would be filled first based on the boarding location. Thus, if you had a third-class ticket that started with F, which indicated the deck the cabin resided in, you most likely boarded the ship from Southhampton, England, for example.", "Now that I understand the original training features and better insights into passenger survival, it\u2019s time to consolidate our findings and start putting together the optimized training dataset for model fitting.", "Assumption: I am assuming that the same ticket number defines passengers traveling together. Furthermore, I\u2019m assuming that if an individual is the only passenger attached to a ticket, this passenger is a solo traveler while potentially having other family members or relatives traveling on different tickets. Therefore, I grouped passengers based on ticket number and surname extracted from the original Name feature.", "There is a trade-off with this assumption, but I\u2019m assuming that this captures most of the group scenarios. And the main goal of partitioning groups in this manner is to generalize the ship\u2019s population.", "At a glance, adult male passengers without families or part of a mixed group had the lowest chance of survival. We do see some interesting patterns in this output. Male passengers traveling with their families had the highest rate of survival. Most likely, these male passengers were boys. I\u2019ll verify this below.", "When I carved out the boys from the male population, the picture is much clearer. Boys survived at a higher rate than adult men.", "To determine each passenger's family size, it\u2019s logical to add SibSp, ParCh, and the current passenger (+1). However, rather than defining this at the passenger level, it made more sense to determine the maximum family size based on ticket number and surname.", "I\u2019m sticking with the assumption that families traveled together and, in this case, on the same ticket. As a result, the sum of SibSp, ParCh, and current passenger, which represents the family size, is matched with a ticket number and surname. I created a mapping SQL subquery where if you had the same ticket number and surname, then the family size (SibSp + ParCh + 1) would be mapped to the passenger.", "Once the logic was put together, I looked at the average survival rate by family size and Pclass. Relatively large families had a lower rate of survival. It can be loosely inferred that if you were part of a big family, you died. Also, you died if you were alone. Since there are only a handful of tickets with four or more passengers, it\u2019s hard to generalize large groups' survival. However, based on available data, it is worth seeing if the family size has some relative importance in predicting survival.", "3. Build the first consolidated feature table: titanic_train_test_raw_v2", "I am now putting together my first consolidate table based on all my findings above. In this step, I\u2019m incorporating new features and transforming existing features for better model consumption. Here is a list of all the additions and enhancements.", "4. Build the second consolidated feature table: titanic_train_test_raw_v3", "Using some of the features created earlier, I created a second consolidated table (v3) to add more features and make additional changes. It\u2019s better to build multiple tables in this fashion when using SQL because it helps to keep things organized and makes SQL more readable by having smaller chunks.", "If Pclass = 1 and Embarked = 0, then cabin_level = C.", "If Pclass = 1 and Embarked = 1, then cabin_level = C.", "If Pclass = 1 and Embarked = 2, then cabin_level = C.", "If Pclass = 2 and Embarked = 0, then cabin_level = F.", "If Pclass = 3 and Embarked = 0, then cabin_level = G.", "I went ahead and tried to re-create Chris Deotte\u2019s feature with some modifications in SQL. I\u2019ll go over what I did and, in my follow-up article, I\u2019ll be testing the feature for impact and importance.", "There is quite a lot of information presented in this article. I conducted my exploratory analysis and feature engineering using purely SQL. I leveraged GROUP BY, window functions, aggregation functions, subqueries, WITH clause, HAVING clause, and other SQL techniques to slice and dice the data.", "The next step is to export the finalized training and test datasets for analysis using Python. In my follow-up article, I\u2019ll use Python to test different ML models, understand feature importance, and tune the chosen model using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV. Finally, I\u2018ll submit my predictions to Kaggle and see how I rank among other entries!", "Title: \u201cKaggle Titanic Competition: Model Building & Tuning in Python\u201d", "If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please let me know.
