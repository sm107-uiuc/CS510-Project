Six was usually the best possible outcome, while one was maybe not so great in most scenarios.", "However, would it not be awesome if you could get the number six on a roll more times than the other numbers?", "This trick is exactly what proportional sampling achieves, and we will look into further details on its step by step implementation in the next section. But firstly, let us understand the need for such concepts.", "Mathematics plays a significant role in data science and machine learning.", "Probability and Statistics is one such essential requirement. Probability deals with predicting the likelihood of future events, while statistics involves the analysis of the frequency of past events. One such important aspect where we utilize these concepts to deal with machine learning and data science problems is called sampling.", "In statistics, quality assurance, and survey methodology, sampling is the selection of a subset of individuals from within a statistical population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. Statisticians attempt for the samples to represent the population in question.", "Basically, sampling is a process used in statistical analysis in which a predetermined number of observations are taken from a larger population.", "The two main advantages of sampling are lower cost and faster data collection than measuring the entire population.", "There are many sampling methods like random sampling, uniform sampling, etc. In this article, we will mainly analyze the step by step approach for proportional sampling.", "Proportional sampling is the method of picking an element proportional to its weight, i.e., the higher the weight of the object, the better are its chances of being selected.", "In reference to the previously stated dice example, the bigger numbers like five or six will have a higher chance to be selected, rather than a smaller number like one or two.", "Let us proceed to understand this with some step by step procedural implementation and some coding with python.", "The only additional library you will have to import for performing proportional sampling is the random module that is available in python. This module can be imported as follows:", "This module is the only additional requirement. The rest of the steps can be carried out with simple python code.", "Before we go ahead, let us define our input. I am going to use a list of numbers ranging from 1\u20136, as an example, for the representation of a dice. You can feel free to choose any random input for your problem.", "Compute the total sum of all the elements of the input.", "In the above code block, we have the list of our inputs stored in the variable \u2018A.\u2019 We will proceed to compute the sum of all the elements in the list. I have used the simple approach mentioned above, but if you feel comfortable, you can use a more compact method with advanced functions as well.", "Calculate the normalized sum of each element in the list of inputs.", "The next code block computes the normalized sum of each of the elements assigned to the input. I have used a dictionary variable \u2018C\u2019 to store these values accordingly.", "Calculate the cumulative sum for each element using all the normalized values.", "The above code block computes the cumulative sum of each of the elements using the normalized values that we found out in the previous step. I have used another dictionary variable \u2018D\u2019 that will store all the required cumulative values.", "Pick a random value in the range of (0,1).", "In the next code block, I have made use of the random module that we imported at the very beginning of the program. Using this random number in the range of 0\u20131, we can compute the chance of the occurrence of the weighted sum.", "Observe the code and try to intuitively understand what we are trying to implement in the above code block. The larger numbers have a higher chance to be chosen in comparison to the smaller numbers because the bridge between them occurring in the range is higher.", "If you are confused about this step, I highly recommended that you try to write this on paper and solve how this computation works.", "Let us now proceed to the final code block, and understand the last step.", "The final code block shown above is used for random number generation and counting. The function above is used to run the first defined function 99 times and check the count of each occurring possibility.", "The desired output would have the highest counts for the number 6, second highest counts for the number 5, and so forth, till we have the least number of counts for the number 1.", "An example of one of the outputs on the first run is as shown below.", "Note: Since we are using the random function, the output will vary each time. So don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t get the same output as me. The important thing to consider is which number has the maximum counts.", "The outputs may differ and vary according to each time you run the program. There is no requirement for you to get the same output like the one shown above. The reason for this occurrence is because we have used the random module. The essential point to take note of is that the largest weight number has a higher count in comparison to other numbers.", "With this, we have successfully implemented proportional sampling. This concept is very important in many aspects of data science, where higher priority needs to be given to larger weights.", "The reference of the dice is a good example. If I had this dice, then my chances of winning games would be much higher!", "With that, we have reached the end of the article. We understood the importance of math for data science, especially in the aspects of probability and statistics required using the example of a dice.", "We then discussed a bit more on the topic of sampling and the advantages it has in the field of data science. Then, we specifically explored on proportional sampling technique with a step by step guide and full codes.", "If you have any queries related to the topic of proportional sampling we covered today in this article, then feel free to hit me up in the comments section.", "Check out some of my other articles that you might enjoy reading!", "Thank you all for sticking on till the end. I hope all of you enjoyed reading the article. Wish you all a wonderful day!", "Your home for data science.
