Specifically, a powerful GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is what you would want. Trust me, I\u2019ve never seen someone with a straight mind train a decently-complex CNN only using a CPU. However, unless you have a lot of cash in your pocket, having access to even one GPU is not going to be easy nor inexpensive, let alone a GPU that has enough computing power or memory for your need. And let\u2019s be serious, we ALL wish to have all the money in the world to dish out multiple RTX 2080 Ti\u2019s just for our own needs.", "What if you are in a tight budget but want to pursue deep learning? Heck, what will you do if you have no cash at the moment? Don\u2019t worry: there are places to get started for free, where you can begin model experimentations and have access (albeit limited) to a fully-fledged GPU. If you\u2019re dead stuck on where to begin with your pockets empty, here are some options you can choose, all of which will provide you a Jupyter (notebook or lab) environment to start creating your projects.", "How will it work? Some providers will store a copy of your custom environment into their servers (a.k.a. the cloud). Others always load a \u201cone-fits-all\u201d environment during every launch while making it very convenient to install additional packages.", "Before we begin, here are some notable trends among these free providers that you should definitely keep in mind:", "Without further ado, here are some of the best free options for a GPU instance to kickstart your deep learning experiments!", "NOTE: Since all of the choices below offer a pretty decent GPU to start with, I\u2019ll be focusing more on the features offered by each, than the GPU performance and stats.", "Maximum Runtime (per run): 6 Hours", "Notable Features: Persistent Storage, Base Containers, Deployment & Project Customizations/Options, Great User Experience", "In my personal opinion, Gradient\u2019s offerings and product seems the most polished out of the rest that I\u2019ve tried. In fact, Gradient had no free tier/option available to it\u2019s users until October 2019, when they announced the offer. Considering this, it wouldn\u2019t be a coincidence why the former point is the case.", "Gradient offers a host of unique features. For one, it allows users to pick a pre-made environment setup (named as \u201cBase Containers\u201d) which comes preinstalled with a particular deep learning framework. It\u2019s much better than manually installing necessary packages or dealing with too many from the start.", "You access your notebooks through the Paperspace Console (Paperspace has services other than Gradient), which recently received a 40% performance boost. Thus, navigating the UI and notebook (once loaded) is quite a joyful experience. With its free tier, you can only run one notebook at a time, and each notebook you run has it\u2019s own amount of disk space that persists over multiple runs (although it is unclear how much space you\u2019re limited to). Additionally, you can only share amongst each notebook a maximum 5 GB of data worth of datasets, model parameters, output, etc., called Persistent Storage.", "Another detail to note: Unlike its alternatives, most, if not all of Gradient\u2019s Base Containers do not add it\u2019s own \u2018flavor\u2019 of Jupyter notebooks or lab, meaning you\u2019ll have an arguably cleaner and faster experience working on the Paperspace Console.", "Gradient also allows you to upload your own models to train, as well as forge new deep learning projects through their CLI or through a GitHub repo.", "If you decide to upgrade, Gradient offers a plethora of cloud GPUs for different prices to choose from. And, you\u2019ll be able to access additional features, such as removing the 6-hour auto-shutdown limit, increasing persistent storage, or reliving the 1-notebook limit.", "My only gripe with Gradient running on free tier is the long amount of time it takes to start one notebook instance, despite performance improvements Paperspace claims. Sometimes, Gradient tells me I\u2019ll have to wait before opening my notebook. I believe these are imposed limitations to set free users apart from the ones who upgrade; nonetheless, Paperspace Gradient is one of the best free options out there for many starting to tinker and experiment with deep learning.", "Maximum Runtime (per run): 12 Hours", "Notable Features: Google Drive & GitHub Integration, Easy to Use & Run,(Superior) Monaco Editor/Intellisense", "Before I had used Paperspace Gradient, Colaboratory was my go-to option to make and run Jupyter notebooks over a cloud GPU. Colab was developed by Google and had always been a free resource for machine/deep learning enthusiasts and beginners alike. Recently they\u2019ve released Colab Pro earlier this year, which gives some convenient perks to its purchasers we\u2019ll discuss later.", "Colab has its fair share of advantages over the rest. For example, it is insanely easy to get started with making notebooks and running models on a GPU. If you\u2019ve ever worked with Google\u2019s Suite of tools (such as Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides), making and editing a Colab notebook has a similar vibe (feel) to those. Another small but amazing detail is the incorporation of the Monaco editor & intellisense within the notebook cells. Basically, it is the same editor/intellisense used in Visual Studio Code, which I frequently use and like as well (probably explaining my favoritism towards Colab\ud83d\ude1b).", "Colab\u2019s heavy integration with Google Drive is, in my eyes, a double-edged sword. On one hand, it\u2019s great that you can put a dataset onto your Drive and have that accessible on all your Colab notebooks. However, that calls for no persistent storage whatsoever, which means you\u2019ll have to load in your data and/or files from Drive with a code snippet every time you run a new instance of your notebook. Additionally, the fact that Colab normally depends on Drive for your permanent data storage means that you are adding a layer of complexity over your setup; simply upgrading to Colab Pro won\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get extra storage, and vice versa for Google Drive.", "Another minor, but noticable, inconvenience is that Colab actually remaps almost all of the standard Jupyter keyboard layouts, seemingly for no reason. \ud83d\ude35", "Colab Pro claims to give users priority access to higher-end GPUs such as the T4 and P100. Priority access is not access, necessarily. You can end up paying the price tag and just get the \u201cnormal\u201d K80 GPU, or you could be a free user that luckily struck gold and gained access to the better devices for one notebook instance. Regardless, Colab itself is a solid pick to get started in practicing deep learning with a free cloud GPU.", "Maximum Runtime (per run/per week): 9 Hours / 30 Hours", "Notable Features: Huge Dataset Catalog, Easy Import of Kaggle Datasets, Great Community & Support", "Kaggle literally needs no introduction. Kaggle itself is home to a huge collection of datasets, which you can explore and use easily on your notebooks there. Kaggle was founded in 2010 and is currently a subsidiary of Google. Unlike the others on this list, Kaggle doesn\u2019t have a tier higher that requires payment; everyone that uses Kaggle is using it for free.", "One of the most compelling features of Kaggle is its humongous dataset catalog. They range from many topics, from video games to COVID-19 data. What\u2019s even better: it\u2019s very fast and easy to import that data into a notebook on Kaggle. Additionally, Kaggle is great for satisfying your competitive edge, as it allows the hosting of formal data science competitions for insane prizes \u2014 a great way to practice applying deep learning into real-world scenarios.", "Everyone that uses Kaggle\u2019s notebooks has access to the Tesla P100 as their GPU. The notebook interface is a heavily-customized flavor of Jupyter notebooks to fit Kaggle\u2019s theme. You are able to share your notebooks to the Kaggle community, and interestingly enough there is an upvote system for notebooks, just most entities in Kaggle. Talking about the community, from my experience, the people here are very helpful towards each other even during competitions. Heck, there are programming and data science tutorials, called \u201cCourses\u201d, offered in Kaggle itself.", "What I find most troubling with Kaggle, however, is the notebook interface. As I said, Kaggle flavors (or themes) their notebooks to fit with their light blue material-like color scheme. This is a problem for me because it causes the notebook to become extremely clunky and a pain to deal with in the long run. Not to mention that it breaks some features of Jupyter: the Shift+Tab keyboard shortcut, which brings up function arguments and documentation, doesn\u2019t even work properly! Kaggle notebooks also have a commit \u201cfeature\u201d, which induces more headaches than not. If you reload your page, there\u2019s a chance that all of your work get\u2019s reverted to the beginning! Finally, with my experience working with Kaggle notebooks, leaving a notebook running was never as reliable compared to Colab or Gradient.", "Despite all of these inconveniences, if you\u2019re starting to tinker machine/deep learning models and want a good community to begin with, Kaggle remains an obvious good choice.", "If you\u2019re running low on cash or are not willing to pay upfront to start pursuing deep learning, there are options where you can have access to a decent GPU to boost your model training and more. If you instinctively skipped up to here, here are the choices:", "Each has their fair share of pros and cons, but ultimately, I recommend starting off with Gradient due to its overall polish, immense deployment customization, and smooth upgrade process once it\u2019s time to get a better GPU for your needs. From there, I would suggest Colab for its simplicity and intellisense, or Kaggle for the community and datasets. No matter which provider you choose, good luck on your deep learning & data science endeavors!", "Your home for data science.
