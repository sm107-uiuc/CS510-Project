Marketing strategy overviews, sales pitches, and case presentations were all a large part of my studies in marketing. Presenting is a very important skill to have, and personally, I\u2019ve never had a problem speaking in front of an audience. Being a musician, I\u2019ve also performed in front of large audiences. You\u2019d think a presentation on analytics or modeling would be the same right? Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case in the professional world.", "This summer, I had the opportunity to do two presentations on analytical topics, one in front of my department, and the other in front of the executive team. Now while I am not by any means a full-time professional analyst (hopefully soon!), these two presentations completely changed my perspective on analytical presentations and how to approach them. I\u2019d like to share my thoughts on this, and hopefully help elevate your presentations! In this story, we are going to approach presenting in three stages: research, preparation, and presentation. Let\u2019s dive in!", "Disclaimer: I am not a full time data professional, I am simply relaying my experiences from my summer internships and personal practice. This is not meant to tell you what exactly you need to know, rather, this is to give you some practical advice from experiences I\u2019ve had. For advanced technical information, please check out Towards Data Science. If you are interested in some advice to help you with presenting, keep reading!", "If you are presenting something, chances are that you have been given a business problem to tackle. It could be something like pulling sales data, analyzing performance, or even creating a machine learning model. No matter what business problem you have, there are some things you should keep in mind as your progress through this stage:", "Depending on who your audience is, you could get questions about how you came up with your numbers and conclusions. Keeping a \u201cnumber trail\u201d so you can show your work will give off a sense of professionalism and credibility if you are posed with such a question. Being able to explain how you got to your numbers in a concise way will go a much longer way than stumbling through how you might\u2019ve came up with the numbers you got. This all starts with documenting your processes!", "This is more of a workflow/project management topic, but it is also very important when it comes to presenting. Presentations are typically one of the last stages of a project, so using good project management practices will help you stay on time and meet your deadlines. Create a project plan that outlines resources, tools, and milestones with a timeline. From my experience, data professionals enjoy using CRISP-DM and Agile methodologies, however, many data professionals also create their own workflows based on their own experiences. Whatever you use, make sure you use it so you don\u2019t let time get away from you come presentation day.", "There will be times where you will have something completely planned out for your presentation. You know what data you need to analyze, where to get your data from, and who your audience is. Sometimes things happen though that throw off your plans. When I was working on a presentation, I planned to survey a population within a company I was doing work for. Right before I was going to send the survey out, human resources told me that it was against data protection policies, and that I couldn\u2019t send it out. I had a contingency plan in place to survey a different population, and was able to get it approved and stay on track to present. Had I not created a contingency plan, I would\u2019ve had a much more difficult time putting my presentation together in time to present.", "In my presentation process, research is about turning data into information. In preparation, information is churned into insights. Ideally, you have done your exploratory data analysis and data cleaning in the research stage, and now you are modeling and coming to conclusions. Here are some ideas to keep in mind as you are working on turning information into insights:", "Knowing your audience is one of the most important variables to keep in mind when preparing and presenting an analytics presentation. A director of business intelligence will understand the information and insights you present in a different way than a vice president of marketing. Always know your audience beforehand because the audience should be the centerpiece of what your presentation looks like and what you say. If you haven\u2019t read one of my previous stories, Data Visualization Audiences and Scenarios, definitely check it out, as the concept of knowing your audience is a prominent theme in that story.", "One big takeaway I took from this summer was how to prepare slide decks. In many universities, presentation software is thought of as art. Your slide deck should have fifty slides, two paragraphs on each slide, and six visualizations on each slide right? Not at most companies. Length depends on what you are presenting, but the goal should be to have the least amount of slides and words as possible. Visualizations should be used, but they should take up most of the individual slide. We\u2019ve all been in a presentation where we saw the first slide with a very large amount of content, and kind of just blanked out. Information overload scares audiences, so rather than just trying to shove it into a slide, use the slides as support rather than just the whole presentation. So if I\u2019m talking about sales performance and ways to improve sales for the next quarter, I would probably show the numbers on one slide, the graph on the next, and the insights on the third slide. Audiences don\u2019t just want a presentation, they want a journey.", "\u201cAudiences don\u2019t just want a presentation, they want a journey.\u201d", "I had to give a presentation to the executive team and senior vice presidents as part of my internship this past summer. I was on a team with two other interns. As a team, we practiced our presentation at least seven to ten times. I\u2019ll get into this in another point, but analytical presentations are quite different than sales or marketing presentations. You can\u2019t second guess yourself or pitch your data. If the numbers are correct, than you should know that they are right! When you get in front of a group of people, your credibility and confidence is put at risk, therefore, many people (including myself) automatically say the words \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cshould\u201d. These should be avoided at all costs, and practice helps with this. With time pertaining, practice your presentation at least five to ten times so you can feel confident about it. If you feel confident, so will your audience. Our job is to make our audience feel confident about our data and insights, so that they can feel confident in their decisions that could directly influence the company.", "Now that you\u2019ve done your research and put your presentation together, it\u2019s time to actually present. While presentations can be daunting, here\u2019s a few tips that have helped me when presenting analytical topics:", "Avoid using words and phrases such as \u201clike\u201d, \u201cum\u201d, \u201cI think\u201d, \u201cI assume\u201d, etc. Now this is a very difficult thing to put into practice, but it will elevate your presentations. When you are in a presentation and nervously say, \u201cI assume that sales will increase next year\u201d, that will make your audience question your credibility. Most likely, you will have an idea if sales will increase or decrease based on your data, so rather than saying, \u201cI assume that sales will increase next year\u201d, say something like, \u201cI expect that sales will increase next year\u201d. This adds a touch of confidence, which gives your audience confidence in your credibility.", "Presentations are a journey. If you want your audience to pay attention, you need to guide them through your slides. Let\u2019s say you have a graph showing marketing engagement projections over the next year. Rather than sitting there talking about the projections, I would recommend getting up and moving near the screen and pointing to the different data points as you explain your findings. This will help your audience make sense of what they are seeing. If you remember visiting a college that you knew nothing about by yourself, it probably wasn\u2019t that enjoyable. However, if you visited a college you knew nothing about AND had a tour guide to help you, that was probably a much more enjoyable experience. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this is also applicable. In a Zoom or Skype meeting, you can use your mouse cursor to simulate pointing at the screen in person.", "Domain knowledge and department knowledge is important when presenting. If you are presenting to other analysts and data scientists, it\u2019s probably acceptable to go into detail about your regression model or mean average error. If you are presenting to sales executives, this probably is not the right direction to go. For example, I used linear regression as a tool in my executive team presentation this summer, and rather then going into detail about how I set up the regression or what variables I assigned in Python, I discussed how the relationships between the variables was important. This goes back to knowing your audience, which is the most powerful concept you can incorporate in your presentation.", "I hope that these tips will be helpful in your presentations! As data students and professionals, our job is to act as tour guides into our worlds. We have a very distinct and different line of work than other parts of a business, yet our information is incredibly important to the success of a business. Bring your passion of data into your presentations, and your audience will notice!
