If we take popular internet media at face value, despite well-publicised successes, the graveyard of failed projects must well and truly be overflowing with corpses of those that \u201cdidn\u2019t know better\u201d.", "Numerous articles exploring these failures touch broadly on the same raft of issues \u2014 lack of clear goals, too many silos, missing expertise, non-data driven cultures \u2026 sometimes blaming the business, other times faulting technology, but usually, artfully, indicting both.", "The claimed failure rate, a cannily high enough number to grab the reader\u2019s attention, ultimately ends up dividing the audience.", "The cynic might say there\u2019s a consultant or two skulking in the corner, waiting to pounce on the unsuspecting business!", "Budget pressures \u2026 sunk costs \u2026 disappointment \u2026 perhaps shame \u2026 and likely, business or career repercussions.", "Through all of this though, what keeps popping up seemingly unnoticed is advice \u2026 and lots of it.", "Search for \u201cWhy data science projects fail\u201d and the resulting links are likely to point to articles with titles such as 7 steps to project success and 5 reasons analytics fail.", "Two recent ones we came across are Doug Gray\u2019s Data science and analytics failures and Ganes Kesari\u2019s piece on Data science adoption challenges. They resonated because we\u2019d experienced many of the points raised \u2026 and we thought they were nicely presented.", "So you read the articles, the messages hammer home and you vow to make sure those weaknesses are addressed for next time. If you\u2019re diligent, the more relevant points become a lessons learned checklist at the start of every project.", "And eventually, you might start to believe that your formula, system, or solution, is robust enough to handle most eventualities.", "A customer some years ago was looking for data-driven analysis to identify potential savings with a key Managed Services supplier. Not coincidentally, it was close to contract renewal time.", "Since the supplier worked in a Citrix-virtualised environment, with a bit of Splunk magic we were able to extract productivity data and visualise 10% worth of low hanging fruit, to be easily snipped off at renewal.", "We were reasonably confident. After all the work had been requested by the customer and the data proved that the supplier was overstaffed.", "So why not remove unwanted services at renewal? Or add new scope if worried about de-scoping the supplier?", "Imagine our surprise when we received a polite pat on the back for good work and a \u201cwe\u2019ll look at it in 6 months\u201d nod.", "It was several months later when one of our stakeholders alluded to what we could only call a \u201csymbiotic procurement relationship\u201d.", "The apparent unproductivity was really margin for the supplier, who would have been extremely unhappy to see it go. In return, the business could call in favours as needed.", "Ultimately, a few embedded sticky relationships meant that neither the most compelling of business cases nor the slickest of presentations would have altered business as usual.", "Was this something we could have anticipated in advance?", "After all, the eventual challenge we faced did sit at #6 \u201cChange is disruptive and not handled well\u201d in Doug\u2019s list. And also at #5 \u201cLack of executive buy-in\u201d in Ganes\u2019 \u2014 which we thought we had!", "Could we have planned for it amongst everything else going on at the same time?", "Is it humanly possible to be so intimately involved with every aspect of a project \u2026 so as to be in a position to pounce at the first sign of a top 10 problem?", "Were we the only ones to feel that data science advice always makes perfect sense after the fact \u2026 but is overwhelming before the fact?", "Eventually, grim economic reality forced us to be honest with ourselves.", "Our previously airtight business case had neglected to consider tacit influence not because we didn\u2019t want to \u2026 but because we didn\u2019t have the relationships to know anyway.", "It was a trigger to start looking at data science failures and successes in a different light.", "And explore the question we\u2019d been trying to avoid for some time.", "In a very technical field like data science, how much do people, relationships and context matter \u2026 for success?", "Afraid that the answer, perhaps unthinkably, might tell us it matters as much as data chops, critical thinking and A+ solutions.", "Your home for data science.
