A simple thought experiment, used to better understand Fermi\u2019s paradox, can shed light on the astronomical odds stacked against the \u2018rare life\u2019 hypothesis.", "To wit, life forming chemistries are most certainly not uniquely Carbon and water based in a narrow pressure band in a narrow temperature range between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius. Instead, they may appear anywhere up and down the temperature, radiation and pressure spectra, across a near infinite range of substances (i.e. Methane is liquid at low temperatures, Iron is liquid at high temperatures).", "Life forming chemistries are most certainly not uniquely Carbon and water based in a narrow pressure band in a narrow temperature range between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius.", "The only commonality these chemistries would need is the ability to store and transmit data, making radiation (light) a potential substrate for life, and possibly even Gravity.", "Perhaps the only fundamental prerequisite for life is the ability to store and transmit data.", "Computers have everything we need. But I digress\u2026", "I\u2019m not talking about AI (artificial intelligence) in its current form. Neural networks are imitations of what we know about how brains work. They\u2019re intelligently designed.", "You don\u2019t design artificial intelligent life. That\u2019s not a natural (or elegant) way to do it. Instead, I\u2019m going to provide initial conditions suitable for intelligent life to evolve. Nature did the exact same thing for us.", "You don\u2019t design artificial intelligent life. That\u2019s not a natural (or elegant) way to do it.", "There are a couple of important concepts underpinning my approach, so let\u2019s start there.", "Heuristics are a natural way to tackle wildly complex problems. I don\u2019t mean natural for us, I mean natural, as in Nature \u2014 the Universe.", "A heuristic is a comparative process not guaranteed to produce a perfect result.", "I first began using heuristic algorithms to tackle a famous type of NP-Hard math problem known as the Traveling Salesman Problem. Essentially you need to work out the most efficient way to visit a specified number of locations. Sounds easy, right?", "The difficulty arises in the sheer number of permutations involved. According to this overview of route optimization:", "A simple route optimization problem with a single vehicle and 50 stops has 30 million times more permutations than atoms of Hydrogen in the Sun (10\u2075\u2077).", "It\u2019s easy to confirm this using the bang (!) symbol on your scientific calculator. The number of permutations can be calculated as follows:", "The fastest supercomputer in the world would take many trillions of years to check each possibility, rendering this simple problem (faced by delivery companies and couriers every day) intractable without heuristics.", "By contrast, a system using heuristics can deliver the following optimal route for a 50 location tour in a matter of seconds:", "Heuristic algorithms often find their inspiration in Nature. From the gathering of food by ant colonies to mutations in our DNA, heuristics are an integral part of life. Without heuristics there could be no evolution.", "What\u2019s weird, but important to bear in mind as we continue, is that naturally occurring heuristics can emerge entirely new heuristics. The term emerge is also really important. I\u2019m going to cover it in more detail shortly.", "Naturally occurring heuristics can emerge entirely new heuristics.", "Our brains use heuristics all the time. We can\u2019t catch a ball without them.", "Instead of calculating Newton\u2019s laws to predict the flight path of a ball, we compare the current situation (i.e. a ball flying toward us) against a library of stored memories and estimate where and when the ball will arrive based on that. The more we practice, the more stored memories and experiences we have to base our decision on, the better we become. Since heuristics can\u2019t guarantee a perfect result, even the best of us occasionally fumble.", "The \u2018ball catching\u2019 heuristic was not present when life first evolved. It wasn\u2019t present when life first crawled onto land. It emerged some time after as a result of the genetic heuristic process of evolution.", "In other words, one heuristic process (evolution) emerged another (ball catching).", "Emergence is a beautifully elegant phenomenon that seems to effortlessly violate the laws of thermodynamics. One of the Universe\u2019s true gems.", "Emergence is a beautifully elegant phenomenon that seems to effortlessly violate the laws of thermodynamics.", "We observe emergence when a system exhibits properties not initially present in any of its constituent parts.", "There are plenty of magnificent examples visible with the naked eye. Look out your window. At the start of the solar system there was no planet Earth. There was no moon. There was no sun. All of these things emerged over time from a cloud of dust and gas acted upon by gravity.", "Even once the nuclear fires of the sun ignited and our planet swept clean its orbit, there was no life here. There were no flowers. No trees. No Kakapos (sadly, we\u2019re killing many of the beautiful things Nature has emerged and the Kakapo is likely soon to be one of them). All of these living things emerged from genetic heuristic processes (i.e. mutation) acted on by adaptation for survival.", "Simple heuristic systems can emerge complex life and intelligence.", "Heuristic emergence, the term I\u2019m using to describe my approach to evolving an AI, is the most powerful natural phenomenon you\u2019ve never heard of. It is responsible for all life in the Universe. It is responsible for the Kakapo. It is responsible for our intelligence.", "Evolution is a specific example of heuristic emergence.", "The beauty of using heuristic emergence to evolve an artificial intelligence is that it requires no designer or guiding hand. Simply set up the initial conditions required for virtual organisms (VOs) to evolve. Press play.", "Sooner or later (in exactly the same way our intelligence emerged from natural selection) they\u2019ll start exhibiting traits like common sense, problem solving, hunches, and creativity. They wouldn\u2019t be designed by humans and trained using machine learning (ML). They would be their own thing. Independent and self-aware.", "Recently I had the time to take a few concrete steps towards building a heuristically emergent system. I call it Grasslands.", "Grasslands is a virtual environment that supports a single type of VO (in this case, grass) consisting of a single gene that codes for size. I tried to keep the rules of the system as close to what we intrinsically recognize as a natural grassland environment in order to make this demonstration more relatable.", "That\u2019s all there is to it.", "The simulation runs over a period of time without any interference and displays a snapshot of what the environment looks like every few virtual years.", "The following screenshot, taken from my PC, shows the initial conditions used (obviously they are configurable) and what the environment looks like after 20 years.", "From the sand colored map at the bottom corner of the screenshot you might be able to make out the faint outline of a river flowing from the North-West towards the center, before draining into an inland delta (like the Okavango in Botswana). The river and delta systems are fed by higher rainfall in the North-West region (average rainfall amounts are not pictured on the map).", "Initially, there are two small grass colonies taking hold \u2014 one at the top-center of the map and one in the center, near the delta. As per the starting conditions, both of the initial grass colonies have gene expression size 20.", "The vast majority of the map does not have sufficient water to support grass of gene size expression 20. Simply put, the seed colonies will have to evolve in order to colonize drier regions of the map.", "After 240 simulated years, the map looks like this (the results differ every time since the system is non-deterministic and there is no way to accurately predict the outcome \u2014 other than general trends).", "Dark green regions indicate large, lush grasses that have colonized the wetter regions in the North-West and along the river and inland delta. The largest grass has evolved to a gene size expression of 111. Significantly larger and faster breeding than the seed colonies.", "The smallest grass has evolved to a gene size expression of only 7, making it well suited to dry regions. Note that the smaller grass, depicted on the map as light green tiles, has colonized the entire available area despite the fact that this was not initially possible for the seed grass.", "The salient point here is that the system is a proof of concept for heuristic emergence in general, and artificial evolution in particular.", "Grasslands is a proof of concept for heuristic emergence in general, and artificial evolution in particular.", "There is no code, no directive, no program, no function, or anything else, that directs the grass to adapt to drier regions of the environment. It evolves because random mutations in its DNA, over time, lead to traits that allow it to survive and reproduce in a drier environment\u2014 passing on those traits to its offspring.", "Machines possess many aspects of intelligence. They are good calculators. They have memory. They can communicate. AIs can learn specific intelligent behaviors, such as recognizing faces or objects.", "They do a lot of things better than us. Yet we don\u2019t really consider them smarter than us. Why? Computers are presently devoid of heuristics, like common sense, empathy, and creativity.", "Computers are presently devoid of heuristics, like common sense, empathy, and creativity.", "Yet heuristics are precisely those aspects of intelligence that are best emerged using\u2026 heuristics. Nature has already shown us how to do this by evolving us. I simply intend to follow the road-map already laid out.", "The next step is to evolve a virtual organism possessing a heuristic behavior, such as creativity or common sense.", "Right now there are a few challenges (namely, finding the time). On the technical front I need to find a way to tie the emergence of new genes to a specific characteristic. These characteristics, working in synergy, will ultimately emerge the new heuristic.", "Remember, I can\u2019t simply create a gene expression for creativity, like I did with the size gene in Grasslands. Size is a rudimentary trait. Creativity is a complex behavior. Simply saying a gene codes for creativity won\u2019t make it so.", "I have some ideas on how to do that and I\u2019ll keep you posted on my progress (or die under suspicious circumstances \u2014 in which case someone really needs to destroy my PC and cloud accounts). In the meantime, I\u2019d like to leave you with the following convoluted thought.", "Nature used heuristic emergence to evolve life imbued with heuristics that allow it to use heuristic emergence to emerge life imbued with heuristics.", "Seems Nature has a kind of recursive poetic symmetry.", "Your home for data science.
