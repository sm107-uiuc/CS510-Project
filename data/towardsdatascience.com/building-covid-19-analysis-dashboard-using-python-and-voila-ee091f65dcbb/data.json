After a while, I decided to create a dashboard out of my jupyter notebook. I am going to walk you through the steps I undertook with code snippets:", "Here\u2019s the video tutorial on my channel in case you want to watch and follow me build this from scratch:", "I gathered my data from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Data repository by John Hopkins CSSE.", "The data here gets updated every 24 hours from the official sources. I accessed the raw files from thecsse_covid_19_time_series directory.", "Here is how I am reading the file using pandas\u2019 read_csv() method:", "Let\u2019s have a brief look at the dataframe returned from reading the file.

The next step then is to prepare the data.", "Firstly, it is always easy to work with column names that are in lowercase. Also, we need to change the Province/State to simply state and Country/Region to country.", "Let\u2019s rename all the columns in the required format:", "Now, with all the columns in the right format, there is a bunch of stuff that we can do with them.", "Let\u2019s calculate the total number of confirmed, death and recovered cases out there. We can use the country_df for that:", "Analyzing the data in alphabetical order is a bad idea for countries that are struck severely.

You can find the code of this function on my GitHub repository.", "The function is then added with an interactive text box which allows you to enter your choice of the country as shown below:", "Folium is a python package that helps us visualize the python manipulated data on an interactive leaflet map.
