Sure, it\u2019s useful for conveying information, but it\u2019s not the type of graph to put in a portfolio or show off to friends.", "Five key adjustments can transform basic graphs into beautiful graphs. Beautiful here does not mean extraneous. When it comes to graphing data, beautiful includes the right background, orientation, size, color, and labels to deliver an attractive, crisp, and informative graph.", "In this article, we load coronavirus data, prepare the data for plotting, plot a basic bar chart using matplotlib, and use 5 key adjustments to transform the plot into a beautiful graph. This article assumes basic familiarity with pandas.", "First, we need some data. The following code assigns the John Hopkins coronavirus Github dataset to the variable url. The file is a CSV file, and a date is provided near the end. This date may be updated by the user to get the most recent coronavirus information. The dataset is updated daily.", "Next, import pandas, then read and display the dataFrame using pd.read_csv and df.head().", "As you can see from the last column, the data is provided by cities and countries. This dataset includes all countries. To plot data from countries only, we may groupby the column \u2018Country_Region\u2019. We choose the \u2018sum\u2019 aggregate to get accurate counts of all numeric columns except latitude and longitude.", "Finally, we select only columns that provide numerical information about the coronavirus, namely, \u2018Confirmed\u2019, \u2018Deaths\u2019, \u2018Recovered\u2019, and \u2018Active\u2019.", "It\u2019s easy to generate a plot with matplotlib. In the case of bar charts, you just need the x-values, the categories that you want to compare, and the y-values, the column of comparison. We will compare the number of recovered cases per country.", "Creating a bar chart with hundreds of categories is infeasible. In the case of the coronavirus data, the categories are the countries, listed as the index after our groupby. We will select the top 10 countries only.", "First, slice the dataFrame by taking the countries with the 10 highest number of recoveries using the sort_values method. The results may be stored in a new dataFrame as follows: df_recovered = df.sort_values(by=\u2019Recovered\u2019, ascending=False)[:10].", "Next, convert the indices to a series using the to_series method on the index. The reason for this conversion is that it\u2019s standard to use columns, which are actually pandas series, when plotting. The indices, often the categories you want after a groupby, must be converted. The following code converts the indexed countries to a series: x_vals = df_recovered.index.to_series().", "We also set y_vals = df_recovered[\u2018Recovered\u2019] to select the \u2018Recovered\u2019 column as our y-value.", "Here are the steps to slice the dataFrame and set the x and y-values.", "Bar charts are one of many matplotlib plots. After importing matplotlib, you decide the kind of plot you want to make, in our case a bar chart, then you insert the x and y-values followed by plt.show() as follows.", "This is what the graph looks like on my computer. It captures the key information, but the country names run together, it\u2019s too small, and it\u2019s not aesthetically pleasing.", "Now let\u2019s use the same information with 5 key adjustments to create a beautiful bar chart.", "seaborn is a wonderful addition to matplotlib. I use seaborn all the time because I prefer the gray background with the grid lines, and I find that many graphing options in seaborn, like linear regression, are easier to use, more aesthetically pleasing, and offer more information.", "The following code imports seaborn along with matplotlib, and sets the background as a nice dark grid.", "We already have our dataset, df_recovered. The information given above for the x-values and y-values may remain unchanged, with one exception: switch them for a horizontal bar chart.", "Horizontal bar charts are easier to read because the spacing on the x-axis will no longer be cluttered. Horizontal bar charts also provide a nice aesthetic when ordered for vertical stacking.", "Here is the code to switch x and y. Note that setting the parameter orient=\u2018h\u2019 inside of the bar plot function may also work.", "This is a big one. I am not sure why the default matplotlib plots are so small. Increasing the size is always a good idea. You can see more detail, the graphs are less crowded, and they take up more screen real estate.", "You may use the method figure on plt, then set the dimensions of figsize inside parentheses. Note that the dimensions are (horizontal, vertical). Here is a large sizing that works. Adjust the numbers for your own preference.", "Nice colors really make graphs stand out. When using one color, consider the alpha parameter to include transparency. With bar charts, color palettes are ideal. The palettes may even be reversed so that the darkest color is on the top, depending on the story you want to tell.", "It\u2019s worth trying to tell a story with your color. Since recovering from the coronavirus is a good thing, green can be used as a positive color with the country having the most recoveries displayed on top as the darkest shade of green. Placing the darkest color on top usually requires the \u2018_r \u2019 string concatenated to the end of the color palette to reverse the order.", "A fun way to find all palette options is to insert a palette error in the code! The correct options are then displayed in a Colab Notebook. Alternatively, standard palettes may be found in The Python Graph Gallery. I prefer the error method because I can stay in my notebook and it shows me everything.", "The color palette may be set inside of sns.barplot, along with the x-values and y-values as follows.", "It goes without saying that labels should be used and sized for graphs. All graphs should be titled, and the size of the title may be increased until it displays to your liking.", "In the case of seaborn, the x and y axes use labels provided by the indices and columns by default, so they are not added here.", "Here is the code to title your plot and adjust the size of the title.", "All that\u2019s left is to save the plot and show it. It is always worth saving your plots because the output on your computer will look much better than in Jupyter or Colab Notebooks, or even on sites like Medium where 3rd-party software is used. A simple strategy is to set the dpi, dots per inch, to a larger number, like 300.", "Here is all the code together to create and display a beautiful coronavirus horizontal bar chart.", "As you can see, with 5 key adjustments, the new graph is worthy of sharing with friends or putting in your portfolio. The graph is simple, yet informative and beautiful. It is even crisper on my computer, and will be on yours too.", "Now that you have learned 5 key adjustments to make your bar charts aesthetically pleasing, have fun with this dataset and others to create and display new columns of information.", "Corey Wade is the director of Berkeley Coding Academy, author of the Python Workshop, and chair of the Math Dept. at Berkeley Independent Study.
