Throwing head or tail with a coin is certain, so its probability is equal to 1.", "If the elements of a sample space (the set of all possible results of a randomized experiment) are equiprobable (= all elements have the same probability), then the probability of an event occurring is equal to the number of favourable cases (number of ways it can happen) divided by the number of possible cases (total number of outcomes):", "For example, all numbers of a six-sided dice are equiprobable since they all have the same probability of occurring.

This is the reason we subtract it to count it only once.", "If two events are mutually exclusive (i.e., two events that cannot occur simultaneously), the probability of both events occurring is equal to 0, so the above formula becomes", "For example, the event \u201crolling a 3\u201d and the event \u201crolling a 6\u201d on a six-sided dice are two mutually exclusive events since they cannot both occur at the same time.

This means that in this specific case (with the same percentages), an individual has less than 1 chance out of 2 of having the disease knowing that his test is positive!", "This relatively small percentage is due to the facts that the disease is quite rare (only 10% of the population is affected) and that the test is not always correct (sometimes it detects the disease although it is not present, and sometimes it does not detect it although it is present). As a consequence, a higher percentage of healthy people have a positive result (9%) compared to the percentage of people who have a positive result and who actually have the disease (8%). This explains why several diagnostic tests are often performed before announcing the result of the test, especially for rare diseases.", "Based on the example of the disease and the diagnostic test presented above, we explain the most common accuracy measures:", "Before diving into the details of these accuracy measures, here is an overview of the measures and the tree diagram with the labels added for each of the 4 scenarios:", "The false negatives (FN) are the number of people incorrectly labeled as not having the disease or the condition, when in reality it is present.
