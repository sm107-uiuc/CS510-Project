You lose everything again and go home with empty pockets.", "Well, I hope you won\u2019t \u2014 because you don\u2019t go to casinos, you don\u2019t buy scratch tickets, you don\u2019t play the lottery or any gambling game in general.", "Why? Because these games are designed to make you lose money.", "And in this article I\u2019ll tell you why. (Check out the podcast or video version of it, too!)", "The house always wins. We all know this phrase. But this is more than a phrase. This is a simple, mathematically proven fact. And you\u2019ll only have to know three statistical concepts to see why the house always wins.", "These three statistical concepts come up often in data science projects, too. So if you are wondering why I\u2019m talking about gambling on a data science channel, rest assured, you\u2019ll be able to take advantage of this knowledge in your data science career, too.", "Let\u2019s start with the first one.", "Everyone loves good stories! A good story sticks.", "And I bet that you, too, have a friend \u2014 or a friend of a friend \u2014 who won big on a sports bet, or came home with 10,000 bucks from Vegas or won the dream trip to Malta on a scratch ticket\u2026 So won something big.", "The trick is that in gambling the good stories are always the ones that end with winning big. It makes sense. My grandma never talks about how she played the family numbers on the lottery last week and won nothing, again, for the 200th time. But she never forgets to mention when she won $6000 on it in 2003.", "Because losing is boring. It\u2019s everyday. It happens with everyone. Winning is exciting, it\u2019s a fun-to-tell story, even after years.", "The story of winning big survives the filter of boredom.", "This is why this statistical concept is called survivorship bias. In this case, the story of winning is the thing that survives. And why is it a bias?", "My brain hears a winning story. That\u2019s one datapoint. Then it hears another one, then another one, then another one. Sometimes it hears losing stories, too\u2026 but by far not as many as there are in reality. So my poor brain will have a disproportionately big sample size of winning stories and a relatively small number of losing stories. And it unconsciously creates false statistics from the skewed data \u2014 and so it thinks that I have a much bigger chance to win than I have for real.", "This is how my silly brain works. Well, okay, the bad news is that it\u2019s not just my brain, it\u2019s yours, too. In fact, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s brain: this is how humans are created. We instinctively believe that we have a bigger chance to win in games than we do. Because of survivorship bias.", "Oh, and of course, almost all casinos and online betting companies amplify this effect as much as they can.", "Anyways, if there wasn\u2019t survivorship bias, we\u2019d see our chances at gambling more rationally and probably none of us would ever go to the casinos. So if you hear a good winning story, you should always remember that\u2019s not the full picture\u2026 and that on the full scale, the house always wins.", "I keep saying this, by the way: the house always wins. But I haven\u2019t yet explained the math behind it. So let\u2019s continue with that and head over to the second statistical concept.", "Here, I won\u2019t go into the details of the expected value calculation itself. But check out this article to learn more: Expected Value Formula.", "But, let\u2019s get back and let me talk a little bit about expected value.", "Expected value shows what result you would get on average if you made the very same bet infinite times.", "I know, this sounds a bit tricky, so let me give you a very simple example to bring this home.", "Flipping a coin is usually a fair game. When you flip a coin, there\u2019s 50%-50% for tails or heads. Let\u2019s say that you bet and when it\u2019s tails you double your money, if it\u2019s heads you lose your money. If you do this over and over again several times, let\u2019s say for 1,000 rounds, your wins and losses will balance each other out. Your average profit will be 0 dollars. That means that the expected value of this game is exactly $0.", "In roulette, there\u2019s a pretty similar bet to flipping a coin. That\u2019s betting red versus black. But in roulette your winning chances are a tiny bit lower compared to flipping a coin. When you put $10 on black, your expected value is not 0. It\u2019s minus $0.27 per round. Again, I won\u2019t go into the math here, check out the article I mentioned. But the point is that in every round you play, you lose an average of 27 cents. It seems like a very small amount of money. But over 1,000 rounds, it adds up and your losses will be around $270.", "I mean sure, expected value is a theoretical value, but it always shows itself in the long term. In other words: the more you play, the more you lose.", "The point is: roulette is a game where the expected value is negative \u2014 because the probabilities in it are designed in a way that you\u2019ll lose in the long term. And it\u2019s not that big of a secret, that every single game in a casino is designed with a negative expected value.", "And that\u2019s why the house always wins.", "So that was the second statistical concept, expected value.", "Let\u2019s talk about the third statistical concept:", "This is another bias and it explains why people don\u2019t get out of a game when they are in a winning series.", "First off, you have to know that probability is tricky. It works in a way that\u2019s really hard to interpret for the human brain. There are events that are extremely unlikely to happen. Like the chance that you\u2019ll get 10 heads in a row when flipping a coin. The probability of that is less than 0.1%. Still, in a big enough sample size, let\u2019s say when you toss the coin 100,000 times, it\u2019ll inevitably happen, even multiple times.", "And the same thing can happen to you. If you play 1,000 rounds of roulette for instance, it\u2019s actually pretty likely that you\u2019ll have lucky runs.", "And when one\u2019s in the middle of a lucky run, it\u2019s easy to feel that she has a hot hand. So she raises the bar, plays with bigger bets \u2014 in the hope of getting the most out of these winning series. But the thing is that these winning series are nothing else but blind luck, and statistically speaking it happens to everyone every now or then.", "In gambling, there\u2019s no such thing as a hot hand. In the casino, just as fast as you win something, that\u2019s how fast you can lose it.\u201d. Again, you can\u2019t get out of the law of statistics \u2014 and the more you play, the bigger the chance you\u2019ll lose. Remember, the house always wins. So don\u2019t fall for the hot hand fallacy. If you go to the casino and play (against common sense) and you win (against the odds), the best thing you can do is get out immediately and be happy for being lucky!", "So why shouldn\u2019t you go to casinos?", "Because of 3 simple statistical concepts:", "And don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s your choice whether you gamble or not. I get it. It\u2019s fun to play sometimes, it\u2019s fun to get lucky and it\u2019s fun to win.", "I just wanted you to understand the math behind gambling \u2014 and to give you a more realistic picture of your chances and about why the house always wins.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data analyst @Data36.
