Intelligent systems are those systems which posses intelligence just like humans.", "The science of Artificial intelligence is not new, The term Artificial intelligence has been mentioned in manuscripts of Ancient Greece and Egypt. Greeks believed in god Hephaestus, also known as God of Blacksmiths\u00a0, according to a Greek mythology Hephaestus made intelligent weapons for all Gods, in their view\u00a0, the goal of Artificial intelligence is to\u00a0: be helpful for people to achieve a certain goal, be able to operate automatically and be programmed in advance to react in different ways depending on the situation.", "Well, The term Artificial Intelligence has become popular in the field of Entertainment, we can see lots of movies based on the concept of Super intelligence. ( Ex-machina\u00a0, Her\u00a0, AI\u00a0, Avengers\u200a\u2014\u200aAge of Ultron etc. )\u00a0. But Artificially intelligent systems what we see today are in no match with so called \u201cSuper intelligent\u201d systems.", "Artificial intelligence\u00a0, as stated earlier is not a new field, many philosophers and scientists had some imagination about AI since humanity, but they were all limited by the technologies of their time. Today with the presence of powerful super computers\u00a0, we\u2019re able to build AI systems which serves the required purpose. But, are they really intelligent?? The answer is No, they are not. Let\u2019s see how.", "With the help of Computers and availability of large enough datasets on the internet\u00a0, the so called Machine Learning came into picture. Machine Learning provides a set of mathematical concepts using with AI can be implemented in the real world.", "Neural networks, roughly simulate the working of Human brain to make machines learn from examples. Deep learning has helped many tech gaints like Google and Apple to improve their products economically by implementing so many new buzzy tech like Face recognition, Language understanding, Image understanding etc. But what you think of , so called deep learning isn\u2019t real intelligence. The field of Machine Learning which requires enormous data sets to learn either to classify objects or to make predictions is called Supervised Learning.", "The so called\u00a0, Supervised Learning creates an illusion of Intelligence, but at it\u2019s core it is just a\u00a0Mathematical Optimization. Even though it posses an ability to make decisions and classify datasets, it is very narrow in the way it works.", "We are very familiar with techniques to create supervised learning systems. Given a large dataset, Supervised Learning systems learn a mapping between I inputs and outputs, and thus it can predict outputs for unseen inputs. But this is not what our brain actually does, our brain doesn\u2019t require 10000 images of cats to recognize a cat, and even our brain can do so many things which supervised Learning systems cannot.", "Even though Supervised Learning can be used to create so many amazing things\u00a0, it has so many limitations\u00a0:", "AGI ( Artificial General Intelligence) is a term used to describe Real intelligent systems. Real intelligent systems posses ability to think generally, to take decisions irrespective of any previous training, here decisions are made based on what they\u2019ve learnt on their own. It can be really difficult to design such systems as technology of today is somewhat limited, but we can create so called \u201c Partial AGI\u201d.", "Even today, many scientists believe that Reinforcement learning as a way to achieve so called AGI. Reinforcement learning can be applied as a solution for problems which Supervised learning cannot solve. Let us take a simple example to understand one of the basic task of walking, Walking is a human-task in which we are very natural and good at. A baby learns to walk by itself, without having to search for a dataset, human brain can do so by learning from mistakes. But once it becomes perfect, it can walk thousands of steps, even a single mismatch in step size can be identified by it. Steps taken by brain are always optimal, the speed (or simply step-size) taken is always in such a way that, destination should be reached in minimal time in the same way, the energy taken for each step should be minimal. So the rate of walking depends on energy as well as how fast you have to reach the destination. The same problem of walking can be applied to so many areas like robotics where locomotion is necessary. Of course, as stated earlier, Supervised learning cannot do that.", "As we\u2019re already familiar , dynamic programming is a method of obtaining optimal solution for any problem. Dynamic programming has been one of the most successful algorithmic approach to solve Travelling salesman problem and other problems related to Graph Theory. This approach uses an iterative approach where a set of solutions can be found in one or more steps, then the remaining part of algorithm decides which solution to take as optimal.", "Dynamic Programming equation : The standard equation for dynamic programming is known as Bellman Equation. The equation can be applied for all decision making problems, for example, in Travelling salesman problem, given a set of cities and their distances, the problem is to obtain a shortest path which traverses all the cities at least once. The Bellman Equation can be given as:", "This equation involves finding a function V(x,a)\u00a0, the goal of this function is to choose an action a for each state x, such that a for x is always optimal. This is the simplest form way of explaining Bellman equation (Not mathematical, for proof refer Wikipedia). All reinforcement learning algorithms which are widely used today are dynamically programmable, means they all take form of Bellman equation. We\u2019ll see about Deep-Q algorithm later, which is similar to Bellman equation. Some Reinforcement Learning algorithms obey Markov decision rule, such as SARSA algorithm etc., In such case, they take form of Bellman equation in Stochastic space as shown below\u00a0:", "Google\u2019s Deepmind\u00a0, in the year 2015 published a very interesting paper on so called Deep Q Learning algorithm. This algorithm was able to excel at most of the tasks which were difficult for Humans. The algorithm was able to excel at more that 2600 Atari games.", "Their work represents the first ever general purpose agent that was able to continually adapt its behavior without any human intervention, a major technical step forward in the quest for general AI.", "The agent was developed using an algorithm called Q-learning, Q Learning algorithm at it\u2019s core is a consequence of Bellman equation, so it follows the methodology of dynamic Programming.", "Practical approach\u00a0: Every reinforcement learning problem contains following components:", "The long term goal of any agent is to understand the environment so as to maximize the reward. Reward can be maximized only it is positive, positive reward, in turn is a result of correct action for that state. So the maximization problem deals with following sequence\u00a0, in simple terms:", "The equation can be given as\u00a0:", "Means, the Q value i.e State-action value is dependent on old value + the difference between new information and old information. Old information is already present in the memory, whereas\u00a0, new information is obtained by maximizing the reward learnt form the action. So in many reinforcement Learning problems,we construct a neural network which can learn the mapping between state and action, If action is positive. Once training is finished, we can deploy the network, so that it creates right actions for any valid state\u00a0, so as to maximize the reward.", "Openai gym provides a set of environments where agents can be trained, Mountain Car is a beautiful example where reinforcement Learning can be enforcement to learn optimal acceleration. The goal of this game is to train a car to succeed in climbing a mountain.", "We can implement Q Learning form scratch\u00a0, or we can simply make use of Kears-rl\u00a0. Krars\u200a- rl is simply a collection of APIs using which pre-written algorithms can be used.", "As shown in the fig. By end of 4000 episodes, car has learnt to produce enough acceleration to climb the mountain.", "Thank you!
