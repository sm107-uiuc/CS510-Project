While on that topic, he commented that, \u201cIn the field of AI, many people talk but don\u2019t deliver\u201d. While what he said was true in general, I feel that success or failure of AI projects are predetermined at the point of hiring.", "Over the past few months, I have been interviewing with various firms across different industries for data analyst, junior data scientist or AI engineer positions. While interviewing, I noticed many differences between these companies I interviewed for. They can be classified into two categories: AI Leaders and the AI Laggards.", "There also exists a \u2018rich get richer, poor get poorer\u2019 phenomenon, and the rationale for this is simple.", "Before I jump into that, we need to segregate two groups of individuals:", "This group of people are individuals who have an avid interest in data science who are either 1) in the midst of making a career switch or 2) have just made the career switch or 3) have up to two years of working experience.", "This group of people wants to get their hands dirty. The dirtier the better. Their focus is on driving up their technical skills as quickly as possible. This involves 1) being able to work with like-minded individuals, 2) having the opportunity to learn every day on the job and 3) being exposed to production grade code and end-to-end ML pipelines.", "This group of people has years of experience working in AI. They know how to build and deploy ML models, plan and execute a ML project with a given timeline, and know the ins and outs of building a successful data science team.", "At this stage in their career, these people are earning big bucks. They are well sought after and they are either AI consultants or managers of big data science teams.", "Here\u2019s how the \u2018rich get richer, poor get poorer\u2019 phenomenon arises.", "An AI Laggard seeking to get their feet into AI will do either of the following:", "In the end, the professional gets overworked and leaves the company and the amateur leaves due to lack of work satisfaction.", "An AI Leader however, will already have the relevant infrastructure in place to build and deploy ML models. Each team that is part of the data pipeline are clear of their responsibilities and attracting talent is not an issue.", "If attracting talent isn\u2019t hard enough for AI Laggards, attracting the right talent is 100 times harder.", "An AI Laggard is often unaware of its needs. It doesn\u2019t know where or how its efforts should be deployed. This often results in a job description that includes basically every single programming language in human history, and every machine learning and computer science jargon that one can think of. It looks something like this:", "Yup, that\u2019s basically no one on this planet. Not even Bill Gates himself can fit the bill.", "As AI continues to boom, talent will continue to be in shortage as demand outpaces supply. Technology recruiters have the potential to solve a company\u2019s talent shortage or continue to throw a massive net of candidates at the sourcing company, hoping one candidate miraculously survives the sieve.", "A Data Scientist that is a good fit is no longer the case of matching key words such as \u201cPython\u201d or \u201cMachine Learning\u201d in a resume. The data production pipeline includes Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Data Scientists, AI Engineers, Machine Learning Operations and more. Understanding what the company needs and knowing the differences between these roles will differentiate a good and a mediocre technology recruiter.", "No, but it will be tough for them to climb out of the ditch. If companies do not know what they need to get started, hire a consultant. Based on my experience, in-house development usually wins in the long-run. Engaging too many different vendors for solutions will only create dependencies and lock-ins.", "Large companies who are laggards are particularly entrenched due to their focus on cost and process automation, as indicated by the survey conducted by Algorithmia which addressed the major trends in enterprise ML.", "From the chart, it can be seen that AI budgets have increased across the board, but deployment rates (in production) remain low at 45% [2]. Companies that are fairly young in terms of AI adoption should be very focused on the types of talent and skill sets they require. Remember, a Jupyter notebook model has no purpose until it is in production generating business value.", "While I do agree with what my manager said, I believe that the reason why organizations or teams end up being inefficient or unproductive boils down to ineffective leadership. In addition, the larger the organization, the higher likelihood of social loafing. In the field of AI, I do have a naive thinking in that I believe individuals in this field are motivated to create value because they see the value that AI brings. Being able to hire the right AI professionals for the job will only get harder, but hopefully over time, things will get better.", "Your home for data science.
