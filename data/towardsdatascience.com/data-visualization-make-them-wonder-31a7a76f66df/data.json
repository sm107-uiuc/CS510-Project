The main reason I enjoy creating visuals from data is that it enables us to see different perspectives on the subject of study. In this article, I will share 2 concepts to improve the insights we can provide through the visualizations we design.", "Our brain has the ability to use our eyes to see in 3D. It\u2019s called stereoscopic vision. Basically, each eye gives us a 2D vision, and because they are separated on our face, each retina produces a slightly different image. This difference is a result of depth, which provides the 3rd dimension. In other words, having a second eye brings a different perspective, and when both perspectives are put together, we can see in 3D.", "Data visualization is like a second eye, it can give us different perspectives that will produce new understanding and knowledge. The artist Michael Murphy calls it perceptual shift, \u201ca moment that occurs when an individual\u2019s interpretation of a particular stimulus suddenly changes\u201d. The video below shows an example of a perceptual shift from Michael Murphy\u2019s art\u00b9.", "Florence Nightingale (1820\u20131910) is the perfect example of a data visualization designer that changed perspectives, she changed the way we deal with healthcare and saved lives. She was a nurse and statistician. She collected data and created visualizations to better understand topics such as mortality in war and hospitals. She used the plot below to prove how improvement in sanitation could decrease mortality in hospitals and prevent diseases. Learn more about Florence Nightingale and her legacy here.", "The concept of \u201cthe island of knowledge\u201d is simple, and it\u2019s stated by Ralph W. Sockman as \u201cThe larger the island of knowledge, the longer the shoreline of wonder\u201d. Our understanding of a subject is like the size of an island, and its shoreline represents how far we can think, ponder and question about it.", "Marcelo Gleiser wrote a book entitled \u201cThe Island of Knowledge. The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning\u201d, and he gives this definition:", "\u201cThe knowledge that we have defines the knowledge that we can have. As knowledge shifts, we ask new kinds of questions that we couldn\u2019t have anticipated\u201d\u00b2.", "Data visualization is a powerful way to increase our island of knowledge. It can give us those different perspectives that will increase the size of our island and consequently enlarge the shoreline of wonder. It will enable us to think of questions we couldn\u2019t before. Alberto Cairo uses the island of knowledge to teach about data visualization in his book \u201cthe truthful art\u201d\u00b3 in a very insightful way. I recommend reading it.", "At the beginning of 2019, I worked on a visualization that represents this concept. I was looking into the stocks of Petrobras (PBR, a Brazilian company) to decide if it was a good moment to buy it. I was staring at the following chart:", "My eyes went straight to the period of 2013\u20132016. I wondered what happened there to make those shares fall so drastically. I then realized that within those years, a huge operation was in progress in Brazil to investigate corruption between the government and Petrobras. I studied more about that and put together some important events in the government and in the operation against corruption to find any correlation with PBR stocks. The image below is the result of my research (click here for the full page):", "Since Dilma Rousseff was elected the president of Brazil in 2012 and changed the leadership of Petrobras, the stocks started falling and hitting the lowest prices in the past 13 years. The red area shows the period where nearly 30 people were arrested being accused of corruption, and it\u2019s followed by the lowest price level. The first plot made me ask new questions, enlarge my island of knowledge, and find new perspectives. Now my shoreline of wonder is larger and the island can grow bigger. How corruption in government have affected other companies or other parts of the economy? Can I use the government\u2019s corruption to predict stock prices?", "Data visualization is powerful, it can change, improve and save the world. It\u2019s key to bringing new perspectives and innovation. Next time that you go to work on your data collection or visualization designs, remember the island of knowledge and make it so that your readers will wonder about new questions they never had before.", "Data visualization is powerful, it can change, improve and save the world. It\u2019s key to bringing innovation. As you create and design your next visualizations, do your data exploration with these concepts in mind. It will lead you to provide new faces of the data and knowledge for your readers. You will enable them to ask deeper questions. Let them wonder!", "Your home for data science.
