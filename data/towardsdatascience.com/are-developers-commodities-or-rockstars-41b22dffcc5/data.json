At the same time, most companies pay developers like rockstars. What is the truth? In this article, I will explain and comment with data on the evolution of the developers\u2019 job market. After 15 years of experience in the IT field, initially as a developer and then as a manager, I will try to tell both sides of the story. We will learn how to understand this evolution in 5 simple points.", "During my past near the customer, I heard too many times a sentence like \u201cI don\u2019t mind how do you do, just do it\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not a technician, I don\u2019t want to understand.\u201d I am not sure when people in business lose interest in how they spend their money. It is like you are building a house, go to the architect and tell him, \u201cI don\u2019t mind how many rooms you will put inside, just build it.\u201d I understand that for a non-technical is not easy to communicate with technicians (and especially if the technician is a developer), but there is a minimum level of knowledge that each one should know to make things work.", "We can ignore wich mixture of cement will be used for our house pillar, trusting engineers, but we need to know how many rooms or floors we will have in the house.", "All this story for telling there are commodities and commodities, so, what is the meaning of commodity? Probably, understanding well what a developer does, we can answer. A car is a different commodity then toothpaste. I consider something a commodity when I can change it or supplier with no effort and consequences.", "Try to change developer in a project running, and you will discover which is the cost of thinking that people are just a commodity.", "Companies that produce software need developers as they are the main resource for completing the product. In other industries, they need to innovate the enterprise, so they run IT projects, and developers have a central role in such projects. From the Chuck Alexander study, an IT project can last from 30 to 60 months. It means about 2.5\u20135.0 years. Each company starts many projects per year. So, it is a big demand. Then most companies agree that producing software is not their core business, so they delegate part of the project in outsourcing and rent people from consultancy companies or freelances. Well, it\u2019s easy to understand why having such big demand with a limited supply salary is growing and find the right specialist is harder than in the past.", "According to the research, junior developers expected a rise in their salary of 4.3% in 20017, skilled developer the 4.5%. If each year we will have this increment, after about 15 years we will double the pay.", "The developer is one of the most challenging jobs and requires high skill, constant learning, and experience. This explains why it is very well paid in most of the countries. 74% of the professionals interviewed by GitHub during the 2020 survey reveal that they have a degree. That\u2019s a very big percentage, comparing with other technical jobs. According to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics, the average in the USA is 73K$ in May 2019. Starting from this good point, we also have some additional key factor that can define some extra revenue for such professionals:", "Until the IT market grows, we will still see the professional developer figure as important in our innovation plan. The rush for finding the best developers in the market creates new job places and power salaries. We love this growth phase, but there is some hidden risk to take into account (as a businessman and as a developer):", "The growth of IT projects is doping the developer market, increasing salary with a trend that is not sustainable in the long term. We need to find a way to keep this salary increase possible by increasing the value of the output. This is possible by giving priority to product development, even semi-finished products that can be reused, technology innovation, and improving organization to avoid waste of time.", "Developers cannot stop learning and need to jump from one technology to the next one, until retirement or promotion to another role. Each person in business needs to leave them enough time for training and learning.", "Otherwise, in the near future, we will have a lot of expert employees that won't be profitable.", "Your home for data science.
