An association rule is an implication of the form X\u2192Y where X is a set of antecedent items and Y is the consequent item. An example association rule of a supermarket database is 80% of the people who buy diapers and baby powder also buy baby oil.", "The analysis of association rules is used in a variety of ways, including merchandise stocking, insurance fraud investigation, and climate prediction. For years scientists and engineers have developed many visualization techniques to support the analyses of association rules.", "Many of the visualizations, however, have come up short in dealing with large amounts of rules or rules with multiple antecedents. This limitation results in serious challenges for analysts who need to understand the association information of large databases.", "This blog is a summary of the research paper Visualizing Association Rules for Text Mining, which presents a novel association-rule visualization system designed to tackle many of these problems.", "The definition of association rule varies with disciplines and implementations. The basic approach is to mine qualitative rules that describe associations between sets of items.", "Given a set of items, S = {i1, i2, \u2026, ij , \u2026, in} where n \u2265 2. An association rule is an implication of the form X\u2192ij where X\u2192S, and ij \u2192 S such that ij\u2192X. The set of items X is the antecedent, while the item ij is the consequent of the association rule. The size of X is between 1 to (n-1) items. The support of the rule X \u2192 ij is defined as the percentage of items in S that satisfies the union of items in X and ij . The confidence of the rule is the percentage of articles that satisfies X and also satisfies ij.", "There are five parameters involved in visualization of association rules:", "Two-dimensional matrix and directed graph are the two approaches to visualize association rules.", "Positioning the antecedent and consequent items on separate axes of a square matrix and drawing customized icons on certain matrix tiles that connect the antecedent and the consequent items of the corresponding association rules.", "The figure depicts an association rule (B \u2192C). Both the height and the colour of the column icon can be used to present metadata values. The values of confidence and support are mapped to 3D columns that are built separately on and beneath the matrix tiles. The icons such as disk and bar are used to visualize metadata in the Rule Visualizer of MineSet.", "Problem with 2D Matrix: A 2D matrix is the most effective technique to show the one-to-one binary relationship. The strengths of a 2D matrix, yet, break down when we need to visualize many-to-one relationships such as association rules with multiple antecedent items.", "The nodes of a directed graph represent the items, and the edges represent the associations. The figure shows three association rules (A\u2192C, B\u2192C, A+B\u2192C). This technique works well only with a few items (nodes) and associations (edges). An association graph can turn into a tangled display with as few as a dozen rules.", "This technique is to visualize many-to-one association rules. Instead of using the tiles of a 2D matrix to show the item-to-item association rules, it uses the matrix to depict the rule-to-item relationship.", "The rows of the matrix floor represent the items, and the columns represent the item associations. The blue and red blocks of each rule represent the antecedent and the consequent of the rule. The right side of the matrix shows the identities of the items. The corresponding bar charts in different scales at the far end of the matrix gives the confidence and support levels of the rules.", "The system supports basic query commands through the use of pop-up menus to restrict key items to be included in the visualization. The display has a mouse-controlled zooming capability to support context/ focus analysis.", "From the experiments, this visualization technique works well with up to several hundreds of association rules on a 17-inch monitor screen, and up to dozens of antecedent topics. This is a significant improvement over the traditional 2D item-to-item association visualization.", "A Two Dimensional Matrix is most efficient when there is a one-to-one binary relationship. In the case of many-to-one relationships, the strength of the Two Dimensional Matrix breaks down. The Directed Graph also works well with the few nodes and associations only. It can turn into a tangled display when items are increased to a dozen. Whereas, the rule-to-item visualization approach can be implemented without any upper limit on the number of items in the antecedent.", "Hence, switching from an item-to-item arrangement to a rule-to-item design of a two-dimensional matrix lets us effectively display association rules with multiple antecedent topics.", "Your home for data science.
