How people meet and form a relationship works a lot quicker than in our parent\u2019s or grandparent\u2019s generation. I\u2019m sure many of you are told how it used to be \u2014 you met someone, dated them for a while, proposed, got married. People who grew up in small towns maybe had one shot at finding love, so they made sure they didn\u2019t mess it up.", "Today, finding a date is not a challenge \u2014 finding a match is probably the issue. In the last 20 years we\u2019ve gone from traditional dating to online dating to speed dating to online speed dating. Now you just swipe left or swipe right, if that\u2019s your thing.", "In 2002\u20132004, Columbia University ran a speed-dating experiment where they tracked 21 speed dating sessions for mostly young adults meeting people of the opposite sex. I found the dataset and the key to the data here: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating/.", "I was interested in finding out what it was about someone during that short interaction that determined whether or not someone viewed them as a match. This is a great opportunity to practice simple logistic regression if you\u2019ve never done it before.", "The dataset at the link above is quite substantial \u2014 over 8,000 observations with almost 200 datapoints for each. However, I was only interested in the speed dates themselves, and so I simplified the data and uploaded a smaller version of the dataset to my Github account here. I\u2019m going to pull this dataset down and do some simple regression analysis on it to determine what it is about someone that influences whether someone sees them as a match.", "Let\u2019s pull the data and take a quick look at the first few lines:", "We can work out from the key that:", "We can leave the first four columns out of any analysis we do. Our outcome variable here is dec. I'm interested in the rest as potential explanatory variables. Before I start to do any analysis, I want to check if any of these variables are highly collinear - ie, have very high correlations. If two variables are measuring pretty much the same thing, I should probably remove one of them.", "OK, clearly there\u2019s mini-halo effects running wild when you speed date. But none of these get up really high (eg past 0.75), so I\u2019m going to leave them all in because this is just for fun. I might want to spend a bit more time on this issue if my analysis had serious consequences here.", "The outcome of this process is binary. The respondent decides yes or no. That\u2019s harsh, I give you. But for a statistician it\u2019s good because it points straight to a binomial logistic regression as our primary analytic tool. Let\u2019s run a logistic regression model on the outcome and potential explanatory variables I\u2019ve identified above, and take a look at the results.", "So, perceived intelligence doesn\u2019t really matter. (This could be a factor of the population being studied, whom I believe were all undergraduates at Columbia and so would all have a high average SAT I suspect \u2014 so intelligence might be less of a differentiator). Neither does whether or not you\u2019d met someone before. Everything else seems to play a significant role.", "More interesting is how much of a role each factor plays. The Coefficients Estimates in the model output above tell us the effect of each variable, assuming other variables are held still. But in the form above they are expressed in log odds, and we need to convert them to regular odds ratios so we can understand them better, so let\u2019s adjust our results to do that.", "So we have some interesting observations:", "It\u2019s of course natural to ask whether there are gender differences in these dynamics. So I\u2019m going to rerun the analysis on the two gender subsets and then create a chart that illustrates any differences.", "We find a couple of interesting differences. True to stereotype, physical attractiveness seems to matter a lot more to men. And as per long-held beliefs, intelligence does matter more to women. It has a significant positive effect versus men where it doesn\u2019t seem to play a meaningful role. The other interesting difference is that whether you have met someone before does have a significant effect on both groups, but we didn\u2019t see it before because it has the opposite effect for men and women and so was averaging out as insignificant. Men seemingly prefer new interactions, versus women who like to see a familiar face.", "As I mentioned above, the entire dataset is quite large, so there is a lot of exploration you can do here \u2014 this is just a small part of what can be gleaned. If you end up playing around with it, I\u2019m interested in what you find.", "Originally I was a Pure Mathematician, then I became a Psychometrician and a Data Scientist.
