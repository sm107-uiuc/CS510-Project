I am quite interested in myself and human societies. I think our purpose to survive in this world as humans is to think about humans. We are always trying to understand ourselves and that is the most important motivation to survive in this world.", "In my case by using computer technologies and robot technologies, and Android technologies, I am approaching these questions.", "Is this the reason why you are building humanoid or android robots to learn in the process of building these robots about our own human nature?", "Once we create a very human-like robot, we can attach it to the even more important human natures, like now for example. We are talking with each other, this is a conversation but what is the real meaning of a conversation.", "Probably to have a conversation, we need to think about something, but what is to think, right? There are so many ambiguous and unknown words. I want to understand every ambiguous but very important concept for us humans by using robots. That is what we are doing in our lab.", "When you talk about thinking, you talk about consciousness. Do you have your own definition of consciousness?", "Consciousness is, thinking, emotions, desire and so on. These concepts cannot be clearly separated.", "I do not have my own original definition, but in research, we basically consider three levels, three layers of consciousness. First, arousal level, then the phenomenological level, and lastly the access level.", "The phenomenological level is qualia. For example, when we see the sunset, we are moved. We are moved by the beauty of the sunset.", "In the access level, we can consider ourselves, we can feel ourselves.", "These layers are tightly coupled, and we cannot decompose them. At the same time, these consciousness levels are closely related to intentions, desires, and emotions.", "What is the connection between the body, the brain, and thoughts?", "That is one of the very important topics for us. Originally, I have developed the Android system as a teleoperated android. That means if we talk through the internet, the android can behave like me. Everybody can easily accept the android body as his or her own body. So, we actually do not need tight connections between the body and the brain. If we have an android body, our brain can accept the android body as our own body, if the brain can control the body. That is a quite interesting phenomenon.", "When I think about the Geminoid you built, what were some key insights you had along the process? What did you learn?", "The most important lesson was, actually, I could not accept my first Geminoid as myself; but other people, the students, and my staff said that this is identical to myself.", "That means, we cannot have objective views about ourselves. We do not know our face and voice and behaviors. I found that humans principally cannot have objective views.", "That was the most interesting finding for me.", "Because we are biased, we perceive our own world and people that surround us\u2026", "We can perceive the world, but we cannot directly observe ourselves, we need to use mirrors and voice recorders. Once we use the voices recorders and look at mirrors, that is different from my own recognition. The recorded voice sounds like another person. Principally we cannot have objective views and understanding about ourselves.", "Next, you might want to make the Geminoid able to communicate and interact with people, at this point, it becomes even more complicated.", "We are not studying the personality yet but before the personality, we need to develop the abilities and functions to have a conversation with others. The conversational autonomous robot is very difficult. Now we are focusing on the conversational functions, and we are taking many approaches, like a chatbot approach or a bit more advanced casual discussions. We are focusing on deeper conversations based on intentions and desires.", "When will be the time where I am talking to the Geminoid and I cannot be sure that I am talking to you or a robot version of yourself?", "Maybe in the future! We are improving the robots more and more. Not yet!", "What do you think about unplugging from technology? Do you think that is important and do you think that will be less important in the future?", "I think it is quite important to think about the human natures but fundamentally we humans have two ways for evolution.", "One is the genes; the other is technologies. Because of technologies, we can be humans. If we do not want to use the technology we want to be monkeys. We cannot separate technology from us humans. The human is an animal that uses technology and tools. We need to study both sides, the animal side of humans and technology side of humans. But more importantly, we can develop much better abilities with new technologies, and that is the way of human evolution.", "What are the biggest hurdles that have to be overcome?", "If we look at smartphones, one country cannot develop practical systems with smartphone technology, the iPhones, and other smartphones are world commercial products. They need to have a big market to have a more powerful and cheaper device. For robots, we need to have more technologies. Robots need to have actuators and sensors added to smartphones, then we can have a robot.", "In this case, we require a bigger market with a stronger impact on societies. Otherwise, we cannot have mass production and the robots will be very expensive. That is the most difficult aspect of a robot society.", "Let us touch on the utopian and dystopian scenarios. Are you more positive or more negative?", "I cannot say if it is better or worse because the future is the future.", "We can always find happiness there. Happy and unhappy is relative.", "More important is to extend our abilities and survive. If we develop more technologies, we are going to have more chances to survive in this world and in this universe. That is the most important thing for us humans. Utopian and dystopian are just relative measures. If you can enjoy or not that is up to you.", "One perspective is to implement microchips in our brain to keep up with robots\u2026", "It is natural. Technology is a very important part of evolution. Look at what we are doing now, everybody keeps using their smartphone, it is almost like an implant.", "Do you have any personal techniques or routines that you do on a daily basis to come up with new ideas?", "I always try to think about many things. It is kind of an internal voice. So always somebody is speaking in my brain. When I am in the bathroom and I am taking a shower and when I am using a hair dryer, then always some ideas are coming up. If I touch my head, I can access neutral conditions in my brain, then there is some idea coming up.", "It is quite important to have a neutral condition of our brains. Maybe that is similar to mentalization. In my case it is easy, I just need to use a hairdryer, then I can mentalize.", "Imagine you would be 18 years old in 2018 with the knowledge and experience you have right now. What would you do? What skills would you acquire?", "Still, I would do the same thing. My current motivation is to know about myself, the humans and societies. This is a very fundamental basic thing. I would do the same, but I might take more challenges. I may start another company. If I am young I can take more challenges.", "I think I was a good programmer when I was young. If I can become 18 years old right now I would connect to the software world and would develop AI by myself.", "So, a combination of technical skills with philosophy, art, psychology and many other fields\u2026", "But the most powerful approach is a constructive approach. Just create a conscious agent. After that, we can talk about psychology, philosophy and so on but without an agent, we cannot have a discussion. I call this approach the \u201cconstructive approach\u201d.", "Do you know the series Westworld?", "Yes. I don\u2019t like the idea, it is totally wrong. If we kill a human-like robot, that is murder. We are not so crazy, so the approach is totally wrong.", "Any movie that you can recommend?", "Bicentennial Man, played by Robin Williams. I love that movie. The man who lived for two centuries.", "Enjoyed this article? Here is another one", "Michael Burkhardt is an AI Travelpreneur (40+ countries). He helps AI enthusiasts acquire hands-on skills through Real-World Projects. Apart from AI he blogs about mindset shifts, meditation tips, and body hacks for travelpreneurs.", "Connect with Michael on LinkedIn, Medium and Instagram.", "Your home for data science.
