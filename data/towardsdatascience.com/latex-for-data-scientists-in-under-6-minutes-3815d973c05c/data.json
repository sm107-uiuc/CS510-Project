Superscripts and also be combined with subscripts by being called consecutively:", "For longer superscript and subscripts, putting the superscript and subscript within brackets can clean the code:", "Note \u2014 LaTeX has many symbols that can be called using \\name.

Others include \\infty, which is the infinity symbol.", "Superscripts and subscripts can also be nested and combined in many ways, as long as the scope is clearly specified with parentheses:", "Many mathematical operators require subscripts or/and superscripts. In these cases, the operator is treated as an object with normal superscript and subscript properties.

They are called with \\name{parameter1}{parameter2}.", "How fractions are displayed differs when they are used inline.", "Fractions can be easily nested by using a fraction as a parameter.", "The above command uses \\cfrac{}{} from the amsmath package, which keeps the size of the fractions the same, even when they are nested. This can be substituted with \\frac{}{}, which will make nested fractions smaller.", "LaTeX supports many types of brackets:", "Sometimes, the brackets and parenthesis will be too small for an expression, for example, if it has fractions.", "Dynamic parentheses and brackets operate by \\left[object] and \\right[object] commands to signify the start and end.", "In this case, the [object] was a parenthesis, so the expression was enclosed in \\left( and \\right). [object] can also be substituted with brackets (\\left[ and \\right]).", "The amsmath package includes many commands to typeset matrices.", "A matrix is defined by several values, separated in each row by &, each row separated by a \\\\.
