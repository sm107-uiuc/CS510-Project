It works so fast, easy to learn and can be adapted in a variety of fields. I started using Python to learn Data Science but found out lately that it can also expand to web scraping or automated BOT programming. Usually, most of the work seems working fine with my personal laptop with administrative right. However, when I try to adapt this knowledge to my area of responsibilities in the workplace (i.e. in my Company\u2019s USER working environment without administrative right), they got frustrated, and most of the time, the package installation is not working well. After looking and trying a few methods for a few days, I have finally found one efficient way. Therefore, I believe writing this blog would help some others figure out the same problems that I have faced. That is, how you can use Python without administrative right at your workplace.", "Without administrative right, I will need to use either software that can be installed in portable mode or web base application. I have tried a number of portable software or cloud platforms that can be used to run Python. These include Anaconda, SublimeText, PortablePython, WinPython, Google Colaboratory, Microsoft Azure services, and others. As I have only tried part of them thoroughly, I will mention only some of them here.", "The first recommended software is to use Anaconda as it comes with the majority of useful handy packages, and it can be installed directly to your working machine in portable mode without requiring administrative right. I started using this software for a few months by running it through Jupyter notebook for self-study. However, I cannot install any additional packages such as the famous XGBoost ML algorithm using this Anaconda environment. There are a few posts on Stackoverflow like this one that I have gone through, but it does not solve the problem. At the bottom line, it appears that I need to configure the system PATH which I do not have authority to do. For Windows 10, you can access this PATH configuration by going through Control Panel, and type \u201cPATH\u201d on the search field. As you can see from the below snapshot, I do not have administrative control to change the System Path. I might be able to ask IT support to change it for me, but there should be some better ways to code Python in user mode. Let\u2019s try other alternatives.", "Secondly, I have tried free cloud platform in Google Colaboratory. It is just typical free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. I can use !pip install XXX to install new packages similar to Jupyter notebook in my personal laptop. For me, it works pretty good for a period. Until I found three main drawbacks using this platform. First, this Colab platform is designed for intermittent users as running a full bunch of lengthy machine learning model could consume significant resource from the servers. After I have tried 2 days running time, I have got some warning message to reduce my GPU level to allow the resources for others to use. Secondly, the data required to be fed in the model will need to be uploaded into Colab. Although it can be synced with Google Drive very nicely, this violates my Company\u2019s policy on data retention. Every file that is uploaded to external server will be tracked and I don\u2019t want to be fired just because of this silly reason. Thirdly, as this platform works in the cloud, some GUI packages cannot be installed. For my case, I intend to use pyautogui to build some BOT to get control over mouse movement, and keyboard to help me reduce some repetitive copy and paste tasks. This Colab does not support GUI control as it does not have mouse or keyboard in the cloud.", "Thirdly, I have tried SublimeText3. It is free for use code editing software in unregistered version (You will need to pay for registered version, but you can continue using free version). This software is built not only for Python users but it can also select which language to compile. It is very nice as the code editing module can be customized, bulk edited, and add some code checker packages. To me, it looks like it is truly built for developers. Unfortunately, after tried a few days, I cannot install any additional packages without modifying system path. You can notice its nice tutorial video.", "Finally, after trying a few approaches without success, I found that WinPython could be one useful Portable Python editor software approach. In my view, comparing with Anaconda, there are a few portable softwares such as PortablePython and others that are more understandable in their root folder/installation files and WinPython works best for me. I can add new package installation using pip install in WinPythonCommandPrompt for *.whl files or I can unpack *.tar.gz files and put them in WinPython package root folder. Unlike two platforms explained before, both package installation approaches are working fine and I can install both XGboost and pyautogui using this WinPython. It works in Jupyter notebook without requiring any administrative right and I want to let you know that this is the best method for me to get Python running in Company\u2019s environment, but still comply with data leaking prevention policy and does not use external cloud server. I also put my Pro/Con comparison of these in the bottom part of this blog. Thank you for reading. Feel free to comment if you have any suggestions.", "Your home for data science.
