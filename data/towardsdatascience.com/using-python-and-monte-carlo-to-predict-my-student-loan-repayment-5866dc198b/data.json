I wanted to gauge my likelihood of paying off the full loan and practice my Data Science skills, so I simulated my earnings using Monte Carlo written in Python. Here I give a walk-through and evaluation of the findings.", "Full code available on my GitHub.", "Skip to Method and Results if you\u2019re short of time!", "In the UK, students can take out university loans for both tuition fees and living costs with Student Finance England, who provide loans underwritten by the Student Loans Company. Once you enter employment as a graduate, you then begin to pay off your loan on a monthly schedule as part of your tax deductions. Crucially, if you do not pay off your loan, plus interest, in 30 years, your loan is cancelled. They\u2019re also substantial \u2014 approximately \u00a342,000 one year after graduating in many cases.", "1. How likely am I to pay off my student loan inside of the 30-year payment window, given my probable salary progression?2. If you manage to save money, or come across a sum of money (e.g. inheritance), should you pay off some or all of your loan in the form of voluntary payments?", "To calculate how much I owed after university I simulated each passing day\u2019s interest plus any new instalments arriving from Student Finance England throughout university, using a Pandas dataframe of payments (digitised from my paper statements).", "Using the above functions, the value owed in Student Finance loans at the start of employment can be calculated. After the April following graduation, you begin paying back towards your loan in the style of a monthly tax. In this simulation interest accrues on the loan daily and on the last working day of the month (BMonthEnd) your repayment comes out of your salary, as in reality.", "Monte Carlo methods are a class of algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results \u2014 by the law of large numbers, the expected value of a random variable can be approximated by taking the sample mean of independent samples. In plain English: \u201cwhile we don\u2019t know what the correct answer or strategy is, we can simulate many attempts and the average will approximate the right answer\u201d. Monte Carlo can be used for many problems with a probabilistic element or \u201crisk\u201d, such as gambling, or stock market and portfolio performance in finance. Here is a great example.", "Since the amount of student finance I will pay across my working life (through monthly payments) is based on what I earn at time t, and I don\u2019t know what I will earn, I can simulate my career earnings using Monte Carlo. In the simulation:", "As a graduate earner, most salary growth occurs in the early years (high % increase) before levelling off (low % increase) \u2014 see this incredibly thorough new report The impact of undergraduate degree on lifetime earnings by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.", "A pay-rise of x% in 5 years is not certain \u2014it could be slightly less than or greater than x%, or you could have a series of smaller or larger pay-rises (the aggregate of which are represented in the 5-year jump). Monte Carlo helps to mitigate this by drawing many salary values (k = 100,000) from a normal distribution for each band. These average x%, but can be less than or greater than x%. I simulate all these trajectories and the monthly payments towards my loan and work out in how many of the simulations I pay off my entire loan.", "As you can see in the top plot, only a small proportion of loans are ever paid off via monthly deductions. These loans are identifiable as the trajectories which cross the zero-line (marked in red) and correspond to the largest salaries. The lowest salaries across all years result in loans which continue to grow in value.", "DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial adviser \u2014 any ideas here are purely hypothetical based off simulations with a suite of assumptions & caveats. These are simply my thoughts on potentially effective strategies, as part of a conceptual exercise. If you are unsure about your own personal financial situation, seek the advice of a qualified financial adviser.", "This simulation, of course, contains several caveats:", "So what is the conclusion here? What strategy should you take with regard to paying off your student loan?", "Firstly, it should be highlighted that debt repayment is a blend of arithmetic and also psychology, because as complex creatures, our emotional welfare with regard to debt is affected by multiple factors. There are different debt consolidation strategies if you have multiple debt repayments to make e.g. Snowball or Avalanche methods.", "Secondly, in a purely mathematical sense, the optimum strategy for paying the minimum amount on the student loan would be to remain at a salary below the repayment threshold for the entire 30-year payment period, thereby receiving the degree for free, as you never pay a penny for it. However, this is only when considering the loan in isolation from other factors, and obviously does not reflect the real life ambitions of a typical graduate. With this in mind I consider strategies that assume progressive career growth which includes repaying your loan.", "Practically and in isolation, yes, you should try and pay it off with any extra money you encounter, because the Results show, on average, you will pay for the loan more than twice over across your working life time (99,691.01/42,000 = 2.37).", "Crucially, the major factor affecting amortisation in this problem is the dynamics between the interest and the monthly repayments. If the interest on the loan accrued in a given month is \u00a320, you need to pay more than \u00a320 in repayments at the end of the month to decrease the principal amount \u2014 this is basic mathematics.", "The key factor is the rate at which your salary increases, because of the powers of compound growth. Your repayments need to chip off the interest plus more to start decreasing the principal amount. But, if your salary means you don\u2019t manage to overcome the interest early on, even if your salary rises to a substantial amount later in life, the loan will have grown to an amount which demands a disproportionately higher salary to conquer the later monthly interest, which will be much greater due to the non-linearity of compound growth. Therefore, to successfully pay off your loan only through monthly tax repayments, the salary must grow fast enough in the early years such that repayments quickly overcome the interest and the debt is not \u201callowed\u201d to grow. The other option is that if your salary is too low to achieve this, you make voluntary repayments each month to make up the difference.", "Of course in reality, your loan repayment is not in isolation of other factors. It\u2019s a multi-dimensional problem! It comes down to what else you can invest any extra money in for the long term, because of the time-value of money and opportunity cost. Time-value of money is the concept that the same sum of money is worth more now than later on in life because of its earning potential and inflation.", "If you come across a sum of money that affords you the ability to pay off the loan (either from a savings account, inheritance etc.), you could invest it and grow it, utilising compound growth rather than only being a victim of it.", "I did a post-hoc analysis to show this. Suppose instead of paying off the loan, you use a long term, sit-and-hold strategy in an investment with a higher average return than the amount you pay towards the loan through monthly salary deductions \u2014 either with a lump sum equivalent to the value of the loan (\u00a342,000), or \u2014 since this situation will be very rare for the typical graduate \u2014 with an initial investment of \u00a31,000 and monthly deposits of any savings (\u00a3200).", "As these results show, even if the simulated graduate doesn\u2019t have a large lump sum available and uses a much more modest amount to begin investing their monthly savings, they could still end up in greater profit than if they paid off the loan completely. In most cases, graduates are unlikely to encounter this kind of lump sum, and to attempt to save money after your living costs to then pay towards the student loan could leave you forever chasing your own tail as the loan interest simultaneously compounds more than you can save \u2014 you would be better off investing it.", "This opportunity cost applies to other investments, like purchasing a house and leveraging its appreciation in value and even to investment in yourself, such as courses, seminars and conferences, which develop your skills and grow your network. Whilst this is hard to capture in monetary terms, it will generate more opportunity, and likely greater profit.", "It\u2019s not a crystal-clear conclusion\u2014 there are a lot of \u201c\u2018ifs\u201d:", "These results will undoubtedly inform my personal finance decisions in the near future.", "What is also reassuring is that the report mentioned above found that even after accounting for taxes and Student Finance repayments, UK graduates are still at least \u00a3100,000 better off, on average, for getting a degree, because of the additional, net take-home salary that they earn.", "This project has certainly shown me that the notion of \u201cdon\u2019t pay off the loan in full as it gets cancelled later on\u201d is misguided in its lack of elaboration \u2014 it completely depends on salary, because this determines if you under- or over-pay for your degree. If lifetime salary is low enough, then you could underpay for the degree via monthly repayments, in which case you should not pay extra or worry about investing. However, these simulations suggest that if you end up earning in the average (densest) region (see salary step plot in Results) then you should invest any extra money and pay the minimum on your loan. This is because you will need investments later on to counterbalance the over-payment of your degree. Of course, these conclusions are hypothetical and are drawn from the predicted interest rate and simulated salaries, which could be different.", "Apart from the greater understanding of the student loans system I have gained, this exercise did highlight something important. We do not have enough publicly available and consumable data tracking graduate lifetime earnings for different fields or careers. The report mentioned analyses longitudinal data for graduates and non-graduates from a particular cohort, and was very recently published \u2014 research like this needs to be made available and digestible to prospective undergraduates. Undergraduate university courses in the UK now cost up to \u00a39,250 per year, which you may pay for several times over as we have seen. We need data on what graduates of a particular course at a particular university go on to earn so candidates can judge for themselves what the ROI for their course and university would be, in light of the huge loan they would be taking on, rather than simply being dazzled by universities on Open Days.", "I hope this article has been insightful!
