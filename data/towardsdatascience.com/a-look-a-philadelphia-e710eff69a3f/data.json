Of these 1.59 million inhabitants, approximately 500,000 of them live in poverty. Today, a quick look at the dynamics of poverty within Philadelphia will be investigated by utilizing R and maps. Poverty will be explored at the zip-code level as per the 2010 Census. Here, several issues will be investigated including Poverty, Education, and Work-force throughout Philadelphia to gain a snap-shot of the city\u2019s health. For all, the investigation will utilize zip-code centric color-coded maps.", "Here, raw counts of poverty, per-capita counts of poverty, disparity-counts of poverty, and comparison between the disparity of the Black and Hispanic communities are looked at.", "A quick look at the total number of persons in poverty gives us:", "Although counts are helpful, they are not incredibly insightful without the back-drop of demographics or overall populations within each zip code. First, demographic-level poverty data will be mapped to explore any demographically-specific patterns in poverty.", "Below is the map of the raw counts of poverty per zip code for White Persons:", "It is apparent that as one moves more north-east in Philadelphia, the raw poverty counts of White Persons increases. As well, in \u201cSouth Philadelphia,\u201d a traditionally Italian-heritage area (zips: 19148, 19147, 19145), there is an increase in White Person poverty counts as well. West, South West, and North West have lower levels of poverty other than 19128.", "Below is the map of raw counts of poverty per zip code for Black Persons:", "Below is the map of the raw counts of poverty per zip code for Hispanic Persons:", "The raw counts for Hispanic Persons in poverty suggest a clustering in the North Philadelphia Region, a traditionally Hispanic section of the city. There are few Hispanic persons in poverty outside of this region throughout Philadelphia.", "The raw counts of the population are interesting in that one can see the clustering. Yet they are not that meaningful without controlling for population count or for representation. Below, those factors are taken into consideration.", "A more intuitive look at the poverty throughout the city can be seen as a look at the per-capita poverty rates per zip code compared to all other zip codes. Below is the map that illustrates the poverty levels.", "Here, it can be seen that a general theme exists. Within Center City Philadelphia, poverty levels are relatively low and increase as one moves out from the center. Looking at the raw numbers, we see a range of 0.8% in zip code 19107 (Old City), and 2.8% in zip code 19133 (North Philadelphia). Another less-than-average poverty level is zip code 19134 (Light Blue), known as University City, where Drexel University, The University of Pennsylvania, and the University of the Sciences. Another prominent university in Philadelphia, Temple University, is 19122, which sits at approximately 1.7% poverty rates.", "Now, our attention is turned to the per-capita poverty rates by demographics. To understand better the per capita poverty rates, let\u2019s first look at each zip to see which demographic group is most represented.", "Above, we can see no zip code wherein the Hispanic community is represented the most. As well, the communities of South Philadelphia, Center City, Old City (19107, 19106), Fishtown (19123, 19122, 19125, 19133), North East, and North West are dominated by the white community. In contrast, South West, West, and North Philadelphia are dominated by the black community.", "The graph below shows us how the poverty rates of white persons within each zip code compared to the total amount of people in that zip code.", "The map above demonstrates the amount of poverty, per racial demographic, compared to the total amount of per capita poverty throughout the city. The distribution is less surprising given the graph above, which demonstrated that the areas where White Poverty is highest in relation to other per-capita areas are also the areas that house the largest number of white persons. Yet, of the white cohort, the zip code with the highest relational per-capita poverty is in the far north-east in 19154.", "A look at the black community shares a similar distribution pattern as the white community. It follows the majority-dominant zip-codes. As seen below:", "Above, we see a similar theme as the white cohort. The highest relative poverty counts for the black cohort follow the same pattern within the zip codes, which have the dominant demographic group being black. North Philadelphia demonstrates the highest relative per-capita poverty for the black cohort throughout the city.", "Although there is no zip code wherein the Hispanic community is the dominant group. As such, it may be difficult to discern any patterns when the data are normalized, and it may still be insightful to look at the per-capita poverty counts for the Hispanic community as compared to the total per-capita poverty counts throughout the city. As seen below.", "Here the trend is similar to the raw poverty counts as the Hispanic community is centered in the North Philadelphia region. Zip code 19122 shows the highest level of per-capita poverty for the Hispanic community.", "Here the per-capita poverty counts of each demographic group were looked at through zip-code-centered maps. The zip codes were ranked by their per capita poverty counts compared to the other zip codes. In general, it was noted that the per-capita poverty patterns followed the general trends, as indicated in which community cohort is most dominant in each zip code. Yet subtle differences exist when investigating the per-capita counts as compared to the raw counts of poverty.", "Although per-capita rates demonstrate a typical normalized value when investigating sociologic or demographic factors, the per-capita rate does not capture any equity differences that may be present. As such, in the next section, per-capita poverty rates normalized against the specific demographics population count within the particular zip code will be investigated.", "Racial Disparity Model of Poverty Distribution", "The rationale behind a racial disparity model of poverty distribution is the following: Suppose a village has two groups of people, group A and group B. The total amount of people in the village is 100, with Group A having 80 people and group B having 20 people. Group A has 20 persons in poverty and group B both has 15 persons in poverty. In the per-capita values, group A is higher (20 people in poverty per 100 people in the village) than group B (15 people in poverty per 100 people in the village). Yet, group B seems to be over-represented in poverty compared to the number of persons in each group. For instance: group A has 20 persons in poverty per 80 people (20%), and group B has 15 people in poverty per 20 people (75%).", "It is said that the first metric (number of persons in poverty per group compared to the total number of persons) is an equality model of poverty. In contrast, the latter metric (number of persons in poverty per group compared to the number of persons in that group) is said to be a racial disparity model of poverty distribution.", "Thus, the following graphs represent the number of persons in poverty per demographic within a zip code controlled by the number of persons of that demographic within the zip code compared to the same metric across the city.", "Below is the white disparity metric for Philadelphia.", "Here we see that the disparity model counts give a clarified view of the behavior of poverty throughout the city. Zipcodes that did not have significant white poverty either by count or by per-capita values now have significant values. New zip codes emerge as high-valued poverty zips 19118, 19119, 19150, 19138 in the northwest have relatively high values of per-capita poverty for the white cohort compared to other parts of the city.", "Remarkably, the pattern of poverty for the black community when looked through the lens of disparity demonstrates wide-spread poverty that expands greatly beyond poverty when looked at through the lens of equality. The only zip codes wherein there are relatively low numbers of equity-derived per capita values are in Center City (19103, 19102) and Old City (19107). Outside of those zip codes, the equity-model of poverty captures a more comprehensive view. Poverty for the black community is rampant throughout the city.", "The disparity model for the Hispanic community is demonstrated below.", "The Hispanic community\u2019s equity map demonstrates wide-spread poverty centered in the North and North East Philadelphia region. Areas not captured originally by the equality model include South Philadelphia (19145, 19148) and West Philadelphia (19139). Yet the disparity model demonstrates more wide-spread poverty for the Hispanic community than the equality model could capture. However, still remaining is the high levels of per capita poverty of the Hispanic community in the North Philadelphia region.", "The equity model is a simple yet powerful tool for looking at the poverty levels of specific demographics within zip codes, and the maps can help look at the relative abundance of these poverty levels throughout Philadelphia.", "It is noted that the equity model highlights more wide-spread poverty for all three cohorts, but especially for the Black community whose poverty levels within the equity model highlight systemic levels of poverty. One of the consequences of the equity model is that one can compare one demographic to another on a more appropriate level. Whereas the equality model accounts for the population counts per zip code, it doesn\u2019t provide information in terms of representing the demographics of the individual zip codes.", "Thus, the benefit is that the equity zip code comparison can help identify in which zip codes, one demographic or the other, may be over or under-represented compared to some base-level of poverty. This will be explored next.", "In comparing the zip codes by demographic equity, one must choose base-level poverty to compare. That is, if in the village, we investigated the per-capita disparity poverty level to group A, the dominant group, one would find that of the 80 members, 20 of them are in poverty. Thus, if group A represents the dominant group within the village, by comparing the other groups\u2019 availability or accessibility to resources to the dominant group, one could directly gauge the level of disparity.", "The level of disparity-model poverty for group A is 2,500 per 10,000 persons in group A. Group B has a disparity model poverty of 7,500 per 10,000 members in group B. Thus, comparing the two, we see that group B has a disparity-level of 3.0 (7,500 / 2,500). That is, group B is over-represented in poverty by a factor of 3 as compared to the dominant group.", "The disparity-level is a de-facto equity number. The number represents how over-represented one group is in terms of poverty. The line of reasoning in quantifying this as an equity number is that one presumes that resources\u2019 availability is inversely related to the level of poverty a community would experience. Thus, comparing two groups, especially one minority group to a majority group, in terms of poverty and resource allocation throughout the city at the racial level can be established.", "It is worth noting that another way would be to measure the level of disparity poverty against the average level of disparity throughout the United States. Although useful in establishing the level of deviations in resources or quality of life (measured through poverty levels), this metric would provide insights into how the zip codes of Philadelphia are situated; it would provide little benefit if attempting to look at the relative differences within Philadelphia itself. Thus a base-group must be established within Philadelphia. Although there are Zip codes in Philadelphia wherein the dominant demographic is Black, it seemed unreasonable to consider the Black community within that zip code as the resource-dominant group such that one zip-code-community\u2019s influence would be minimal compared to the level of influence the white community has had nation-wide.", "Furthermore, comparing the zip-codes by the equity-model helps identify areas of increased poverty per demographic groups in complicated or overly saturated systems, such as Philadelphia. By normalizing demographics against a known or a base-amount (in this case, the nationally dominant demographic cohort), wide-spread poverty can be simmered down into patterns.", "In summary, it will be seen that the disparity-model can be used to compare zip codes throughout the Philadelphia region to gain insight into the different levels of resource allocation (as measured through poverty) differs between zip codes.", "Black Cohort comparison with White Cohort in terms of the Disparity Model of Poverty", "Here we see a difference in the equity of the poverty of the black community per zip code compared to the equity of the white community\u2019s poverty. There is over-representation, particularly in the West Philadelphia zip code of 19130 (darkest red). Yet, it is difficult to see if there is over or under-representation as in totality. As such, the following graph helps answer the question: \u201cIn which zip codes are the black communities over-represented in poverty?\u201d.", "These graphs are incredibly insightful. They demonstrate that the black community is over-represented in poverty in a larger number of zip codes than may not have been elucidated by looking at the equality maps or even the raw count maps compared to the raw counts of population. For even in the predominately black communities of West and North Philadelphia, when controlling for both per-capita poverty rates and relative population counts, when compared to the white cohort, there is still an over-representation of poverty within these demographics.", "Interestingly, the areas that demonstrated the highest level of per-capita values of poverty for the black community show diminished over-representation levels compared to the equity white poverty levels. This suggests that both the white and black poverty levels are abnormally and comparatively high in some zip codes.", "Hispanic Cohort comparison with White Cohort in terms of the Disparity Model of Poverty", "Using the same methodology, we can look at the Hispanic cohorts poverty levels. Below are two graphs, the first demonstrating the relative amount of equity poverty levels for the Hispanic community compared to the white cohorts\u2019 equity poverty counts within the same zip code. The second shows whether or not the Hispanic community is over or underrepresented in the poverty pool distinctly.", "Again, as with the black community, the Hispanic community seems to be over-represented in the poverty pool throughout Philadelphia compared to the level of poverty of the white community to a greater level than was observed using simple equality and even equity models. Here, the over-representation of the Hispanic community\u2019s poverty extends significantly from the isolated North Philadelphia region noted previously. Now, it can be seen that West Philadelphia and North Philadelphia regions have even greater levels of disequilibrium in poverty.", "The theory was that in looking at poverty, one could gain insight into the level of resource allocation throughout the city. This rests on the assumption that the more resources one has, the less likely or, the less prominent poverty would be. However, to look at the relative amounts of disparity-derived poverty levels, one must have something to compare the levels to. In this investigation, it was chosen that the historically and nationally resource-dominant group, the White cohort, would be the base-level to which all other demographics would be compared.", "The resulting disparity-comparison model of poverty provides useful insights into the relative amounts of poverty throughout the city. Although raw counts, per-capita counts, and even the disparity-model counts are useful, the disparity-model\u2019s true benefit is comparing the demographics across zip codes. The disparity-model comparisons allow one to see that the poverty levels between minority demographics and the dominant demographics can tell a more complete story.", "It was shown that for all demographics compared to the white cohort, the poverty levels were more significant than could be captured by simple counts without comparisons. In particular, the Black community seems vastly over-represented in the poverty pool when utilizing the disparity-comparison model. Although this is suggested in the simple disparity model, the real significance is caught when one uses the disparity-comparison model.", "The view of the Hispanic community\u2019s poverty levels was drastically altered with the disparity model and especially the disparity-comparison model. In the raw counts and even the per-capita counts, the Hispanic community\u2019s poverty levels seemed centered in the North Philadelphia region. Yet, when using the disparity-model, it was noted that the level of poverty for the Hispanic community stretched well beyond the North Philadelphia region. This was echoed with more precision by the disparity-comparison model, which showed the Hispanic community\u2019s over-representation is systemic throughout Philadelphia.", "These models are useful when needing to use an equity-based decision-making system with efforts to increase resource availability to a specific demographic. Thus, these may be of particular use to social workers or social institutions that wish to utilize a more comprehensive approach to allocating their attention and resources.", "Next, more in-depth investigations will be performed. The next post will allow us to answer questions such as \u201cIs there a way to include the level of poverty in these models? How does that change the view of poverty within Philadelphia\u201d.", "For those interested in the math behind these models and the code utilized, keep a lookout for my write-ups on those subjects!", "Your home for data science.
