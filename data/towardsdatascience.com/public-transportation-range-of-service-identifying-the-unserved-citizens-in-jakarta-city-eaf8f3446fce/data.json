Public transportation usage must be promoted by first widening the service coverage to the residents. This covering distance should be within 700 m based on the standard walking distance as humans have limited stamina to walk. So,", "has Jakarta\u2019s 700 m public transportation range of service reached all of its residents?", "The answer is no. There are around (approximated) 827.594 (out of 10 million) citizens that live beyond current public transportation walking distance. 9160.16 out of 64,752 hectares (around 14%) are not covered by the service range. To reduce the number, there is a need to plan new routes and produce a spatial plan that either incorporates the route, OR is incorporated by the new route.", "Jakarta is among the worst if we are talking about congestion; it lingers in the top 10 wost congested cities in the world. Time lost due to congestion may take up to more than 19 minutes in the morning and 26 minutes in the evening. Such that, each year, 7 days and 6 hours are spent by each Jakarta citizens for traffic congestion (Tomtom, 2019). Moreover, the congestion results in the surge of air pollution that is, needless to say, slowly intoxicating its citizens. Despite various metrics and rankings by many institutions, it does not diminish the urgency of the problem, and this problem still needs to be addressed.", "Surely, something has to be done to reduce this usage: by shifting the private vehicle consumption to public transportation. This can be done by reducing the cost of public transportation, and by cost, I don\u2019t mean monetary value. The cost\u2019s components can be composed of experience, amenity, feelings, convenience, ticket price, and many things that affect a person\u2019s decision to use public transportation (although the calculation using some statistical methods may convert these variables to a monetary unit). I suggest that The most fundamental variable for people to use public transportation is transportation\u2019s range of service; the distance that a person should walk to access public transportation.", "(Imagine: even with the nicest train or bus,\u00a0beautiful\u00a0pedestrian\u00a0way; you would not walk 10 km just to use the\u00a0service, would you?)", "Well, 10 km is just an exaggeration. The point is, the walking distance should be short. There are many justifications for this statement, but it\u2019s going to take a deep dive into some academic papers, lots of statistics will be involved, and I don\u2019t want this essay to get heavy. So, let\u2019s just keep it light (if you want to look for arguments, see this, and this). Note, I don\u2019t ignore other causing variables. My argument is that before we fulfill other variables, the range of service should be prioritized.", "With limited capacity to walk, the range of service must be within walking distance: that is, 700m. This number is set by Jakarta Provincial Regulation as a standard for designating Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) region. Beyond this number, it is expected that people will use other means of transportation because it is too tiring to walk! Thus, we have to make sure that every citizen in Jakarta is within this 700m threshold.", "This range is 2 dimensional and results in an area, that is defining the transportation range of service. In my other article, I use other nomenclature: Pedestrian Catchment Area (PCA), but it is essentially the same.", "This essay seeks to identify the number of citizens that are not within the 700m transportation range of service. To achieve that, some geographical data are used:", "Some analysis uses the 700 m distance as circular radius, but empirically, people don\u2019t fly. People walk and turn; roads have intersections and curves, so this 700 m walking distance is certainly within 700 m radius.", "This section explains the input data: transportation facilities, road geometry, and population distribution.", "There are many transportation providers in Jakarta both private and state-owned enterprises. Although the published list of current transportation services can be found in the official open data website, Trafi has collected and provided a comprehensive collection of the data, which I must credit. The dots are the facilities\u2019 stops; there, you can embark on the cars or busses.", "Road geometry is retrieved from OpenStreetMap (OSM). Notice the dots on the map. The dots are the public transportation stops retrieved from Trafi. The road geometry encompassed all road hierarchy (motorway, primary, secondary, residential, pedestrian, etc.). Zooming in, we can see the complexity of Jakarta\u2019s road design.", "I stumbled on my senior\u2019s article which discusses the degree of Indonesia\u2019s urbanization (in terms of built-up regions and density) and regional urban system. One of the arguments is that in order to define and analyze a metropolitan area, we need population data in grids. I could not agree more, and fortunately, The Global Human Settlement Layer, as the article mentioned, provides such data.", "The continuous nature of raster data provides flexibility in analysis. It disregards the discrete nature of geographical data that is aggregated to administrative boundaries (such as data that can be visualized by choropleth maps). As a data analyst, this kind of continuous data, sparks joy! This article\u2019s analysis needs continuous data, not discrete ordinal data.", "For each transportation facility stop, I identified the pedestrian catchment area (PCA) as the range of service (PCA and range of service are interchangeable) and eliminated the regions that are already covered by the pedestrian catchment area. This results in regions that are not covered by the pedestrian catchment but some regions are meant to be not covered by the PCA such as airports, empty fields, lakes.", "So, I extract by overlaying the population data with the regions that are not served by transportation facilities (regions beyond 700 m). This is why continuous population data is needed because extracting discrete geographical data (such as spatially extracting from the administrative boundary) does not make sense!", "I guess it is easier if the readers to just look at the figure below.", "The result of the analysis is a raster that holds the value of citizens that are not covered by the current public transportation range of service. As the objective stated, this essay seeks to identify the number of unserved citizens.", "Summing up all of the cells\u2019 values, there are approximately 827,594 citizens that are not served. Note that I use \u201capproximately\u201d this is because the population data\u2019s scale is too small, and needs to be reassessed based on the local context.", "Furthermore, 9160.16 out of 64,752 hectares (around 14%) are not covered by the service. However, parts of the 14% are not supposed to be covered or are needless to be covered. These parts are regions that are not populated: lakes, an airport, empty fields, etc. So, there are always regions that are not served by transportation service and it is expected.", "This section explains about the recommendation and the importance of integrating transportation plan and urban/spatial plan.", "Transportation and urban planning/design are inseparable. Land use affects transportation and transportation affects land use. Because of these interactions, the transportation plan must be integrated with the urban spatial plans; transportation plan can not stand alone as transportation is defined and compiled by the built environment around them.", "Counter-intuitively, we can say that, in order to improve our transportation, we can intervene in our urban environment, without intervening transportation itself. For example,", "Putting it into context; what should we do to the current Jakarta citizens that live beyond the 700m transportation range of service?", "Obviously, plan new routes that serve the unserved residents. But! Make sure that the pedestrian network around the route incorporates the new route, providing a direct line to the service or shorter distance. This can be done by producing new urban design plans for some prioritized regions.", "Another quite radical idea is to reorganize the building mass to produce higher permeability. Consolidate the land and reorganize the space, moving the unserved citizens to the already served nearby neighbourhood. I feel like this one is less likely, but hey! That\u2019s what the Japanese did!", "To achieve the recommendation, the Transportation Agency (that plans routes), and The Planning Agency (that plans the spatial plan), or any other entities must collaborate.", "At least in my experience, (I would like and need to learn more about this too) the reality of our Indonesian institution entities (Government or non-government) is that these entities sometimes move independently. For example, the developers are developing their own privately acquired land and the travel agencies are planning their own routes; while there is a need of synergizing these independent activities. Wouldn\u2019t it be powerful if the land developers are also transportation service providers? hey! That\u2019s what the Japanese did! (I learned a lot from the Japanese!)", "I am not saying that such effort does not exist (I mean, that\u2019s what our Government is for). My message is as an urban planning graduate, I think we must be aware of such phenomenon; that transportation and spatial plan are dependent on each other.", "Your home for data science.
