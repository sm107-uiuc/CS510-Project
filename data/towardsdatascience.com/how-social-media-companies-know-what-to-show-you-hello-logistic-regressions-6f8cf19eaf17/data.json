Data has grown to become one of the world\u2019s valuable resource, so much so that almost every decision made within big companies are strictly driven by data. This extreme use of data is especially seen within social media companies or large platforms that have advertisements and recommendations. This makes sense because that platform\u2019s conversion rate is the bread of butter of its business. Therefore, every piece of content that a user sees should be optimized to achieve its maximum potential.", "When browsing through Instagram, for example, there are very powerful machine learning algorithms running in the background to determine whether a user would be interested in a piece of content. These algorithms can take a variety of inputs to determine interest, and these can include features such as the user\u2019s age, the content that the user usually interacts with, and even how frequently the user is active on Instagram. The reason that machine learning algorithms can predict this is because these algorithms find and apply patterns to large sets of data. Thus, based on the various patterns detected among the platform\u2019s enormous user-base, predictions can be made about various subsets of users.", "Now, this act of determining whether a user would be interested in the content or not is referred to as a classification problem. Classification problems refer to grouping observations into discrete classes based on criteria developed by a model. More broadly, this scenario can be considered a regression analysis. This is the technique of finding the relationship between a dependent variable and either one or multiple independent variables. For example, one might notice that the hotter it is, the faster ice-cream melts. In this scenario, the temperature is the independent variable and the rate of ice-cream melting is the dependent variable. In addition to temperature, there can be other variables which affect the rate at which the ice-cream melts. Maybe the ice-cream would initially melt faster because of the drastic change in temperature but eventually melt slower as everything liquefies. In this case, the amount of time eating the ice-cream would also be an independent variable.", "Different types of regression analysis can be performed, with the first being a linear regression. As the name suggests, it determines the extent to which there is a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. If a linear regression were to be applied to the ice-cream example, it would be referred to as a multiple linear regression since there is more than one independent variable predicting the ice-cream\u2019s rate of melting. Linear regression is a powerful tool and it can be used by companies to determine whether a user would be interested in the promoted content. Here, the regression\u2019s job would be to predict the probability that the user would be interested in the content, and the decision rule would be that the user is interested if the probability is over 70%, for example.", "However, there is a large potential issue with using linear regression to predict this probability. The probability of an event is a measure of the likelihood that the event will occur, and this measurement is bounded between 0 and 1 (or 0% and 100%). That means, even if the entire world is completely certain that an event will occur, it does not now increase the probability of that event to 112%. Similarly, negative probability does not exist. But this is not the case under a linear regression. Due to the nature of linear regressions, if one were used, it would likely predict a value that is outside of the bounds of probability. Additionally, since a linear regression applies a \u2018best fit\u2019 line to data, much larger (and much smaller) observations will alter the slope of the line; thus, changing the classifications when given a fixed decision rule.", "Because of this, logistic regressions are more appropriate. This is a regression where the output variable is a categorical variable that has two or more mutually exclusive levels. That is, the output can be \u2018interested\u2019 versus \u2018not interested\u2019, or \u2018type A\u2019 versus \u2018type B\u2019 versus \u2018type C\u2019 (where A and B are compared against C as the base type). Logistic regressions predict probabilities, and the classification is assigned based on the decision rule set in place. The advantage over linear regressions is that the probability output of logistic regressions is within the bounds of probability. This is because logistic regressions follow the mathematical concept of logistic growth. Let us go back to the ice-cream problem to understand this concept a bit more. Suppose that the ice-cream is removed from a freezer and placed in a much warmer, temperature-stabilized environment. The ice-cream begins to melt rapidly due to the increase in temperature, but the ice-cream cannot melt forever. Rather, it will melt until everything becomes liquified and the rate at which it is melting will be zero (because it has stopped melting). Under a linear regression, a negative melting rate might be predicted, even though the ice-cream has stopped melting.", "A logistic regression\u2019s ability to provide probabilities and classify observations using both continuous and discrete measurements make it a very popular method in machine learning. As can be expected, logistic regressions are not only useful to determine whether a user might be interested in particular content or to model to melting rate of ice-cream. This method is used within the financial industry to determine credit card fraud, the medical field to identify malignant and benign tumors, and even by email services to detect spam messages. It must be noted that due to the mathematical structure of logistic regression, the coefficients on variables cannot be interpreted as intuitively as with those from linear regression, and it does not directly output a probability. Rather, it outputs the logarithmic odds of an event, and this output can be converted to probabilities using mathematical transformations.", "Regression analysis is powerful, but it is most important to utilize the most appropriate type of analysis given the problem at hand. Logistic regressions are most appropriate for classification problems where the dependent variable is either dichotomous or categorical. So, the next time you see some promoted content on Instagram, it would be interesting to think about what variables made the Instagram algorithms think that you were more likely to be interested in seeing it.", "Your home for data science.
