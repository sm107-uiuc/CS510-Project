To make us cautious. Pareidolia. A well-known phenomenon, when we see faces where aren\u2019t any. We see faces on Mars, we see Jesus in the toast, we see it everywhere. Well, it does our brain, which is trained on biometrical recognition: eyes, nose, mouth = when everything is in the right place, that\u2019s a face.", "It originated from our past \u2014 as we were strolling around the woods hunting mammoths. It was better to confound a bush with a tiger once more than to ignore an actual predator between the trees. Survival instinct.", "Neural Networks are acting similarly. They recognize what they are trained on. The best example is StyleGAN2 Projection, where the latent image is juxtaposed with an uploaded one and is examined for its origins (more about this later).", "Here is an example of human and artificial Pareidolia:", "While our human eye sees a face in some random rock formations, Convolutional Neural Networks of an early version of Google Deep Dreams recognizes dogs. Everywhere. The explanation to the question \u201cwhy dogs?\u201d was obvious:", "In Deep Dream\u2019s case, that data set is from ImageNet, a database created by researchers at Stanford and Princeton who built a database of 14 million human-labeled images. But Google didn\u2019t use the whole database. Instead, they used a smaller subset of the ImageNet database released in 2012 for use in a contest\u2026 a subset which contained \u201cfine-grained classification of 120 dog sub-classes.\u201d(Source: FastCompany)", "This was one of the first visualizations of biased Neural Networks, being trained on a limited dataset. It isn\u2019t AI\u2019s fault to be unable to recognize objects it isn\u2019t trained on. It\u2019s up to us.", "But this flaw can become an advantage \u2014 if used for experimental purposes.", "You have already seen the StyleGAN2 Projection feature.", "The main task of this function is to compare a given image with the seeds from the Latent Space (hidden layer of StyleGAN, where all unique image seeds are located before they are getting modified). Among others, the matching images can point out the Deep Fake (for criminologists\u2019 Image Forensics).", "At some point in my experiment, I tried other imagery than physiognomical pictures.", "Or even an unsettling one (speaking of Uncanny Valley):", "I used for this experiment StyleGAN2-based Neural Network, trained on Faces from FlickrDataset, StyleGAN2 for FFHQ dataset at 1024\u00d71024.", "The same dataset is implemented in a web application ArtBreeder. Using the upload function, you can augment the latent space with new images. But they are aligned with StyleGAN2 trained network and modified in a compatible way using Projection feature.", "Sometimes adding a particular non-latent image to the Latent Space causes interesting effects. In one case, StyleGAN2 \u201ccorrected\u201d a photo of an artist, who playfully had covered his eye with a paper disc:", "Experimenting with limited recognition skills (which are caused by limited training) can bring fascinating results.", "It began, as I tried to upload a photo of an object. Without any facial expressions or biometric elements. My motivation was to examine, in what way StyleGAN2 can identify and categorize a random motif (instead of photo portrait).", "So I uploaded my photo of a cup of coffee. Random as it is.", "Using further modifications of various Neural Layers (specific face features) new portraits were generated. As you see, neither could AI recognize the drawing, nor imitate its physiognomical style and features. But the outcomes were nevertheless unique, instead.", "As you see, in the first image the dark spot was recognized by AI as an eye \u2014 and other parts of the face followed.", "In motion, you can see better the transitions between changing neural layers of faces. But you can never spot any traces of a cup of coffee.", "This experiment proves in a very visual way:", "The quality of an ML recognition model is highly dependent on datasets it was trained on. And the quality of those datasets is dependent on labeling and preparation by humans.", "Before we trust to AI, we should enable this trust in ourselves.
