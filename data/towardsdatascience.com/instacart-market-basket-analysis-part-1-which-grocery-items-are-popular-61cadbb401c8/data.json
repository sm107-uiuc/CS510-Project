As a Data Journalist, a big part of my role is sharing code chunks with my readers.", "Now the reports that I share need to be rendered properly on the web. And the code that I share also needs to be reproducible.", "Saturn Cloud solves both use cases for me.", "In this 3-part blog series, I will walk you through an example of how I use Saturn Cloud to communicate my results. In particular, I will work on the Instacart Market Basket Analysis, showing the results on which products that an Instacart consumer will purchase again.", "Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, is one of my favorite tech platforms. As a graduate student with a busy academic schedule, I simply don\u2019t have the time to do grocery shopping. Instacart aims to make it easy to do the shopping online with the touch of a button. After the customers select the products through the Instacart app, personal shoppers review the order and do the in-store shopping and delivery for customers. You can think of Instacart as the Uber for grocery shopping.", "Back in 2017, the company announced its first public dataset release, which is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. The goal is then to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user\u2019s next order. In this post, I\u2019ll do some exploratory analysis to get some surface-level insights about the dataset.", "Firstly, let\u2019s explore the data for Instacart products. There are 2 CSV files, namely order_products_train and order_products_prior, that specify which products were purchased in each order. More specifically, order_products_prior contains previous order products for all customers and order_products_train contains the latest order products for some customers only.", "Overall, there are 3,346,083 unique orders for 49,685 unique products. We can observe in the plot below that people usually order around 5 products.", "About 59% of ordered products are previously ordered by customers. The plot below shows the products that are usually most reordered by probability. The top 5 most re-ordered products, by probability, are Serenity Ultimate Extrema Overnight Pads (0.933), Chocolate Love Bar (0.922), Maca Buttercups (0.894), Benchbreak Chardonnay (0.892), and Organic Blueberry B Mega (0.889).", "Let\u2019s now explore the data for Instacart orders. The orders.csv file has 3,421,083 orders and 7 feature columns:", "It looks like Instacart customers mostly made their orders between 8 AM and 7 PM during a typical day.", "And it seems like they mostly made their orders during the weekend (0 is Saturday and 1 is Sunday).", "The plot below shows the Instacart customers\u2019 period of reorders. There are obvious spikes on day 7 and day 30, signifying that people usually reorder either after a week or after a month.", "There are a total of 206,209 unique customers in this dataset. As observed below, most customers made about 4 orders.", "Let\u2019s look at the most important aisles over all departments, as being sorted by the number of products. Ignoring the \u2018missing\u2019 values, we have the top 5 aisles being Candy Chocolate (1,258), Ice Cream (1,091), Vitamins Supplements (1,038), Yogurt (1,026), and Chips Pretzels (989).", "Doing this analysis allows me to understand in fine-grained details about the customer shopping behavior on the Instacart platform. Knowing which items are most frequently purchased is the first step for Instacart to optimize its software product and recommend items for customers while they shop.", "If you are interested in reproducing this result yourself, you can download the dataset from the Instacart website and view my notebook on Saturn Cloud here. Personally, the ability to quickly and easily share notebooks is truly helpful for any data scientist.", "In the next part of this blog post series, I will segment the customers into different groups, which can help Instacart deliver more personalized recommendations for different needs. Furthermore, I will explore Saturn\u2019s feature that allows me to scale for cloud computing as I have a higher computing need.", "Your home for data science.
