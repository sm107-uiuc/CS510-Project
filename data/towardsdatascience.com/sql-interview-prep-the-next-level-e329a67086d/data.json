Every interviewer has their own deal-breakers; mine is SQL. If you have conceptual issues with SQL, then that means you might wind up unintentionally pulling data incorrectly. Data Scientists need to pull data correctly in order to build train/test sets for their Machine Learning (ML) models. Data Engineers need to pull data correctly in order to provide reliable data sources for stakeholders. If a Data Engineer makes a mistake, that mistake can affect more than one ML model- it can propagate out to all of the Data Science, analytics, marketing, and finance teams that subscribe to that dataset. SQL skills are important. Most entry-level interviewees know the fundamentals of a SELECT * statement, GROUP BY, and all of the different types of JOINs, but they struggle to really conceptualize the data. Let\u2019s go over a few real-world examples that will hopefully boost your SQL interview prep to the next level.", "Let\u2019s say that it\u2019s your first day working as a Data Scientist for an online retailer, Pets R Us. You have a table, customers, that keeps track of all customer records. Each customer record includes a customer ID, cust_id, and the creation date for that record, cre8_dt. Can you write a SQL query that calculates the percentage of customer records that were created prior to \u20182007\u201312\u201322'?", "Here\u2019s the hack-ish way I would have done this on my first day as a Data Scientist. First I would have counted the total number of records in the table:", "Then I would have counted the number of records that were created before \u20182007\u201312\u201322\u2019:", "But\u2026 don\u2019t do it that way in an interview! Here\u2019s a more concise way to do it:", "The trick here is to first use a sub-query to create a flag for whether or not an account was created before or after our date threshold. Then, we can GROUP BY that flag in the main query. When we build the perc_of_tot column, the COUNT(*) counts the total number of accounts in each group (one group for cre8_flag = \u2018before\u2019, another group for cre8_flag = \u2018after\u2019). Since we don\u2019t include a PARTITION BY after the OVER(), SUM(COUNT(*)) sums the counts over the entire result set, which in this case is made up of two values: COUNT(*) for the \u2018before\u2019 group and COUNT(*) for the \u2018after\u2019 group.", "It\u2019s only been a week since you joined the Data Science team at Pets R Us, and your manager wants you to work on the new Pupcake acquisition campaign. She asks you to build a ML model that predicts the likelihood that an existing customer who has never bought Pupcakes will buy a Pupcake within the next four weeks.", "Let\u2019s think about the data you need to pull in order to build your train/test sets for this model. First, you need to aggregate customer sales data over two time periods: (1) an outcome period (let\u2019s say four weeks prior to today) and (2) a baseline period (let\u2019s say twelve weeks prior to the outcome period).", "Assume that you managed to pull two datasets so far. You wrote each dataset to a table:", "What you really need is a list of customers who purchased at least one item from Pets R Us during the baseline period but did not purchase any Pupcakes during that time. Can you write a SQL query that generates such a list of customers, using the two tables above?", "This is a useful trick, and I\u2019ve been asked to do this in an interview before! It\u2019s actually called a LEFT ANTI JOIN in Scala and PySpark. The LEFT ANTI JOIN above will only return customers from the left-hand table (cust_basel) that do not exist in the right-hand table (cust_pupcakes_basel).", "Let\u2019s go back to the Pets R Us customers table from our first example. We\u2019ve already gone over the cust_id and cre8_dt columns. Each record also has a full_nm column and an email_adr column. Assume that this table is unique on cust_id (i.e. each cust_id appears only once). Here\u2019s a sample of five rows from the table:", "In addition to the customers table, you also have access to the cards table, which stores credit card information. Each record has a card_id (internally generated by Pets R Us to ensure that each card has a unique ID), the cardholder\u2019s full name (full_nm), card expiration date (exp_dt), the cust_id associated with the card, and the most recent date the card was used to make a Pets R Us purchase (last_purch_dt).", "First question (without inspecting the data): do you think the cards table is unique on cust_id?", "Answer: No, because each customer can have multiple credit cards.", "Here is a small sample of what the cards table looks like:", "Second question: can you write a SQL query that displays the total number of active credit cards associated with each cust_id, along with that customer\u2019s full name and email address?", "Here\u2019s what most entry-level candidates do:", "Most people begin by first using the cards table to count the number of cards for each cust_id. They then throw that into a sub-query and join it back to the customers table to get the full_nm and email_adr.", "Here\u2019s a more concise way of doing it:", "Notice that we actually don\u2019t need a sub-query here! Since we know that each cust_id only has one unique full_nm and email_adr associated with it, we can just do a JOIN to the cards table and GROUP BY cust_id, full_nm, and email_adr. However, if the customers table is not unique on cust_id, then the above query might produce duplicate cust_id\u2019s.", "Follow-up question: how do you check if there are duplicate cust_id\u2019s in the customers table?", "The main point here is that you can add extra columns to the GROUP BY clause even if you\u2019re not necessarily grouping by them. In the above case, we\u2019re technically only grouping by cust_id, while the full_nm and email_adr columns are just customer attributes. However, we can throw other columns into the GROUP BY as long as they are unique on cust_id. I have seen this discussed in a SQL interview before!", "Here\u2019s another challenge: using the customers and cards tables, write a SQL query that displays each cust_id, their full_nm, and card_adr.", "First, before diving into the SQL, let\u2019s inspect the data we have and think about it conceptually. Scroll back up to the previous section and take another look at a few rows from the cards table. It looks like Dwayne Johnson (cust_id = 2) has at least three credit cards, and each card has a slightly different address associated with it. So if some customers have multiple credit cards, and each card could theoretically have a different address associated with it (or even the same address formatted differently), how do we choose exactly one address for each customer?", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at Dwayne\u2019s three cards. One has expired while the other two are still active. The active cards have the same address but they are formatted differently. The expired card has a totally different address. It looks like perhaps Dwayne might have moved recently and the expired card reflects his old address.", "What we need to do first is PARTITION all of the records in the cards table by cust_id. This means that each customer has their own partition that includes only their own credit cards. We tell SQL how to order the cards within each partition: by last_purch_dt. The card with the most recent last_purch_dt will be ranked first. Once we rank all the cards, we select only the card that is ranked first for each customer. This way, we will be left with only one card (and one address) per customer.", "There are other ways to select one card per customer. For example, you could take exp_dt into account or use some kind of transactions table to determine the frequency with which each card has been used in the past month. The point here is to know that you should use some kind of PARTITION BY statement.", "Also, be sure not to over-think tasks in an interview setting; try to solve the problem without adding unnecessary complexity. You can always layer on top of your solution if the interviewer wants to follow-up. If a candidate is a SQL whiz but makes something simple unnecessarily complicated, that can still reflect poorly upon them.", "Your business stakeholders at Pets R Us would like to analyze the distribution of Black Friday sales per customer over the past 10 years. First, before we dive headfirst into SQL, let\u2019s think about everything we need in order to fulfill this request.", "We need a table with all the Pets R Us transactions in it. Each transaction will be associated with a customer and a date. First we should filter the transactions to only those from Black Friday. Then we can aggregate sales by customer.", "You could probably just look up the dates for Black Friday from the past 10 years and hard-code them into your SQL query. However, in most cases it\u2019s generally best to avoid hard-coding. Plus, this is an interview- so what would be the fun of that??", "The Data Engineering team has provided the Data Science team with a dimensional date table, dim_date, to help with date filtering tasks such as this one. Here are a few sample rows from dim_date:", "Question: using dim_date, can you write a SQL query that generates a list of dates for all the Black Fridays between 2010 and 2020?", "Hint: use the rule that Thanksgiving occurs on the fourth Thursday of every November.", "The output should look like this:", "Follow-up question: what happens if we change order of the column names in the PARTITION BY clause?", "Answer: This will not change the output since the same records in dim_date get grouped together regardless of whether you sort them by year first, by month first, or by day-of-week first. However, the output could change if you have multiple columns in the ORDER BY clause and you change their order.", "Let\u2019s say that we wrote the output of the Black Friday query to a table: blk_fri_dates. Now that we have a table with all of the dates we want to use for filtering transactions, let\u2019s take a look at a few records from the transactions table so we can get a feel for the transactional data:", "Question: using the transactions table, the blk_fri_dates table, and any other Pets R Us tables that we have discussed above, sum up the total sales for each customer for each Black Friday between 2010 and 2020.", "First, we start with the transactions table. We INNER JOIN the transactions table to the blk_fri_dates table, since we only want to grab transactions that took place on Black Friday. We also have to INNER JOIN the transactions table to the cards table, since we need to look up which cust_id corresponds to which card_id for each transaction.", "Here are a few rows of sample output:", "Follow-up question: if there are duplicate rows in the blk_fri_dates table, what happens to the above output?", "Answer: imagine that the blk_fri_dates table erroneously has two rows for the year 2020:", "In this case, if we INNER JOIN this table to transactions, each Black Friday transaction from 2020 will be double counted.", "Follow-up question: if blk_fri_dates has duplicate rows, how can you adjust the above SQL query so that you still get the correct Black Friday sales per customer?", "Bonus: we can further optimize this query by using a LEFT SEMI JOIN on the blk_fri_dates table instead of an INNER JOIN:", "The LEFT SEMI JOIN above will select only the transactions from transactions (left-hand table) where there are one or more matches on the id_date column in blk_fri_dates (right-hand table). The great thing about LEFT SEMI JOINs is that if there are duplicate rows in blk_fri_dates, the LEFT SEMI JOIN won\u2019t duplicate transactions like an INNER JOIN will.", "A LEFT SEMI JOIN usually performs faster than an INNER JOIN because it can only return columns from the left-hand table. Since we don\u2019t need to select any columns from blk_fri_dates in this query, the LEFT SEMI JOIN is a great choice. Consider a LEFT SEMI JOIN the next time you need to do some filtering!", "Let\u2019s revisit the above query that aggregates total sales for each customer for each Black Friday between 2010 and 2020. Think about what your business stakeholders originally asked for: \u201cthe distribution of Black Friday sales per customer over the past 10 years.\u201d Is the solution above thoroughly sufficient for this purpose?", "Hint: what happens if a customer has associated transactions in the transactions table for Black Fridays 2010-2014 and Black Fridays 2016\u20132020, but not Black Friday 2015?", "Answer: if a customer (let\u2019s say cust_id=20) did not make any transactions on Black Friday 2015, then the output rows for total Black Friday sales for that customer will look something like this:", "Notice how there is simply no record for Black Friday 2015? What we really want is something that looks like this:", "When you get a question like this in an interview, it is almost certainly a LEFT JOIN question. The aggregated Black Friday sales output will go on the right-hand side. But what should go on the left-hand side?", "On the left-hand side, we need every possible combination of customer and Black Friday. In other words, we need to write a SQL query that generates every possible cust_id, black_friday pair.", "First, generate output with every unique customer:", "Second, generate output with every unique Black Friday between 2010\u20132020:", "Third, multiply them together with a CROSS JOIN:", "Note: remember that CROSS JOINs are very computationally expensive, so use with caution.", "Question: using the query we just wrote to generate every possible unique customer, Black Friday pair, and the query we wrote in the previous section to aggregate total Black Friday sales for each customer, write a SQL query that outputs total Black Friday sales for each year for each customer. If a customer made no Black Friday transactions for any year, then they should show up as $0.00 for that year.", "I used a WITH clause to build a temporary table since I didn\u2019t want my SQL query to get messy with too many sub-queries. Notice that I selected the cust_id and black_friday columns from the left-hand table. This is important: if you accidentally select cust_id or black_friday from the right-hand table, you could get nulls, which negates the purpose of the LEFT JOIN. I used a COALESCE to replace any nulls from the LEFT JOIN with a 0.0.", "Also note that I like to add qualitative comments at the top of each sub-query to keep track of what my code is doing. I have seen people use two, three, or more levels of sub-queries without including any comments. I find this hard to read. I recommend including comments in order to facilitate collaboration and make it easier for team members to review your code.", "Let\u2019s take a step back after all of that work. There\u2019s actually one more thing that we need to account for before we throw a bunch of histograms together and send them to our stakeholders.", "Hint: take a closer look at a few customer records:", "Only Karen Gillan\u2019s Pets R Us account was in existence for every Black Friday between 2010\u20132020. Dwayne Johnson\u2019s account wasn\u2019t created until after Black Friday 2020. Should Dwayne Johnson\u2019s zero Black Friday sales be included in the histogram for 2010? For 2015? For 2020? No, no, and no. Should Awkwafina\u2019s zero Black Friday sales be included in the histogram for 2007? No. For 2008? Yes.", "In this article, we won\u2019t discuss specifically how to address the above consideration, but think about how you would approach the problem, either programmatically or with SQL. There are multiple correct approaches to this! If you think of multiple approaches, which approach has the best performance? If you think of just one approach, how can you optimize it? This could be a great qualitative discussion towards the end of an interview.", "As you can see, pulling data can get tricky very quickly. It\u2019s extremely important to think qualitatively about the task at hand and to anticipate how to maneuver around any eccentricities or known flaws in your data.", "\u2014 every Data Engineer I have ever met", "If you\u2019re in an interview, don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions about the dataset at hand. It shows an interviewer that you\u2019re detail-oriented, thoughtful, and less likely to make mistakes on the job.", "The above examples are variations of actual interview questions that I have seen plenty of interviewees struggle with. Sometimes my team really likes a candidate, but their SQL is so undeveloped that we worry it would take them too long to get up to speed.", "Also, be sure to ruthlessly demonstrate a positive attitude. That means that even when things get tough, and you think you couldn\u2019t be performing any worse, or you think the interview questions are totally unfair, stay positive! As an interviewer, I\u2019m not just looking for the right answer. I\u2019m looking for someone who is professional, collaborative, and quite frankly, nice. Who would you want to hire to join your team: Bravestone or Van Pelt??", "I hope that this article was helpful in boosting you to the NEXT LEVEL in your SQL interview prep.
