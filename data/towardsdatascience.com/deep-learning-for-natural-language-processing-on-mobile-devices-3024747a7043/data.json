The releases of TensorFlow.js for React Native [4] and TensorFlow Lite [5] allow us to train new machine learning and deep learning models and/or use pre-trained models for prediction and other machine learning purposes directly on cross-platform mobile devices.", "Recently I published two articles [6][7] to demonstrate how to use Expo [3], React [1], and React Native [2] to develop multi-page mobile applications that leverage TensorFlow.js for React Native [4] and pre-trained convolutional neural network models MobileNet and COCO-SSD for image classification and objects detection on mobile devices respectively.", "As described in [6][7], React [1] is a popular JavaScript framework for building Web user interfaces, while Reactive Native inherits and extends the component framework (e.g., component, props, state, JSX, etc.) of React to support the development of native Android and iOS applications using pre-built native components such as View, Text, TouchableOpacity, etc.", "The native code in mobile platform specific languages (e.g., Object-C, Swift, Java, etc.) is typically developed using Xcode or Android Studio. To simplify mobile app development, Expo [3] provides us with a framework and platform built around React Native and mobile native platforms that allow us to develop, build, and deploy mobile applications on iOS, Android, and web apps using JavaScript/TypeScript. Thus any text editor tool can be used for coding.", "In this article, similarly to [6][7], I develop a multi-page mobile application to demonstrate how to use TensorFlow.js [5] and a pre-trained deep natural language processing model MobileBERT [8][9][10] for reading comprehension on mobile devices.", "Similarly to [6][7], this mobile application is developed on Mac as follows:", "It is assumed that the latest node.js has been installed on your local computer/laptop such as Mac.", "In order to use Expo CLI to generate a new project template automatically, first, the Expo CLI needs to be installed:", "Then a new Expo project template can be generated as follows:", "The project name is qna (i.e., question and answer) in this article.", "As described in [6][7], I choose the tabs template of Expo managed workflow to automatically generate several example screens and navigation tabs. The TensorFlow logo image file tfjs.jpg is used in this project and it needs to be stored in the generated ./asserts/images directory.", "The following libraries need to be installed for developing the reading comprehension mobile app:", "In addition, the react-native-fs (a native filesystem access for react-native) is required by @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native/dist/bundle_resource_io.js:", "The expo-camera (a React component that renders a preview for the device\u2019s either front or back camera) is needed as well since it is used in @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native/dist/camera/camera_stream.js.", "As described before, first I used Expo CLI to generate example screens and navigation tabs automatically. Then I modified the generated screens and added a new Qna (question and answer) screen for reading comprehension. The following are the resulting screens:", "There are three corresponding tabs at the bottom of screen for navigation purpose.", "This article focuses on the Qna screen class (see [11] for source code) for natural language reading comprehension. The rest of this section discusses the implementation details.", "The lifecycle method componentDidMount() is used to initialize TensorFlow.js, and load the pre-trained MobileBERT [9][10] model after the user interface of the Qna screen is ready.", "Once the TensorFlow library and the MobileBERT model are ready, the mobile app user can type in a passage and a question related to the passage.", "For convenience, the passage and question in [10] are reused as default passage and question in this article for demonstration purpose.", "Once a passage and a question have been provided on mobile device, the user can click the \u201cFind Answer\u201d button to call the method findAnswers() for finding possible answers to the given question on the passage.", "In this method, the prepared MobileBERT model is called to take the provided passage and question as input and generate a list of possible answers to the question with their probabilities and locations (starting and ending indices of answers in the passage).", "Once the reading comprehension is done, the method renderAnswer() is called to display the answers on the screen of mobile device.", "The mobile application in this article consists of a react native application server and one or more mobile clients. A mobile client can be an iOS simulator, Android emulator, iOS devices (e.g., iPhone and iPad), Android devices, etc. I verified the mobile application server on Mac and mobile clients on both iPhone 6+ and iPad.", "As described in [6][7], the mobile app server needs to start before any mobile client can begin to run. The following commands can be used to compile and run the react native application server:", "If everything goes through smoothly, a Web interface as shown in Figure 1 should show up.", "Once the mobile app server is running, we can start mobile clients on mobile devices.", "Since I use Expo [3] for development in this article, the corresponding Expo client app is needed on mobile devices. The Expo client app for iOS mobile devices is available for free in Apple Store.", "Once the Expo client app has been installed on an iOS device, then we can use the camera on the mobile device to scan the bar code of the react native application server (see Figure 1) to use the Expo client app to run the mobile application.", "Figure 2 shows the introduction scree of the mobile application on iOS devices (iPhone and iPad).", "Figure 3 shows the screen of reading comprehension (passage, question, \u201cFind Answer\u201d button, and answers).", "The following are the output of the findAnswers() method call:", "Figure 4 shows the screen of references.", "Similarly to [6][7], in this article, I developed a multi-page mobile application for reading comprehension (question and answer) on mobile devices using Expo [3], React JSX, React Native [2], TensorFlow.js for React Native [4], and a pre-trained deep natural language processing model MobileBERT [9][10].", "I verified the mobile application server on Mac and the mobile application clients on iOS mobile devices (both iPhone and iPad).", "As demonstrated in [6][7] and this article, such mobile app can potentially be used as a template for the development of other machine learning and deep learning mobile apps.", "The mobile application project files for this article are available in Github [11].", "Your home for data science.
