To ponder what it feels like to be an animal.", "Our turtle ran away. Was he unhappy? Our parrot flew headfirst into a wall. Was she depressed? Our cat used to shit on my bed. Did she hate me? Our dog\u2019s balls were cut off. Was he mad? These are the kinds of things that kept me up at night throughout my childhood, for there were no answers.", "Nowadays, I have it easier. Instead of the unpredictable chunks of flesh shaped by evolution, I\u2019m surrounded with mechanical man-made creatures behaving in accordance with formal logic. Creatures whose every act of defiance can be traced back through computer code to its root cause and weeded out.", "My job as an engineer is precisely that \u2014 to put myself in the shoes of a six-wheeled autonomous delivery robot and tame it. These are the questions that keep me up at night in my adulthood, for I\u2019m perennially working on the answers:", "The eyes of a robot, like these of people, come in pairs. Two eyes make it easy to gauge the distance to the objects in the world, to see things in three dimensions.", "As the light bounces off of objects and enters our eye \u2014 or camera, in the case of the robot \u2014 an image is created on our retina. Since our eyes are in different positions on our head, the images they capture are slightly different as well. If we overlaid them on top of each other, we\u2019d see that the positions of the corresponding objects on the images wouldn\u2019t exactly match. Everything would be horizontally shifted, appearing a little bit more to the left on the right image, and vice versa.", "The twist: the more an object shifts from one image to the other, the closer it is to us. The less it shifts, the farther it is. It\u2019s an astonishing mathematical fact. To understand how many meters an object is away from us in the real world, we merely have to measure the millimeters it has moved between the images.", "The problem: matching the objects. To calculate how much an object has shifted between the two images, we must first identify it on both of them. Humans are exceptionally good at this, we do it subconsciously. Robots are exceptionally bad at this \u2014 thank God, for it keeps me employed.", "The robot is a pedestrian \u2014 it drives on sidewalks. And like pedestrians, it\u2019s pestered by road crossings. Its idyllic, carefree stroll is promptly replaced by terror, for there is now a stream of vicious two-ton savages it has to maneuver through. Hurry, and you might be flattened in cold blood. Stall, and you might be dismantled for serving cold food.", "An enormous task requires enormous intelligence. The robot\u2019s brain-for-vehicles is a deep stack of layers, each a sheet of millions of artificial neurons. The different layers are akin to specialized workers at a conveyor belt, with succeeding layers building on top of the results of the preceding.", "An image \u2014 a soup of raw, indiscernible pixels for the robot \u2014 comes in from the camera. The bottommost layer recognizes groups of pixels that represent edges. The next sheet of neurons recognizes shapes \u2014 circles, rectangles, and triangles \u2014 built up from the edges. The third layer puts together these geometric shapes to discerns entire objects: wheels, doors, windows, and license plates. The topmost layer assembles the various car parts to recognize complete vehicles.", "It\u2019s this single-purpose brain, devoted solely to preventing the robot from becoming a roadkill, that allows for safe road crossings. Compare that to animals, who dedicate only a tiny fraction of their mental capacity to recognizing cars. That\u2019s why it\u2019s squirrels you see dead all over the place, not robots.", "The only thing worse than a late delivery is a lost delivery. To avoid such a host of misery, robots have taken a page from the playbook of London\u2019s cab drivers.", "To get their license, the budding cabbies need to ace the world\u2019s hardest geography test \u2014 a demanding test of the tens of thousands of streets, landmarks, and tourist destinations of London. In preparation for the exam, the candidates drive through the city hundreds of times, for nearly half a decade, trying to etch the tangled arteries of London into their brain.", "Robots, likewise, need to practice. Before they\u2019re given free rein of the city, they\u2019re driven through it manually, accompanied by a human overseer. But unlike the black cabbie hopefuls, robots need hand-holding only once.", "If computers are good at anything, it\u2019s memorization. During their singular mapping run, the robot takes pictures, many times a second, along the entire route. Next, it extracts relevant objects \u2014 items as granular as the individual wooden boards of a park bench or bricks of a chimney \u2014 from the images. Finally, time-intensive algorithms figure out the real-world coordinates of all these objects, which are then stored in an enormous data center that makes up the robot\u2019s immensely detailed memory.", "Afterward, whenever a now-autonomous robot is uncertain of its location, it searches this database for the closest match to its current surroundings. Like the London cab drivers, their artificial counterparts map the local scene \u2014 how the objects they see relate to each other \u2014 with the global knowledge stored in their memory \u2014 how these objects relate to the city at large. Robots just build this understanding in days, not years.", "Soon enough, you\u2019ll see one of these delivery robots toiling away in your own neighborhood. Usually, you\u2019ll see them at their best, efficient and effective.", "Occasionally, you\u2019ll also see them at their worst. Perhaps confused on a sidewalk. Or petrified to cross a car road. Forgive them their clumsiness. As Theodore Roosevelt put it: \u201cThe only man who never makes a mistake is the man who never does anything.\u201d Robots do a lot. They deliver.", "Your home for data science.
