It has also created new opportunities for crime, new methods of committing them and a larger pool of potential victims. One such crime is cyber abuse, an umbrella term used for stalking and harassment committed with the use of technology.", "While some researchers argue that cyber abuse is simply an extension of old traditional forms of interpersonal violence (e.g. stalking and harassment), it is clear that technology affects the way the crime is perpetrated, experienced and, subsequently, can be prevented.", "Research in mechanisms of stalking and harassment is quite extensive with a number of criminological theories used to explain its causes. However, the causal mechanism of new technological forms of abuse is not yet fully understood. It is also unclear whether the traditional theories that were developed with \u201cterrestrial\u201d forms of crime in mind are useful in explaining these new forms of crime.", "In this paper, we focus on lifestyles-routine activities theory, which explains why some people are more likely to experience crime than others (Cohen et al., 1981). From this perspective, crime is seen as a product of motivated offenders converging in time and in space with suitable targets in the absence of capable guardians (Cohen and Felson, 1979).", "The theory argues that our lifestyles and routine activities are important predictors of the risk of criminal victimisation as they determine the likelihood of coming into contact with offenders. Those who engage in lifestyles and routine activities that are more likely to result in contact with potential offenders are more likely to become victims.", "According to this theory, the risk of criminal victimisation is encapsulated and can be accessed by measuring the level of individual\u2019s a) exposure to risk, b) proximity to potential offenders, c) target attractiveness (in a form of economic or symbolic value and being perceived as vulnerable), and, finally, presence or absence of potential guardians in the individual\u2019s immediate environment (e.g. passive bystanders or active interveners).", "Our objective in this paper is to examine the nature of the relationship between the risky lifestyles and routine activities and cyber abuse victimisation.", "Aiming to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of cyber abuse victimisation, we surveyed adult members of Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk using an online survey (N = 1, 463) and then analysed the data using logistic regression with Bayesian variable selection using stochastic search algorithm implemented in AutoStat\u00ae.", "To estimate the effect of the type of activities on the likelihood of becoming a victim of cyber abuse, we measured the level of our respondents\u2019 involvement in potentially risky routine daily online activities as well as the strength of their interpersonal relationships with various groups of social contacts (e.g. family, friends, online gaming contacts, etc.). Here, we measured activities that have been shown in previous research to affect one\u2019s exposure to risk, proximity to offenders, target attractiveness and absence or presence of capable guardianship and therefore to be associated with increased risk of personal victimisation Vakhitova et al. (2019).", "Table 1 presents summary statistics for our sample analysed here.", "Summary statistics presented in Table 1 appear to suggest some difference in the level of involvement in risky activities between our two sub-groups of interest\u2013victims and non-victims. To help visualise this trend, we compared victims and non-victims in terms of their online lifestyles and routine activities using the box plot and density plots. Figure 1 presents a density and box plots for the relationship between volunteering online (for example, as an online forum moderator) and experiencing cyber abuse victimisation. The figures suggest that victims (orange distribution) tend to volunteer online much more often compared with non-victims (blue distribution). In fact, only a few non-victims reported being actively involved in volunteering online.", "However, this trend is not uniform and, for example, the comparison of earning online income between victims and non-victims suggests that both victims and non-victims are similarly likely to earn income online, suggesting that earning income online may not be an important predictor of cyber abuse victimisation (see Figure 2).", "To generate distribution plots in AutoStat\u00ae, select the tab Visualisation, select the type of plot you wish to generate and move the variables you wish to plot into the appropriate boxes (move your categorical variable into the Sub-groups box and your continuous variable into the Values box) (see Figure 3).", "As shown earlier, summary statistics and visualisations of bi-variate relationships suggest that victims are more likely to engage in risky online activities and, at the same time, less likely to actively socialise with most kinds of interpersonal relationships (with the exception of relationships with ex-romantic partners and online gaming connections).", "To estimate the combined effect of lifestyles and routine activities-related variables and the socio-demographic controls we will now model cyber abuse victimisation using logistic regression with Bayesian variable selection implemented in AutoStat\u00ae.", "In deciding on the modelling approach, we took into consideration the exploratory nature of the study; the explicit lack of theoretical guidance on selection of variables to be included in our models; and the benefits of statistical methods of variable selection in the context of social science research identified in previous research (Vakhitova and Alston-Knox, 2018; Vakhitova et al., 2019). Employing Bayesian variable selection when modelling processes in the absence of clear theoretical guidance on model specification allows not only accounting for parameter uncertainty, but also for model uncertainty, as well as addressing the issue of over-fitting.", "We have used AutoStat\u00ae for this analysis because it provides a simple, user-friendly interface and a straightforward way of conducting a similar analysis. There are also a number of statistical packages for performing Bayesian variable selection in the R programming environment, for example, Raftery (1995) and Raftery et al. (2016) or Clyde et al. (2016). While each of these algorithms is slightly different, the intent of them is unified and the inferences from the model are similarly interpreted.", "In this analysis, a stochastic search algorithm is used to determine the most probable models in terms of their explanatory power. AutoStat\u00ae allows estimating the most probable models using a number of different priors. In this study, we employed G-prior spike-slab to enable the variable selection.", "As a schematic diagram of the G-prior spike slab shows, the prior takes two states (see Figure 4). During MCMC iterations where the coefficient is included in the model (as indicated by the stochastic search algorithm), the prior used in this posterior sample draw will be a G-prior, indicated as the \u201cslab\u201d. Similarly, for iterations when the stochastic search does not include a coefficient, the prior used in the posterior draw is a point mass at zero (0), indicated by the \u201cspike\u201d, resulting in a posterior draw of the coefficient that is exactly zero (0):", "The g-prior (slab) for our \u03b2 parameters is given by:", "As g increases, the prior becomes more concentrated around zero (0) and takes on a more active role in the posterior distribution specification. In this example, we set g to be equal to the sample size (the default value in AutoStat\u00ae).", "For more information about the stochastic search algorithm for variable selection, and this specification of the g-prior, please see Marin and Robert (2014).", "The following is a how-to guide for using AutoStat\u00ae\u2019s Model Builder feature to perform a Bayesian variable selection analysis using stochastic search algorithm.", "To conduct logistic regression with Bayesian variable selection in AutoStat\u00ae, select the tab Model Builder. Select the dataset you are analysing and move it to Training Data box. Then select your dependent variable and move it to Forecast Variable(s) box and then move your predictors Explanatory Variable(s) box. Please note, if you have any missing values, you will be given a choice of removing them from the analysis.", "The next step is to specify your modelling parameters in Parameter(s) Settings part of the screen. You can specify the prior, g (in our case, equal to sample size after all missing data is removed), random seed, number of iterations and burnin (see Figure 5).", "After the parameters are specified, click Analyse button and watch the magic of stochastic search happen in front of your eyes (Figure 6)!", "As part of Bayesian variable selection analysis, AutoStat\u00ae generates a number of different outputs, including a summary of five top best explanatory models together with probabilities of inclusion for all coefficients of interest (Figure 7), a summary of means, standard deviations and HPD intervals for all coefficients of interest (Figure 8), a detailed variable importance graph (Figure 9) and a number of diagnostic plots (see, for example, Figures 10 and 11).", "Table 2 summarises the results of our analyses. It shows that the best model using our data (Model 1) with a posterior probability of 0.23 per cent includes ten predictors. The next best model (Model 2) has a posterior probability of 0.21 per cent with nine predictors. Please note that the posterior probability of the model does not tell us about the predictive capability of the model. Instead, it gives us a number relative to all the other possible models. Hence, In the case of our specific example study, having many potential regressors means a large number of potential explanatory models, which in turn means small relative posterior probabilities of models.", "Most variables included in the best model (Model 1) are also included in all five top best models with inclusion probabilities of over 50 per cent. The two exceptions are socialising with ex-romantic partners, included in 4 out of 5 best models, and socialising with sports contacts, included in 3 out of 5 best models with the inclusion probability or around 40 per cent.", "Table 2 suggests that using our data and controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyles and routine activities appear to be useful predictors of cyber abuse victimisation, with some being more useful than others. The best explanatory model (Model 1) suggests that the most important factors accounting for the risk of cyber abuse victimisation include risk factors in the form of engagement in volunteering online and socialising with ex-romantic partners and protective factors in the form of presence/absence of someone who could actively intervene in an incident of cyber abuse, earning income online, and socialising with family, spouses and sporting/social contacts.", "Using the information in Table 2 we estimate that those with intervening guardians in their lives are only 17 per cent likely to experience victimisation compared with 83 per cent for those who do not have intervening guardians in their immediate environment; socialising with family, spouses and sporting/social committee contacts also appear to be associated with the reduced likelihood of experiencing cyber abuse (27 per cent, 41 per cent and 44 per cent respectively).", "However, engaging in online gaming, volunteering online and socialising with ex-romantic partners is associated with increased risk of cyber abuse victimisation (61 per cent, 66 per cent and 65 per cent respectively). The finding that earning income online appears to protect individuals from cyber abuse (probability of experiencing cyber abuse of only 38 per cent) is puzzling. It appears those who earn income online behave in a way that is different from those who use the Internet for entertainment and communication purposes only that protects them from victimisation.", "Notably, out of social-demographic characteristics, only age is a useful predictor of victimisation (younger people are more likely to experience victimisation), while race, employment and gender are not.", "Our findings suggest that lifestyles and routine activities of victims could provide a useful insight into the mechanisms of cyber abuse victimisation. Having said that, some lifestyles and routine activities appear to have more influence than others. For example, we found that such activities as volunteering online, earning online income, and socialising ex-romantic partners and sporting/social contacts increase the risk of cyber abuse victimisation while having someone in one\u2019s immediate environment who could actively intervene in an incident of cyber abuse and socialising with family and sporting/social contacts actually decreases one\u2019s risk of becoming a victim of cyber abuse.", "Our best models included at least one variable encapsulating the risk from all four aspects of risk according to lifestyles-routine activity theory: exposure to risk, proximity to offenders, target attractiveness and particularly capable guardianship.", "The evidence supporting guardianship as a protective factor is particularly intriguing. Our best model includes four variables measuring guardianship\u2013one measuring online guardianship (having someone to intervene) and three measuring offline guardianship (actively socialising with family, spouses and sporting/social committees contacts). It appears that guardianship like cyberspace itself has no borders; its effect traverses from terrestrial world to cyberspace and back.", "It also appears that having an active social network consisting of mainly primary contacts (e.g. family, spouses, etc). can serve as a protective factor against criminal victimisation. Further research is needed to better understand this protective mechanism.", "Another interesting finding from this study is that having someone who could actively intervene on your behalf in an incident of cyber abuse is the best possible explanation of cyber abuse victimisation (with the inclusion probability of 100 per cent), however, having someone to witness (passively) you being cyber abused is not a good predictor of abuse with the inclusion probability of less than 40 per cent. This finding highlights the value of guardianship in action in preventing crime (Reynald, 2010).", "Dr Zarina Vakhitova is a Monash University (Melbourne, Australia) Lecturer with the School of Social Sciences specialising in criminology and criminal justice.
