This doesn\u2019t mean you should avoid learning them \u2014 as you encounter them in production code sooner or later. This article will help you master the concept in no-time.", "This article shouldn\u2019t take you more than 5 minutes to read, maybe 10 if you\u2019re following along with the code. In that time, you\u2019ll get introduced to the concept of decorators starting from the basics \u2014 regular Python functions.", "Further, the article aims to take your understanding level up step by step, so you don\u2019t get confused in the process. Before jumping into code, we\u2019ll quickly cover what decorators are. Later, towards the end of the article, we\u2019ll cover some benefits and use-cases of decorators, so don\u2019t miss that.", "The middle part is reserved for the concept itself. Let\u2019s start!", "A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. A Python decorator can make code shorter and more pythonic. It is an advanced topic and can make coding easier once you grasp the concept.", "Before we dive deeper, let\u2019s make a quick recap of the basics.", "Functions are a way of writing a particular code that can be used repeatedly. They exist in almost every programming language and are a huge part of every program.", "Now that we know what a function is, the next topic to understand are functions within functions:", "Similar to this, we can also return a function from within another function:", "In the above code, we can easily see that with the help of if/else clause we can return function within functions. The last part you need to understand is that a decorator is giving a function as an argument to another function:", "That\u2019s pretty much all you should know before we dive into decorators. Now the fun part begins.", "Now we have the required knowledge to understand decorators. Let\u2019s quickly create one:", "After reading the above example you can hopefully understand decorators better, as we just applied all the basic knowledge of functions covered previously.", "Python allows us to use decorators more easily with the @ symbol \u2014 sometimes referred to as the pie syntax.", "Let\u2019s see how we can apply it to the above example:", "So, @my_decorator is just an easier way of saying say_where = my_decorator(say_where). It\u2019s how you apply a decorator to a function.", "Now we have a clear idea of a python decorator but why do we need them in the first place? Let\u2019s go over some benefits in the next section.", "We\u2019ve covered the how part of decorators, but the why part may still be a bit unclear to you. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve prepared a couple of real-world decorator use cases.", "We often need to specifically measure what\u2019s going on, and record metrics that quantify different activities. By summing up such noteworthy events in their closed function or method, a decorator can handle this very specific requirement easily.", "For all the pro\u2019s Python type system has, there\u2019s a con. This means some bugs can try to creep in, which more statically typed languages (like Java) would catch at compile time. Looking beyond that, you may want to enforce more sophisticated, custom checks on data going in or out. Decorators can let you easily handle all of this, and apply it to many functions at once.", "When you ace composing decorators, you\u2019ll have the option to profit by the straightforward syntax of utilizing them, which lets you add semantics to the language that is anything but difficult to utilize. It\u2019s the best thing to have the option to expand the language structure. Numerous well known open source systems utilize this. The web framework Flask utilizes it to course URLs to capacities that handle the HTTP demand.", "I hope these 3 use-cases have convinced you just how important decorators are in real-world tasks. With this, we\u2019ve come to the end of this article. Let\u2019s wrap things up in the next section.", "Decorators aren\u2019t such a straightforward concept to understand at first. For me, this concept required multiple readings (and hands-on tasks) to feel confident enough, but it\u2019s all worth it once you get there.", "So yeah, take your time and don\u2019t rush things. Make sure to understand the functions first, and all the things we\u2019ve covered today. It\u2019s easy to expand from there.", "I also want to mention that this was first in a more advanced Python concept series, and topics like generators and parallelism will be covered next. They are also essential for a scalable and clean programming environment, so make sure to stay tuned.", "Loved the article? Become a Medium member to continue learning without limits.
