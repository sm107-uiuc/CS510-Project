It is a question portending an existential crisis for human know-how and actions, as it is being asked often.", "For example, a recent report in The Verge was titled: \u201cWhy Cancer-Spotting AI Needs To Be Handled With Care\u201d (by James Vincent, January 27, 2020). From the report: \u201cBut for many in health care, what studies like these demonstrate is not just the promise of AI, but also its potential threat. They say that for all of the obvious abilities of algorithms to crunch data, the subtle, judgment-based skills of nurses and doctors are not so easily digitized.\u201d", "But such views ignore evidence that suggests otherwise. There are two key factors\u2015(1) cognitive bias and (2) cognitive overload\u2015that play a role.", "To answer this question (experts vs. algorithms), let us first look at the role played by cognitive bias.", "Daniel Kahneman, the psychologist and behavior economics pioneer, won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2002 \u201cfor having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty.\u201d His collaboration with economist Amos Tversky is well known\u2015a partnership that resulted in a number of foundational results in behavioral economics, particularly the development of \u201cProspect Theory\u201d in the 1970s.", "Prospect Theory was an important update\u2015a behavioral framing of the loss and gain asymmetry in human estimates\u2015to classical utility theory, the foundation of modern economic theories, first offered by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738 as the famous resolution of the \u201cSt. Petersburg Paradox\u201d and woven into its modern form\u2015expected utility theory\u2015by John Von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in the 1940s using the axioms of rational choice. (While Von Neumann and Morgenstern framed modern utility theory using the axioms of rational choice, Bernoulli in 1738 set up the utility construct as \u201cmoral expectation\u201d as opposed to mathematical expectation, highlighting his view of utility as a subjective construct rather than a mathematical one. This was the key point of his argument: that a pauper\u2019s moral expectation is different from that of a rich person\u2019s\u2015making Daniel Bernoulli the true behavioral economics pioneer.)", "Tversky would almost certainly have shared the Nobel Prize with Kahneman but for his untimely death in 1996 (Kahneman shared the Nobel award with economist Vernon Smith, known for his pioneering role in Experimental Economics).", "It was in graduate school that I first encountered their classic paper \u201cJudgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases\u201d (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) and was immediately drawn into the fascinating world of judgment under uncertainty, the role of heuristics in decision making and the systematic biases the occur as a result. In this classic paper, Tversky and Kahneman cluster these biases that arise into three key heuristics: representativeness (the probable degree to which an object represents a particular type); availability (the subjective assessment of the probability of an event based on instances or occurrences that come to one\u2019s mind); and adjustment from an anchor (the subjective estimates made starting from an initial value and adjusted to yield the final answer, with these adjustments typically proving insufficient).", "In his wonderful book \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow\u201d (2011), Daniel Kahneman explains the notions taking root in psychology that human thinking is a mix of two mental systems: a fast, intuitive, automatic, almost involuntary process (System 1) coupled with a slow, deliberative, conscious one that requires concentration and effort (System 2). The interaction of these two systems enables our thoughts and actions. (Note the comma after Thinking in the book title highlighting Fast and Slow.)", "Kahneman looks into the question of experts vs. algorithms in the section \u201cIntuition vs. Formulas.\u201d He highlights the interesting findings of clinical psychologist Paul Meehl regarding expert intuition and the use of formulas for guidance. Meehl\u2019s findings revealed that simple algorithms (statistical predictions) outperformed or tied experts (clinical judgment) in almost all the domains tested. As Kahneman notes, the ease of implementation makes even a tie a win for algorithms. These results (\u201cthe Meehl patterns\u201d) understandably shocked the clinical establishment then as the advances of AI continue to do so now.", "It is the famous Apgar Score highlighted by Kahneman that makes the point clearly. \u201cIn 1953, Virginia Apgar, M.D. published her proposal for a new method of evaluation of the newborn infant. The avowed purpose of this paper was to establish a simple and clear classification of newborn infants which can be used to compare the results of obstetric practices, types of maternal pain relief and the results of resuscitation. Having considered several objective signs pertaining to the condition of the infant at birth she selected five that could be evaluated and taught to the delivery room personnel without difficulty. These signs were heart rate, respiratory effort, reflex irritability, muscle tone and color. Sixty seconds after the complete birth of the baby a rating of zero, one or two was given to each sign, depending on whether it was absent or present.\u201d (Source: \u201cThe Apgar Score Has Survived The Test of Time,\u201d Dr. Finster & Dr. Wood, 2005)", "In short, this simple score (0\u201310) obtained 1 min after birth by the delivery room personnel provided (and still continues to provide) the prognosis for the newborn (excellent if 8\u201310, fair if 3\u20137, poor if 0\u20132). Importantly, Dr. Apgar selected five objective signs \u201cthat could be evaluated and taught to the delivery room personnel without difficulty\u201d\u2015that is, it could be easily understood by non-experts. The Apgar scoring had a tremendous impact in reducing infant mortality. According to Dr. Richard Smiley of the New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center: \u201cThe score gave physicians and nurses a requirement to look at the newborn in an organized method and it\u2019s helped prevent the death of countless babies. Once physicians and nurses had to assign a score, it created an imperative to act to improve the score. It was essentially the birth of clinical neonatology.\u201d (Source: New York-Presbyterian Health Matters: \u201cIt Happened Here: The Apgar Score\u201d)", "The pioneering Dr. Virginia Apgar was the first female physician to hold a full professorship at Columbia\u2019s College of Physicians and Surgeons.", "Kahneman\u2019s research into this question of Intuition vs. Formulas suggests that \u201cwhenever we can replace human judgement by a formula, we should at least consider it.\u201d Biases (hubris, overconfidence, etc) get in the way of objectivity. Irrelevant context or the saliency bias affects consistency. Algorithms have the potential to offer objective and consistent judgments in situations with poor predictability. Using the frame provided by Kahneman, it is easy to see that employing System 1 thinking (fast intuition) in areas where System 2 thinking (slow deliberation) is called for can produce these situations. Recognizing these patterns can help planners in different domains put together strategies (like Dr. Apgar did) to keep the assessments objective and consistent where the situation (such as speedily assessing the newborn a min after birth) seems to demand intuition.", "Let us now look at the question of experts vs. algorithms by examining the role played by cognitive overload. Cognitive overload is a consequence of the growth of complexity and the reality of human limits.", "Dr. Atul Gawande rose to prominence with his essays on healthcare in The New Yorker magazine. His first book \u201cComplications: A Surgeon\u2019s Notes on an Imperfect Science\u201d (2002), a collection of essays written during his residency at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital won him a National Book Award. \u201cThe essays that comprise Complications (many of which originally appeared as articles in The New Yorker) are divided into three sections\u2015\u2019Fallibility,\u2019 \u2018Mystery,\u2019 and \u2018Uncertainty\u2019\u2015each dealing with a different sort of imperfection or difficulty in medical practice. Gawande thus explores the many ways that medicine can fall short of expectations. Humans err, despite their best efforts. Scientific knowledge remains incomplete, leaving many questions unanswered and unanswerable. And some situations are simply ambiguous, calling for the exercise of judgment in the face of maddeningly incomplete information, often with no good solution available.\u201d (Source: \u201cLike a Surgeon,\u201d Steven Lubet, May 2003, Cornell Law Review)", "Human fallibility, what we do not know and making judgments with incomplete information are part of any situation. When these come together in a situation where timing matters (e.g. the 1 min after birth for newborns or the 90 min after arrival for cardiac attacks) and complexity is ever present, the recourse to algorithms (and formulas) may be necessary.", "In 2009, Gawande came out with \u201cThe Checklist Manifesto: How To Get Things Right,\u201dwhere he looks at how to take the hard won but unmanageable know-how accumulated by \u201chighly trained, highly skilled and hardworking people\u201d and eliminate common and persistent failures that are avoidable by prescribing a strategy for \u201covercoming failure, one that builds on experience and takes advantage of the knowledge people have but somehow also makes up for our inevitable human inadequacies\u201d\u2015a checklist!", "Echoing the insights of Apgar, Gawande suggests that: \u201cChecklists seem to provide protection against such failures. They remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit. They not only offer the possibility of verification but also instill a kind of discipline of higher performance.\u201d As an example, Gawande discusses how the checklist devised by critical care specialist Peter Provonost at Johns Hopkins Hospital to tackle the problem of central line infections in the ICU showed a dramatic drop in such infections (driving it down to almost zero) over a two year period. The other example of an Austrian child\u2019s miraculous recovery after sliding into an icy pond shows how the rapid and coordinated sophistication of modern medicine can pull off such miracles. The Checklist Manifesto has a lot of such examples and is a fascinating read.", "Checklists or formulas or algorithms can provide an objective and consistent path to eliminate avoidable failures by focusing on the minimum necessary in a time-sensitive situation where the ever-growing complexity and human fallibility (and human limits) can combine adversely. There are potentially areas where this algorithmic approach may not work that well (at least currently) but it is important to acknowledge all the areas where this will work well.", "This view of algorithms goes against the current wisdom of experts and pundits. But theory and experience provide ample support for this view, showing why it is important to at least consider the role of algorithms in planning complex operations and pooling of expertise for complex projects.", "Why do simple algorithms do the trick so well in such situations? By distilling the signal from the noise that surrounds it.", "Treating cognitive bias as experts filtering information inefficiently or adversely and cognitive overload as human incapacity or limits when faced with a barrage of information, algorithms can overcome such barriers for decisions to be objective and consistent.", "This essay examines only the relative merits of experts vs. algorithms under typical conditions of uncertainty and complexity, eschewing the larger question of the ethical, societal and economic impact of introducing algorithms. The lessons of the Industrial Revolution and the insights of Karl Marx about the trajectory of automation expounded in his famous work Capital (Das Kapital) are relevant for that discussion. But I will save that for another day.", "\u201cThe instrument of labour, when it takes the form of a machine, immediately becomes a competitor of the workman himself.\u201d\u2015Karl Marx, Capital
