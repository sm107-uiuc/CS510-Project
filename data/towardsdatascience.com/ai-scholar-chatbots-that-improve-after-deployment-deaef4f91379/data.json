In 2016, the chatbot market was worth approximately $700 million. Growing at a CAGR of over 24%, the Global Chatbot Market is now expected to reach $ 1.25 billion by 2025 according to a recent report.", "Innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are increasingly enhancing chatbots features and thus driving the market demand. Unlike human assistants, chatbots provide instant responses, process complex questions, enhance analytics, boost customer engagement and are less costly. Artificial Intelligence, NLP and Machine learning advancements keep expanding, and modern chatbots are becoming more and more intelligent. As such, chatbots future is bright and shining.", "One of the recent chatbot developments is the ability of chatbots to train themselves through by self-feeding \u2014 the ability to extract new training data from the conversations they take part.", "Previously, most of the conversations or dialogues that a chatbot agent will ever engage in are those it has already been trained on and requires extensive supervision.", "However, new research work now presents a methodology that provides chatbots with limitless capabilities where they can engage in dialogues and learn to automatically estimate user satisfaction in the responses to be able to improve themselves. Chatbots are trained with any available supervised data and let loose in production. If a conversation goes well (above a set satisfaction score), the bot continues with the conversation on its own. Conversely, when the conversation appears not to go well, the bot will realize it has made a mistake and request for user feedback which it will predict and imitate. The chatbot is occasionally retrained with the available responses without any more new supervised learning thereby improving its conversational performance.", "This approach resembles human\u2019s conversational skills where it is not merely observing others engage in good conversations, but actively fine-tuning and adjusting our speech based on feedback from our conversations.", "This new approach combines a few ideas and creates a system which is robust and capable of improving over time. While this paper outlines how it can be used in chatbots similar methodology can be used in many different products. I look forward to the day when I launch a product and it continues to get better and updated based on how users interact and engage with the product. The \u201cFor You\u201d revolution is coming.
