If you haven\u2019t heard it yet, you should stop and think before you code, and the same concept applies to data cleaning. It has been valuable to step back from the initial work and begin to think about the problem at hand and the data you will be cleaning. It is also a great idea to consider the end-use case for the data. Do you need it in a report or dashboard? Will the data be used by many or by one? How often will you need to clean this data? With that, I would like to introduce to you 25 common questions I consider before tackling data cleaning.", "When I start a project, the first consideration I have to make is how I will ingest the data for this project before I start cleaning it. Depending on where I am getting the data from, I may need to perform different data cleaning steps. Suppose the data had already come from another team. In that case, there is a possibility the data is clean before I ingest it, making it easier for me to preprocess the data before working with it.", "After I have received the data, the next step is to understand how to handle empty or NULL values. It is rarely that easy to have empty or NULL appear in your dataset. Instead, users will add obscure large values like -9999 or 9999, other characters, or words. It is good to take a step back and understand how users add empty values into the dataset and take action to look at how you will clean out these values. Once you know how these values are represented in your dataset, you can begin cleaning them out or impute values where needed.", "The next thing I look for is text fields. When I use text fields, I either use them as categories, discussed next, or as plain text that will be displayed or used for additional information. But what happens if you are using your text fields for modeling? You may need to consider different types of cleaning or natural language processing techniques to work with your data, such as stemming, lemmatization, or removing filler words. I find it harder to work with text fields as there can be variations in the spelling, acronyms, mistypes information, and more.", "Categories and booleans are the most accessible two data types to deal with when cleaning data as they tend to have less variation in their columns. For categories, I tend to look at the unique categories listed for a given column to understand better what I am working with for different values. Then I can bring that information back to a subject matter expert (SME) as needed to get definitions for categories that may be unclear, such as numeric numbers or single letter values that map to a definition.", "Lastly, there are numeric fields. A common task I have done when looking over numeric fields is to understand the summary statistics and data distribution in these columns. This quick analysis helps understand how the data is structured and if any noticeable outliers could exist. After looking at this data, you may also need to consider any units associated with your numeric points. Did you assume the units of specific columns, but something seems wrong? Double-checking this can help before you move forward with your work.", "Data cleaning and preprocessing can take up much of the time during data science projects. As you ingest the data, consider how much work may have already been done to clean the data before receiving it and how much work you will need to do to clean it. As you look at your data, the first thing to consider is how you will handle null or empty data values. Can you clean them out, or will you need to impute a value in its place? Once you have made that determination, you can begin to look at the actual data points in each column and construct a plan to clean those columns as you see fit. Columns can include things like categories, booleans, numeric, and text fields. Each will require different considerations as you clean and preprocess the data before modeling.", "What types of questions do you ask as you clean data?", "If you would like to read more, check out some of my other articles below!", "Your home for data science.
