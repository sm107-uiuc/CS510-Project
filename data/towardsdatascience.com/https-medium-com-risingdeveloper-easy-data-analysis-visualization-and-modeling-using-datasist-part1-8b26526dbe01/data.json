You probably don\u2019t know what datasist is, so let\u2019s not get too excited yet.", "Well, in simple terms, datasist is a python library that makes data analysis, visualization, cleaning, preparation, and even modeling super easy. Because let\u2019s face it, I wouldn\u2019t want to do this every time\u2026(Please look at the code block below)", "\u2026 just because I want to drop columns with 80 percent missing values, when I can simply do this (Please look at the beauty below)", "I know right, it\u2019s lazy, but damn efficient.", "The goal of datasist is to abstract repetitive codes, functions and techniques we use often into simple functions that can be called in one line of code. Datasist was born out of sheer laziness, because let\u2019s face it unless you\u2019re a 10x data scientists, we all hate typing long and boring chunks of code to do the same thing over and over again.", "The design of datasist is currently centered around 5 modules:", "This is subject to change in future versions as we are currently working on support for many other areas of data science and machine learning.", "The aim of this post is to introduce you to some of the important features in each of these modules and how you can start using it in your projects. For this post to be short and concise, I decided to split it into two parts.", "Part 1 will cover the first three modules (structdata, feature engineering, timeseries) and part 2 will cover the last two modules (visualization and model).", "So without wasting more time, let\u2019s get to it.", "What you will learn in this part:", "To follow this article, you\u2019ll need to install the datasist library. You can do that using the python pip manager. Open a terminal or a Jupyter notebook and type,", "Remember to use the exclamation symbol ( ! ) before the command above if you\u2019re running it inside a Jupyter notebook.", "Next, you need to get a dataset to experiment with. While you can use any dataset, for consistency, it is advisable to download the dataset we used for this tutorial. You can find it here.", "Finally, open your Jupyter Notebook and import the following libraries and dataset as shown below:", "The structdata module contains numerous functions for working with structured data mostly in the Pandas DataFrame format. That is, you can use these functions to easily manipulate and analyze DataFrames. We highlight some of the functions below.", "From the result above, you can have a full description of your dataset at a go and also properly understand some of the features all in one line (amazing right!).", "2. check_train_test_set: This function is used to check the sampling strategy of two dataset. This is important because if two dataset are not from the same distribution, then feature extraction will be different because we can not apply calculations from the first dataset on the second.", "To use this, you pass in the two dataset (train_df and test_df ), a common index (customer_id) and finally any feature or column present in both dataset.", "3. display_missing: You can check for the missing values in your dataset and display the result in the well formatted DataFrame using this function.", "4. get_cat_feats and get_num_feats: Just like their names, you can retrieve categorical and numerical features respectively as a Python list.", "5. get_unique_counts: Ever wanted to check the number of unique classes in your categorical features before you decide what encoding scheme to use? well, you can use the get_unique_count function to easily do that.", "6. join_train_and_test: Most of the time when prototyping, you may want to concatenate both train and test set, and then apply some transformations to it. You can use the join_train_and_test function for that. It returns a concatenated dataset and the size of the train and test set for future splitting.", "Those are some of the popular functions in the structdata module of datasist, to see other functions and to learn more about the parameters you can change, check the API documentation here.", "Feature Engineering is the act of extracting important features from raw data and transforming them into formats that are suitable for machine learning models.", "Some of the functions available in the feature_engineering module of datasist are explained below.", "NOTE: Functions in the feature_engineering module always return a new and transformed DataFrame. This means, you should assign the result to a variable as nothing happens inplace.", "First let\u2019s see the percentage of missing values in the dataset", "Just for demonstration, we\u2019ll drop the column with 7.1 percent missing values (Date_of_Occupancy).", "Note: You should not drop a column/feature with so little missing values. The ideal thing to do is to fill it. We drop it here, just for demonstration purpose.", "2. drop_redundant: This function is used to remove features with low or no variance. That is, features that contain the same value all through. We show a simple example using an artificial dataset.", "First, let\u2019s create the data set\u2026", "Now looking at the dataset above, we see that column a is redundant, that is it has the same value all through. We can drop this column automatically by just passing in the dataset to the drop_redundant function.", "3. convert_dtypes: This function takes a DataFrame as argument and automatically type-cast the features to their correct data types.", "Let\u2019s see an example. First we create an artificial dataset below.", "Next, let\u2019s check the data types\u2026", "The features Age and Date of Birth are supposed to be integer and DateTime respectively, by passing this dataset to the convert_dtype function, this can be fixed automatically.", "4. fill_missing_cats: As the name implies, this function takes a DataFrame, and automatically detects categorical columns with missing values. It fills them using the mode. Let\u2019s see an example.", "From the dataset, we have two categorical features with missing values, these are Garden and Geo_Code.", "5. fill_missing_nums: This is similar to the fill_missing_cats, except it works on numerical features and you can specify a filling strategy (mean, mode or median).", "From the dataset, we have two numerical features with missing values, these are Building Dimension and Date_of_Occupancy.", "6. log_transform: This function can help you log transform a set of features. It also display the before and after plot with level of skewness to help you decide if log transforming feature is what you really want.", "The feature Building Dimension is a right skewed, and we can transform it.", "Note: Columns passed to the log_transform function should not contain missing values, else it will throw an error.", "To work with geo features like latitude and longitude, datasist has dedicated functions like bearing, manhattan_distance, get_location_center etc, also available in the feature_engineering module. To see these and other functions, you can check the API documentation here.", "Finally in this part, I\u2019ll talk about the timeseries module in datasist. The timeseries module contains functions for working with date time features. It can help you extract new features from Dates and also help you visualize them.", "The dataset contains lots of time features which we can analyse. More details about the task can be found on the competition page.", "Let\u2019s demonstrate how easy it is to extract information from Placement \u2014 Time, Arrival at Destination \u2014 Time features using the extract_dates function. We specify that we want to extract just day of the week (dow) and hour of the day (hr).", "We can see that datasist created new columns and appended the new features to the dataset.", "2. timeplot: The timeplot function can help you visualize a set features against a particular time feature. This can help you identify trends and patterns. To use this function, you can pass a set of numerical columns, and then specify the Date feature you want to plot against.", "And with that, we have come to the end of part 1. To learn more about datasist and other functions available, you can check the API documentation here.", "In part 2, we will cover the last two modules (visualization and model) and there you\u2019ll see how you can leverage the power of datasist to quickly create beautiful plots with just a single line of code.", "Datasist is and will continue to evolve as we add more features. If you would like to contribute to making it better, check our contribution guide here, if you would like to report a bug issue or have an idea for a new feature, visit our GitHub issues page here. And don\u2019t forget to leave us a star on GitHub if this project has been useful to you.", "Finally, if you have used datasist in your project, let us know so we can feature your work on our page.", "Find our list of contributors here.", "LINK to datasist repo on GitHub", "Your home for data science.
