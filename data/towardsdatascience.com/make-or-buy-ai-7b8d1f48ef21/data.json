The numerous processes that can be optimized with advancements in pattern recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing are set to fuel the next generation of business. For this reason, many organizations are clamoring to get their AI strategies together. While data scientists and software engineers often calculate the difficulty of the project by the tasks it requires; business leaders must weigh many personnel and financial trade-offs of their options. One commonly used process in finance and accounting is the Make or Buy Decision. This is the process of considering all present and future costs of developing anything in-house or outsourcing. This article will explain the considerations for both sides of these decisions as they pertain to AI and Data Science Efforts.", "Make or Buy Decision: A make-or-buy decision is an act of choosing between manufacturing a product in-house or purchasing it from an external supplier.[1]", "The definition of a make/buy decision is self-explanatory and in the specific use case of AI the options are as follows:", "Make: Implement machine learning models on personally collected data from scratch \u2014 this includes building neural net architectures, writing custom algorithms, leveraging other ML methods and building APIs to serve the results.", "Buy: Pay for use of existing APIs and write minimal code to preprocess and interact with existing service to achieve company objective \u2014 this includes, but is not limited to Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS AI services for CV, NLP and many other tasks.", "Many IT Leaders within big and small companies are often well versed in the current top-of-the line technologies. Their curiosity and involvement in the tech community is often what brought them to their position. For this reason, they very often look to pick up cutting-edge projects that are beyond the overall scope of their overall companies objectives. In these cases, they may push for AI efforts to involve highly complex projects which build AI technologies that may already exist, from scratch. While this is exciting for the team, the result is often less than perfect.", "An example I have seen of this is a small medical services business who wished to build their own transcription(voice-to-text) AI system from scratch to interact with a larger application. Any experienced data scientist would recognize the vast amount of data and time it would take to build an NLP system capable of working in complex medical operations which performed better than current speech to text systems. No matter how much they were suggested to try to utilize services like AWS Transcribe, the IT leaders continued to demand to build it in house. Breaking this down further, the final cost of development likely included a staff of 5+ with a monthly burn rate of $20,000+ on salaries before other costs were figured. The flip side shows that the existing transcription service could have been licensed for less than $1 per request!", "It is not difficult to see how this \u201cmake\u201d decision would have benefitted as a \u201cbuy\u201d decision. If instead the task had involved complex and unique data types the spend would have been much more justified. Likewise, if the business had wished to sell this transcription service as their core product, they would have also benefitted from building their own Intellectual property. I always bring these points up when advising businesses on their AI strategy. It is important to recognize the hours and personnel that businesses like Microsoft, Google, or Amazon have put into developing their service. It is unlikely that a business whose core concern is not technology is going to achieve the same results, let alone for a lower cost.", "As detailed above the buy decision can provide high quality AI services at a fraction of the cost and time that it would take to develop in house. This is a great option for businesses who wish to harness AI in their internal business processes. The fact of the matter is that most companies who wish to utilize AI are not technology companies at their core, so utilizing models developed by tech companies is more effective than building a highly skilled IT department at a moment\u2019s notice.", "There are drawbacks, however, of the buy decision. Data incompatibility and lack of data are both obstacles for many of these services. Data incompatibility refers to either complex data structures or complex expected outputs. Many of these services expect perfectly organized data to produce a generic output. The moment a task above the level of speech transcription or image classification is required they ofter are rendered useless. In these cases, the data scientist will need to do enough preprocessing work to justify the potential of building a custom model to accommodate the task. It is also important to consider the adaptability of the system across the lifecycle. If the program is expected to outgrow the capabilities(i.e. Edge/IoT requirements) it is important to consider building in-house to eliminate this dependency. Finally, data regulations can often get in the way of interacting with 3rd party APIs which may be another point to consider that causes the lean towards a \u201cmake\u201d decision.", "Over the past few years, I\u2019ve worked with numerous companies to implement and advise on AI systems through contract and freelance work. I always start with the question: \u201cDo you want to integrate an existing service or build one yourself?\u201d Let\u2019s take a look at the results.", "It is quite obvious that most are biased towards building a completely custom system. I won\u2019t go into each specific case, but many of these applications were simple CV and NLP tasks which would have been duplicative to build from scratch. Some might ask, But aren't they hiring you to build these types of applications?", "The answer is that they are hiring a data scientist to complete an objective, and part of my task is to advise the most product and cost effective route. No matter where the model comes from the knowledge and understanding to build the pipeline with any tool is what every business is looking for in the end.", "As we can see the final outcomes were much different from the initial ask. I was able to save some of these clients from the mistake later in the initial conversations, but others spent a lot of time and money trying to build models that would just be replaced by existing services or pre-trained models.", "Here is a quick list of some services available that can integrate wonderfully to fullfil many data science desires effectively.", "This list could take up an entire article to explain the opportunities and nuances that each provides.", "In conclusion, it can be said that implementing AI into any production system requires deep levels of expertise across a team of data scientists and machine learning engineers. Though it can be enticing to for IT departments to build their own AI systems, it is often more effective to consider what options already exist. This can help avoid numerous costs and headaches. On the flip side, if an organization has the time, resources, and personnel to experiment with a radically different system, this may have the benefit of creating the next big thing in this vertical. I\u2019m sure that 10 years from now there will be numerous case studies detailing what went right and wrong in these decisions. Old Industries, like automotive for example, may find that their efforts to build in house efforts at autonomy could have been expedited by working with more technology-oriented partners to fill these gaps. Taking the time to consider if your organization is best fit to make or buy your next AI application can be the most important decision of any business transformations in this generation.", "For more information on what i\u2019m up to head to MindBuilder AI", "Your home for data science.
