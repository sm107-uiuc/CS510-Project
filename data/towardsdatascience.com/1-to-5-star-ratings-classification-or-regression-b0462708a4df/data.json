This gives us a possibility to model the problem as a regression task.", "On the other hand, we could decide to ignore the ordering information and simply represent every value of the rating with a separate class. This would lead us to a classification task.", "In this article, I would like to make an experiment using both approaches, and compare their performance on 3 different real world datasets.", "For this experiment, I wanted to use at least 3 different datasets, in order to have a higher confidence in the final result. The datasets that have been chosen are Coursera\u2019s Course Review Dataset, Amazon Musical Instruments Reviews and Trip Advisor Hotel Reviews. These all have the target values ranging from 1 star (very negative) to 5 stars (very positive). Additionally, every dataset has a bit different distribution of ratings, although the ratings 4 and 5 are always most represented.", "The methods used for the experiment were very similar for every dataset. The dataset was always split into training and validation set in 90:10 ratio. The text of the reviews was not preprocessed in any way, and was represented using Glove: Global Vectors for Word Representation.", "For classification I used the following model, which consists of a non-trainable embedding layer on the input, a bidirectional LSTM layer, a dense layer with ReLU, and an output layer with the softmax function over 5 classes. As expected, the model was trained using the cross-entropy loss function.", "For regression I used exactly the same model, only changing its final layer to have a single output with linear activation function. The model was trained with the mean squared error loss function.", "Both models were always trained on the same data, with the same batch size, and for the same amount of epochs. In order to compare the scores, I needed to use the same metric for evaluating every model. This was done by simply rounding up the predictions from regression to the nearest possible rating value, and using accuracy. The results are the following:", "What we can see is that classification achieved better result than regression on all three datasets. The difference seems to be quite significant, reaching almost 6% on Amazon Musical Instruments Reviews dataset.", "The accuracies overall are not very high, which could possibly be caused by user bias, that is often present in ratings of the online review systems. Additionally, all the models used the same hyperparameters, which were not fine-tuned for every dataset. Still, the results of classification are not very far from the best solutions that are available for the given datasets.", "I must admit that I was expecting a different result, since the regression originally seemed to be a better choice when dealing with ordered labels. However, the same result was also found for example in this paper.", "I wonder how would the result change with increasing the number of possible rating values, and where would be the point when the classification can no longer keep up. This could be a topic of the next experiment in the future.", "All the code that I used is available in these kaggle notebooks:", "Your home for data science.
