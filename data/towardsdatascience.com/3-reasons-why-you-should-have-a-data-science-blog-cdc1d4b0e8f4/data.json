When you teach what you\u2019ve learned in the form of a blog you can see the gaps in your knowledge and fill them in\u201d \u2014 My Manager (2019)", "I first began blogging 8 months ago when I was tipped by my manager at work to do so as a means of cementing new things that I learned. He said \u201cWhen you teach what you\u2019ve learned in the form of a blog you can see the gaps in your knowledge and fill them in\u201d. Fast-forward 8 months and I now have top writer status in Medium\u2019s Artificial Intelligence category, whilst being amongst the top 5\u20138% of earners on the platform \u2014 It\u2019s fair to say that cementing my knowledge this way has had some really cool by-products which have also opened many doors to me.", "I am going to tell you as my manager told me\u2026", "Start a Blog to cement your knowledge. When you teach what you\u2019ve learned in the form of a blog you can see the gaps in your knowledge and fill them in!", "I believe I can end this post here, but in case you are still not convinced, I am going to give some reasons as to why I believe it\u2019s extremely important for you to start a Data Science blog even if you are an aspiring Data Scientist that started his/her first course yesterday.", "Note: This is just one aspect of the greatest Data Science project you\u2019ll carry out. View the link below for more on the most important Data Science project you\u2019ll ever have to do.", "I want you to press Ctrl + T on your keypad and type your name in on Google (or whatever your preferred search engine is). What comes up? Nothing? Ok, type in your favourite artist name. What comes up? Their background, their album, their tours and other channels to connect with them on, etc.", "If you want to be a rockstar Data Scientist, people should at least know where to find your work \u2014 Kurtis Pykes", "Yes, you may find it cringey to type your own name in on Google (or your preferred search engine) and I don\u2019t blame you, I do to. However, for most companies you apply for, it\u2019s likely that they will do exactly that. Alternatively, If you search your name and a load of Data Science articles occur, you\u2019ve basically handed them a second resume and they can make impressions of you based on your work. The employer has a chance to pick your brain before they ever sit down to speak to you about the job which can give you a strong competitive edge over other candidates.", "Furthermore, you can begin to establish yourself as an expert on the topic you write about and everything you put out can be considered to be intellectual property. Cool feat!", "Note: It\u2019s important to think carefully about the things you decide to put out because you will be associated with what you write about.", "Let\u2019s take 4 soft skills that are highly regarded as ones that boost career growth and tie them into how a Data Science blog helps \u2014 there are more than 4 soft skills but the point is to hone in on the fact that having a data science blog is something you should do.", "Emotional Intelligence is referred to as the ability to recognise the emotions of others and manage your own. Improving as a Data Science writer inherently constitutes learning the links between people\u2019s emotions and how they behave hence allowing you to put yourself in the shoes of your target audience, which gives you a platform to influence them towards a common goal. For instance, you may be able to put yourself in the shoes of a beginner learning a very difficult technical topic and be able to break it down in a very simple way for the target audience to understand.", "A growth mindset is the belief you have ultimate control of your ability, and can learn and improve. I think this one is self-explanatory. If you never want to run out of ideas on topics to write about, you will have to continually learn \u2014 it\u2019s as simple as that.", "Feedback is a major feat within the work environment. Being open and able to receive development feedback is critical to success at any job. Well, guess what? The minute you publish on your article to make your work public, you open yourself up to feedback. For example, I remember the upheaval that was caused on LinkedIn when I made a mistake about the assumptions of Linear Regression \u2014 yes, I made a mistake discussing one of the easiest Machine Learning algorithms ever. Although one may of taken this to be a public embarrassment, and many of the comments people were sharing were adding fuel to the flame, instead, I felt a much greater sense of responsibility to properly research whatever I write about and I was quick to befriend the person that called me out for helping me become better.", "\u201cSee people that correct your mistakes as those that want you to be the best you can be and befriend them!\u201d", "If you truly want to succeed in a role in the workplace you\u2019d need to willing put in the time, effort, and elbow grease required to achieve your goals. Starting (and maintaining) your own data science blog is not a prerequisite, in fact, you don\u2019t have to. However, if you decide to you are not only expressing your work ethic to everyone around you, you also develop your own work ethic. Some people do this as a result of wanting to reach monetary targets with their blogs, some from social goals (i.e. having 3k followers), and others from ensuring they remain disciplined (i.e. ensuring to post 3 times a week). Whatever the reason, you develop your grit and that is a life skill to hold dear.", "With your Data Science blog, you are essentially marketing yourself, and good marketing will attract willing customers. In other words, if you do a good job of portraying the skills and qualities that you have, people will take note and approach you regarding these things. Beware that this is not exclusive to job offers, but it could be something significant that leads you meeting someone with a job offer or meeting someone that you go on to form a start up with, such as making you a guest speaker on a podcast where you discuss a blog post you\u2019ve made or to write for a publisher \u2014 Who knows?", "\u201cDo things that increase your chances of achieving success\u201d", "There are many more reasons that I could of added as to why you should have a Data Science blog , but I am hoping that these 3 reasons were enough to persuade you to start. In general, I believe the overall purpose of having a blog should be to learn new exciting things which you then go on to teach. However, considering the upside of blogging can serve as an effective motivation tool to aid you in tackling the gritty work that is required for blogging.", "Thank you for reading to the end.
