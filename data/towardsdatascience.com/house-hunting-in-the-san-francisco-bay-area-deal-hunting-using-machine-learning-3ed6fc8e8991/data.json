Using a data set of 7,000 active listings from June 2019, factors influencing home prices across the region were explored. Complementing listing information (number of bedrooms and bathrooms, home size, and lot size) with location data (school quality and commute times) was found to significantly improve explanatory power of the simple linear regression model. Regression coefficients also tell an interesting story about the market\u2019s perception of the value of various aspects of the home and its location. Importantly, the pricing model enables identification of undervalued listings and neighborhoods, offering key information of potential interest to individual homebuyers and investors alike.", "While the performance of the S&P 500 and the overall US housing market has been nearly identical since 2000 (both up ~100%), home price indices in the San Francisco Bay Area have risen by approximately 167% (St. Louis Fed). As such, Bay Area homeowners have enjoyed an opportunity to build wealth through real estate in a way that is not necessarily accessible to most of the rest of the country.", "For those already bought into the market, this near-tripling of real estate values since 2000 has undoubtedly been a good thing. However, for those newly relocated to the region, saving towards a down payment and choosing where to buy can be a daunting task. Inspired by discussions I\u2019ve had with friends and family, and basic concepts in investing (i.e., buy underpriced assets) I set out to gather as much information about current prices of single-family homes in the Bay Area, apply simple machine learning techniques to tease out factors driving home values, and identify corners of the region that may be appealing for investment.", "Data from single-family home listings (address, beds, baths, home size, lot size, latitude/longitude coordinates, and price) across the Bay Area was cleaned and processed using Regex and Pandas. Complementing listing data, commute times were obtained from Google Maps and school quality data pulled from the 2018 California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP). The resulting information was overlaid onto maps using Cartopy, Matplotlib, and shapefiles (town, zip code, and neighborhood borders) from Stanford Earthworks. Box/strip plots and pairwise relationships between variables were visualized using Seaborn. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis was applied to the data using Statsmodels and Scikit-learn libraries. The full source code for this project is available on GitHub.", "With information for several thousand properties on the market across the Bay Area, the location of all listings was plotted on a terrain map and color-coded by price (Figure 1) using the Python Cartopy package together with city border information obtained from Stanford Earthworks. This map reveals clear geographic trends of the relative cost of homes across the region. For instance, San Francisco, Marin County, and the Peninsula typically contain the most expensive 20% of listings (dark blue data points), while those in Oakland, San Leandro, and Richmond are typically in the least expensive 20% (dark red data points). Similarly, in the South Bay, homes closer to the Santa Cruz Mountains are typically more expensive than those running alongside the Diablo Range.", "A natural extension of this analysis involves splitting the listings into subregions. Zooming in on San Francisco, the East Bay, the Peninsula, and the South Bay, geographic price trends again emerge (Figure 2). The most expensive single-family home listings in San Francisco fall between downtown and the Presidio, while the least expensive are found in the southern portion of the city, from the Sunset to Bayview districts. In the East Bay, homes on either side of the Oakland Hills (including Piedmont, Berkeley, and Orinda) are the most expensive, while Richmond, South Oakland, and San Leandro are the least expensive. On the Peninsula, homes in Palo Alto, Atherton, and Hillsborough are the most expensive, while San Mateo and East Palo Alto are the least expensive. In the South Bay, homes closest to the Santa Cruz Mountains (Los Altos, Saratoga, and Los Gatos) are the most expensive, while nearly everything east of that is less expensive. Relative cost across regions is also interesting to note: while the top price quintile in the East Bay starts at $1.5M, that same price point falls at the bottom of the scale on the Peninsula.", "Home and land prices across cities and towns", "To better quantify price variation, box plots were constructed using the Python Seaborn library. This representation enables comparison of distributions across categorical variables (here: cities/towns), where the colored box denotes the bounds of the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentile), the line within it shows the median price, and the whiskers encompass the remainder of the distribution minus outliers.", "From this perspective, sorting selected localities from least- to most expensive median home price offers some interesting insights (Figure 3). For example, the lowest median home prices are largely found in the northeast Bay (Vallejo, Antioch, and Richmond), while the highest are found on the Peninsula (Hillsborough, Palo Alto, and Woodside). In addition, the overlay of scatter points on top of the boxplots speaks to where most people live: Oakland, San Jose, and San Francisco each have several hundred current listings, while the more expensive dozen communities have just a handful of homes currently listed for sale.", "Interestingly, application of the same analysis to the price of the land the house sits on (Figure 4) leads to somewhat different conclusions. For instance, while the median home price in Woodside ranks third highest of the 29 cities and towns depicted in Figure 3, the median cost of land per unit area in this community (located mostly west of I-280 and known for horseback riding) is in fact the lowest of those 29. Similarly, other towns with high median home prices, such as Orinda and Los Gatos, appear to be more affordable from a land cost perspective. At the other end of the spectrum, Palo Alto and San Francisco are by far the most expensive places to buy land, reflecting their status as major hubs of economic activity in the region.", "For San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose, the distribution of home prices was also split up by neighborhood. While several San Francisco neighborhoods (Inner Richmond, Russian Hill, Nob Hill, Marina District, North Beach) lay claim to the most expensive (> $5M) homes in the Bay Area, there are still a few neighborhoods (Bayview, Hunters Point, Visitacion Valley, Excelsior, Crocker-Amazon) offering properties with a list price below $1M (Figure 5, top).", "In Oakland (Figure 5, middle), just 3 neighborhoods (Montclair, Trestle Glen, and Rockridge) have median home prices exceeding $1M, while nearly all others (most notably Cox/Elmhurst Park, Coliseum, and Fruitvale) have a significant number of listings priced below $0.5M, among the cheapest offered in the Bay.", "Such bargains are generally not found in San Jose (Figure 5, bottom), where the most affordable neighborhoods have median home prices just under $1M. Even so, there are only a handful of homes priced above $2M in this area, and they seem to be mostly in the Willow Glen, Almaden, and Evergreen neighborhoods. Interestingly, the highest median home prices here are found in West San Jose, though the price distribution is much narrower than similar neighborhoods, perhaps reflecting the fact that this area has uniformly modest homes with property values driven up by proximity to technology giants like Apple and Netflix.", "Here I describe a very simple approach to construct a model for home prices using an ordinary least-squares (unregularized) linear regression model. My goals are to (1) produce an interpretable model with coefficients that shed light on the value the market places on various aspects of the home and the land it sits on, and (2) identify parts of the Bay Area that offer the most \u201cbang for your buck\u201d, i.e., those that offer a combination of features that warrant higher prices than what the market currently bears. Of course, other approaches (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, neural networks) can yield a model with much higher explanatory power [link to new home price modeling article]. The linear model described below fits with the intent of this article \u2014 to offer insights on home values from a descriptive analytics perspective.", "Beyond simply describing the geographic distribution of current Bay Area housing and land prices, the data set was used to model home prices using Python Statsmodels and Scikit-learn libraries.", "To begin, prices of the 7,151 homes in the data set were plotted individually against property data contained within the listing (number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, home size, and lot size) and fitted using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression via Seaborn pairplots (Figure 6, top). Of these four features, home size explains most of the observed variance in list price (R\u00b2 = 0.56). On the other hand, when the full data set is narrowed to a single zip code (95126), each of these features does a much better job of accounting for price variance (Figure 6, bottom).", "The modest correlation between home size and price over the entire region, and strong correlation within a single zip code, raises the very intuitive possibility that location-specific factors also contribute to price. To bring \u201cplace\u201d into the equation, additional data reflecting convenience and privilege was introduced: commute time and public school quality.", "Recognizing San Francisco and Palo Alto as the two primary economic centers of the region, the commute time was measured via Google Maps as travel time by car (at 8 AM on a Wednesday) from each zip code to the closer of the two destinations (Figure 7, left). The result indicates that homes up and down the Peninsula, from San Francisco to San Jose, offer the possibility of a commute time shorter than one hour. Similarly, Marin and Oakland have convenient access to San Francisco, as does Fremont to Palo Alto. On the other hand, commute times to the nearer hub are often more than 1.5 hours from homes in the outer East Bay (Richmond, Antioch, San Ramon).", "The quality of public schools is also likely to play a role in setting the price of single-family homes in a particular area. Conveniently, the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) standardized testing authority has made available a large set of student proficiency data for every public school in California. Using the 2018 data set, averaging proficiency measurements across grades for each school, and across schools for each zip code, school quality was quantified as the fraction of students deemed proficient in reading and math within a particular zip code (Figure 7, right). Even after such averaging, this map points to a nearly bimodal split in student outcomes across the Bay Area, with Marin County, the Peninsula, and the Tri-Valley region enjoying excellent schools (> 75% of students proficient) while public school students in Antioch, Vallejo, Richmond, San Leandro, and San Jose appear to struggle by comparison.", "These new parameters were also evaluated as independent predictors of list price. Indeed, commute time and school score explain to a similar degree (R\u00b2 ~ 0.55) observed variance in price as home size, the previous best predictor (Figure 8). Intuitively, the lines of best fit imply a positive relationship between home price and school quality, and a negative relationship between price and commute time.", "Multicollinearity, or significant correlation between features across a feature set, can lead to different values for coefficients depending on which features are selected for inclusion in the model. With the intention of creating a simple model with interpretable coefficients, this expanded feature set must be winnowed down to those that offer meaningful new information for price prediction.", "To that end, Pearson correlation coefficients across the feature set are shown in Figure 9. Indeed, three parameters from the listing data (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and home size) are all strongly correlated with one another (0.65 < \u03c1 < 0.83), necessitating the removal of two of them if we are to extract meaning from the coefficients after fitting the model. As the strongest independent predictor of price (Figure 6, top), home size was kept in the model while bedrooms and bathrooms were discarded.", "Bringing in the commute time and school quality data, the simple linear regression model was constructed as:", "Price ~ Home size + Lot size + Commute time + School score (1)", "Home price data was regressed onto the four features listed above using the Scikit-learn LinearRegression package. Tenfold cross-validation was used to estimate generalization error, or how well the model performs on data not used in training the model. With home size, lot size, commute time, and school score, an average test set R\u00b2 of 0.61 was achieved using all examples in the data set. However, outlier removal resulted in a sizable improvement in fit quality, bringing up average test set R\u00b2 to 0.70 after excluding homes with prices in the bottom and top 5% ($450k and $4.3M, respectively). This model trained on filtered data is further examined below.", "The key advantage of such a simple model is ease of interpretability. To that end, feature coefficients suggest that Bay Area homebuyers should, all else being equal, be prepared to pay roughly $430 for each additional square foot of interior space, $0.35 per additional square foot for exterior space, $14k for every minute of commute time saved, and $12k for each percentage point gain in fraction of students proficient within their local public schools:", "Given its simplicity, and the fact that the training and test set error are very close (R\u00b2 of 0.71 vs. 0.70, respectively), it\u2019s safe to say that this four-feature, least-squares linear regression model is on the high bias side of the bias-variance tradeoff. A more accurate model could be constructed without to much difficulty by using, for instance, a larger feature set or nonparametric approaches such as k-nearest neighbors or decision trees (see my more recent article on the same topic). Interpretability is the price paid \u2014 simple rules regarding the market\u2019s value of an additional square foot of interior space or shorter commute are not easily extracted from complex models.", "The gap between the current model\u2019s performance (R\u00b2 = 0.71) and perfection (R\u00b2 = 1) can be explained by three factors: (1) nonlinear effects not treatable under a simple linear model (e.g., interaction effects between features, saturating relationship between home size and price), (2) aspects of a home and its surroundings that may affect price but are not included in this model, and (3) mismatch between intrinsic home value and list price set by agent or homeowner. The first can be addressed by increasing complexity, for instance adding interaction terms or moving to nonparametric model. The second could be fixed with additional features, for example local crime rate, aesthetics of neighborhood, property condition. Neighborhood Scout has a crime risk map but to my knowledge the underlying data has not been released. Neighborhood aesthetics might be approximated by quantifying desirable attributes such as tree coverage or elevation. The third is simply irreducible error contributed by inherent randomness in market pricing.", "Buying underpriced assets is the core tenet of value investing. From the perspective of an institutional investor or savvy homebuyer, a home value model offers the attractive prospect of identifying areas (and ultimately, individual properties) that may be mispriced with respect to the rest of the market.", "To this end, the location of each listing was plotted on a terrain map with marker color now denoting the difference between actual and predicted price (Figure 10). Underpriced listings (shown in red) are those that offer a combination of the four features (home and lot size, commute time, and school quality) typical of a higher-priced home. According to the model, underpriced areas can be found in San Francisco (Sunset and Bayview districts), along the Peninsula (Daly City and East Palo Alto), in the East Bay (Alameda, Orinda, Hayward, and Fremont), and Marin (San Anselmo).", "Consider the scenario where a more complex model was fitted, for instance, one where we added dummy variables for every city or zip code. This model would offer a more accurate home price hypothesis by adding some dollar figure to the predicted price for a listings that happens to be in an expensive city or zip code, and thus be better for identifying deals at the listing level. However, we would then lose the ability to identify under- or overpriced corners of the map! By choosing only features related to the intrinsic value of a property, we deprive our model of the ability to learn that East Palo Alto, for example, is cheap, and thus gain the ability to reveal that East Palo Alto is underpriced with respect to what it offers.", "Boxplots offer another interesting representation of the residuals (Figure 11). Arranging selected cities by the difference between actual and predicted list price, it\u2019s possible to see that East Palo Alto and Orinda offer a combination of home and location attributes characteristic of listings typically priced $0.5M above that of those two locations. On the other hand, the opposite appears to be the case for places like Menlo Park, Los Gatos, and Palo Alto.", "For San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose, the residuals were also plotted across individual neighborhoods (Figure 12). In San Francisco, the bargains are straightforward: the most affordable neighborhoods look to be undervalued. On the other hand, the same is not necessarily true in Oakland: the Montclair and Glen Highlands neighborhoods, for instance, appear to be both nominally expensive in terms of list price and also a bargain relative to Eq. 2. San Jose appears to combine elements of both, indicating that some nominally expensive neighborhoods (Willow Glen, Midtown) may indeed be overvalued, while other pricey neighborhoods (Cambrian Park, West San Jose) look to be more reasonable with respect to Eq. 2.", "Scraping several thousand current real estate listings, the price of single-family housing across the San Francisco Bay Area was explored graphically and statistically. Bringing home and lot size, commute time, and school quality into a multiple linear regression fit enabled modeling of prices and identification of undervalued areas of the Bay that may be appealing for investment. Future work might include improving the model by adding additional features (e.g., crime data, tree coverage, elevation) likely to impact the perceived desirability of a location, and tracking the performance of this pricing model as the housing market evolves over the coming years.", "The application of data science techniques to inform real estate transactions need not be pursued only by professional investors \u2014 free, open-source packages for use with Python empower the individual to gather large data sets, visualize key metrics, and apply machine learning techniques to identify deals that may be overlooked by other market participants.", "Your home for data science.
