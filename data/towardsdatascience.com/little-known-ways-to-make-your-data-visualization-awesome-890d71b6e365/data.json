As I determined the connection between the author\u2019s name and the term data-ink ratio, I began to explore it and started implementing it on my data visualization journey.", "This blog is dedicated to those who want to dive into or are engaging in mesmerizing data visualization fields.", "Data visualization is mapping values to visuals or, say, turning numbers into pictures and stories, allowing us to explore, explain and understand the data in a different way, giving us the window of opportunity to grab the hidden pattern and insights.", "Want to explore more about EDA?", "Suppose you have previous experience in data visualization or is a neophyte to this field. In that case, I am sure you have played with visual encoding or have a basic idea of it.", "Generally, when we try creating a visualization, we append a lot of information needed for the audience, so we fantasize about introducing more colors, facts, images, etc. They sometimes look good, but most of the time, it leads to the visual clutter: making our work loath by the audience.", "Today, people are so familiar with images that they neglect the text accompanying the photos. This is why Instagram gained its popularity in a short interval of time: Power of Images. As people won\u2019t read through the text, our graphs have to be self-explanatory and can\u2019t be open to others\u2019 interpretations. They shouldn\u2019t detract from the information with lots of bright colors and bold fonts, with a high cognitive load on the user. Thus, naked visualization is a better option for our users.", "How can we make our visualization, Naked?", "For this, we can accompany the following three concepts:", "Above all else, show the data. \u2014 Edward R. Tufte", "Information visualization expert Edward R. Tufte is an artist and statistician professor at Yale University, who has written, designed, and published four books dedicated to data visualization knowledge. In 1983, Tufte published his first book called The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, focusing on designing data graphics\u2019 theories and practices.It is probably the most important book ever written on data visualization. In this book, he introduces two interesting graphical heuristics, the data-ink ratio, and chartjunk.", "He defines data-ink as \u201cnon-erasable core of the graphic,\u201d or in other words, \u201cthe data-ink ratio is the portion of ink (i.e., pixels) that makes up data-information on the view.\u201d", "Tufte defines the data-ink ratio as the amount of data-ink divided by the total ink required to print the graphic.", "In a layman term, Tufte suggests removing those elements that don\u2019t add new information to the graphic, i.e., using less ink (chart elements) is more effective, attractive, and imperative for viewers.", "He puts forward the following five principles related to data-ink:", "Let\u2019s take an example of the data-ink ratio.", "The chart below represents the penguin species and their body mass in grams.", "So how we can achieve a high data-ink ratio here:", "After following these approaches mentioned above, we come into the chart below:", "We have made the graphic more straightforward and readable and increased the amount of information the viewer sees by increasing the data-ink ratio.", "Rule of ThumbExtraneous elements, such as background grids and tick lines, should be removed or visible enough to serve their purpose but not detract from the relevant information.", "Kill the frills and get to the point! \u2014 Edward R. Tufte", "When we try to make visualization, we always think of what we will put in the graphs rather than what we will leave out. This gives rise to chartjunk.", "Chartjunk is the next heuristic, Tufte mentioned in his book The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (1983). He calls Chartjunk \u2014 the excessive and unnecessary use of graphical effects in graphs. He also calls out moir\u00e9 vibration, massive grids, and self-promoting charts used to demonstrate the designer\u2019s graphic ability rather than display the data.", "In simple terms, chartjunk refers to all visual elements that are not necessary for the chart view or say, which distracts the user or in the simple phrase when the chart or graph has many superfluous labels or decorations that do not convey data.", "Let\u2019s take an example of the Chartjunk.", "So how we can remove chartjunk here:", "After removing the chartjunk, we have the following graphic.", "Thus, adding extra \u201cstuff\u201d is not always informative as sometimes it gives the cognitive load. It is not still exact to know what chartjunk is and what is not. So we should also think about how we can clarify the message, how we want people to read our data, and what we want them to take away as sometimes adding various design elements can be useful for clarifying the story we want to tell.", "White space is to be regarded as an active element, not a passive background \u2014 Jan Tschichold.", "There is one saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t design when you can\u2019t see.\u201d , So in the below design, how many elements do you see?", "Oh, sorry, my friends, there is a third element, also called whitespace.", "Tufte, in his next book, called Envisioning Information writes that about 1 +1 =3. Don\u2019t be sad, space or say negative space is the most ignored design elements. It is the one that controls every other design element in our visualization. So in data visualization, the expression 1 +1 =3 is very popular as white space is anything as empty design.", "Why Even White Space Matters In Data Visualization?", "Remember, we don\u2019t have to be a professional designer to understand and implement the white space design principle on our next data visualization project. Our goal is to reduce cognitive load, improve reader experience, and create a sense of harmony.", "Thus, if you made this far, We can see that how stripping away the excess and making our graphs naked has helped to present the underlying data in a way that communicates our thoughts, provoke readers\u2019 attention, and above all, doesn\u2019t make readers flow in information overload: all by introducing data-ink ratio, chartjunk, and negative space on our design.Next time you jump into making the design, think about what you can take away rather than what you can put.", "Closing with Antoine de Saint-Exupery quote:", "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.", "If you have any queries regarding the article or want to work together on your next data visualization project, ping me on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
