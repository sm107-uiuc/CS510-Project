Yet the black box nature of some AI systems, giving results without a reason, is hindering the mass adoption of AI. According to an annual survey by PwC, the vast majority (82%) of CEOs agree that for AI-based decisions to be trusted, they must be explainable. As AI becomes an ever more integral part of our modern world, we need to understand why and how it makes predictions and decisions.", "These questions of why and how are the subject of the field of Explainable AI, or XAI. Like AI itself, XAI isn\u2019t a new domain of research, and recent advances in the theory and applications of AI have put new urgency behind efforts to explain it. The talk I gave at TMLS\u201919 was based on a blog post series I had published previously. The series explored the various facets of the XAI field, including what it is, why it is important, and how it can be achieved.", "Instead of repeating the content in the series, here I am going to present an overview of each of the five parts of the series and refer interested readers to them for a detailed discussion.", "This part presents an overview of some of the most important drivers of XAI research such as establishing trust, regulatory compliance, detecting bias, AI model generalization and debug.", "This part takes a deep dive into what it really means to explain AI models in terms of existing definitions, the importance of explanation users\u2019 roles and given application, possible tradeoffs, and explanation studies beyond the AI community.", "Explainability mean different things at the three main stages of AI development, namely, before, during, and after the modelling stage. This part looks into achieving explainability prior to the modelling stage. This involves reviewing a set of methodologies for better understanding and documentation of datasets used for modelling.", "An AI model can be developed with both explainability and the typical predictive performance as objectives. This part reviews several family of methodologies to achieve explainable modelling including adopting inherently explainable models, hybrid models, joint prediction and explanation, as well as explainability through regularization and architectural adjustments.", "The vast majority of the XAI literature work is focused on extracting explanation from a pre-developed model to better understand it. This part presents a novel taxonomy of post-modelling explainability methodologies. This taxonomy is then used as the underlying structure for reviewing the related literature work.", "I have the privilege of working as a customer-facing data scientist at H2O.ai, an open source leader in AI and ML. I dedicated a part of my talk to an overview of H2O.ai\u2019s enterprise automatic machine learning platform, i.e. Driverless AI, and in particular its machine learning interpretability (MLI) capabilities.", "I ended the talk by presenting my take on the XAI outlook with three predictions. First, I expected we will see more infusion of learnings from explanation studies beyond AI community. Second, I discussed emergence of XAI best practices in the future. Last but not least, I advocated for more future work on explainability by design over the, currently dominant, post-hoc explainability paradigm.", "Your home for data science.
