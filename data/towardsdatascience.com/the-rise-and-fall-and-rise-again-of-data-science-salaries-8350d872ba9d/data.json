Machine learning, salary, cumulative pay growth."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://datascience2.medium.com/subscribe", "anchor_text": "https://datascience2.medium.com/subscribe", "paragraph_index": 18}], "all_paragraphs": ["In the past five years, data science salary cumulative growth has varied between 12% in the United States, according to Glassdoor\u2019s job market report [2]. Between those five years, there have been certain months of significant increase and decrease. In this article, I will outline the key metrics that occur at certain months and years of these five years, including median base pay, cumulative growth, and year-over-year growth. Somewhat similar careers, like software engineering, have seen steady inclines over the same period, so it is important to note the volatility of data science salaries.", "I will speculate as to why there is either an increase or decrease in growth along with its respective median base salary for each significant period of time. There are many reasons as to why these changes have occurred, and it is interesting to look at the differences between months and years for data science salary, spanning over $10,000 total. If you would like to know more salary information on similar positions like data analyst and software engineer, you can refer to the same Glassdoor job market report by following the link at the end of this article.", "I will be discussing the key metrics over the rise and fall and rise again of data science salaries below.", "The initial rise of the five year period is June of 2015. This month recorded a median base salary of $95,798, with a cumulative growth of 6.2%. There could be several reasons to explain this growth. While it is not recorded, I can speculate on what has caused this change in cumulative pay growth.", "I would suggest that the spike in growth is from companies realizing how powerful and popular this career in data science is. Once companies hire more and more data scientists, it becomes more competitive not only for the applicant, but for the employer as well. I am considering that in 2015, in this case, data science is well-established, and applicants feel more confident in demanding a higher salary, as well as companies allocating more of their budget to data science careers after seeing or hearing about wide success with this position on businesses.", "In some cases, you could argue that one data scientist could perform the function of two analysts from the automation of common processes with programming language like Python, so why not pay one person a little more instead of having two people cost your business even more in the long run? Of course, all companies are different in some ways, along with their respective roles, so this could be beneficial or detrimental. Additionally, data analysts can sometimes have considerably different tasks, processes, and impacts.", "Once again, here are the metrics for the first rise:", "Once companies hired their first data scientist, they sought out to hire more.", "Perhaps this trend meant that they already had a senior data scientist and the next logical choice was to look for a junior data scientist that could be acquired for a smaller salary.", "This fall in June of 2016 was considerably substantial in that the median base salary dropped to $88,649 with a cumulative growth of -1.7% and a year-over-year growth of -7.5%. Yes, those last two statistics were negative. While I do not know for certain the cause of this significant drop in pay, I do know that there were going to be better months and years ahead. As a data scientist myself, I would create a dataset to isolate key, significant features like the following:", "As you can see, there are several different ways of dissecting this decrease in pay. Luckily, the fall did not last long, and a huge rise would top that initial rise. Here are those metrics highlighted once more:", "It took a few years to see this rise again, which occurred recently in June 2020. Perhaps with COVID-19, tech roles became of more focus as employees demanded to work from home, or were required to. Customer-facing roles perhaps declined, as many new positions would need to be performed individually at home, over a video conferencing platform. Nearly $100,000, the median base pay for data scientists in this month was $99,674 with a cumulative growth of 10.5% and a year-over-year growth of 5.5%. This rise again is of course great news for data scientists. If you have not noticed yet, it is important to note that all of these key dates have been in the month of June of their respective years, perhaps it is just a coincidence, but it would be interesting to know why this trend and pattern occurred.", "The summarized information is here for the rise again:", "For easy viewing, the chart above summarizes the key dates along with their respective metrics of median base salary, cumulative growth, and year-over-year growth. This chart was made in Google Data Studio and covers the key points in time discussed in this article. If you would like to see a more detailed time series chart with more months and years including not only the data science statistics, but other technology position statistics, follow the link from Glassdoor in the references section below.", "As for the future of data science salary, it could be tricky to predict with the pandemic occurring, and companies that were once steady, are now volatile in themselves. Perhaps, data science pay will rise with more tech companies performing better, or the salary will decline as more and more companies, in general, are declining. Additionally, data science positions could soon offer more or less pay based on their split in specific requirements for the position. For example, a data scientist role in 2025 could reduce to a median base salary of $95,000, while a machine learning engineer role could increase to $105,000. This change could result in response to companies needing to rely more on the deployment of models and less face-to-face interactions.", "In this article, we discussed the rise, fall, and rise again of data science salaries. There are several reasons for these changes in pay growth over the past five years. Feel free to comment down below on why you think this median pay changes so frequently. Keep in mind, this highly changing trend was not the same for similar roles in technology like software engineering, systems engineering, and web developer.", "I hope you found my article useful and interesting.
