Exploratory data analysis helps to comprehend data better by finding patterns through it. Pandas is a powerful library that is used to perform EDA."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["It is relatively easy to draw graphs using libraries say Matplotlib or query the data. However, to be able to draw graphs the data has to in a certain format. One of the motivations behind this article is to understand how to prepare data for further processing. The article also discusses on performing basic operations such as querying, sorting and visualising Pandas data frames.", "Although data can be available in multiple format but for the sake of discussion let us assume the data to be in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.", "The above syntax is pretty standard and is sufficient most of the times. The default behaviour of read_csv() assumes first line in a CSV file to be column headings and uses it as the heading for the data frame created. However, the following variation dictates to use the first row as a part of data.", "In this case you can explicitly specify column headings as \u2014", "If names parameter is not specified then columns are indexed starting from 0.", "Once you have read your data, the next step is to make yourself comfortable with the data set. Let\u2019s begin by seeing the number of records in data set.", "Once you know the size of data let\u2019s take a look at how does the data look. You can use the head() function to take a look at the starting rows of the data set. The tail() function is used to look at the bottom rows of the data set.", "Having seeing the data let us try to understand the data better. It is really helpful if you know the data type of data stored in a column. It helps you to apply appropriate functions to column. For example, if the column is of float or integer data type then you can apply functions like mean() and max() over them. The info() function returns a summary of data frame along with the data type for each column.", "Let\u2019s see different type of data that is stored in the column.", "The above command will help you to see you the frequency of each item stored in \u2018col\u2019. In some cases you might see unwanted values that you want to get rid of, say NaN in case of numbers or empty values in case of strings. Let\u2019s discuss on how to clean the data set in the next section.", "The most naive approach to clean the data set will be to drop rows which contain unwanted values. Another convincing way is to impute missing data. Let\u2019s see how to handle not a number (NaN) value.", "Instead of dropping the rows you can choose to replace the NaN value with say 0 or replace it by say using the mean of the respective column.", "Obviously you cannot compute mean for string values, but comparison and regex can be used to find strings of undesired format and replace them with a value of your choice or drop the corresponding row.", "If instead of dropping you want to replace the missing string value you can do it as follows \u2014", "Assume you expected that a particular field in your CSV to have only integer values but accidentally the column has a string value. In this case you cannot process the column as integer. Let\u2019s see how to handle such situation.", "You can choose to find the string values and replace it with any suitable value as discussed earlier.", "Once you have replaced string value you can convert the data type of column as follows \u2014", "Once you have finished processing your data, the next step is to extract valuable information from the data. For the sake of discussion let us consider a very small data set comprising of marks of a couple of students. Below is the tabular representation of the CSV data.", "The basic query is to list students who scored above a certain value. The following query shows all records in which marks scored for Test1 are greater than 15. Apart from the greater than operator other relational operators can also be used such as > =, <, < =, ==, and =!.", "The following query shows how to perform comparison on string values. There also exists the not equal (!=) operator. The following query retrieves marks for John.", "Apart from basic comparison for string you can also apply functions such as startswith(), endswith() and contains() to filter the data. The following example queries marks for students whose name starts with J.", "Although, pandas provides ways to filter based on string valued columns but there is nothing more powerful than using regex. The following example retrieves names that begin with A using regex.", "You can also combine multiple conditions using and and or. The following query retrieves record in which students have scored more than 16 marks in the first two tests.", "It is not always that you want to compare values with a constant. The following syntax is used to compare corresponding values of two columns and return the rows which satisfy the condition. This query shows list of students who have improved their performance in the second test as compared to the first test.", "There is a possibility in which you do not want to see results which comprise of all the columns. Let us take a look on how to conditionally retrieve marks only for Test2.", "The next most common operation is to sort data. Let\u2019s take look at an example to sort students in descending order of marks obtained in Test3.", "You can use libraries such as Matpoltlib to graph and visualise data which will help to quickly find trends and patterns in data. But for the sake of uniformity let\u2019s use plot() function provided by Pandas dataframe class.", "A bar chart of \u2018Name\u2019 and marks scored in \u2018Test1\u2019.", "The following graph is a comparison between marks scored by each student in all the three tests.", "You can certainly draw more informative graphs based on your requirement but to keep the discussion simple let\u2019s wrap it up here.", "Your home for data science.
