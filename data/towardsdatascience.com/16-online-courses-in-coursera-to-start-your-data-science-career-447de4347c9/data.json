Most importantly, we can learn remotely.", "In this article, I\u2019ve organised the courses on Coursera that I think will help people who want to enter this area. If you\u2019re already a very experienced Data Analyst/Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer, I believe most of the courses might be kind of shallow.", "The courses are organised into different categories for your convenience.", "Of course, I won\u2019t say that you have to nail everything in these courses. Based on your personal needs and career path preferences, you may pick up some of them to warm up yourself.", "\u2605 Introduction to Big DataUniversity of California San Diego", "I\u2019m sure that you probably know something about databases, SQL, etc. However, nowadays you need to know what is Big Data to be capable of in most of the data analytics and data science tasks.", "This course introduces the core concepts of Big Data and why does it matter. It also trains us how to think about problems in a scalable way, which enables us to have a further vision when we meet a data-related problem.", "If you are happy with this course, it also comes in a series that will keep immersing in the applications of Big Data including Machine Learning in Big Data, but it is meant to be more theoretical rather than a lot of hands-on.", "\u2605 The Data Scientist\u2019s ToolboxJohns Hopkins University", "If you don\u2019t have too much programming background, this course will be very helpful. It listed the most popular things in the \u201cData Scientist\u2019s Toolbox\u201d and explained.", "In this course, you will learn basic programming such as R, as well as the development environment such as RStudio. Also, as a data scientist, you will need to know how to collaborate with your colleagues in Git.", "\u2605 An Introduction to Interactive Programming in PythonRice University", "You must know that Python is the most popular programming language in the data science area. So, if you haven\u2019t started to use it, this course will help you to become a Python programmer.", "The expected audiences of this course are those non-computer science background people. Therefore, it starts from the basics. So, don\u2019t worry to get stuck if you never use a programming language before. It is also worth mentioning that this course is not focused on either data analysis or machine learning, but only the programming skills.", "\u2605 Applied Data Science with Python SpecializationUniversity of Michigan", "Please be noticed that this is a specialization which means it contains multiple courses.", "This course is for those who already have experience in Python but never used it for data analytics. Indeed, I would say that it is kind of different when I use Python to write a web service and a data visualisation application. This course will help you to switch your existing programming skills to fit your data analysis/machine learning career in Python.", "Of course, Python is not the only choice for data analysis and machine learning. When people mentioning these areas, R cannot be absent.", "If you prefer to use R, it is totally fine. In this course, you will learn from A to Z for R programming, including environment configuration, applying R in statistical problems, utilising third-party libraries, debugging, etc. Another good thing is that this course also provides some data analysis examples from the industry, which makes your skill more practical.", "\u2605 Business Metrics for Data-Driven CompaniesDuke University", "If you want to learn data analysis that is driven by the purpose, this course is one of the best for you. It presents data analysis skills using all industry examples to teach you not only the knowledge but also hands-on skills.", "You will learn what do you exactly need to become a typical Data Analyst. How to use data analytics to help your company in intensive competitions. You will find the answers here.", "If you want to have a deep dive into those popular data analysis, data mining and statistical techniques, this course will be helpful. It focuses on statistical techniques such as Hypothesis Testing, ANOVA, Chi-Square Test, Pearson Correlation, etc.", "\u2605 Mastering Data Analysis in ExcelDuke University", "I know that using Excel sounds not very cool, but I have to say that it is not a bad option sometimes. For example, when you got data already in Excel and want some quick and one time results, it still might be the best choice. Also, if you have already got not bad skills in Excel, this course will help you to explore more possibilities and potentials in Excel.", "\u2605 Getting Started with Power BI DesktopAmit Yadav, Coursera Project Network", "As one of the most popular data visualisation and BI front-end tool, Power BI is a good start if your company is a Microsoft shop.", "I would highly recommend this course to start your data visualisation journey. It is one of the Coursera Guided Project Course, which means that it provides you with an online workspace that is a cloud desktop right in your browser, no download required. Then, you can work on the hands-on tasks with the instruction video side-by-side, very convenient and good experience.", "\u2605 Data Visualization and Communication with TableauDuke University", "Tableau is another data visualisation tool that makes a large proportion in this market. In this course, you will learn how to use Tableau to tell a data story, how to visualise the results from your data analytics or machine learning models and how to communicate better with others by data.", "\u2605 Data VisualizationThe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "Rather than introducing a specific tool for data visualisation, this course means to provide a guide on the conceptual level. For example, what kind of data visualisation should be used in which circumstances, what are the typical data visualisation methods for numerical and non-numerical data, etc.", "\u2605 Machine LearningAndrew Ng, Stanford University", "This is the best machine learning course ever, no \u201cone of\u201d. If you would like me to recommend only one course on machine learning for beginners, it has to be this one. So far (August 2020), there have been more than 3.4 million learners enrolled in this course on Coursera.", "More importantly, this course has already been made free on Coursera, although I think it is worth thousands of dollars.", "\u2605 Applied Data Science with Python SpecializationUniversity of Michigan", "If you have already learned the course from Andrew Ng and just want to explore some others, this is a not bad one. The content has a lot of overlaps with the former, but it is good to have another one for reinforcing your learning if you want.", "If you have already got basic knowledge of machine learning and want to know what kind of applications that ML can do, this course is one of the best.", "Recommender System has been and still be one of the hottest application areas of machine learning. When you bought something on ebay.com, their recommender system will \u201clearn\u201d your preferences and recommend you with something others that you may buy as well. This is one example of recommender systems.", "Regression is one of the most commonly used techniques in statistical learning. This course focuses on regression and has a deep dive into all different kinds of regression such as linear regression, logistic regression, multivariable regression, residuals, Poisson regression, etc. It also tells you how to select the best regression model.", "\u2605 Neural Networks and Deep LearningAndrew Ng, deeplearning.ai", "If you are a technology enthusiast, you must know Alpha Go, which is an AI that has beat the best human Go players, and the technology behind it is deep learning.", "If you want to learn deep learning, this is the best course from Andrew Ng again. Don\u2019t worry. It starts from the shallow neural network so that it is pretty friendly for beginners, though I still suggest that beginners should start from the first course in this section.", "While everyone is locked down in their homes due to the COVID-19, someone spends their time on trivial things to \u201ckill\u201d the time. However, if we can utilise the time to improve our data science skills, I\u2019m sure that we will be more competitive in the job market when everything is back to normal.", "If you feel my articles are helpful, please consider joining Medium Membership to support me and thousands of other writers!
