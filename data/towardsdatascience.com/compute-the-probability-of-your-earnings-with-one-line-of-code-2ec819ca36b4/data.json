This is especially true during these times of Corona crisis, where any prediction feels quite precarious.", "Nevertheless, even in such difficult circumstances, I believe some applied math can never hurt. Below, you can enjoy some concepts of random process theory applied to simple business scenarios.", "Necessary premise: my purpose is to show some math at work, not to give any financial advice. Please, also don\u2019t forget that math formulas are reliable only when their working assumptions are satisfied.", "Let\u2019s start simple, and consider that in your business you only sell one type of product at a fixed price. This might be a concrete object, digital content or any service.", "For instance, imagine you are a hobby painter and you sell your artworks at 100$ each. For compactness, we\u2019re going to denote this price with the letter a. So, a=100$/artwork, meaning one hundred dollars per artwork. Nice.", "Assume you know that, on average, you sell r=10 artworks in a month. You also have some fixed expenses due to color, brushes and so on. You spend precisely c=50$/month in painting material.", "How much will you earn in one year? You open your trusted Calculator App and digit", "where the time t is set to 12 months. However, this is only your expectation. You can\u2019t be sure to sell exactly r\u00d7t=120 artworks this year. Instead, the number of artworks sold each month will oscillate randomly around the average r.", "The following plot helps visualize the effect of randomness. Each green line is an independent random simulation that represents a plausible future trajectory of the net earnings. Until the end of the year, fluctuations can significantly build up and deviate from the expectation!", "Then, how to claim more than just the expected value?", "Under the assumption that the selling rate r doesn\u2019t change over time, it turns out that the number N(t) of artworks sold during some time t is distributed according to a Poisson distribution with mean value equal to r\u00d7t. Not surprisingly, the mean value r\u00d7t=120 is in agreement with the expected amount of sales, but now we know more. The knowledge of the exact distribution allows us to compute probabilities.", "More precisely, we would like to know the probability that, at time t, the net earnings E(t) will have grown bigger than a goal g. In math words, this probability can be compactly written as Prob(E(t)>g).", "We can now do some math and obtain", "That\u2019s the formula. We have shown that the probability to earn more than the goal g is precisely the same as thing as computing how likely the number of sold artworks N(t) gets bigger than (g+c \u00d7t)/a. This is readily obtained as the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of the Poisson distribution. How to get the numbers?", "In Julia, using the package Distributions :", "In Python, using the package scipy :", "First, let\u2019s have a sanity check. In the painter example, the probability to earn more than the expectation 11400$ turns out to be 47.6%. This makes sense, because the chance to sell more or less than 120 artworks is quite symmetric. (Note: if you are asking yourself why this number is not 50%, it\u2019s just because mean and median are not the same, in general).", "To have a better overview of the earning chances, it\u2019s possible to plot Prob(E(t)>g) as a function of the goal value g. For instance, there are about 90% chances to surpass net earnings of 10k$, but only 0.9% to exceed 14k$.", "It\u2019s interesting to watch the behaviour of the earning distribution while playing with price and average sales. For instance, by tuning the price a and the average sales r while keeping their product constant, it is immediate to realize that increasing the sales number has a stabilizing effect: the earning probability gets concentrated around the expectation. On the opposite, fewer sales at a higher price result in a more uncertain outcome.", "This fact is nothing but a consequence of the law of large numbers: the more random things you add up, the better you can characterize their sum. I actually like to think about this statement in reverse:", "the smaller the numbers, the more chance matters.", "This is true in both directions. You might perform poorly as well as hit the jackpot. It\u2019s just luck.", "Let\u2019s now consider the more common case of retailing several products, each at a given price. Building again on the example of the painter, for instance, we could imagine we sell three different types of artwork, depending on the size: small, medium and large canvas, at price 50$, 100$ and 200$ each, respectively.", "We assume again to sell on average r=10 artworks per month and to know the fraction in which canvas are typically sold. For example, 40% small, 40% medium and 20% large. Note that these numbers are such that the expectation is unchanged with respect to the one-product scenario. But what about the earning probability? Will it be significantly different now?", "In this specific case, it won\u2019t change much. The earning probability can be safely estimated again with the previous formula, just by setting a equal to the weighted average of the item prices (a=0.4\u00d750$+0.4\u00d7100$+0.2\u00d7200$).", "However, this works reliably as long as each item is sold \u201coften enough\u201d, so that there is no risk to be too close to the small-numbers uncertainty zone. The formula is especially accurate if the item prices are also not too different from each other, because the average is more representative.", "If this is not the case or if some items are sold rarely, it is important to derive a specific formula for this inventory scenario. This can be done by means of the thinning property of the Poisson process: selling more products at global rate r and respective fraction f(i) is mathematically equivalent to selling independently each item i at rate r(i)=r\u00d7f(i). The resulting formula would be anyway conceptually similar to what shown previously, just that one would need to sum the returns from all items when computing the net earnings E(t).", "Finally, let\u2019s explore the most interesting case here on Medium. How to compute the probability for your writing returns?", "The main complication is that we can\u2019t model the earnings from Medium stories as items of which we know the price beforehand. Instead, we could describe them in a probabilistic way too by introducing a return distribution.", "We essentially want to model the total Medium earnings as the sum of the random returns of the random amount of stories that will be published in a given period of time.", "The return distribution can be thought of as a continuous version of the price fraction mentioned previously. It describes with which probability a story you publish by will return a given amount of earnings. Clearly, such distribution is specific for each Medium writer, as it strongly depends on experience and popularity on Medium.", "To keep things simple, here I am going to describe post returns with an Exponential distribution, for two reasons. First, this applies well to many Medium writers: most of the post with modest returns, few slightly better, but nothing skyrocketing. Secondly, the Exponential distribution is simple because it has only one parameter, the average return per post. (Again, let\u2019s call it a.)", "In these settings, the total Medium earnings are described by a compound Poisson process with rate r\u00d7t and exponentially distributed summands. What does it mean concretely? To begin with, let\u2019s look at the mean value.", "For the considered compound process, the average total earnings are equal to a\u00d7r\u00d7t, with a standard deviation of a\u00d7sqrt(2\u00d7r\u00d7t). The standard deviation gives an idea of the size of fluctations: the earnings will fall with probability 68% in an interval of one standard deviation above and below the expectation, as a consequence of the central limit theorem. However, in order for the central limit theorem to work decently, the rule of thumb is to consider at least more than 20 total sales (i.e. Medium stories, in this context).", "For instance, if you publish a post per week and earn 25$ per post on average, in one year you expect to raise (1300\u00b1255)$ ( with t=52 weeks).", "In case you are specifically interested in the probability of reaching some goal, the painter\u2019s formula works fine also in this case, even if only as a proxy. The reason why it\u2019s still valid to use it is that the Exponential distribution is not too skewed, like the example of the canvas prices.", "Note, however, that the credibility of the obtained probability value depends on how well these modeling assumptions\u00a0are\u00a0met:", "You might want to give the formula a try. If instead, you do not like approximations, it is straightforward to compute Prob(E(t)>g) by direct simulation. This is also just one line of code.", "(P.S. Julia looks so much better and is insanely faster. I love Julia!)", "The code above is simply summing up a Poisson-distributed number of Exponential-distributed returns, several times. Then, the probability of exceeding the goal g is simply estimated as the fraction of simulations whose total earnings are greater than g.", "But is all this accuracy really necessary? But to be honest, probably not.", "The take-home message of probability theory applied to Medium simply confirms the everyday evidence: the most robust way to ensure your success on Medium is to increase your publishing rate and write good stuff. More a, more r, and both for a longer time t. In short, more art.", "Even if I am a math person, I do believe life is sometimes more enjoyable with fewer numbers and more words. So, good writing!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Physicist passionate about sustainability and applied probability.
