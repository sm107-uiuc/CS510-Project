I had a promising career in brain tumour research along with eight years of study under my belt, so why would I want to throw that all away?", "I completed my Health Sciences Degree and wasn\u2019t really sure what I wanted to do next. There was a new post graduate degree in Radiography on offer, unfortunately it was very popular and I didn\u2019t get in. This left me scrambling for a backup plan as the new year had already started. I reached out to my favourite undergraduate lecturer to see if there was any possibility for me to do an Honours Degree even though the program had already started.", "Normally that wouldn\u2019t have been possible. As luck would have it the department had a project they really wanted somebody for, but had no interest from students. So they made an exception and I started a Honours Degree in Anatomy and Pathology.", "Normally your supervisor is an expert in the area of your project, I broke new ground for the lab as the first brain tumour researcher.", "By the end of my honours year, I had only just started to get a glimmer of hope that my model simulating the disease could work.", "I didn\u2019t want to let the project beat me so I went on to do a PhD using the model. That might sound like a strange reason to commit to at least 3 years of study and research, but I think it might be more common than you think.", "It\u2019s almost like I became a neuroscientist by accident.", "In 2012 I completed my PhD in neuroscience, next step do a post doc overseas. I landed my first post doc at UCSF, a world leader in cancer research.", "So why wasn\u2019t I happy? Somehow I ended up working as a scientist without really thinking about what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.", "I started to doubt my suitability for a career in research and my boss was a bully. Data science seemed like it could be a good solution to my problems. This story is about my journey from research scientist to data scientist.", "During my post doc I was a brain tumour researcher at the Helen Diller Cancer Center at UCSF. Some of the best, most advanced cancer research in the world was being done there, it should have been my dream job. But I didn\u2019t want to be there anymore. I realised that I needed a change. There were many contributing factors that helped me reach that decision.", "Politics is present to some extent in any workplace, but I was surprised how much there is in science. I thought that somehow academics wouldn\u2019t want to bother themselves with office argy bargy, boy was I mistaken. Research scientists are just as competitive and insecure as people in any other industry, maybe more so. Spending all day with people who are the world\u2019s foremost expert in their very specific area of research is great for fostering imposter syndrome.", "There is not enough jobs or money to go around and so scientists have to compete with their colleagues for grants and authorship on publications. It does not foster a collaborative environment. It\u2019s more cut throat than collaborative. \u201cPublish or perish\u201d is the academic tagline.", "In the world of research science, especially in academia, things happen slowly. The work is repetitive and in the field of preclinical research that I was in, the soonest someone could possibly benefit from the work we were doing was probably about 10 years time.", "Unfortunately the best science does not always get the most money or recognition. That may sound like sour grapes on my part and there probably is an element of that, but I have seen plenty of bad science get rewarded with career progression and funding. I found this difficult to handle because it seems so unfair. But I guess life is often unfair.", "I am a terrible liar, I don\u2019t have the ability to make my results seem more exciting or important than they really are. To get funding you have to make your results seem ground breaking every time, even when they are not. That is the game that you need to play to be successful in research.", "Did I mention I was losing money working full time? Even though I was sharing a 1 bedroom apartment with my boyfriend, my salary wasn\u2019t enough to live on in San Francisco.", "The final straw in my breakup with brain tumour research was that one of my bosses was a real bully who micromanaged me and all of my colleagues.", "My week would often go like this\u2026", "On Monday I was the star of the lab. On Tuesday I would get crucified for some perceived shortcoming. Then on Wednesday it would be like nothing had ever happened on the previous two days. It was an emotional rollercoaster and I was always on edge to see what the day would bring. This anxiety over my bosses unpredictable reactions really took its toll.", "I knew it wasn\u2019t just in my head when my boss resorted to emotional blackmail. I told her that I was thinking about leaving the lab because I could no longer cope with the stress. Her response was:", "\u2018think about all your parents sacrificed to support you through your PhD, should you be really throwing all that away?\u2019", "In reality my parents had been encouraging me to quit for a long time because they could tell I was miserable.", "After leaving the lab, many of my lab mates talked about experiencing symptoms of post traumatic stress. Unfortunately through conversations with the university\u2019s union, I found out that our lab was not alone in our experience of working under a tyrant.", "I was working in the USA on a J1 visa which is a cultural exchange visa. Since I did not complete the program, when I quit my job I had to leave the country the following day. Thankfully Mexico was just a quick hop, skip and a jump across the boarder. I was able to re-enter the US on a tourist visa to pack up my apartment before going back home to Australia.", "After leaving academia I decided to explore becoming a data scientist. All the perks of working in tech sounded appealing. I knew that I would need to substantially increase my skills in multiple areas. The academic research I had done required me to generate my own datasets, I had only ever dealt with very small datasets.", "I had a good foundation in scientific method and experimental design, but I had never coded a day in my life and only had basic skills in statistical analysis.", "When I started, I didn\u2019t know what I didn\u2019t know. So to gain the expertise I needed, I took 6 months off work to learn to code and level up my understanding of statistics and machine learning.", "To do this I took many online coding, statistics and data science courses. The specifics of the courses I took and tools I used are covered in detail in one of my previous posts.", "I was very targeted in my approach to finding job openings. My boyfriend and I wanted to move back to San Francisco, so that narrowed down the companies I was looking at. There is such a concentration of tech companies in the bay area, so I still had plenty to choose from.", "I tried all the normal job search sites, but there was too much to sift through, so I used a more targeted approach. Health or biology companies were what I was looking for.", "Rock Health is a venture fund which invests in digital health companies. I found my best matches by looking through the list of health startups supported by Rock Health. I scoured their job board for positions that suited my skill level and had a mission that resonated with me.", "For each company, I did my homework and wrote a tailored cover letter telling them the specific reasons that I was interested in working there. I also tried to highlight my skills that would set me apart from other people applying for the job.", "I did all of my interviews on Skype and Google Hangouts. It was a strange and nerve racking experience to be interviewed remotely.", "One interview really sticks with me. The CTO who was interviewing me had a problem with his webcam, so all I could see while I was talking with him was his Skype profile picture. That would have been totally normal, except for the fact that his profile picture was Kermit the Frog. He made a timezone joke about me talking to him from the future. That was the moment I knew that I wanted to work there and I would fit in.", "One big advantage of interviewing remotely is that I didn\u2019t have to endure any whiteboard coding interviews. The practice of coding in front of people in interviews is one of my pet peeves. Not only because it makes me uncomfortable, but because that is not how you code in a job. However I do acknowledge that there is a distinction between white boarding architecture in a meeting versus writing actual code.", "I was tested on my programming skills. Some companies asked me to come up with SQL queries as we spoke, some got me to do pair programming in a google doc and others asked me to do a take home assignment. By far my preference is the take home assignment.", "Even though they took up more of my time, it seems to me that they most closely replicate how you actually work in a company. The take home assignments kill two birds with one stone, testing both programming and statistical analysis skills at the same time. I found it extremely helpful to get feedback from the interviewers who were marking my take home assignments.", "It\u2019s not standard practice for interviewers to provide feedback after an interview but I reached out to ask what I could have done better so that I could improve. Even when I was pretty sure about why I had not been successful, it was great to have it confirmed. When I followed up or asked at the end of the interview, all of the people I contacted were very open and provided me with plenty of valuable feedback.", "My problem solving skills were tested by several companies. Some more effectively than others.", "My favourite problem solving question was a real scenario the data science team had recently worked on. I talked through several approaches with my interviewer. The approach I settled on was the same as what the team ended up using. I found this so encouraging and was the first time that I truly thought \u2018I can do this!\u2019.", "In contrast, there were several companies that tested my problem solving ability using brain teasers. I really dislike this practice, it puts people on the spot and is not relevant to the job. I don\u2019t understand why interviewers waste time with questions that have nothing to do with the job. Some people think brain teasers let you see how people approach problem solving, those people are wrong.", "When interviewing I was very up front with the hiring panels about my limitations. I knew that I was extremely junior and would require mentoring and continued training on the job. This is not something that I tried to hide, but rather spoke to the interviewers about.", "I told them that I had only recently learned to code and analyse large data sets. However, I emphasised my ability to learn and to do it quickly. I told them that if they were looking for someone who was a seasoned data scientist who already knew all of the skills inside and out that I was probably not the right candidate. If they were looking for someone who could develop into the position, then I would be perfect \ud83d\ude09", "I am so glad that I made the transition from research scientist to data scientist. I have gone from a field where positions are scarce and the hours are long, to being in demand and treated much better. In addition, the amount of money I earn is substantially more.", "However, these were not the main things that made me happier when I became a data scientist.", "I have much better work life balance. The startup where I got my first data science job takes care of its employees. We had an unlimited vacation and sick days policy. In contrast, when I was a researcher it was not unusual for us to work all weekend or until 10pm at night in order to make experimental timeframes work.", "As a data scientist I feel like I can make a larger and faster positive impact on the world than as a brain tumour researcher. Even though my research was looking for ways to treat and prevent brain tumours, I felt like my impact on people was limited by the slow pace of translation of new therapies to human use. Rightly so, I wouldn\u2019t want people just trying out new drugs willy nilly. However it was frustrating to feel like the impact of my work was so delayed.", "When I became a data scientist, the products that I worked on could be in the hands of users within a matter of weeks. Since the mission of the company reflected my values it felt like I could make a real positive difference in people\u2019s lives. We could also test the impact of our work and get feedback from users.", "As a small healthcare startup, I liked the feeling that we were all working towards the same goal. Team members were always generous with giving each other credit for helping each other out. This contrasted with the competition that often occurred within the lab for authorship on papers.", "It may sound crazy, but now that I am a data scientist, I no longer have nightmares about accidentally giving myself cancer. The human cancer cells and harmful chemicals I used in the lab always caused a background level of anxiety that would often come out in very strange nightmares. Now that I do my work in front of a computer I sleep much easier.", "I have talked a lot about the difference between my new and old career, but there are also a lot of similarities between research science and data science. As the names suggest, science is the common factor.", "Problem solving is central to both and something that I have always found very satisfying. Good experimental design is also extremely important for research which is obvious, but it is also integral to getting the most out of data.", "Statistical analysis is more prominent in data science work but is also of vast importance as part of research science. In my opinion, the importance of appropriate statistical analysis is often brushed over in lab based research. Statistical methods are often chosen because they are \u2018how everyone else in the field does it\u2019 rather than because they are the methods most appropriate to the experiment. I think that more extensive statistical training should be implemented as part of research degrees.", "Additionally, there are many other transferrable skills between the two fields, which I will talk about further in a future post.", "I want to say a huge thank you to the hiring committee at Amino who took a chance on me as a very junior data scientist and allowed me to learn on the job. I am so happy in my new career and grateful for that first opportunity.", "In addition to data, my other passion is painting.
