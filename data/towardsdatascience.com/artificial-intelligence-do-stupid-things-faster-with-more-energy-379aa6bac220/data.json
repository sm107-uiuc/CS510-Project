Computers are the ultimate reliable workers. They do only what they are told. No more and no less. They don\u2019t think for themselves. They don\u2019t think at all! They don\u2019t want anything except what you told them to want. (In fact, neuroscientists talk about concepts like motivation \u2014 wanting \u2014 as a biological privilege. It makes no sense to say a machine really wants anything.) If you tell your computer to want to say \u201chello\u201d to the world a million times, you\u2019ll get no complaints.

Each of us takes a lifetime of effort to cultivate and no two of us get the same series of inputs from our environments.

(That said, if people are aligned like iron filings with a magnet, history shows that we become capable of some scary things.)", "Computer systems tend to follow much more simplistic incentive sets because these are dictated to them by the humans who build them.

(Or is there some extraterrestrial event I\u2019m not aware of?)", "Because it always comes from and is designed by people, all technology is an echo of the wishes of whoever built it. Sometimes that echo lingers for such a long time after the button press that it\u2019s easy to forget the role people played in making it. It always does what people built it to do\u2026 which is tragicomically often not the same thing as what they hoped they were building it to do.

It\u2019s a lever, and the more it scales the more of a lever it is. When levers become long enough to move the world, why aren\u2019t we demanding to know whether the people wielding them have the skills to do so responsibly?", "In past centuries, bad decision-makers were relatively self-limiting, so training people in decision skills wasn\u2019t taken all that seriously. Sure, you\u2019d start tutoring a royal from infancy, but why bother with the rest of the populace?", "Today, as computer systems scale to touch more lives, we\u2019re reminded all too often that your garden variety tech product manager was blessed with a much rosier childhood and hasn\u2019t done much by way of a speedy catch-up to prepare for their growing responsibilities in a technology-fueled world.", "Too much status, not enough craft.", "Worst of all are those leaders who see decision-making only as another way to thump their chests and exert status.

None of it was AI-specific.", "The trouble with ML/AI is that building it effectively and responsibly takes all the decision-making skill of scalable tech and then some. It is more of an amplifier of both decision intelligence and decision stupidity (I hope you\u2019ll agree that one of these sounds more palatable than the other).", "Think of it as a proliferation of magic lamps.", "When I think of machine learning and AI, I think of a proliferation of magic lamps. Forget humanoid robots \u2014 these technologies are far more powerful. Unlike traditional programming, they allow you to solve a problem even if you can\u2019t think up the solution\u2019s steps yourself.", "AI allows you to automate what you can\u2019t express.", "That\u2019s because they let you express your wishes with examples and objectives instead of explicit instructions, which means that you can automate beyond human expression.", "AI represents a fundamental leap in human progress\u2026 but do you remember the moral of every be-careful-what-you-wish-for story?", "It\u2019s not the genie that\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s the unskilled wisher.", "In those stories, it\u2019s not the genie that is dangerous.

If our species were granted enormous power, I\u2019d be much less afraid of Hollywood-caricature villains (aggravated psychopathy is blessedly rare) than teeming multitudes of well-meaning bumblers.", "Compared with traditional programming, ML/AI involves expressing what you want in a style that is closer to those magic lamp stories.", "At its heart, the ML/AI paradigm is a new way to communicate with machines. Compared with traditional programming (step-by-step instructions), ML/AI involves expressing what you want from the genie in a style that is closer to those magic lamp stories (objectives and examples).", "What happens when you put the power to communicate with data at scale in the hands of thoughtless communicators?", "The scary part of AI is not the robots. It\u2019s the people.", "An ML/AI system will either fail testing and deliver nothing (because your genie was so impotent that you sent the lamp back to the attic), or pass testing and will deliver exactly what the decision-maker wished for.

What if they made a foolish wish?", "Testing an ML/AI system protects you from an ineffective genie, not a foolish wisher.", "If you\u2019re harboring the following sentiment, be very afraid: \u201cI never do what the boss asked me to do, I do what the boss actually wants.\u201d", "What you\u2019re saying is that your boss does not know how to wish responsibly. Putting them in charge of a ML/AI project is a disaster waiting to happen. Instead, they need training or to be put somewhere safe (and padded?) where they can\u2019t do any damage. Take your eye off them for a moment and they\u2019ll have asked an AI system to make as many paperclips as possible.", "We need to work harder than ever to ensure that whoever is involved in the decision role has the skills to wish responsibly.", "The wisher who is perhaps most dangerous of all is the one whose wishes have unintended consequences that escape flimsy safety nets. Even if a wisher has the best of intentions, they\u2019re a hazard if they aren\u2019t able to fully think through what they are asking for, so that the spirit of the wish matches its letter. With great power comes great responsibility\u2026 to use that power intelligently. That takes skill, not just good intentions. But how do you build responsible wishing skills for the AI era? By investing the time and seeking them out.", "Technologies that scale are like ever-lengthening levers, and we mustn\u2019t forget that there\u2019s a human decision-maker on the end of those levers.", "Powerful technologies that scale are getting easier and easier to use, so it\u2019s more vital than ever to recognize just how much of the human element they have baked into them.", "If you\u2019re in the habit of blaming lifeless objects, you\u2019re not helping here. Open your eyes to the people behind the machines.", "If you want to worry about something when it comes to AI, don\u2019t worry about personhood or robots. Worry about scale, speed, reach, and longevity. The more a tool\u2019s effect scales, the more careful you need to be with it. The more people your decisions can affect, the larger your duty.", "If you ask me whether I\u2019m scared of AI, what I hear you asking me is whether I am scared of human negligence.", "If you ask me whether I\u2019m scared of AI, what I hear you asking me is whether I am scared of human negligence. That\u2019s the only way the question makes sense to me. My answer? No. I\u2019m optimistic about our AI future. I believe that people can learn to build safe and effective systems responsibly, driving progress and making life better for those around them.", "This isn\u2019t about IQ, it\u2019s about stepping up and choosing to build some new mental muscles.

(\u201cYou\u2019re going how fast?! With other people around? How does anyone survive?\u201d) Somehow, most of us manage to acquire safe driving skills\u2026 despite clearly having no idea how to walk properly. (Why yes, I do live in New York \u2014 what gave it away?)", "Similarly, I\u2019m convinced that you can develop your decision skills if you\u2019re intentional about it. These things can be taught. That\u2019s why I (and others like me) choose to step up and contribute to training a new breed of leader skilled in decision intelligence.", "If we teach people how to build magic lamps, we must also teach the skills for wishing responsibly. Otherwise, huge scale will bring huge problems.", "Decision intelligence is a new academic discipline concerned with all aspects of selecting between options. As a movement, it is built on the realization that if we teach people how to build magic lamps, we must also teach the skills for wishing responsibly. Otherwise, huge scale will bring huge problems.", "If your team lacks the skills to wish responsibly at the beginning of your project, there\u2019s no point in all that beautiful engineering \u2014 it will only deliver poisonous rubbish in the end. On the other hand, if we train skilled leaders, then humanity can enjoy unprecedented ease and plenty. In the hands of competent decision-makers, scalable technology can help us solve some of the biggest problems facing our species.", "We\u2019ve spent too long stuck solving problems with simple solutions \u2014 simple in the sense that we can wrap our heads around them. Simple won\u2019t cut it for all problems, so it\u2019s time to add complex solutions to our repertoire.
