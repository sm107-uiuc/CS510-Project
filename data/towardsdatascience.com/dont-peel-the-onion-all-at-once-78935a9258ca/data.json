During our talk, Ben asked many interesting questions, that\u2019s why I decided to summarize our conversation in a blog post.", "Welcome to Profitable Python. I\u2019m Ben McNeill, and today we talk to Alexey Grigorev.", "Alexey lives in Berlin with his wife and son. He\u2019s a software engineer with a focus on machine learning. He works at OLX Group as a Lead Data Scientist. Alexey is a Kaggle master and he wrote a couple of books. One of them is \u201cMastering Java for Data Science\u201d and now he\u2019s working on another one \u2014 \u201cMachine Learning Bookcamp\u201d. That\u2019s not a typo, it\u2019s called \u201cBookcamp\u201d.", "Hi Ben, it\u2019s a pleasure to be here.", "Glad to have you. Can you tell me more about the book you\u2019re working on?", "Yes! The idea is to learn machine learning by doing projects. Every chapter is a new project: you get a dataset, prepare it and build a model. We also look inside each model and see how it makes predictions and try to understand it. It\u2019s pretty hands-on and we keep the theory to a minimum. It\u2019s not always possible to completely avoid it, that\u2019s why there are still formulas here and there, but the focus is on coding.", "The target reader is somebody who can already code, like a software engineer, or a student who already has experience in coding. As you go through the book, you build a portfolio of projects, and in the end, you know enough to get a job as an ML engineer and continue learning at work.", "The book is still in progress, but it\u2019s already possible to have a look inside and decide if you like it or not. There are already three chapters and one appendix. In total, there will be ten chapters, so it\u2019s 30% ready now.", "What triggered your idea for writing this book?", "I wrote another book some time ago \u2014 it was about Java for data science. I really liked it, but it turned out to be a pretty niche topic: Java is not that popular for ML. Today, if you want to do ML, you use Python, not Java. So, I thought, I still have things that I want to share with the world, but the world is not interested in Java, so let\u2019s write another book \u2014 this time using Python.", "The idea of learning by doing projects is something I picked up from Kaggle \u2014 this is a website for hosting data science competitions. At Kaggle, a company prepares a dataset and then ask the community to train the best possible model for them.", "Only on Kaggle I really learned ML. I had spent years at university learning theory, but it was not helpful without proper practice. And, to be honest, that theory wasn\u2019t really needed for competitions \u2014 participating is a very hands-on activity which requires a lot of coding: you generate new features, throw them in a library, tweak the parameters, see the results, and keep repeating till the competition is over.", "This made me realize that the best way of learning ML is not studying it, but doing it: each Kaggle competition is a project, and by doing these projects I was able to actually learn ML. To me, it was more helpful than watching how equations are solved on a blackboard.", "That\u2019s why I think that the project-based approach is the best way for software engineers and other people who can code. That\u2019s why I decided to write this book.", "Cool. I\u2019m excited to see how that progresses. Can you tell us about your background and how you became a machine learning expert?", "I\u2019m originally from a small city from the Far East of Russia. There\u2019s a small university in my city and the things I studied were a bit outdated: I was learning to use Delphi and things like that. In 2006, it was all that organizations in my region needed. Yet, we learned some fundamental things like databases and automating business processes.", "That was fun, but the subjects I really enjoyed were math and stats. Unfortunately, there was no way to apply these skills: everybody just needed a database.", "Eventually, I moved to a bigger city in central Russia. Companies there didn\u2019t need Delphi, they needed Java and they needed web services. So I switched my focus to Java and worked as a Java developer for a while.", "In 2012 Coursera became popular. One of the courses there was machine learning. I happened to watch that course and it changed my life: Java and databases were fun, but ML got me, so I decided to go that way.", "Around that time, data science positions also started to appear on the market, even though in small numbers. Back then I lived in Krakow, Poland, and there were a couple of open positions, but all of them required a PhD and five years of Hadoop experience. The companies didn\u2019t understand what they wanted to get from data science, they just heard about ML and thought, \u201clet\u2019s hire somebody with a PhD and let them figure out what we want\u201d.", "It was a difficult time to switch from Java to data science. That\u2019s why I decided to get some additional education and do a master\u2019s.", "After graduating I suddenly discovered that companies didn\u2019t need a PhD anymore. The market figured out what they needed from data scientists. They understood that a PhD is a nice to have, but not a must. And since then the demand for data science and ML has been only growing.", "When I started working as a full-time data scientist, I found out that having a background in software engineering is very helpful. Only training a model is not enough, you need to go to production, and this is something many data scientists struggle with. They know how to read papers and implement algorithms from these papers, but going to production is a different thing. That\u2019s why having some exposure to software engineering is helpful for data scientists to make use of their models and solve business problems faster.", "I also noticed that many companies saw that and started looking for these kinds of people \u2014 software engineers who know ML, maybe not in-depth, but enough to actually train a model and then make a business impact.", "That\u2019s interesting, and a little counterintuitive.", "Yes. I tried to go deep into math, but in the end, it wasn\u2019t needed. Even though it\u2019s fun to study it, the job I and many of my colleagues are doing is different. We don\u2019t solve math equations. We spend months preparing a dataset, then take a library, wait for ten minutes for training to finish, get a model, and then again spend months on productionizing the model.", "The part of training a model doesn\u2019t take a lot of time, yet the focus of many programs at universities and many online courses is on the mathematics behind ML. Yes, it\u2019s still needed: as a data scientist, you sometimes need to understand what\u2019s going on inside the libraries \u2014 to the same extent that a software engineer needs to know how TCP/IP works. However, not many software engineers need to go deep down the network stack daily. Maybe once in five years, when there\u2019s a problem, but day-to-day work typically doesn\u2019t require that.", "So, you just need to have broad knowledge and good exposure to different techniques. Knowing the details is good, but not always necessary. All you need is the foundations \u2014 to be able to notice if things aren\u2019t right. But when you face a problem, then you need to go deeper.", "I did it the other way around and tried to understand everything in advance. Instead, I should have focused on hands-on skills, and dig deep when it\u2019s required.", "I noticed that on your CV you mention \u201crapid prototyping skills\u201d. How do you use them?", "For software engineering projects, especially for ML, it\u2019s important to validate ideas as fast as possible.", "Often you can validate an idea without even coding anything.", "Imagine that we want to build a system that determines if an image is good or not: it\u2019s properly framed, in focus and has good light exposure. Instead of investing time in a model, we ourselves can just look at the pictures and decide if the quality is good or not. If it\u2019s not, then we send emails to the sellers and see how they react. If their reaction is positive and it\u2019s something they need, then we invest time into building an actual model.", "When it comes to prototyping, you can quickly build something, e.g. a simple Flask app in Python that initially might not even follow the best engineering standards. The focus is on speed because you want to validate the idea first before investing time into it. Then you present this to the users, or the stakeholders within the company, and see if they\u2019re interested in this project.", "Moving fast also means failing fast and learning fast: often the decision-makers would say \u201cthis is not what we meant, we don\u2019t need this thing\u201d. It\u2019s very good to learn feedback early: spending half a year only to find out the project is not needed is quite frustrating.", "How to become an expert at rapid prototyping?", "Time-frame your task. Let\u2019s say, give it only five days, and then do as much as possible during these days. Move fast, but don\u2019t let it take more time than planned.", "If you only have one week, then you start thinking about the most important thing to focus on. Then within a week, you have a working system and demo it.", "How without much effort convince somebody to hire you as a machine learning professional?", "Well, first of all, buy my book (laughs).", "However, to get a job, you may also need to get noticed. If you have an idea, find or collect a dataset, implement this idea and train a model. Don\u2019t stop at that yet. Put the code on GitHub, write a blog post about it and share it on social media. If you do this for ten projects \u2014 you\u2019ll get noticed for sure.", "What machine learning newcomers should avoid?", "In the beginning, try to avoid getting too deep into theory. For example, there are some algorithms, like SVM, that require a strong mathematical foundation to understand them: two years of calculus and then a year of convex optimization on top of that. This is quite serious, and you might think, \u201cI don\u2019t understand anything, so I\u2019m quitting\u201d. And people give up. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t let these equations scare you.", "The ML libraries hide this complexity. You can use them without being afraid of what\u2019s inside \u2014 just like a software engineer can create a web service without knowing how TCP/IP works. Of course, knowing the foundations is important, but as a newcomer, you should focus on learning fast rather than going deep.", "So stay at the right level of abstraction \u2014 for a beginner that might be a library that you treat as a black box. When you need, then go deeper. Don\u2019t try to peel the onion all at once.", "What are the key learnings from running ML models in production?", "Go as fast as possible. Try to deploy a model as quickly as possible. One of the most common reasons for project failures is spending too much time on making the perfect model. Don\u2019t. Start with a simple baseline, then try to deploy it \u2014 and go with it to production and see how people react to it.", "Don\u2019t make it overly complex. For example, if you want to build a price suggestion model, start with the average price per category. In the case of a car, it can be as simple as the average per make and model. Don\u2019t start with a neural network or something equally complex.", "If you invest a lot of time in a system, it\u2019s hard to let it go. It\u2019s known as the IKEA effect: if you build something yourself, you love it, even if for others it\u2019s nothing special. Imagine you\u2019re building a chair, you spend three hours building it and you finally made it \u2014 it\u2019s not falling apart and you can sit on it. You love this chair, but for others, it may look pretty ugly. The same thing happens with software: if people build something for a long time, they have trouble letting it go.", "I have this problem, so realizing the problem is already helpful. At some point, it doesn\u2019t make sense to continue working on a project and you just need to stop.", "But if at the beginning you spend only one week and it doesn\u2019t solve the problem \u2014 you stop working on it. You learn from the feedback early and move on.", "\u201cMath is not as important as you think, but solving business problems is more important than it seems\u201d. If your program is just a bunch of \u201cif\u201d statements, but it solves a problem \u2014 it\u2019s good. So start with simple heuristics, and if you see that it\u2019s helpful, move on to do more complex things.", "How do you decide what speaking opportunities to take on?", "I will take on pretty much anything because I don\u2019t have that many speaking opportunities at the moment. I\u2019m still learning how to make my proposals sound exciting, so the conference organizers accept them and let me speak at their events.", "Follow me on Twitter (@Al_Grigor) and LinkedIn (agrigorev).", "Alexey, thank you so much for coming on the show.", "Thank you for having me. I enjoyed talking to you.", "Yeah, this was fun. Peace out, folks.", "Thank you for reading it. If you liked the article, you can listen to the entire episode on profitablepython.fm.
