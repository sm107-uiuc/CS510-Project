In this article, I do not present any projection models, but instead focus on presenting the data in a meaningful way intended to draw evidence-based judgement of how the novel corona virus infection is spreading in different geographical areas. Although there is clear sign that official numbers are grossly under-reported, this codebase intends to democratize official data and analysis toolkit on COVID-19 trends.", "The data is presented in geo-scatter animation of reported cases of COVID-19 across various countries and time-series plots to compare the spread rates across various geographical regions. Also particular focus is given to spread rates across USA. With the general principle of adhering to answering only \u201cwhat does data say?\u201d I limit my analysis based on reported cases of only. There are three type of reporting of COVID-19 cases with John Hopkins University\u2019s report and they are 1) confirmed infection, 2) deaths reported, 3) reported recovery.", "Color of bubble representing % increase of infected people in 3 days as a measure of spread rate.", "Corona virus like any infectious disease initially spread in a given population with exponential growth rate. This means daily increase of new infection is proportional to the number of infected people in a given population. A good metric to measure how fast COVID-19 is spreading is the number of days it takes to multiply the count of infected people. In this section the number of people affected due to corona virus is presented using logarithmic scale in the time-series plot ordinate. In plot abscissa, number of days from first 500 reported cases is presented. Saturation point is generally reached when virus runs out of finding new people to infect, then the time-series ordinate tends to \u2018flatten\u2019 out in logarithmic scale.", "The top three subplots presents per-country data of confirmed cases (left), deaths (middle) and reported recovery (right). The bottom three subplots presents the same metric for individual US states. Only countries with more than 10000 confirmed cases (except for South Korea) and US states with at least 5000 confirmed cases as of April 3, 2020 are presented in these plots.", "Not all countries follow same trajectory in the logarithmic plots presented above. Factors that influence these trajectory are a) availability of testing, b) population density and c) policy measures taken.", "Austria, Belgium and Netherlands took 16 to 18 days to report 10k cases, while USA, China, Italy, Germany and Spain took between 9 to 12 day mark to get to 10k confirmed cases. USA and Turkey showing sudden increase of reported cases in about 11th day mark. This may be due to increased campaign on testing for corona virus. Canada and Belgium\u2019s cases are still emerging. Based on the plots France, UK, Italy and Germany are in the trajectory to take ~30\u201335 days to report 100k cases. Italy\u2019s trajectory of confirmed cases is already showing ample evidence of flattening out by ~40 day mark. Spain currently have higher spread rate than Italy, but also showing some preliminary sign of slowing the spread-rate. USA is on a trajectory that is different from any other nation and showing little to no evidence of flattening the curve yet.", "Germany, Switzerland, Canada and Austria so far have done very well in limiting the rate of increase of deaths from COVID-19. On the other hand, USA showing no evidence of slowing the curve of COVID-19 deaths.", "Within USA, there is large state-wise variations in spread rates. Spread rates in New York and New Jersey are the highest, while Washington is on a very different trajectory of lower spread rate. It took 7 days for New York to report first 10k cases, while Washington may take more than 25 days for the similar increase from first 500 state-wide cases. Among other states, California, Georgia and Texas can be grouped together which has or in their way to report 10k cases in ~16\u201318 day mark.", "Intellectually curious audience can re-analyze and re-plot figures presented in this article using the Google Colaboraty platform and the code is also published in a GitHub gist.", "Plot COVID-19 time series data per country and per USA state basis with", "Plot these variables in log scale to highlight exponential growth in pandemic against days since initial outbreak.", "In this geoscatter animation image below, the bubble size represents the reported number of cases with COVID-19.
