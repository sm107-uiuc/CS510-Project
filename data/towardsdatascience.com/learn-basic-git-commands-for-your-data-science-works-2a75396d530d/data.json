The version control system helps developers to contribute to the open-source projects and check the version of codes. The git is developed by Linus Torvald, the Linux founder as a tool to help Linux developers develop and maintain the codes. So, git is the second project of Linus Torvald to support the main project, Linux.", "The above illustration clearly explains to us the functionality of git as a versioning tool. It lets us work with a single file instead of many files with their own version. Working with basic versioning (many files) tends to be untrackable and unstructured. We can not track our revision as well. But, using git, any revision or changes will be recorded on the git system and as users, we can move back to a certain version of files as we want to. From git logs, we can track the revision in our works, from the beginning.", "As the collaboration tool, git moves basic collaboration ways like using email, SMS, chat, etc to the collaborated system. Basic collaboration tends to be not integrated, misunderstanding, bad logs, and Inefficient for a big project with a lot of people working in it.", "Git is designed for text-based data, for instance codes, books, papers, article, etc", "Many companies and open-source projects are using version control systems to manage their project, like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, LinkedIn, and others. So, this is why we need to learn the basic git commands for our future work and career in a tech company.", "It seems easy to install git on your computer. But it depends on your operating system as well. For Windows users, you might need to head over to git official site to download it. Luckily, for Linux user, just open our favorite terminal and run the script as follow:", "After the installation, everything would be okay. Check our git version with the following command.", "For the first step, before talking deeper about git and its environment, we need to configure our git. We provide a username and email to it.", "For our first touch with git, let\u2019s create a directory, for instance, git-stk in my case, and move into that directory. Then, begin our practice with git init. Important to note that git status will print the status on our works like are there any changes in the directory or files. As long as we didn't do any changes, the command git status will print no commits yet.", "So, what does git init means? Simply, this command will create a .git folder that contains several folders and files, like hooks, info, objects, refs, config, description, and HEAD in order to track our work. The logs of our changes will be recorded there.", "To interact with git commands, let\u2019s create a new markdown file, namely README.md that is filled with the sentence \u201cFirst line of README.md file\u201d.", "Let\u2019s check the current status with git status command. It prints with red marks indicating that we have done any changes to folders or files within the git-stk. It also means that our changes are not marked yet. We are in the modified state in the git lifecycle.", "To mark our change in file README.md, run git add command. To look up the differences of status between modified and staged states, just run git status again. The green mark indicates that our changes have been marked and now we are in the staged state.", "Our README.md file has been marked but has not been recorded yet. Record our changes like when we were working on Microsoft Word or other tools with git commit which is followed by the commit messages.", "So far, we have conducted experiments within a git environment and assigned git commands. But now, we will look deeper into the git lifecycle. What we did before is what we see in the git lifecycle. The git lifecycle is divided into four states namely:", "Can you imagine if we did some mistakes within our folders? Can we just move backwards to our last commit or two last commits? The answer is of course we can. Git keeps our changes (commits) and we can go anywhere if it is necessary for our work. Okay, here is the new git command you must know: git log. We will record our entire commits, so we might easily track our works or commits.", "On the previous commit, we created a file namely README.md. Now, we will modify that file and inspect its logs using the git logs command. First, add our README.md file with the sentence \u201cSecond line of README.md file\u201d and then commit it. Just follow and run the scripts based on the following figure.", "Check out the status until it prints \u201cNothing to commit\u201d. It means that we have committed all of our changes. Okay, to track our works (commits), we just run git log and it will print the author (username and email), date-time of changes, messages, and SHA.", "We must add commit messages as clear and simple as possible because it will help us to track our works", "One of the must-to-know commands on git is git diff. It helps us to compare commits on branches, specific files, or an entire directory. For instance, we will compare our two commits.", "The pattern is git diff <SHA-before> <SHA-after>. Input <SHA-before> and <SHA-after> with SHA of our commits.", "According to the output, we get information about the differences between our first commit and second commit on the README.md file. It is useful, right?", "As a human, we\u2019re not perfect, right? Sometimes we get mistakes that impact other things. It applies to tech companies too, for instance as a data science team, we are developing new features for our machine learning flows. But found a bug. We must trace back from the beginning of works, looking into line per line of codes. Git simplifies our work with the move backward feature. Instead of looking from the beginning of works, we can track based on the previous commit before a bug was found.", "There are three commands to move back on git. It is used for our needs.", "We can call the git checkout command to check the file condition at each commit. To return from the past use the command git checkout master", "When we decide to use git reset, there are three options we can select. It depends on our problem and which states we want to go to. Let\u2019s check them out and try them on your computer!", "The git reflog is used to recover project history. We\u2019re probably familiar with the git log command, which shows a list of commits. The git reflog is similar, but instead shows a list of times when HEAD changed.", "Let\u2019s modify our README.md file again to show us the git checkout command. We just add a new line with \u201cThird line of README.md file\u201d. After that, like in the previous step, add it into the committed state.", "Remember that we have restored our file with git reset and it removed our last commit. Then, using git checkout, we will check the file condition at each commit.", "Remember: Until this step, we just have three commits", "To check our first commit, we use the HEAD pointer. Follow the instruction to understand what does git checkout HEAD mean. It helps us track our content in the README.md file each commit, are there any changes? What kind of changes?", "To understand the functionality of tilde (~) and caret (^) on HEAD, please look at the following figure. It lets us go to every commit on every branch in our works.", "When talking about git as a versioning tool, we just talk about how git helps us keep the version of our files. But, now we will talk git as a collaboration tool.", "The default branch name in Git is master", "When developing new features on our codes, it is recommended to create a new branch. Let the master branch as our main code. If our features are already done and there is no bug found, just merge with the master branch.", "In this case, we will create a new branch namely new_branch that adds two new lines to the README.md file.", "The git checkout command is also used to move and create branches", "Add a modification to the committed state on the new_branch branch and return to the master branch. Check the README.md file. Our modification on new_branch is not applied to the master because we worked on a different branch. It keeps our main codes clean and safe.", "Look at git logs and now you will find a new branch on the red mark. Yeah, this indicates there are any commits on another branch.", "We just created a new branch and commits to it. Now, we must merge that branch to the master and clean any conflicts.", "When we are working with a team, we must have many branches with its features. Our next task is to merge these branches and manage conflict within it. It is helped by git merge command. When files on the master are selected as the main file or code, we must merge another branch to the master. So we need to go to master! If our codes conflict, as the main developer or project leader, it is our task to choose whether codes are removed or added to the master.", "The two branch codes are separated by ======", "After our merging is done properly, just check out the git logs. Voila! We have merged the new_branch to the master. Our master is clean now! This is the simple task of merging on git.", "Show what revision and author last modified each line of a file, we can use git blame command.", "After talking a lot about git as versioning tools next, we talk git as collaboration tools via the remote repository. There are many platforms providing services to collaborate our scripts with people or our team, for instance, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc. For this tutorial, we use GitHub. So you might need to register your account and follow the instructions!", "Please log in to the GitHub page and create a new repository. Choose your own repo name and click create a repository to create the new one.", "Our aim is to upload our local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. So, after the new repository is created, we can copy our remote repository link (via SSH or HTTPS) to the terminal and run git remote add command. It will create a new connection to a remote repository.", "Run git push to upload our local repository to a remote repository. This command takes two argument <remote-name> <branch-name> .", "We are here right now, coders! To summarize our tutorial, the friendly developer just creates a simple cheat sheet to help us understand the basic git commands we have already learned. Learn more about the git cheat sheet!", "You might want to get the resume of this basic git tutorial, just visit my GitHub page https://audhiaprilliant.github.io/git-version-control-system/.
