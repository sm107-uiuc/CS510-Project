AutoML Vision means training your own custom machine learning models by uploading images and train the models with AutoML Vision. As for Vision API, is an API offered by Google with pre-trained models, which could be easily used on the product you\u2019re building. And today we\u2019re going to introduce Vision API.", "Before we get started, I would like to give you a basic concept about what is cloud Vision API? And what it could do?", "Google Cloud\u2019s Vision API offers powerful pre-trained machine learning models through REST and RPC APIs. Assign labels to images and quickly classify them into millions of predefined categories. Detect objects and faces, read printed and handwritten text, and build valuable metadata into your image catalog.", "Click the link above and give the cloud Vision API a try by yourself. You could see what it could detect and what kind of JSON response it would return by this website.", "We are going to put some images into the Google cloud vision website and see what happens.", "Face Detection detects multiple faces within an image along with the associated key facial attributes such as emotional state or wearing headwear. Facial Recognition is not supported.", "The API will give you the landmark of the face(the green dots and area on the actors\u2019 face), and each dots correspond to the JSON response:", "Further, it will also analyze their emotional state like Joy, Sorrow, Anger, and so on.", "Object Localization can detect and extract multiple objects in an image.", "Object localization identifies multiple objects in an image and provides a LocalizedObjectAnnotation for each object in the image.", "Label Detection detects broad sets of categories within an image, which range from modes of transportation to animals.", "Web Detection detects Web references to an image.", "Text Detection performs Optical Character Recognition. It detects and extracts text within an image with support for a broad range of languages. It also features automatic language identification.", "I try to put multiple languages in one image. It seems there\u2019s room for improvement.", "The Image Properties feature detects general attributes of the image, such as dominant color.", "Crop Hints suggests vertices for a crop region on an image.", "The JSON response is something like below.", "Another sample, we can see the original image is a cat image.", "And here is the cropped image.", "Personally, it would a good tool to crop the image without cutting the most important thing like face. But if the image contains many faces like the Avengers sample, it is not able to have all the faces in the cropped image.", "Safe Search Detection detects explicit content such as adult content or violent content within an image. This feature uses five categories (\u201cadult\u201d, \u201cspoof\u201d, \u201cmedical\u201d, \u201cviolence\u201d, and \u201cracy\u201d) and returns the likelihood that each is present in a given image. See the SafeSearchAnnotation page for details on these fields.", "This could be a good solution for filtering any inappropriate content on the internet or UGC(User-generated content). The best example is Google search, which will filter the bad content automatically when you google.", "Landmark Detection detects popular natural and man-made structures within an image.", "The API responses not only the attractions\u2019 name but also the Lat and Lng of the location.", "Logo Detection detects popular product logos within an image.", "Okay, now we all know what Vision API could achieve. Next, we\u2019re going to learn with the ML Study Jam to know how to create a Vision API request and calling the API with curl.", "2. In the dialog box that opens, click START CLOUD SHELL:", "3. Wait a few moments to provision and connect to the environment. Then you will see the project is set to your PROJECT_ID.", "Since we\u2019ll use curl to send a request with an API key to Vision API, we need to create an API key and export it as an environment variable.", "Copy your API key and execute the following command in the shell.", "There are two ways to send an image to the Vision API for image detection: by sending the API a base64 encoded image string, or passing it the URL of a file stored in Google Cloud Storage. We\u2019ll be using a Cloud Storage URL.", "To save images on Google Cloud Storage, we need to create a bucket first.", "After creating the bucket, upload an image to it. And then modify the image\u2019s permission to allUsers for Vision API could access it.", "Create a request.json file as a request to be sent to Vision API. The gcsImageUri should be replaced with the image URL we just created in the previous step. And we could add all the types we want to detect to the features, including FACE_DETECTION, LANDMARK_DETECTION, OBJECT_LOCALIZATION, WEB_DETECTION, DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION, IMAGE_PROPERTIES, SAFE_SEARCH_DETECTION, CROP_HINTS.", "Finally, call the Vision API with curl:", "The response should be like this:", "description with the name of the item.", "score, a number from 0 - 100 indicating how confident it is that the description matches what's in the image.", "mid value that maps to the item's mid in Google's Knowledge Graph. You can use the mid when calling the Knowledge Graph API to get more information on the item.", "Official Website Vision AIOfficial Website all samples", "This is another major thing the company or developer may consider. I post the pricing image here for reference.", "This is a website for identifying Shiba Inu and Akita dog. It is an example of how to train your model with AutoML model and implement it on the product. It is just for fun, enjoy it.", "In conclusion, the Vision API is really a good tool to help us to simply handle image analytics. For many developers, it offers an entry point to access the professional field. Image analytics is not quite a difficult thing anymore. There could be lots of implementation with Vision API, including entertainment, education, medical science, and so on. I am really looking forward to the creative products in the future!", "Your home for data science.
