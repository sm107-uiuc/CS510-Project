For applications, DEVOPS \u2014 a set of capabilities, tools, and automated procedures \u2014 have helped to manage this complexity, which has resulted in dramatic increases in delivery speed for enterprises.", "However, the path to production for AI/ML models imposes several additional challenges that go beyond the capability of most enterprise DEVOPS environments. In fact, the impact of these challenges is rather significant: a study by MIT Sloan and BCG highlighted only 5% of companies were extensively utilizing models in their business. Getting a model into production is proving to be a difficult journey.", "Clearly the most difficult part about AI/ML happens after the model is actually created. The root of this issue is based upon a mistaken belief that because models and applications are \u201cjust\u201d software code that they can be managed in a similar way. Rather, enterprise DEVOPS capabilities must adapt to accomodate the needs of the AI/ML lifecycle.", "Enterprise applications are typically self-contained units with codified logic that act in a consistent and deterministic fashion independent of the data upon which they act. On the other hand, a model will react consistently in production only in response to data that has a similar pattern to that with which it was trained.", "If the patterns in data \u201cdrift\u201d significantly in production, then the model\u2019s response to that data may have significant unexpected and potentially negative consequences. When a model\u2019s efficacy declines due to data drift then there is only one response: re-train and re-deploy the model as soon as possible.", "This need for more frequent and perhaps on-demand release cycles will force enterprise DEVOPS to adapt to a new level of speed and agility required by the AI/ML lifecycle.", "AI/ML development uses many similar tools to traditional application development \u2014 for example, editors, source code management \u2014 but the languages, supporting libraries, and frameworks used to create models may be foreign to the typically enterprise IT group.", "In addition, where enterprise have invested in an analytics capability, it has largely focused on more traditional business intelligence tools or proprietary analytics capabilities (for example, SAS), however, the new AI/ML tools and frameworks are largely open source (TensorFlow/Keras, for example). While not necessarily a large impediment, nevertheless new tools, libraries, and frameworks must be introduced into the enterprise DEVOPS capability.", "At the \u201ccode\u201d level, models are algorithms that seek to identify patterns in data. These models are trained on vast amounts of data and require a computational footprint that is different and much larger than what may be available in most enterprises.", "Establishing the necessary infrastructure (GPU farms, for example) internally within an enterprise has proven to be difficult, costly, and time consuming and has become an impediment to model delivery within many enterprises. These barriers have driven many enterprises to consider migrating model development and training to the cloud. However, while cloud providers clearly have the necessary scalable computational footprint, the migration of training data to the cloud imposes significant data security challenges.", "Today, only a few segments of industry (for example, financial services, healthcare that have PII or HIPAA) are impacted by strict data regulations, however, in the future, security considerations will most definitely become a priority concern in most enterprises. In fact, the European Union, the largest single market in the world, recently created General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which strictly governs data privacy.", "And even Facebook, as highlighted in a recent article by Facebook\u2019s chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, is making a compelling case for much more expansive and stronger data privacy and protection regulation.", "Clearly, data privacy and protection will soon impact and dramatically influence an enterprise\u2019s data management and DEVOPS capabilities. So, the key question is: how do DEVOPS capabilities evolve to meet critical data privacy, protection, and security required for AI/ML model development?", "With AI/ML adoption clearly accelerating within the enterprise the traditional DEVOPS process must change to accommodate: (a) new tools and frameworks, most of which are open source, (b) migration of AI/ML workload to the cloud from internal data centers, and, (c) evolving security policies and techniques to govern data access rights required as enterprise AI/ML workload migrates to the cloud.", "The objective of AI/ML Governance is to ensure that evidence is provided to prove that a model and its delivery process can generate results that are reproducible, traceable, and verifiable.", "Today, many industries including banking, health care, biotech, and many parts of government already have these regulatory requirements, however, few would debate the benefits of having a disciplined AI/ML lifecycle that provides reproducible, traceable, and verifiable results. (For more information on this topic, see my AI/ML Governance article).", "The implications of providing these capabilities impose their own challenges: reproducibility requires maintaining not just the model source code but also a permanent association with the files used to train the model; traceability requires maintaining the association between the model and its training files to the original data files as well as any transformation scripts used to create the training files; and verifiability demands that output generated by the model lifecycle \u2014 for example, training verification logs, or output from model testing that demonstrates ethical/bias validation \u2014 also must be archived and linked to a model.", "The majority of traditional enterprise applications will increasingly require the depth and breadth of artifact and metrics capture to the degree needed by AI/ML. Enterprise DEVOPS must be extended to support requirements imposed by AI/ML to address model reproducibility, traceability, and verifiability.", "Models are different from traditional applications, and that imposes new challenges for an enterprise DEVOPS capability: a model\u2019s dependency on data drives increased DEVOPS velocity; new tools, increased security constraints, and integration of cloud capability impose new requirements upon an enterprise\u2019s DEVOPS process; and new levels of governance required for models to ensure reproducibility, traceability, and verifiability require a new depth and breadth of model lifecycle artifact and metrics capture.", "These challenges are not insurmountable, but they must be planned for. In many respects, enterprise DEVOPS must be considered a starting point that must be extended for scalable and agile AI/ML.", "Your home for data science.
