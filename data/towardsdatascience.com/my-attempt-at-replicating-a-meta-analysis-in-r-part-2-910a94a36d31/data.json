Let\u2019s jump straight into seeing how we can create a forest plot from this arduous process!", "Remember that we have imported all the statistics from each studies in the Excel data file. It\u2019s just then a matter of creating a new column that (1) calculates Cohen\u2019s d; and then (2) converts d into Hedge\u2019s g. We\u2019ll filter the data frame so that only studies with an inactive control comparison are included as per the filter(inactive_control_ind == \"Y\") line. From that, we use our function for calculating d, i.e. the cohen_d_calc() function followed by converting it into g. Let\u2019s go ahead and create a few columns estimating the effect sizes using our custom functions.", "We should now have a data frame that contains the published effect sizes from Blanck et al. (2018) and the estimated effect sizes from our functions. Take a look at it below:", "However, I\u2019m missing another required transformation. There are two studies which, in fact, used multiple treatment conditions and compared them against an inactive control group, i.e. Parkin et al. (2014) and Yamada & Victor (2012). We have estimated the effect size for these studies but have not combined these together to represent the study overall.", "I\u2019ve decided to calculate the weighted mean effect size for these studies which I assume is what the authors in Blanck et al. (2018, p. 28) similarly did:", "If studies provided data for more than one eligible outcome measure of either anxiety or depression, we collapsed data to ensure independence of obtained ESs. In a similar vein, data was combined for studies using multiple, eligible treatment conditions (e.g., conditions employing different mindfulness exercises).", "The equation for the weighted estimator can be found in Hedges (1983). Here it is below:", "where x (with an overline) is the calculation for weighted mean effect size.", "In our case, the weight w(i) refers to the total sample size for the given study(i) including both treatment and control groups. g(i) refers to the effect size estimated for the study(i). Okay, let\u2019s take care of those studies by calculating the weighted mean effect size and then compare it against the reported effect sizes.", "If effect sizes in studies could not be calculated, we\u2019ll adopt Hedge\u2019s g reported from the meta-analysis. Furthermore, pretest and pottest scores were only reported for one of the two anxiety scales in Zeidan et al. (2010). Given the insufficient information, we will substitute our estimated g value with the published value.", "It\u2019s coming along well. There\u2019s some small differences that we\u2019ll tolerate for now (especially given that this is new to me). So, we have the effect sizes. What are now missing? Bloody sampling variances for the studies.", "Unfortunately, none of the studies included for the meta-analysis on anxiety symptoms included correlations between pretest and posttest results. The methodology also does include any information on how this correlation coefficient was determined. These are required in order to calculated the sampling variance vi in the metafor::rma package.", "A previous meta-analysis on mindfulness and its effect on anxiety and depression has encountered the same issue (Hofmann, Sawyer, Witt, & Oh, 2010; Hofmann, Wu, & Boettcher, 2014). To address this, the authors used a conservative estimation of r = .7 in accordance to Rosenthal (1986)\u2019s recommendation. Similarly, I will use .7 and test out the forest plot.", "Before I can replicate the forest plot, I need to set the pretest and posttest correlation coefficient ri. Since we have estimated the effect sizes already, we can use the approach in Morris (2008) to determine the sampling variance vi which is required to run a random-effects model. Yes, very confusing. See Viechtbauer (n.d.) as the webpage contains more information on the R syntax for using pooled standard deviations to calculating the sampling variance using the approach described in Morris (2008).", "So, let\u2019s therefore use r=.7 for the pretest and posttest correlation and feed it into the calculation for sampling variance as per vi in the metafor::rma() function.", "After all that trouble, we finally have the complete set of statistics to plug into the random effects model function. At this point, I\u2019m going to use the metafor::rma() function which will aggregate all the effect sizes to produce a summary effect size of SAMs on anxiety symptoms. Good news is that we know that Blanck et al. (2018) used the inverse variance random effects model by DerSimonian & Laird (1986). You can choose this model by specifying method = \"DL\" in the rma() function. See below.", "However, the confidence intervals for each study\u2019s effect sizes are far off from the ones reported in the meta-analysis. With some trial and error, I assumed that r=.5 might be more conservative than the value adopted from Rosenthal (1986). There\u2019s no information about what correlation coefficient was used in Blanck et al. (2018).", "The Hedge\u2019s g values come quite close to the results reported in the meta-analysis for Blanck et al. (2018). The random effects model yielded the same summary effect size of SAMs (and confidence intervals) on anxiety symptoms as per the forest plot in Blanck et al. (2018), i.e. SMD=0.58. However, the weights reported by our model do not match the ones published in the article. I admittedly can\u2019t explain this at this stage.", "Nonetheless, I think this is an OK attempt at the basics of completing a meta-analysis. This does not cover all the processes involved in running a meta-analysis and I would recommend a relevant and recent article by Shim & Kim (2019) that provide additional examples on sorting out intervention meta-analyses in R. The authors also provide a nifty diagram on the essentials of the meta-analytic process.", "I might write another post on how to use the packages directly to perform the manual effect size calculations automatically.", "Blanck, P., Perleth, S., Heidenreich, T., Kr\u00f6ger, P., Ditzen, B., Bents, H., & Mander, J.
