Computer Scientists have borrowed the term \u2018Big-O Notation\u2019 from the world of mathematics to accurately describe an algorithm\u2019s efficiency. Many self-taught Developers and Data Scientists either settle for a solution that \u2018just works\u2019 without thinking how to improve their code\u2019s performance, or go into optimising it without really understanding the basics. Their attempts are either fruitless or have very small, and mostly incidental, impact.", "Measuring an algorithm\u2019s complexity is not a difficult concept to grasp \u2014 Although this sounds like an oxymoron \u2014 it is not!In this article, we are going to leave out the mathematical jargon and explain the Big-O concept in an easy to understand way. We will refine our understanding with standalone Python snippets and we will conclude our journey with an all-in-one cheat-sheet for future reference.", "Instead of focusing on units of time, Big-O puts the number of steps in the spotlight. The hardware factor is taken out of the equation. Therefore we are not talking about run time, but about time complexity.\u26a0 We will not cover the Space Complexity i.e. the how much memory an algorithm takes up. We will talk about it another time :)", "An algorithm\u2019s Big-O notation is determined by how it responds to different sizes of a given dataset. For instance how it performs when we pass to it 1 element vs 10,000 elements.", "O stands for Order Of, so O(N) is read \u201cOrder of N\u201d \u2014 it is an approximation of the duration of the algorithm given N input elements. It answers the question: \u201cHow does the number of steps change as the input data elements increase?\u201d", "O(N) describes how many steps an algorithm takes based on the number of elements that it is acted upon.", "Starting with a gentle example: Given an input array[N], and a value X, our algorithm will search for the value X by traversing the array from the start until the value is found.", "Given this 5-element array: [2,1,6,3,8] if we were searching for X=8 the algorithm would need 5 steps to find it, but if we were searching for X=2 it would only take 1 step. So best case scenario is when we look for a value that is in the first cell and worst case scenario is when the value is at the last cell, or not there at all.", "The Big-O notation takes a pessimistic approach to performance and refers to the worst case scenario. This is really important when we describe the complexities below, and also when you try to compute the complexity of your own algorithms: Always think of the worst case scenarios.", "Now that we have our rules and vocabulary defined, without further ado, let\u2019s dive into the most common complexities you may come across\u2026", "O(1) means that the algorithm takes the same number of steps to execute regardless of how much data is passed in.", "Whether we access the 1st or 2nd or millionth item it doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 We can access it directly by using the index operator array[i] .", "If we were to represent the number of steps (y-axis) vs the number of input elements (x-axis), O(1) is a perfect horizontal line, since the number of steps in the algorithm remains constant no matter how much data there is. This is why it is called constant time.", "An algorithm that is O(N) will take as many steps as there are elements of data. So when an array increases in size by one element, an O(N) algorithm will increase by one step.", "Here, we need to access all the elements one by one, so the calculation time increases at the same pace as the input.", "O(N) is a perfect diagonal line, as for every additional piece of data, the algorithm takes one additional step. This is why it is also referred to as linear time.", "Let\u2019s plot the O(1) and O(N) algorithms in the same graph and let\u2019s assume that the O(1) algorithm constantly takes 50 steps.", "\u2192 When the input array has less than 50 elements, the O(N) is more efficient. \u2192 At exactly 50 elements the two algorithms take the same number of steps. \u2192 As the data increases the O(N) takes more steps.", "Since the Big-O notation looks at how the algorithm performs as the data grows to infinity, this is why O(N) is considered to be less efficient than O(1).", "O(N\u00b2) represents the complexity of an algorithm, whose performance is proportional to the square of the size of the input elements. It is generally quite slow: If the input array has 1 element it will do 1 operation, if it has 10 elements it will do 100 operations, and so on.", "This is a \u2018naive\u2019 implementation, but it traverses the array twice:", "Adding more nested iterations through the input will increase the algorithm\u2019s complexity: e.g. if the number of iterations is 3 then its complexity will be O(N\u00b3) and so forth. Usually, we want to stay away from polynomial running times (quadratic, cubic, N\u02e3, etc).", "The O(N\u00b2) line is a sharp curve:", "Simply put, O(logN) describes an algorithm that its number of operations increases by one each time the data is doubled.", "Logarithmic time complexities usually apply to algorithms that divide problems in half every time.", "1) Open the dictionary in the middle and check the first word.2) If our word is alphabetically more significant, look in the right half, else look in the left half.3) Divide the remainder in half again, and repeat steps 2 and 3 until we find our word.", "We can only pick one possibility per iteration, and our pool of possible matches gets divided by two in each iteration. This makes the time complexity of binary search O(logN).", "The number of steps barely increase, as the input grows (i.e. it takes just one additional step each time the data doubles):", "By now we have learnt the four most important Big-O taxonomies. Of course there are a few more, but I am confident you will be able to understand them. Let\u2019s quickly cover them:", "An algorithm of this complexity class is doing log(N) work N times and therefore its performance is slightly worse than O(N). Many practical algorithms belong in this category (from sorting, to pathfinding, to compression), so we are mentioning it for completeness.", "\u270f\ufe0f Example: Merge Sort \u2014 it is a \u2018Divide and Conquer\u2019 algorithm: it divides the input array in two halves, calls itself for each one and then merges the two sorted halves.\ud83d\udca1 Scalability: Average.", "Exponential growth means that the algorithm takes twice as long for every new element added.", "\u270f\ufe0f Example: Find all subsets in a dataset.\ud83d\udca1 Scalability: Poor.", "\u270f\ufe0f Example: Find all different permutations in a dataset.\ud83d\udca1 Scalability: Very Poor.", "The Big-O notation offers a consistent mechanism to compare any two algorithms and hence help us make our code faster and more scalable.
