It is emerging out as an extremely popular language, and also the most talked-about coding language today thanks to its flexibility.", "The coding language python is not only easy to learn and implement but also provides a wide diversity while maintaining simplicity. Python being an overall easy language to get started with and implement top-notch projects provides room for us to execute a wide array of options.", "Today, we will go over 5 project ideas that we will be implementing with the help of python. I have mentioned 2 basic level project ideas for beginners, another 2 intermediate level project ideas, and finally, 1 complex project idea for the last project.", "I will be thoroughly discussing each project idea with necessary codes, examples, essential guides, and useful links to help you to start building the mentioned python projects.", "With the brief introduction out of the way, let us dive into the interesting part of this article and discuss each of these projects in detail so you can start working on them right away!", "This basic project to be implemented can be done in any way you choose. Let us analyze how the execution of this simple calculator project is done for each class of difficulty. I will begin with beginner\u2019s implementation of simple calculators, but even if you have basic programming knowledge, stick on till the next part of this section as I have suggestions for taking this project to the next level as shown in the above image.", "If you are a beginner and you are just getting started with python, then please refer to the starter code provided below, which is one of the best ways you can understand the use of functions in python.", "With just a simple code as displayed above, you have successfully created four functions to compute the four basic operations of a calculator. To take the two inputs from the user for the calculation purpose, you can use the following code block assignment.", "After executing the following code block, I will assign my two numbers like 5 and 2, for the interpretation of the calculations. You can feel free to declare any number you desire as per your requirement. The answers you should get for the following assignments should be as follows:", "This part completes the simple calculator program. However, this is not even close to the end. There are a ton of improvements to be made with the use of various techniques. Let us discuss how we can accomplish this task. For the intermediate-level programmer, I would highly suggest that you go beyond the two input integers to a higher n-element approach by making use of the *args option available for functions. Then, try to use classes for understanding that concept more precisely and develop a more complicated calculator.", "For more advanced or expert level construction of the same project, look into graphical user interface libraries like Tkinter. Using this module, users can develop an awesome GUI structure for your calculator. There are also other graphics modules you can use, but I would personally recommend Tkinter as a good starting point. Refer to the amazing code snippet provided by Programming Knowledge user in the GitHub link in the image above for a concise guide on the calculator development.", "An important aspect of python and machine learning is understanding the math behind these concepts and knowing how some of the code in machine learning libraries. To have a better grasp of these concepts, it is essential to practice the ideas implemented in scientific modules like numpy and scikit-learn by ourselves. One such programming application is performing the matrix multiplication operation without using any ML libraries.", "To perform this task, the main requirement is knowledge of how matrices works. The complete explanation and guide can be obtained from my article below. However, if you are just interested in the basic gist of this coding problem and want to try to solve this on your own, then use the next reference paragraphs to help you get started.", "My approach to this problem is going to be to take all the inputs from the user. These are the number of rows and columns of both the first and second matrix. Also, based on the number of rows and columns of each matrix, we will respectively fill the alternative positions accordingly.", "The first step, before doing any matrix multiplication is to check if this operation between the two matrices is actually possible. This can be done by checking if the columns of the first matrix matches the shape of the rows in the second matrix. This can be formulated as:", "This should be a great starting point for you to get started.", "The outdated GIF you guys can see above is one of my first projects I ever did with the help of pygame about three years ago. If you want a more concise guide on how you can build this from scratch with python then do let me know. But the main idea here is to build a game with python from scratch on your own. Start off with something simple like a snake game, or tic-tac-toe, and proceed towards a more advanced one like flappy birds with reinforcement learning.", "The idea behind accomplishing this task is more of personal opinion and preference. I believe that one of the best ways to get a good hold of any programming language is to start with a project that is fun and enjoyable. I am also a bit of a gaming nerd. To get started with gaming projects related to python, I would highly recommend the use of the Pygame library module for the execution of such programs.", "With the pygame module, you can build some simple, fun games with python. However, don\u2019t expect anything too fancy as it has its limitations. Regardless, it is a fantastic way to get started, and below is the starter code to dive in. Just install pygame with a simple pip command and then use the following import pygame command. The following message will greet you upon the successful importing of the module.", "The versions might differ depending on the time on installation, so don\u2019t worry too much. Just use the updated versions always in any scenario. I will go over some basic commands you should know and how they work. Below is the complete code block for all the important aspects you need to know to get started with pygame.", "I would highly recommend you check out some YouTube videos for better understanding and learning to build some games. The documentation for the pygame module, albeit a little lengthy, is probably one the best resources to learn more about this module.", "The next intermediate level we will be focusing on is one of the coolest aspects of having python programming knowledge. Complicated tasks such as text-to-speech conversion and optical character recognition of python can be completed just with the help of understanding the python library modules created for this purpose.", "The text-to-speech (TTS) is the process of converting words into a vocal audio form. The program, tool, or software takes an input text from the user, and using methods of natural language processing, understands the linguistics of the language being used, and performs logical inference on the text. This processed text is passed into the next block, where digital signal processing is performed on the processed text. With the use of the many algorithms and transformations, this processed text is finally converted into a speech format. This entire process involves the synthesizing of speech.", "Optical Character Recognition is the conversion of 2-Dimensional text data into a form of machine-encoded text by the use of an electronic or mechanical device. The 2-Dimensional text data can be obtained from various sources such as scanned documents like PDF files, images with text data in formats such as .png or .jpeg, signposts like traffic posts, or any other images with any form of textual data. There is a wide range of interesting applications for optical character recognition.", "Below is the list of two articles that will be extremely useful to get you acquainted with the Google Text-To-Speech module for speech translation and the pytesseract module for optical character recognition. Refer to these below articles for a comprehensive guide for getting started with them and perform a project using them together.", "You can make the best use of these modules for more advanced projects like using them with sequence to sequence with attention for the construction of deep learning models for machine translation and so much more. Have fun experimenting and exploring these libraries.", "The virtual assistant project is one where your computer will listen to every single command of yours and perform all of your desired tasks. This project will be useful to control all your activities with a simple voice command.", "You can carry out actions like the automation of emails after typing it out with just your voice, and the virtual assistant takes care of an autocorrect required. You can also command your virtual assistant for browsing the internet or for opening any websites or shopping or any other thing you desire. I will be going over one of my virtual assistant projects, but you can feel free to be innovative and try out any of your self-made ideas as well. All the reference links are also available in the respective parts of this section.", "Firstly, I wanted my virtual assistant to grant access to only me or the selected members of my choice. I built a smart face lock system that would only permit me access. I constructed the face recognition model by using deep learning technologies and python. The entire concise feedback to this project is available from the following link below.", "The next thing I wanted my virtual assistant to do was automatically predict the next words in my mind and perform the prediction task of the next words and complete my messages at a faster pace without needing much effort. The Next Word Prediction model with natural language processing and deep learning using python accomplished this exact task.", "Below is the complete, concise guide for the implementation of the next word prediction model, which covers all these concepts in-depth.", "The final part of my virtual assistant project was the implementation of the chatbot. I wanted a partner to talk to me and understand what I was saying and reply with appropriate responses. I designed my chatbot using a sarcastic dataset, and this made the chatbot to reply with funny messages filled with sarcasm. Below is the complete and concise guide for building your chatbot from scratch with Python and deep learning.", "You can feel free to do the same thing as I have implemented with my above ideas or try something unique and innovative with your style guide of implementation of the virtual assistant project.", "These five projects mentioned in this article will be useful for all levels of programmers, and it does not matter if your just getting started or have an intermediate to an advanced-level knowledge of Python. If you have any clarification regarding any of these five projects mentioned in this article, then feel free to hit me up.", "Artificial Intelligence is on the rise, and we are close to conquering even the entire universe. With these python projects and understanding of concepts such as sparsity, we can all learn and develop into a more evolutionary modern era.", "If you are interested in similar articles that cover amazing project ideas, then check out one of my previous articles related to 5 awesome computer vision projects that can be implemented with python, machine learning, and deep learning.", "Check out my other concise guides to learn more about python and understand everything you need to know about python to get accustomed to programming with it for machine learning projects.", "Thank you all for sticking on till the end. I hope you enjoyed reading the article. Wish you all a wonderful day.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Love to explore and learn new concepts.
