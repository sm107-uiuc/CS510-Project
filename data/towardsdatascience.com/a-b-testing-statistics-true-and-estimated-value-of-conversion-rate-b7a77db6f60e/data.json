How do I check?", "The A/B test is one of the most popular user experience research methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of UX or UI changes on your website or mobile app. So say you changed something, started the test \u2014 and it seems the modified version wins. But can we be sure of that? And what percent out of 100 we sure?", "To answer let\u2019s look at this method A/B test not as a way to measure user engagement and satisfaction of the changes, but as a statistical experiment. So, what do you need to know to say for sure that we can go with the results obtained?", "I mean it doesn\u2019t show the actual value of CR, but estimated. No matter how many users you have in the experiment, the sample size is still less than the total number of users. Therefore, when you determine the required sample size for the test, the next logical question is \u201chow many users do we need to be sure the test result (estimated CR value) really describes the actual state of things (true CR value)?", "In other words, how close is the estimated CR (T) to the true value (Q). And to answer this question, we need confidence intervals.", "So, we ran the A/B test and now have some estimated conversion (let\u2019s designate it with T). But in fact, the actual conversion rate may be slightly less, or slightly more, and we don\u2019t know an exact value, but can calculate an interval from [a;b] which contains it. This is called the confidence interval.", "The larger the sample, the smaller the interval. That is why it\u2019s so important to determine the minimum number of users in each group of the experiment before starting the test.", "The confidence interval is calculated with a certain level of confidence. For example, if the confidence level is 95% (as it usually is), what does it mean?", "Here\u2019s what: if we run the test 100 times on 100 different samples, get 100 estimated CRs and calculate the confidence interval for each of them, then 95 times out of 100 the interval contains true CR value.", "It\u2019s important to understand that the confidence level is a characteristic of the confidence interval calculation procedure, not the interval itself. And we can choose which confidence level is enough for us to trust the test result.", "So, a confidence interval is a way of CR estimating, which results in not just a single value, but an interval of values that can contain the actual CR value. And the confidence level shows how likely it\u2019s to be contained there.", "I hope I have succeeded in conveying the meaning of the concept of confidence level, so now let\u2019s see why it is usually 95%, and not 75% or 80%?", "And here I have to introduce two more terms from mathematical statistics (the last ones for today, I promise!) \u2014 significance level and statistical power.", "But first, let\u2019s have a look at the pic below. This is a statistical test matrix (a/b test is a statistical test), and it shows 4 scenarios:", "Say, we had a red button on the site, and we decided that it should be repainted in blue. We hope that the blue button will be clicked more often, so we run an a/b test to check this hypothesis. What result can we get?", "So, in 2 cases the result is true, and in 2 other cases test distorts the real picture.", "The probability of getting a false-positive result is often called a Type I error, and it\u2019s usually denoted by \u03b1. If \u03b1=5%, this means that 5 times out of 100 we register a difference while the variants are the same.", "What do such misleading findings mean for us? Well, apparently, we\u2019re happy, we believe the test, we spend time and money to roll out the changes and introduce it to all users, and \u2014 no effect, the CR is the same which is only to be expected considering there was no difference from the very start. Whether you are ready for this in 5% of cases or in 1% \u2014 it\u2019s up to you :) Usually, people agree on \u03b1=5%, so the confidence level, which is calculated as a 1-\u03b1, is 95%.", "Thus, the confidence level (1-\u03b1) is the probability of NOT getting a Type I error (\u03b1). It\u2019s the percentage of confidence in the result if the test shows that variants A and B do not differ.", "Feel free. But you need more people in the experiment then, or a greater difference between the winner and the runner-up conversion rates. This can affect the time of the experiment, so start from how important it is for you to have such high confidence in the result.", "However, another erroneous scenario is possible \u2014 when variants A and B have a true difference in its conversion rates, but the test failed to detect it. It\u2019s called a false negative result or a Type II error (denoted by \u03b2).", "What are we risking here? Missing a good idea and not implementing it. This is painful, but slightly less than with the Type I error, so here we can set probability of mistake \u03b2=20% or less. Then statistical power, which is calculated as a 1-\u03b2, is 80% or more.", "Statistical power is the probability of NOT getting a Type II error (\u03b2), i.e. the percentage of confidence in the result if the test shows that there is a difference between variants A and B.", "Ok, now we\u2019re ready to calculate confidence interval, and here is how to do it:", "2. Calculate the difference between variants B and A conversion rates (it can be negative number, if the A variant is winner):", "3. Calculate the confidence interval for the difference:", "Your home for data science.
