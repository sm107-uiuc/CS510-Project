The cloud vendors promote some or the other form of AutoML services. Similarly, Tech unicorns also offer various AutoML services for their platform users. In addition, many different open source projects are available, providing interesting new approaches. But what is Auto AI, and what does AutoML mean?", "AutoAI utilizes training of features in a sophisticated way to automate most of the complicated and time-costly tasks in the whole machine learning pipeline in general but, more specifically, the feature engineering and ML models selection and building part. It does so without needing you to be a Data Science expert. Of course, it helps if you have that expertise as by then, you would be able to leverage the auto AI capabilities at the next best level, which is known as a human in the feedback loop.", "It is expected that Automated AI will help take the ML capabilities to the next level, helping business users, improve the ML workflows. Although, the long term goal of Auto AI is the automate the most if not all of the end to end process of applying ML for business use cases. There is a need for us to understand its capabilities, and limitations as well as the future goals of Automated AI.", "This blog focuses on clarifying the concepts, what does it include, and what are we still missing or, in other words, what are some of the potential improvements needed to make automating the data science journey complete. This blog discusses the landscape and history for projects and research efforts related to AutoML, looking beyond just hyper-parameter optimization and considering the impact on end-to-end workflows and data science practices.", "In this blog, you will learn the following aspects:", "AutoAI stands for automation of the AI. In more concrete terms, it means which parts (or steps) of the ML / DL pipeline can be and should be automated. It centers around automation of selection and tuning of the machine learning steps, including but not limited to data preparation, feature engineering & extraction, model selection, hyper-parameter tuning, and optimization, results-interpretation, and visualization.", "Although not everything in the data science workflow, I believe many things can be automated. You can have a look below on a typical Machine Learning workflow, which I presented in my article on Feature Store in April 2020. I am reposting it down for your reference. Feature Store is a great way to make your AI and Data Science workflows automated (at least in many parts). For further details on a feature-store, you can read that blog.", "The pre-implemented model types and structures can be presented or learned from the input datasets for selection. AutoAI simplifies the development of AI projects, proof of value initiatives, and help (Business) users to speed up ML solutions development without extensive programming knowledge. However, as it stands today, it can serve as a complementary tool for data scientists. It helps them to either quickly find out what algorithms they could try or see if they have missed some algorithms, and that could have been a valuable selection to gain better results.", "Usually, business leaders think that why should they hire the data scientists if they have Auto AI tools at their hands. I would strongly recommend not get into this thinking as it will give you the wrong picture.", "I have brought up these points early on here so that you do not get the confusion around the fact that you are good to go with AutoAI without the data scientists. It would be best if you had both of them in your journey towards AI-based transformation.", "At the same time, I would like to emphasize and remind you that there is an excellent value that Auto AI can offer you and shorten the time to market for the ML models, and that is why I came up with this blog.", "Enterprises seek to automate ML pipelines and different steps in the ML workflow to address the increase in their tendency and need for accelerating the AI adoption. Before we delve into what can be automated, let\u2019s first have a look at how a standard ML pipeline looks. As illustrated in the figure above, it consists of data retrieval, data preparation, modeling, hyperparameter tuning, model deployment, and monitoring.", "After the initial data ingestion, we need to remove the duplicates, fix the missing values, and address if there are any potential errors in the data. The next step is to apply feature engineering to extract and engineer the features followed by obtaining the training data from the cleaned dataset. It includes encoding the data, feature (re)-scaling, correlation analysis, etc.", "Then we feed these features ready for training to the selected models followed by hyperparameters tuning. This selection of models and parameter tuning requires the data scientists to go through this process a few times and compare the performance of the models.", "The resulting models and their results need to be tested and interpreted. In this step, data scientists have to validate the feature importance, detect the potential bias, and interpret the predictions so that the business users could understand the insights and comprehend their relevance for them.", "Data Scientists go through this process for every use case and within each use case. These repetitions cost time, effort, money, and delay in getting to production. For this reason, we suggest that AutoAI could come in as a savior and can automate many steps of the ML lifecycle.", "Different vendors provide solutions for automation of the ML pipeline. The solution provided by IBM is called AutoAI. AutoAI focuses on automatically preparing data, selection and application of Machine Learning algorithms, and building model pipelines that are best suited for your data and your business scenarios.", "The first step after the data ingestion, in an ML pipeline, is about data cleaning and Feature Engineering: Feature + (Selection, Extraction, Construction). AutoAI can help you to detect duplicates, missing values, and other inconsistencies or errors that might exist in the data. After addressing these issues (data cleaning), we transform the attributes in the data to features so that the ML models can consume them. The quality and quantity of the features dramatically impact the models and their outcomes.", "Feature Selection: The system chooses a subset of features using a search strategy and evaluates them. It does so until it finds such a feature set, which is suitable for the model.", "Feature Construction: Creates new features from the raw data or by combining the existing features.", "Feature Extraction: Focuses on dimensionality reduction by using standard methods such as PCA, independent component analysis, isomap, etc.", "Usually, this step takes a significantly large amount of time from the data scientists as it is a tedious process. Auto AI solves this problem, with increased efficiency and guaranteeing the quality features.", "Coming up with the right features is one of the most time-consuming steps in the Machine Learning pipeline.", "There are two approaches to model selection. Traditionally, the data scientists focus on manual model selection: where the select the model from the conventional ML models (Decision Trees, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.) based on the data available and suitability of the models. The second approach, which is used by AutoAI, is the Neural Architecture Search (NAS): It tries to design a network architecture using reinforcement learning in the b background.", "Due to data scientists being the scarce resources, this part is usually very challenging for the data scientists as they have limited time and other practical considerations, which do not allow them to try out multiple models at the same time. AutoAI helps them in many ways. Once the models get trained, they are available for reuse for testing and further tuning in the case of AutoAI.", "To efficiently select the best model, AutoAI runs estimators against small subsets of data, gradually increasing. It helps the system to iteratively eliminate the estimators and choose the best one while saving on scarce resources such as time and storage.", "One crucial aspect is hyperparameter training. It contains data that govern the training process. Hyper-parameter tuning runs the whole training jobs, evaluates the results, and make adjustments to find the best combination of parameters to lead towards the solution.", "Auto AI provides a smart, hyperparameter tuning, that tunes the essential hyperparameters for each algorithm. The methods used for HPO include evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization, etc. It searches through a different range of values for each parameter, and once the algorithm has finished its execution, you can select the corresponding model and visualize the results.", "You would like to be able to visualize the dataset as well as models, i.e., to be able to see the statistical information about the data such as datatypes, distribution, outliers, etc. Without automated AI, it could take a data scientist hours and even days of work.", "The visualization helps users to get a more intuitive overview and understanding of the data. It could also help you to interpret the models, which turns them into white boxes. For example, it would greatly help if you could plot the structure of the decision tree visually. It enables the users to evaluate the model and modify the tree structure, such as pruning and boosting. Similarly, it helps to have the information about the features, their importance, and how do they influence the model predictions.", "Having the possibility to use the one-click deployment of the models\u2019 functionality, when the models are ready to be deployed, puts the data scientists at great ease and comfort. Furthermore, it helps if you can select and save services that you would like to be used with the model and create versioning of the models. I mean, who would not want to have \u201cgit\u201d in there!", "The automatic scoring of the model pipelines makes the model ready to run them in production. Besides that, it gives the users flexibility to run several experiments such as A/B testing, health checks, maintenance, and applying security patches.", "In the future, Auto AI will gain more adoption as well as momentum. It demands further improvement and the addition of capabilities of AutoAI systems. For example, adding the data collection capability would greatly help as it is usually one of the challenging problems to solve, especially high-quality data. This problem has two solutions; 1) data synthesis and 2) data search.", "Data Synthesis: Data augmentation would be useful for image data; translation for text data could also help, and data simulation could serve for more particular tasks.", "Data Search: As the internet contains unlimited data, the data search could turn out a good solution. Besides, domain-specific capabilities would be helpful to automate the data science for specific scenarios.", "Your home for data science.
