Then probability helps you to account and understand the uncertainty that we see in the real world.", "Probability gives us the tools to measure and quantify the uncertainty on the events that we model or that we try to replicate. Another good reason is that many algorithms and models use probability as their base, like \u2018Probabilistic Graphical models\u2019 and \u2018Naive Bayes models\u2019.", "That is one of the reasons why you will get tested on the interview about probability. As a quick refresher, keep the axioms of probability in mind:", "Another very important theorem to keep in mind is the Bayes\u2019 Theorem:", "And now as promised we can start with some Q&A\u2026", "Every flip has the same probability (0.5) of getting heads (H) or tails (T). Since we have 2 possible events and three flips, we have 8 permutations (2\u00b3).", "The possible cases are: HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT", "A variation of this problem is to answer what is the probability of getting at least 2 heads, which is easy enough to calculate\u2026 (ok, it\u2019s 0.5)", "Just for your interest, you may want to read about the gambler\u2019s fallacy.", "The probability of any number is proportional to itself and the total must be 1:", "From this we calculate the probabilities of odd (O) and even (E) numbers:", "Now the only thing left is to realise that there are two scenarios where we can end up with the desired result. The 1st scenario is to get 1st the odd number and in the 2nd throw the even number. And the 2nd scenario is to get 1st the even number and in the 2nd the odd number.", "There are more ways to solve this problem and different ways to thing about it. For example by using the relations between the events. We have four permutations in which one is the 2 odd numbers and another is the 2 even numbers:", "Now it is time to apply that conditional probability that we have seen at the beginning. The data we will work with is:", "The probability of a user signing up and visiting a specific version is calculated by multiplying the chance of the website being presented to the user by its conversion ratio.", "This is again a problem that we can tackle in different ways\u2026.", "The possible cases for boy (b) and girl (g) are: bb, bg, gb, and gg", "The first way of thinking about this problem is to realise that we already know that one of the kids is a girl, so in reality we have only 3 cases: bg, gb and gg", "And within these 3 cases only one is gg, so the answer is 1/3", "The second way of solving the problem involves using Bayes\u2019 Theorem:", "Did you find it interesting? Truth is, this is an old problem that you may have heard already as the Boy or Girl paradox and I invite you to read more about it in the link...", "This is another classic of probability:", "To answer this question let\u2019s take any of the possible positions:", "The main point is to be aware of the fact that when the opponent pulls the trigger and it didn\u2019t fire, there are 4 positions or possibilities in which the revolver may have been, that we have marked with \u2018x\u2019.", "For three of these positions we will be safe in the next pull of the trigger and only in one the revolver will fire in the next trigger. Let\u2019s call P(S) the probability of survival, then the probability of survival without spinning again the revolver is:", "If I spin the revolver the probability of ending on any chamber is the same (1 across 6) and there are 2 possibilities (bullets) out of 6 of finding a bullet which is 4 possibilities out of 6 of finding an empty chamber:", "So I wouldn\u2019t spin the cylinder if I were you\u2026", "And now a simple variation of the previous problem:", "There is a trick in the question and it is that there can not be more than two empty chambers of separations as we would leave 3 empty on one side of the bullet and only 1 on the other. So we end up with this scenario:", "Which we can simplify to: B | x| x", "We have only two possible positions for when our opponent didn\u2019t find a bullet and from those two positions only one is safe for us in the next round\u2026", "And there are no variations vs. the previous problem is we spin the revolver, as all events have equal probability:", "So now is marginally better if we spin it.", "Though this won\u2019t give you a huge edge if you plan on playing\u2026 \ud83d\ude05", "I hope that you enjoyed this article and maybe I inspired you some extra curiosity to search for more\u2026 many of these problems can be found in wikipedia and similar sources so I invite you to dig a little more into this fascinating world.", "Please leave your thoughts and ideas and let me know what other topics may be of your interest.", "Your home for data science.
