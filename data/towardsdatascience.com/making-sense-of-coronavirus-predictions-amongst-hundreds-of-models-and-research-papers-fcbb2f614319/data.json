I will explain a bit about the architecture of these models, their subjectivity, and the process of interpreting their estimates.", "In the last two months, we all have seen multiple estimates and models of the growth of Coronavirus. Many of them, such as the most recent model predicting the death of 84,000 Americans by the end of the summer, is particularly concerning. Another model by Dr. Fauci at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases predicts the death of about 200,000 Americans under a best-case scenario and the death of about 2.2 million Americans under a worst-case scenario if no actions are taken.", "But do all of these models make sense? And are these predictions right? If not, how do we make an informed judgment about the current global situation given the predictions ranging from 100,000 deaths to about 2.2 million deaths? This article aims to answer some of these questions.", "Generative models, which are models aimed at predicting future results, are approximations of a future scenario given historical data and present circumstances. A model can be as simple as linear regression and as complicated as a neural network of thousands of layers trying to predict those numbers accurately. Each model has certain inputs such as information about the population and information about the virus.", "Each model\u2019s dynamics are built using the information we know about the coronavirus. For example, one person can infect up to six different people in a single day. Hence, in a very simple and uninformed model, we would simply multiply the number of infections by 6 to get the estimates for the next day. But life isn\u2019t that simple. There are infinitely many different complexities about human nature and interaction that need to be accounted for in the model. For example, there\u2019s a spectrum of human interaction: Some extroverted people interact with up to 20 people a day while some barely interact with 5 people a week.", "While building a model, numerous parameters are designed (such as the number of interactions, the life of the virus, probability of transmission, probability of a human using a mask, etc.) and each parameter is assigned a \u2018distribution\u2019 of values. These distributions reflect our belief in the spectrum of values that are represented in normal human life. In statistical terms, they\u2019re called the priors of our model.", "All these prior distributions are fed into a model along with the assumed dynamics of interaction between all these parameters. A data scientist decides the possible influence of each parameter on our dependent variable (number of infections). The model accepts our assumptions and distributions along with historical data and tries to obtain the best possible estimate about the number of infections given our assumptions about its growth and the input parameters.", "But here\u2019s a problem: If these models rely on such subjective assumptions, a data scientist can define unrealistic assumptions and predict a number of infections/ deaths which are not realistic at all. So how do we make sure that models are reliable?", "Each model\u2019s reliability is affected by the kind of assumptions and dynamics encoded into the model. If one assumes a simple exponential growth, the model results are going to be far more inflated than the actual results. At the same time, if I assume that one person can only affect another person, I would be looking at estimates that are too optimistic to be true. (This kind of estimation is called Bayesian Inference. If you are interested, you can read more about Bayesian Inference and its subjectivity here.) Then, why is this so hard? Before we answer that question, here\u2019s a fun fact:", "\u2018All models are wrong but some are useful.\u2019", "The quote above simply means that we will never be right about our predictions for the number of coronavirus infections and death tolls. It\u2019s simply because nature wouldn\u2019t tell us the exact relationship between the different input factors such as population density and the output variables. If only nature could speak, we could unravel all its mysteries but that\u2019s sadly not the case.", "Every model and simulation is an attempt to estimate natural relationships given historical data and information that we have gathered. It is impossible to have a model that is \u2018correct\u2019. Hence, models can never be completely right. But that doesn\u2019t mean that models can\u2019t help.", "Models can\u2019t give us precise results, which means that deterministic models aimed at just one right estimate are not reliable. But there\u2019s a lot of value in evaluating the best-case scenarios and the worst-case scenarios. If you go back to the articles that I linked in the first paragraph, the articles actually provide bounds on these estimates. Dr. Fauci\u2019s model actually predicts 100,000\u2013200,000 deaths during the summer in the best-case scenario and about 1.6\u20132.2 million deaths in the worst-case scenario (if we don\u2019t take any action).", "Why are these estimation intervals so big? If they were a little smaller, understanding and planning would be easier. But that\u2019s the problem \u2014 we don\u2019t know enough about the Coronavirus, its strains, its abilities, its growth patterns, its mortality rate, etc. to predict estimates that are more certain than that. That doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t try to build models. But we should be careful about the effect of our knowledge gap on the abilities of our models.", "These models help us evaluate the depth of the situation and plan for the worst. When it comes to saving lives, it is very important to consider worst-case scenarios and plan for them because the cost incurred to society during the worst-case scenario is significantly higher than the average case scenario.", "Uncertainty is better than certainty in some cases, especially if it\u2019s about a critical issue such as saving lives. This sounds counterintuitive because you would want to be certain about a scenario, right? Not exactly.", "In statistical models, we evaluate the utility of each scenario. How much more costly is one scenario compared to the other? Answering questions like these are very important in the decision-making process for politicians and public health officials when relying on estimates from approximate models.", "But the sensitivity of this cost changes with the context. In the context of an online marketplace that is trying to predict recommended products to you, predicting a wrong recommended product wouldn\u2019t make a huge difference to your loyalty to that website so it would be a very small loss to the company. Thus, a company official would pay very little attention in evaluating their absolute worst-case scenario of predicting recommended products.", "But things aren\u2019t so simple when it comes to public health. If a country plans for a scenario that is not the worst-case scenario, they risk the lives of thousands of people. While there is a huge debate on the cost of a life, the approximate cost of human life is $10 million. (Note: I do not fully agree with putting a price tag on life but you should read this article.)", "One of the reasons for pricing life is to highlight the importance of public health planning. If an online marketplace loses a customer due to the wrong prediction of their products (which is highly unlikely), the total loss in the profits would be less than $100. On the other hand, every single life lost due to wrong health planning would cost $10 million to the country.", "It is not the predictions that matter, but rather the interpretation of those predictions and the method of weighing different scenarios.", "Unless someone has built a model from scratch, most existing models don\u2019t weigh their worst-case scenarios but rather present their estimates as an interval going from the best-case to the worst-case scenario.", "These scenarios need to be accurately weighed and their sensitivity needs to be taken into account. Let\u2019s do a little math here. If we use our estimate of life cost, we\u2019re losing approximately $1\u20132 trillion in terms of human life in the US alone (this doesn\u2019t account for the economic losses that are estimated at about $3 trillion in the US alone). Oh, wait! That was the absolute best-case scenario. The worst-case scenario puts us at a loss of $16\u201322 trillion in terms of human life alone. If we don\u2019t plan properly and implement every single intervention that we possibly can, we\u2019re looking at an additional loss of $15 trillion in human life on top of the $1 trillion in the best-case scenario.", "Pricing human life is difficult. These estimates are called \u2018estimates\u2019 for a reason because they\u2019re not real. They\u2019re not right because you can\u2019t quantify the emotional, mental and financial burden of a person\u2019s death on their entire family and beyond. But these estimates are important to quantify the extent of losses that we could incur if we don\u2019t take action NOW.", "In the world of data science, you can build the fanciest models possible and add multiple layers of a neural network. But if you can\u2019t quantify your estimates into real-life costs that can guide decision-making towards the right path, you\u2019re doing it all wrong.", "Here are some steps that you can take to evaluate the quality of the predictions that you read:", "If you have any questions or if you would like to connect with me, here\u2019s my LinkedIn profile.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
