Companies are always hiring data scientists and there\u2019s always a large number of people trying to become one. But data science hasn\u2019t\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "http://www.stratascratch.com", "anchor_text": "www.stratascratch.com", "paragraph_index": 23}], "all_paragraphs": ["Data science is one of the hottest careers in today\u2019s market. Companies are always hiring data scientists and there\u2019s always a large number of people trying to become one. But data science hasn\u2019t been around for as long as other technical disciplines, so unlike software development which has, there aren\u2019t as many data science-specific learning platforms to help prepare aspiring and experienced scientists. There\u2019s of course Coursera and Udemy, then a few big brand name platforms like DataCamp. Then there are a dozen or more smaller niche platforms aimed at training data scientists their way.", "I\u2019ve evaluated 18 platforms recommended by people in the data science communities. Depending on your learning style and need, there\u2019s a platform for you. The first half of the article is my final assessment of the platforms, ending with a complete list of platforms with all the details that helped me evaluate them. The second half of the article details my approach in evaluating the platforms \u2014 understanding the different user types, sourcing platforms, and variables to evaluate. So if you have the time, skip to the end first to understand my evaluation criteria and then read the results. If you\u2019re pressed for time, just go to the next section.", "I created 2 graphs to map my variables. They\u2019re those graphs with the quadrants you see in all the whitepapers. Honestly, I\u2019m a bit ashamed that I chose this visualization (it feels like making 3D pie charts in Excel) but I think it will allow you to quickly figure out which platform fits you best.", "Ask yourself: What is my learning style? Do I like to dive right in and start coding or do I like to watch videos first? Am I totally new at this and need more hand-holding? Or can I jump right in?", "At the extreme end of lecture-based platforms are pure passive lectures like text on webpages or people talking on videos. Oftentimes these platforms ask you to install the software yourself, which I think is lazy since it\u2019s so easy to spin up a server with all the software to offer the full out-of-the-box experience. Users aren\u2019t always advanced \u2014 that\u2019s why they\u2019re learning \u2014 so offering them an experience where they can access the software, libraries, and datasets easily accessible via browser is now a must-have \u2014 at least to me.", "Interactive, self-guided learning allows you to work at your own pace and select whatever topic you want to learn or practice. At the extreme end, there\u2019s a fully functional IDE that allows you to explore, interact, and manipulate data like you would in a real professional setting. But it\u2019s not just completely self-guided as there are solutions to help you solve questions and understand concepts. The approach here is to start coding immediately and learn the solution if you are stuck. These platforms are perfect for the experienced user, even if you\u2019re just moderately experienced.", "The middle ground is a blend of lecture and interactive self-guided learning. With these platforms, you\u2019re on a \u201ccourse\u201d and \u201cpath\u201d to learn a set of concepts from start to finish. You\u2019re presented with text and/or video and then asked to apply what you learned in an interactive-but-limited IDE where you\u2019re asked questions that build up in complexity. Interactive-but-limited IDE means that the IDE only accepts inputs that answer the question prompted so you can\u2019t go off the path and explore the data or try out different functions and techniques \u2014 you know, things a good data scientist would do. This is perfect for someone learning from scratch and is trying to learn something new from the ground up.", "Ask yourself: Am I trying to learn python? Or am I trying to learn python to be a data scientist? Am I trying to prepare for an interview? Or am I trying to build my first machine learning model? Or just trying to learn the basics?", "Specialty topics are educational content meant for a specific purpose. For example, it\u2019s preparation for a technical interview \u2014 either data science or software development. It\u2019s to learn financial modeling with python or to build a gradient boosted decision tree. These platforms serve a niche population but they do it extremely well to the satisfaction of their user base.", "General education is merely an introduction to basic concepts that are building blocks to becoming proficient in navigating the language, like how to create pandas dataframes to manipulate data. Once you\u2019ve mastered these concepts, the next phase would be to dive into specific topics that serve your needs.", "Platforms are designed with a user in mind. In this case, are you a data scientist or software developer? If you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re probably a data scientist, but as I\u2019ve mentioned before there are many more educational platforms created for teaching software development. Sometimes these platforms offer education in python but their content and examples aren\u2019t always meant for data scientists. It\u2019s sort of like adding a plug-in to a piece of software (it\u2019s not native and sometimes feels a bit hacky).", "In case the graphs aren\u2019t enough for you.", "So depending on your career goals and how you like to learn, there\u2019s a platform for everyone. In your journey, you might end up using a few of these platforms since each platform focuses on a specific strength. Pick the data science platform that allows you to learn what you need to learn for the stage you\u2019re at. I hope this list has been helpful.", "See below for my approach to evaluating the platforms\u2026", "I started with an understanding of the user \u2014 you. When thinking about what type of people would be interested in learning data science, I came up with 3 different user personas:", "I asked myself how someone would find out about data science platforms. Other than a simple Google search, most people would either go for a brand they recognized or choose a platform based on a recommendation.", "I chose to find the platforms from recommendations on popular subreddits like:", "Reddit has an active data science community so it was a good place to start. I supplemented with Quora, Google, and Youtube.", "I consciously chose to exclude (MOOCs) massive open online courses (like Udemy, EdX, and Coursera), bootcamps, and university programs because the quality depends on the instructor and course, so it would be difficult for me to evaluate apples-to-apples. Also, I didn\u2019t think experienced data scientists would actually take an Udemy course on how to be a data scientist \u2014 but I could be wrong.", "For each platform, I signed up and used it for a bit. I didn\u2019t sign up for the premium version unless I couldn\u2019t properly evaluate the platform based on my criteria.", "I evaluated each platform based on 4 main variables I thought were important for each of the user personas above.", "Go back up to my assessment section to read the results!", "Your home for data science.
