It\u2019s easier to understand them through visual representations rather than looking at thousands of records.Data Scientists often leverage graphs such as bar charts, line plots, area curves, etc to communicate this story to their stakeholders.Python and R have been preferred language of choice when working with data. There are multiple libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, pyVis, etc through which one creates visualizations inside the Jupyter Notebooks or stand-alone apps using Bokeh, Flask, for example.", "In this article, I will try to introduce you to Streamlit and get familiar with it. At the end of this article, you will be able to create an interactive app based on your data. Let\u2019s take a publicly available data set from Kaggle. In the end, we will be able to create an app like this.", "The above gif is actually a screen record of the demo app. Streamlit provides you with an easy option to record your app with audio, in case you need for a demo. This is very helpful if you plan to showcase it to an audience.", "Before we start with building apps, lets set up streamlit. I am working on a Ubuntu machine. Commands would be mostly the same for all OS.", "In case you face errors such as this which is a quite common one:AttributeError: module \u2018google.protobuf.descriptor\u2019 has no attribute \u2018_internal_create_key\u2019", "The fix is to upgrade protobuf", "python3 -m pip install \u2014 upgrade protobuf", "Before we go ahead and start coding one should spend some time to create a rough layout. The way I go about is to draw it on a piece of paper \u2014 where charts should go, where would the drop-downs be? Will the charts be connected to the buttons?\u2026 so onIn case you do not have a pen and paper, draw.io is an alternative to draw designs/flow charts/UML diagrams, etc. This is what I have had drawn on a piece of paper.", "Now that we have the design in mind, let\u2019s start adding the Title followed by some description of the analysis. You may wish to add an image if that increases the appealing nature of the application.", "The code is very simple and intuitive. To load an image, you just have to read the image and call streamlit.image method. One could also write markdowns which are very similar to that of Github. To add a description we just have to call the write method with python objects as parameters. It could be a string or pandas data frame.", "In the above code, we are reading the data set and showing a glance of the values. In terms of code, it\u2019s very straight forward. You just call that sampled pandas data frame. This is the magical part of streamlit, also called as Magic Commands. When you write a variable name, streamlit implicitly writes that out to your application just that way you would using the write method. We will be utilizing some of the magic commands in this app to create charts and interactive options.", "To start the app \u2014 streamlit run app.py. You will get an app like this:", "Having looked at the data, we would like to create some bi-variate visualizations. These should be interactive as well so that one can select different values and analyze the trend. For example, I would like to show sales across years for various platforms. And to make it interactive, let\u2019s add a drop-down where the end-user can select the values.", "In the above code, we are creating one drop down and 2 charts (line graph and a stacked bar graph). To create a drop-down in streamlit, it's very simple \u2014 just call the Magic command st.selectbox", "Now how do we make sure that the value selected in the drop-down option is reflected on the graphs? Well, that\u2019s very easy too. Whatever selection you make gets assigned in the platform_name variable. In this example, we are using altair library to create charts. Refer to line 6. To embed the graph in the app, just call", "And magic! below is what you get in your app", "I found an interesting functionality in the API. If you wish to share code snippets in the app, it just a single line of code in streamlit.

Building a demo to showcase is equally important as building one. Streamlit makes that work easier too. Let\u2019s say, I have built a keras based model to identify the number (0\u20139).", "Just follow these easy 5 steps and you will get an App built out", "Full code can be found on this Github repo.", "I think this article can help you get started on Streamlit.
