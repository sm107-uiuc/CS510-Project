Google map uses location data to display the stores in the neighborhood on the map. These data may contain additional information such as store details, address, phone number, but the geographic location itself is the key. Location data are used for many reasons \u2014 as simple as for finding a grocery store, but can be used for more complex decision-making such as where to open a new restaurant business.", "This post is complementary to a previous post on points pattern analysis with the purpose of demonstrating a few basic things that someone can do with location data. Not so much complicated analysis, but I\u2019ll focus on how to display location data on maps and interpret what these data points mean with respect to surrounding and underlying variables such as population and income.", "In this a case study I am using Starbucks location data. The data is a bit dated, but I doubt locations have changed much in these few years.", "In addition, I\u2019m using county-level census data on a few variables to understand the underlying processes that may be associated with Starbucks location:", "The purpose is to see which of these variables are associated with (without implying a correlation) where Starbucks stores are located. We are not doing any fancy geostatistical analysis but just overlaying data layers on top of it and eyeballing over them to find out if any interesting pattern immerges.", "To map the location data along with census variables I\u2019m implementing this exercise in R. Python has great libraries for this kind of work but I wanted to take advantage of the tidycensus package to work with census data. First, we need to install some libraries.", "To access data using Census Bureau API you\u2019ll need an API key. It\u2019s a simple process, just go to the Census Bureau website to request an API key and have it sent to your email. Load the key in your environment once you have it.", "Now we can go ahead and load Starbucks location data. The dataset has nation-wide Starbucks locations, and you can filter whichever state/geography you are interested in. I am filtering New York State.", "The next step is to import the census data from Census Bureau via tidycensus for variables of interest. I am accessing household income and population variables.", "Let\u2019s first take a look at how household incomes are distributed state-wide in New York.", "Not surprisingly, some highest-earning households are located in counties around NYC. I\u2019ll be zooming in to that area.", "But let\u2019s get the other variables first.", "First, let\u2019s put Starbucks locations on top of income data to see whether counties with high incomes have a high number of Starbucks stores. Again, I am zooming in on New York City area.", "So most Starbucks stores are located in the Manhattan area. But that\u2019s not where the highest household incomes are located, highest-earning households are rather in Nassau County (yellow polygon). We can infer that Starbucks stores are not necessarily located in rich areas, meaning that there is a weak (if any) association.", "Now let\u2019s try with the total population, and see if counties with a high population have a high number of Starbucks stores.", "In terms of population, Kings County (yellow polygon) followed by Queen County have the highest population in the NYC area, but that\u2019s not where most Starbucks stores are located either. That means, like income, the total population also seems to be a weak predictor of Starbucks store location.", "Finally, let\u2019s check if population density has anything to do.", "The highest population density is in the Manhattan area, and that\u2019s where the most Starbucks stores are also located. So there seems to have an association between location and population density, stronger than the total population of counties or household income.", "From these association analyses we have found that population density is a better predictor of whether there is a Starbucks store in the neighborhood and that income is a non-factor. However, making such generalization would be rather simplistic because there are other factors that I have not considered such as the age of the population, number of college students, ethnicity and so on. Also, we could test whether such association holds in other states and regions of the country.", "In this example, you have learned how to map location data and work with Census maps. You have also learned how to ask a question, test a hypothesis or even generate a new hypothesis. In future posts, I\u2019ll be taking point data analysis a step further, so stay tuned.", "Your home for data science.
