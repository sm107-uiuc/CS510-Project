In particular, these guidelines have curated the library shelves of elementary, middle, and high schools, effectively shaping the leaders and bookworms of tomorrow with a carefully selected list of just under 80 recommended texts.", "As a lover of books and data journalism, I was inspired to attempt a \u201cby-the-numbers\u201d look at these Common Core standards. Areas that were considered include the gender of a book\u2019s author, its date published, and its popularity based on Goodreads review data.", "The complete list of these titles can be explored in this PDF, as well as through an interactive table at the bottom of this article. I have also made the final dataset I used to produce analysis and visualizations available here.", "Although the Common Core State Standards Initiative (CCSI) applies to students from Kindergarten onwards, this analysis will focus on recommendations the program has made for students in 6th through 12th grade. English Language Arts recommendations can be segmented into two categories: \u201cLiterature: Stories, Drama, Poetry\u201d and \u201cInformational Texts: Literary Nonfiction and Historical, Scientific, and Technical Texts.\u201d It is also worth noting that Common Core standards have been adopted by most, but not all, states.", "For these seven years of education, Common Core standards recommend students read 38 specific texts. On this list, 26 percent of books are written by women (10/38) and 74 percent are written by men (28/38).", "This gender disparity becomes more pronounced when considering only Informational Texts\u2014recommendations which include primary sources and historical literature\u2014like the \u201cNarrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass\u201d or Abraham Lincoln\u2019s \u201cGettsyburg Address.\u201d Out of 18 informational texts, just one is written by a woman\u2014Ann Petry\u2019s \u201cHarriet Tubman: Conductor on the Underground Railroad.\u201d", "Conversely, the ratio within the Literature category is more even. 12 texts are written by men while 8 are written by women.", "Next, I examined when recommended texts were written. The visualization below displays a timeline in which books are binned into 50 year spans. As the chart illustrates, most titles in Common Core curriculums were written in the 19th or 20th centuries. The median date of publishing was 1920, although if the outlier of \u201cMacbeth\u201d (1592) is ignored, this median rises to 1925, precisely the year F. Scott Fitzgerald published \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d", "This graphic also indicates how more books tend to be selected from particular historically significant eras. For example, three informational texts are clustered around the dates of the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783).", "Just one book from the complete list of 38 was published in the 21st century: Jhumpa Lahiri\u2019s 2003 novel \u201cThe Namesake.\u201d", "Since each year students nationwide are assigned these same books, some more enthusiasm-generating than others, I was curious to determine how popular these curriculum keystones really are. For this task I turned to Goodreads, an online database of books with user-generated reviews and ratings.", "Note: 9 texts, including some essays and speech transcripts, were excluded from this analysis due to missing Goodreads data.", "On average, Common Core books received 4.02 out of 5 stars from Goodreads users. The most popular title on the list was Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d at 4.53 stars. The least popular was Laurence Yep\u2019s 1975 novel \u201cDragonwings,\u201d which was awarded 3.53 stars on average from over 3,500 user reviews.", "Although exact English Language Arts curriculums vary from one school district to the next, some noteworthy conclusions can still be drawn from this list of recommendations which claims to \u201cprepare all students for success in college, career, and life by the time they graduate from high school.\u201d It is apparent that while some effort seems to be made at presenting more diverse perspectives (from Shakespeare, to Emily Dickinson, to Lorraine Hansberry), stories and histories written by women are disproportionately represented in the Common Core catalogue, particularly within the genre of Informational Texts.", "Schools can always strive for more diversity in the perspectives they choose to teach. The significance of this objective holds true not just for gender, but also for topics of race, sexuality, and nationality. On the subject of multicultural and international literature, Junko Yokota, Director of the Center for Teaching through Children\u2019s Books, writes, \u201cIt is clear that culturally diverse literature can be and should be central to student learning, and well-selected, high-quality literature can have an impact on students\u2019 sense of self, and sense of others.\u201d", "Familiarity with the authors on this list suggests that most texts were written by white Americans, but specific numbers would require another analysis with a more detailed dataset.", "For the dataset I did use, information was first pulled directly from the Common Core website, then cleaned and pre-processed in Excel, and lastly new fields were added through independent research (mostly scouring the internet for author bios and Wikipedia pages). All charts and tables were made with DataWrapper and Adobe XD.", "If a given school does adopt the standards laid down by Common Core, their English students will read 38 books between 6th and 12th grade. Of these 38 books, ten will be written by women and 28 by men. The majority of these works, whether they are historical documents or literary classics, will have been published in the 1800s or early-to-mid 1900s. What will be their favorite? According to Goodreads users, one might likely say \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail,\u201d or maybe Michael Shaara\u2019s \u201cThe Killer Angels.\u201d", "As for measurements of author diversity aside from gender, demographics like ethnicity are beyond the scope of this project. However, important research is being done on the subject. For those interested in learning more about representation in classroom reading, I would recommend looking into the Center for the Collaborative Classroom and the Cooperative Children\u2019s Book Center, which produces an annual review of children\u2019s literature.", "Your home for data science.
