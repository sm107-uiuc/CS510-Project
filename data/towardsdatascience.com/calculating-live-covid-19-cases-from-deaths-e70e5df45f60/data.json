But what if the number is 2500 instead?", "Let\u2019s use simple maths and what we have learnt from other countries. I am in Mumbai, India right now and would like to calculate real cases on a day given the deaths at that day.", "To calculate true active cases, the calculation needs to be very country-specific and also requires enough cases to become statistically correct. If there is just one death so far, the below calculation might be incorrect.

This matches nearby with India\u2019s currently reported cases to some extent.
