Since receiving my first cd \u201cBig Willie Style\u201d by Will Smith in primary school, I have been listening to rap practically every day for multiple hours. From primary school till now, I acquired knowledge and experience in many fields including data and statistics, but of course the world of rap kept evolving too. In the recent history of hip hop a new subgenre known as \u201cmumble rap\u201d has emerged.", "Urban dictionary defines mumble rap as \u201cA form of music that sounds like a stroke victim trying to deliver a speech; it is often incomprehensible and illogical.\u201d. In my opinion, a good example of mumble rap would be Playboi Carti\u2019s @ MEH, of which the top YouTube comment reads \u201cSounds good, can\u2019t wait for the English version.\u201d. However, not every example is as clear, and some rappers do not want to be associated with the term \u201cmumble\u201d at all. So who gets to decide which rappers meet the criteria for being a mumble rapper? Since even the Wikipedia entry describes it as \u201cloosely defined\u201d, I decided to open my data toolbox to get a more objective indication on how much your favorite rapper is mumbling.", "My idea to test for mumble was pretty simple:", "Now of course, as with any software project, things didn\u2019t go as smooth as planned. I started working on this project about a year ago, but after running some initial tests it seemed the voice-to-text converter (Google API) really struggled with beats, instruments and other sounds in the background. The combination of extremely poor results and a ton of other project ideas, made me decide to give up on this one.", "Fast forward to early 2020, I saw a post on Reddit where someone created an online tool to extract vocals from songs. As this was the missing key, I got my hopes up again for completing this project. The basic concept to determine the amount of mumble remained the same:", "Except this time I would use the tool to extract the vocals first.", "Now let\u2019s get into a bit more detail on how I got the data and did the analysis.", "I encountered a variety of obstacles while gathering the data. The initial idea was simple: download tracks, remove the vocals and feed them into the API. However, I quickly found out that especially in the case of rap music, a whole song is often a bad representation of the recording artist\u2019s pronunciation. This is mainly because:", "This means the samples should be limited to verses. For each track, one verse would be used. Consequently, I had to trim all the songs and select the corresponding part of the lyrics. In summary, the process went like this:", "For getting the tracks I wrote a simple bot, but the trimming to select the right verse and the copy-pasting of the corresponding lyrics was tedious manual work. As the manual part took a tremendous amount of time, I had to limit my sample. I went with the following approach:", "Of Course more rappers and tracks per artist would yield better results, but as said before, the gathering of data was a very work-intensive task and luckily the results will show most rappers are pretty consistent over the course of different tracks.", "Along the way I realized rap music might have also become less comprehensible over time, given the increasing amount of slang (e.g. \u201cshizzle my nizzle\u201d). So I added 30 more tracks from Complex\u2019s \u201cThe Best Rap Song, Every Year Since 1979\u201d. This list contains more than 30 tracks, but since some of them overlap with what was already in the sample, it resulted in only 30 new tracks, giving a total of 180 tracks. I shared the complete table on Kaggle.", "Here you can find an overview of all the artists in the dataset and some key figures.", "Before starting the preprocessing I added an extra \u2014 fictional \u2014 rapper who I named \u201cLil Controlla\u2019\u201d. Lil Controlla\u2019 will act as a control group and so far only released two tracks:", "Lil Controlla\u2019 will help me in double-checking various parameters of the model.", "For the pre-processing, the following steps have been applied to both the original and the API-generated lyrics:", "Stemming is a common method in NLP used to reduce words to their word stem, base of root form. For example the words \u201cball\u201d, \u201cballing\u201d, \u201cballer\u201d, \u201cballers\u201d would all be reduced to the words \u201cball\u201d. For this analysis both the original as API-generated lyrics were stemmed. This is to allow more tolerance for the voice-to-text API. If the original lyrics is \u201cballers\u201d, but the API captures \u201cballer\u201d, one could argue it should not be punished for it, since you would easily be able to tell the difference from listening to the track. Often words will be stemmed to new words that are not in the English dictionary, but this should not be a problem as both the API as well as the original variants would be stemmed to the same base.", "Here you can find an example of a verse before and after preprocessing and stemming.

Those not interested in the technical aspects can skip this part and go straight to the results.", "From this part on I worked together with my friend dr. Frederik Caenepeel, a mathematician who shares an interest in coding, data and hip hop. During one of our many coding with pizza, hip hop and beer sessions, I told him about this idea and after brainstorming about the approach we decided to tackle it together. Frederik also deserves credit for the tedious work described above.", "In order to determine the similarity between the original lyrics and voice-to-text version, we used a combination of different measures and factors influencing those measures.", "The first, and most obvious, algorithm we used for comparing the original and computer-generated lyrics is Damerau-Levenshtein distance. The principle of this algorithm is pretty simple as it comes down to counting the number of manipulations it takes to make string A identical to string B. The starting point of the algorithm states there are three possible ways to manipulate text:", "Cardi B\u2019s \u201cI like it\u201d starts with \u201cNow I like Dollars, I like diamonds\u201d. However transcribed \u201cdollars\u201d as Dallas. Using Damerau-Levenshtein, we count two manipulations:", "Using this algorithm generated a score for each verse, allocating a quantitative description of the similarity. Before we applied this algorithm we removed the stopwords using Python\u2019s NLTK. You can find more information on this algorithm here.", "While Damerau-Levenshtein is sufficient for a lot of NLP projects, this particular case could also use a different approach. NLP projects are mostly focused on spelling or meaning, while in this case it\u2019s more about phonetic understanding. The objective is to hear whether or not you can understand the rapper, not necessarily if you capture the exact meaning or spelling of the word. Let me illustrate this with an example: if a rapper says the word \u201cnice\u201d and the API captures it as \u201cguys\u201d, there is not a single overlap in letters. However, from a phonetic point of view both words are very similar. For this reason we decided to add a layer of analysis that compares words by sound.", "SoundEx is a commonly used phonetic algorithm for indexing words by sounds. Wikipedia describes the algorithm as:", "The problem with this project is that the API did not necessarily grab every word, meaning the API-generated text is almost always shorter than the original lyrics. Consequently, one can not simply apply one to one word analysis using SoundEx. In order to overcome this, I generated two SoundEx lists: one for the API text and one for the original lyrics. By subtracting the former list from the latter, the remaining elements are those that have not been captured. Although this method is not perfect (given that similar sounding words in different places might cause conflicts), it does give a good indication on the performance of the computer-generated lyrics using phonetics as a metric.", "The third and last parameter we used, came up unexpectedly. As described in the data gathering, the songs were downloaded from YouTube and consequently trimmed with an online tool. The tool returned the trimmed version in waveform audio format (or simply .wav). Turns out, there was quite some inconsistency in the quality of the different songs. While most tracks were high quality, some outliers really had subpar audio quality. Feeding those negative outliers to the API resulted in very poor performance of transcribing the lyrics.", "For the human ear, it is not always easy to hear the difference, but by visualizing the amplitude it becomes very clear. The basic idea is, higher amplitude results in higher \u201cvolume\u201d or loudness.", "Here you can see examples of two tracks with greatly varying amplitude.", "The cause of this variance in amplitude is actually easy to explain. Remember, all of the tracks were downloaded off YouTube where the audio quality is set by whoever uploaded it. As YouTube is a relatively modern phenomenon, many tracks in this sample come from a pre-YouTube era. Unlike modern artists who have record labels upload their tracks in the highest possible quality, previous generations don\u2019t have any YouTube channels. The only way their tracks often end up on YouTube is by some fans uploading it themselves, often ripped from a CD. As a result, the older the track, the higher the probability the quality is bad which shows in the low amplitude.", "In order to express the quality in the single digit, I used power which is the energy per second. When plotting the average power per time period you can clearly see the trend over time.", "Disregarding 1975\u20131980 which only contains one track, you can see the quality greatly improves from 1995 onward. Even though we spent a lot of time and effort on preparing all the tracks, we decided to drop all tracks based on certain criteria as the impact of bad quality is just too high on the transcription performance.", "The criteria we came up with are:", "After this cut-off, the new selection of artists now looks like this:", "In order to combine the parameters we considered many different options including many more parameters like variance within the same rapper, track length, words per second, richness of vocabulary and many more. However, given the size of this (personal) project, not wanting to over engineer and the satisfying results with two parameters, we decided to bring it down to a very simple formula.", "Mumble score = (DamLev distance + Soundex score) / 2 *", "* Using amplitude as a prior criterium.", "Using this formula we obtained a \u201cmumble score\u201d for each track ranging from 0 to 1, with the following interpretation:", "0: Very bad score, track consists of nothing but mumbling.", "1: Perfect score, the lyrics are all perfectly understandable.", "Now the methodology is behind us, let\u2019s dive into the results!", "In this bar plot we can see an overview of all the rappers and their average score (higher score means less mumble). The color coding is used to identify the rappers WikiPedia (see introduction) refers to as mumble rappers. This chart confirms the hypothesis and clearly shows the so-called mumble rappers have lyrics that are on average way harder to transcribe using voice-to-text analysis. But let\u2019s get into some more detail.", "At the lower end of the spectrum we can find the mumblers. Those are the artists with the lowest scores. Again, the low score means the voice-to-text algorithm struggles to match their spoken/rapped words with the actual lyrics. Young Thug, Gunna and Playboi Carti are at the bottom, which is in line with the expectations given they are sometimes considered \u201cposter boys\u201d of mumble rap. I personally don\u2019t find it surprising either. If you listen to some of their tracks yourself, try to transcribe it yourself and you will understand where the low scores come from.", "When we look at the highest scores, the names aren\u2019t that surprising either. Dr. Dre, J Coles, NaS and Drake all articulate well and are easy to understand. Seeing J Cole at the top is particularly interesting since he is a known critic of mumble rap.", "In the middle we can find some rappers that have been \u201cmislabeled\u201d as mumble rappers or non-mumblers. Basically they are artists of which the media gives them a label that does not fully align with the data. For example 21 Savage is often categorized as a mumble rapper, but this experiment shows he actually articulates pretty well. On the other hand, someone like Lil Wayne seems to perform less than expected. However, the scores around the 0.5 mark should be interpreted lightly as the sample remains small and there are many other variables at play. The main focus on the results should be on the extremes: the top mumblers and the most articulate.", "Given that the sample per artist is small, it is particularly important to look into the variability of their scores. The standard deviation (easier to interpret) per rapper looks like this.", "For a simple interpretation, you could say the lower the standard deviation, the better the mumble score fits as a representation of the rapping skills.", "At the start of the project I used Wikipedia as a source to find which rappers are labelled as mumble rappers. Using this classification we can compare the average scores of both mumble and non-mumble group:", "The difference is clearly visible as the average performance of non-mumble or \u201cclassic\u201d rappers is significantly higher than the mumblers, confirming the hypothesis.", "Lastly we can look at the \u201cmicro-level\u201d and actually see the model performances on the best and worst tracks. Let\u2019s start with one of the best (and also a personal favorite) \u201cNo Role Modelz\u201d by J Cole (score 0.86).", "As an example for a low scoring track I opted for \u201c@ MEH\u201d by Playboi Carti with the infamous YouTube comment \u201cSounds good, can\u2019t wait for the English version.\u201d (score 0.09).", "Lastly, I would like to show an example of a \u201cmislabeled\u201d track. In other words, a track that obtained a score that is way lower/higher than you would expect when listening to yourself. In this it is the classic \u201cX Gon\u2019 Give It To Ya\u201d by DMX.", "When listening to the version we scraped and from which we removed the instrumentals, I was able to find one of the reasons for the bad API performance; all the explicit words have been censored which creates a lot of word gaps in the audio. It seems like the API struggles with this. Furthermore the amplitude of the track is also low which contributes to a poor score.", "When looking at the results by artist we can attribute the label mumbler or non-mumbler to some rappers with a certain degree of confidence. For example, J Cole clearly seems to be in the right position to distance himself from mumble rapping seeing that his scores are not only very high, but also show consistency. Other lyricists like Nas, Kendrick Lamar and Eminem also live up to their reputation. Among the \u201carticulate\u201d rappers we can also see huge names like Dr. Dre, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Drake.", "On the other side of the spectrum the expected mumblers live up to their reputation, with names such as Playboi Carti, Gunna, Young Thug and Lil Pump. So from now on, if you listen to their music and fail to understand what they are saying, know that you are not alone. From this point on you say it\u2019s not just you, a computer algorithm built for understanding human voice is struggling as much as you are.", "Evaluating the model as a whole, I am happy to say it is performing pretty well. The results are all in line with what you would expect or what you would see when rating the \u201cmumble\u201d yourself as a person. I am also surprised by the quality of the Google API, even with a lot of the mumble tracks it managed to grab and correctly transcribe a fairly big chunk. We can conclude the model is capable of making a sensible distinction between mumble rap and normal or \u201cclassic\u201d rap. I even feel confident to say 60% of the time, it works\u2026 every time!", "Finally, despite the overall performance there is still a lot of room for improvement. For example, rappers like DMX and Lil Wayne score way lower than one would expect. When taking more factors into account (like explicit language or slang), the score could be more accurate. The API also seems to struggle with speed, which shows in the lower score for Godzilla by Eminem. This brings us to a list of some improvements that can be made under \u201cFurther Research\u201d.", "Even though my friend and I spent a big chunk of time on this project, there is still tremendous space for improvement. Here I have listed some things that can be improved or could be explored further.", "This is probably the most important one. In the current project we only have about 5 to 8 tracks per artist, which is incredibly low. Due to the time-consuming task of extracting, trimming, converting and transcribing the audio, we were limited by our resources to dive deeper. Scaling up the number of tracks per artist to at least 20 should give more reliable results. Secondly, it would also be nice to include more artists overall. We tried to select the \u201cclassic\u201d rappers as objectively as possible (based on Google search results), but we know a lot of readers will disagree, because their favorite rappers are not in the list while an artist they dislike is. In conclusion, both the time per artist as the total number of artists should be increased.", "Aside from the data quantity, the quality can also be improved. Unfortunately, we had to remove a lot of tracks because of an amplitude that was too low. The audio quality on YouTube varies greatly. Ideally the tracks should be grabbed from a better source that guarantees high and equal quality for all tracks.", "The formula used to calculate the mumble score is currently very simple. We think it could improve by adding some parameters. For example, explicit language plays a role. In some of the tracks the swear words have been censored out. So while these words are written down in the original lyrics they can never be picked up by the API. Another factor could be the richness of vocabulary and words per second. Imagine we used the well known \u201cGucci Gang\u201d by Lil Pump, it would not be fair compared to other tracks. If the API would pick it up correctly, his score would be improved multiple times for the same text/words. Conversely, if the API would miss it, he would be punished multiple times. Having a greater/lower variety in vocabulary and higher/lower rate of words per seconds should be taken into account.", "While writing the article I quickly realized this could rapidly turn into a long read. As you can see in my other posts, I usually tend to explain every single step in my analysis making it possible for the reader to completely replicate the process. In order not to make it too long, I didn\u2019t go in detail over every single step. Because I have API credentials in my code I did not use a public notebook (for example using Kaggle) either. Doing this would make it easier for others to collaborate on the project and expand it with more data or improve the analysis. As mentioned earlier, I did upload the data which you can find here.", "If you can think of other improvements or adaptations, feel free to drop them in the comments below which could spark the discussion or inspire me for a follow-up project.", "Ffmpeg, Acapella extractor, Mp3cut.net, Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, nltk, SoundEx, SciPy, PyDub, NumPy, Pandas) and Power BI.", "About me: My name is Bruno and I work as a data science consultant for the European Commission.
