Here I\u2019m going to share with you the 7 most important things to consider and implement when designing business dashboards to up your data viz game. My top tips, if you will.", "Before you start adding charts to a report that you\u2019re planning on publishing, make sure that you have a clear idea of its contents and layout. What I recommend the first thing you do is to write down all of the queries, or questions you want to ask of your data. Make a list. It should contain:", "This last one isn\u2019t essential at this point though if you haven\u2019t done any data discovery to see the kinds of results you\u2019ll be working with", "Once you\u2019ve made your list, I then recommend taking a blank sheet of paper and a pencil and simply sketching out a rough drawing of how you would like your report to look. Nothing detailed, just a very rough sketch. Try and add in all of the queries from your list. Believe me, this will be a great help. You\u2019ll also find out whether you\u2019re going to need to have more than 1 page in your report and how you could potentially group certain queries together.", "What I mean by this is that your report is going to be \u201cread\u201d by its viewers, most likely from top left to bottom right, like a page of a book. That\u2019s just the way our brains are set up. So make sure there is some coherence to the report in terms of which queries you\u2019re showing where.", "Also, think about grouping queries together that contain data relating to the same area, activity or KPI. What you\u2019ll find with lots of reports that have multiple pages in them is that the first page will contain a kind of summary of the main headlines and the other pages will be dedicated to specific areas and go into more depth. So this is what I mean by telling a story.", "This tip is closely related to the first two and that\u2019s to Avoid TMI, or \u201cToo Much Information\u201d. What I mean by this is to not overload your report with charts and information making it difficult to read and understand.", "You should never be asking yourself \u201ccan I squeeze another couple of charts on the page/screen just to avoid going over onto a new one?\u201d Because usually what happens in these cases is that you either end up reducing the size of other charts, making them less easy to read. Or you move charts around on the page to try and accommodate more charts, which can mess with the story you\u2019re trying to tell. Or your charts will simply be too close together; and your data needs room to breathe. Rather than overloading your viewers with information, you could even do the opposite, be more minimalist and use as many pages as you need to make sure your data can be read properly.", "TMI also relates to individual visualisations. For example, don\u2019t have a bar chart with so many bars in it that it\u2019s hard to read and you can\u2019t see the labels properly. Remember, the idea is to make your visualisations as easy to read and understand as possible.", "This is a concept introduced by Edward Tufte, a data visualisation expert, in his 1983 book,The Visual Display of Quantitative Data.", "\u201cA large share of ink on a graphic should present data-information, the ink changing as the data changes. Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented.\u201d", "So essentially, what he\u2019s saying is that the majority of the ink needed to display (or print) a visualisation should be data ink. For example, the bars on a bar chart or the line on a time series chart. Wherever possible you should remove anything non-essential to the visualisation.", "This means things like the grid on a chart, axis labels etc. If the visualisation data can be read and understood without it, then remove it.", "A good example would be in a time series chart. The values on the x-axis are dates and obvious to the viewer. So you don\u2019t need to have an x-axis title label that says \u201cDate\u201d because it\u2019s redundant. An exception to this might be when you have more than one date in the data set and that needs specifying but you get the idea.", "If you\u2019re interested in learning more about data visualisation theory then I definitely would recommend you getting yourself a copy of The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (affiliate link).", "It\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re choosing the right visualisation type for your query you\u2019re creating. Here are some questions you might want to ask:", "All of these questions will help you decide which visualisation type best suits what you\u2019re trying to convey. The goal is to make your data as easy to understand for the viewer as possible and visualisation type plays a big role in achieving this.", "What I mean by this is don\u2019t go wild and start choosing a different colour for each visualisation. Keep your use of colour as simple as possible.", "You could use different colours to represent different areas in your report, so everything relating to sales in one colour, marketing another etc. But only when it makes sense to do so. I guess a rule would be that if you\u2019re going to use a different colour make sure that it\u2019s applied to more than one visualisation in the report.", "However, you will notice that the best designed reports and dashboards keep the colour scheme very simple.", "This relates to not only who is going to be viewing your report, but also how it\u2019s going to be viewed or consumed.", "On this first question, who, are they going to need to drill down into the data or filter it? If they are, you\u2019ll need to include these options when building your visualisations and designing your reports. How familiar are your dashboard viewers with the data that\u2019s being presented? This will determine how much description or non-essential information you have in visualisations to explain what is being presented.", "How the report is going to be viewed and consumed will have an impact on things like the orientation and size of your dashboard. Will it mainly be shared as a pdf that will be printed? If so, you\u2019ll need to make sure that it prints properly. You would also, in this case, perhaps need to add more information like displaying certain values in charts because you can\u2019t hover over a chart with your mouse to display values on a pdf.", "So you can see that there are many things to consider when it comes to your audience.", "So there you have my top 7 tips for better dashboard design to help take your reporting to the next level.
