Some people believe that there is a relationship between the number and the type of crime with the country\u2019s region, that\u2019s why in the following work an analysis will be made with the data from the National Survey of Victimization and Perception of Public Security ( ENVIPE ) 2018 (which aim to estimate the number of crimes committed during 2017) in order to be compared to Peace Index Mexico ( IPM) 2018\u00b9", "The data to be used are part of the National Survey of Victimization and Perception of Public Security ( ENVIPE ) 2018\u00b2 also we add the data from the number of homicides in each of the states\u00b3.", "All this data is reflected and group in a csv file named CrimesMX2017 and has the following content:", "* Crime prevalence rate by state per hundred thousand inhabitants", "A statistical summary of the data is shown below:", "It can be seen that the highest averages of number of crimes per hundred thousand inhabitants are:", "An interesting analysis is to show the different distributions of variables by state:", "For this analysis only the most important variables will be taken, these are:", "The correlation between these four variables will be shown below for a better perspective of the problem:", "Sometimes is better to see the numbers in a different way:", "It is observed that the highest correlations are:", "An essential step for the Cluster Analysis is standardization . In this process, the variables\u2019 data are re-scale to lie under the same weighing; thus, the data\u2019s similarity is determined. Standardization is necessary when the variables have different scales.", "One way to perform this task is to model the distributions of the variables as a Normal Distribution with mean \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3. The following formula is used to model such distribution:", "K-Means Algorithm seeks to find K number of clusters in a data set. This clusters have to be apart as they can be from each other and keep their elements as closely as possible.", "Cluster analysis is ideal to find patterns, client segmentation, and in our case, to find any similitude. However, the question is always the same: what is the K numbers that makes the number of clusters optimal?", "There are two ways to find the optimal number of clusters:", "The Elbow Method is the most popular way to find the optimal number of clusters in the data set selected. This method employs the Within Cluster Summed Squares parameter or WCSS parameter, this number is obtained with each group\u2019s centroid locations.", "* Centroid : Geometric point where the majority of the cluster\u2019s data is concentrated.", "Within Cluster Summed Squares (WCSS) is a parameter that represents the square distance from each data point to the cluster\u2019s centroid where it belongs.", "Different number of clusters give different WCSS parameters. If the WCSS parameter associated with every possible cluster of the data set is plotted, it will be obtained something similar to:", "The WCSS parameter decays as the number of clusters increase. The difference of WCSS \u2018s decrease between clusters diminishes. What is the optimal number of clusters? When the decrease difference is not significant.", "Looking at the image above, there is a significant difference when the number of clusters is 4; after that number, the difference between clusters is attenuated or not significant. In this example, the optimal number of clusters is 4.", "This method is called Elbow Method because the point where the decrease of the WCSS parameter starts to get less significant makes the graph looks like a semi-flexed arm, and the point that gives us the optimal number of clusters is the elbow.", "The optimal number of clusters is not not precise in this case.", "As observed, it is not always clear the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method; however, there is another option: The Silhouette Method.", "In order to use the Silhouette Method, it is necessary to obtain the silhouette score . This parameter indicates how appropriate the classification of a point is for the cluster in which it is located. The mathematical equation is:", "Each cluster corresponds to a silhouette score that is the average of all silhouette scores of all points in that same cluster, and the silhouette score of the model is the average of the clusters\u2019 values.", "he ideal case is when a is so small that (we can say) it tends to zero and b is so big that (we can say) tends to infinity, so the model\u2019s classification is excellent:", "this means that the worst case scenario is when a>>b , and the model\u2019s classification is the worst:", "In summary: The closer it gets to one the better. In this method we are trying to find the maximum value of the silhouette score to know the optimal number of clusters", "The Elbow Method is more of a decision rule, while the Silhouette is a metric used for validation while clustering. Thus, it can be used in combination with the Elbow Method.", "Therefore, the Elbow Method and the Silhouette Method are not alternatives to each other for finding the optimal K. Rather they are tools to be used together for a more confident decision\u2075 .", "Below it is possible to observe the combination of both methods in the crime problem in Mexico.", "In this case it can be seen that the optimal number of clusters is 5 and it is possible to apply it in the K-Means algorithm to obtain the separation of the data into clusters", "The following graph shows the correlation of each of the selected variables and each of the clusters in colour.", "The variables with the highest correlation (HOMICIDES, CAR_THEFT and STREET_TRANSPORT_THEFT) are taken and plotted together, and it is possible to appreciate much better the way in which the clusters are separated.", "The geographical location of each cluster is observed through a map created in the library folium\u2076, to identify the states by their corresponding cluster colour assigned by the K-Means algorithm.", "It is possible to notice that there is a geographical relationship in the way in which they were grouped, so here are some comments regarding the division of the clusters and the states they cover:", "Unsupervised learning can help show patterns or similarities that are not easily observed, especially when many variables are involved.", "When the K-Means algorithm is used to perform cluster analysis, the Elbow method, is a great tool to choose several clusters, although sometimes using this method, the optimal number of clusters is not so precise. The Silhouette Method is then used to find the maximum value (either visually or with software support). As mentioned earlier both methods are not alternatives to each other for finding the optimal K, they are tools to be used together for a more confident decision.", "With this exercise, it was observed that Machine Learning tools tools could be applied to studies from other areas such as the Social Sciences.", "These results obtained have some similarity with the results published in the document Mexico Peace Index 2018 found on the IMCO (Instituto Mexicano para la Competitividad A.C.) published on April 13, 2018\u00b9 \u2077.", "Your home for data science.
