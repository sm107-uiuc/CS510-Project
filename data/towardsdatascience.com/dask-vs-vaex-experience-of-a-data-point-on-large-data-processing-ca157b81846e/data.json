The official reason given was that Pandas moved on to new opportunities but all of us insiders knew what happened.", "Well, the truth is that the top level management was not pleased with Pandas\u2019 performance lately. Our company had grown quickly and business increased exponentially. Pandas was initially doing great but gradually find himself unable to cope with increasing data. When the full truckload of us data points arrives, we prove to be too much for Pandas to cope. Usually, we will sit in a large warehouse called hard disk, but when we need to be processed, there\u2019s this temporary storage room called Random-Access Memory (a.k.a. RAM) where we will be transported to for further processing. Here\u2019s where the problem lies: there\u2019s not enough space for all of us to fit into RAM.", "So our guess is that top management decided to replace Pandas with Dask and Vaex in order to grow the company further. It\u2019s sad but it\u2019s just business.", "Since the two new managers came, they each deployed a unique trick to handle us.", "With Dask, we get broken up into groups (or in his words, \u201cpartitions\u201d) and are processed one to a few groups at a time.", "With Vaex, each of us provides our address in the warehouse and Vaex calls those required to come over to RAM by our address when she needs us (she calls this technique \u201cmemory mapping\u201d).", "Anyway, the good thing is that the job gets done even though there are too many of us to fit in RAM all at once, and top management is now happy.", "We are quite used to Pandas commands after such a long time working together, so it helps that Dask and Vaex both tried to mostly order us with similar commands. But they are after all not Pandas so some differences remain.", "Dask likes a keyword called \u201ccompute\u201d. Before he says \u201ccompute\u201d, we are not to get fully processed. Dask always tells us to do things with the end in mind. So his procedures usually will be a series of Pandas-like command, then he will shout out \u201ccompute\u201d at his last major command and we get off to full actual work.", "Take for example the simple code below:", "Instead of the general statistics that you expect to receive, you will get this (basically no data shown):", "What happened was that when performing dd.read_csv, Dask only reads in a sample of us data points from the beginning of the CSV file. And when describe() is called, Dask merely takes note of the steps to take.", "To get the usual output that you receive from Pandas, you need the magic word \u201ccompute\u201d:", "For Vaex, she has her own style too. One notable difference is that she always wants us to perform train test split before any processing is done.", "That\u2019s because Vaex has a neat trick.", "Suppose we did some transformations on the training data:", "These same transformations can be easily applied to the test data through the following two lines of code:", "I asked Vaex the secret behind this trick and she told me that actually each of her DataFrame contains a state, which basically contains information of all transformations applied to the DataFrame.", "Hence, what we are doing in the two lines of code is to get the transformations information contained in the state of df_train and apply this state to df_test , and all the changes will be passed on.", "And in case you are wondering, the standardization transformation on df_test was applied using the mean and standard deviation of df_train.", "I guess she really knows how to work smart!", "Honestly in my opinion, Vaex seems more capable than Dask in terms of performance. Some of us like Dask so don\u2019t tell others what I said, else they might flame me. You also don\u2019t have to take my word for it, just look at what others (here and here) are saying.", "Despite being a high performer, Vaex is a little shy so she does not fit in as well with others, like Scikit-Learn, and typically needs some intermediary. Dask, however, works well with many others, given that he often socializes with Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.", "You may also note that Dask specializes to work in a cluster environment while Vaex outshines on a single machine.", "That\u2019s all for my sharing on my new managers Dask and Vaex for now! Hope my tips are useful and you will have a good time working with Dask and/or Vaex too. \ud83d\ude04", "Thanks for listening to my sharing and if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to let me know.", "Your home for data science.
