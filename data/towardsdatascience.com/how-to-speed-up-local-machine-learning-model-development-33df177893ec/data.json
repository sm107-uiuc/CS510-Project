In that time, I have been lucky enough to tackle a number of cool problems. From writing an algorithm to detect someone\u2019s gender based on a picture of their shoes, to using natural language processing to predict your next job given your CV to predicting the outcome of clinical trials, I have worked on a wide variety of problems.", "These problems are clearly quite different and have their own unique challenges. What interests me for this post, though, is not how these problems are different but what they have in common. Every time I have started coding-up a machine learning problem, I have had to write the same objects and functions to split the training and test sets, train the algorithm, perform cross-validation, save the trained model and so on. This has applied regardless of whether it is a natural language problem, a machine learning vision or any other type of problem.", "If you are developing your code in a hurry, you also write code that is badly structured. I don\u2019t need to tell you that badly structured code makes it a lot more difficult for anyone to pick up at a later date and means that it is less easy to spot mistakes.", "A further frustration I have had is in monitoring the model when the main structure is built. In my experience, building a machine learning model is iterative with a lot of experimenting with different versions of the data and different transformations, algorithms and hyperparameters.", "I have tried to solve this problem by recording the parameters and outputs of the \u2018main\u2019 runs of the model in an Excel spreadsheet but have found that this quickly becomes unwieldy. What happens if you need to switch the model back to a data/code combination that you ran last week? It can be tricky.", "To try and address these pain points, I have developed an object-orientated machine learning template which can be adjusted accordingly to your particular problem. I see this package as equivalent of building the foundations and structure of a house \u2014 there is still a fair amount of work to do before completion but it hugely accelerates the process.", "But first, let me take you through the two packages that I use for data and model version control.", "In the days before Git, changes to code were passed around as patches and archived files. This made it difficult for two or more people to work on the same code and made it hard to quickly switch to previous versions. The adoption of Git hugely improved the efficiency of software development.", "Machine learning currently feels like it\u2019s in the equivalent of the \u2018pre-Git\u2019 days. Sure, you can version control your code but most data scientists today don\u2019t version control their data or their model. This means that, you guessed it, it makes it harder to collaborate on a model and to switch to a previous versions. DVC and MLFlow are two packages (amongst others) that aim to help.", "DVC is a version control package for data. There are other packages for data version-control out there such as \u2018Git-LFS\u2019 but this has a number of issues (see this blog post for more details). What is clever about DVC is how it leverages the same concepts from Git into the world of data management. It is easy to store data on many different file systems (local, S3, GCP etc), it can deal with massive file sizes and it integrates seamlessly with Git. DVC is being actively developed and increasingly expanding its functionality to deal with improving model management and model deployment. A package to watch for the future.", "MLFlow is an open source package initially developed by Databricks for managing the whole machine learning life-cycle from experimentation right through to model deployment. If you look on their website, they have a ton of integrations with all the popular machine learning tools and an impressive array of companies are using and contributing towards it. I have only used the \u2018tracking\u2019 functionality of the package which makes it very easy to track different machine learning experiments on a good-looking user interface.", "So, using DVC for version controlling the data and MLFlow to log experiment results, I have created a Github package, ml-template, to help accelerate the process of developing machine learning models. My hope is that, when you are starting a machine learning project in the future, you will find it helpful to clone ml-template from Github and then tailor the code to your project.", "Now, of course, when any process is automated, is it always tempting to use the software on \u2018autopilot\u2019 and not to think about some of the default assumptions that are being made. In particular, every time you clone ml-template, I think you should think about the following:", "Also, here are a couple of tips for using the package most effectively:", "I hope that people find this package useful in setting up and managing their local machine learning model development better.", "Please do feel free to contribute and to suggest ways of improving the package further going forward.
