We need to first build a dataset first.", "The task for converting raw data into a dataset is called Feature Engineering.", "For example, let the business problem be predicting if a customer sticks to the subscription for a particular product. This would be further useful to enhance the product or the user experience, which will help for business growth.", "The raw data will contain details of each customer such as location, age, interests, average time spent on the product, the number of times the customer has renewed the subscription. These details are features of the dataset. The task of creating a dataset is to understand the useful features from the raw data and also, create new features from the existing features that have an impact on the results or, manipulating the features such that they are model ready or can enhance the results. This entire process is simply called Feature Engineering.", "There are various methods to achieve this. Based on the data and applications, each of these is used.", "In this article, we will understand why to use feature engineering and various methods to perform feature engineering.", "Feature Engineering comes in the initial steps in a machine learning workflow. Feature Engineering is the most crucial and deciding factor either to make or break the results.", "Many Kaggle competitions are won by creating appropriate features based on the problem. For example, in a car resale competition, the winner solution contained a categorical feature that has classes \u2014 normal car colors, rare car colors. This feature increased the prediction of the car resale. Now that we understood the importance of feature engineering, let us dive into various standard methods used to implement.", "Let us now understand how to implement feature engineering. Here are the basic feature engineering techniques widely used,", "Some algorithms work only with numerical features. But, we may have categorical data like \u201cgenres of content customers watch\u201d in our example. To convert such categorical data, we use Encoding.", "Converting categorical data into columns with each unique category as a column is One-hot Encoding.", "Here is the code snippet, to implement One-hot encoding,", "This is widely used when that categorical feature has less unique categories. We need to keep in mind as the unique categories of the categorical feature increases, the dimensions also increase.", "Converting categorical data into numerical by assigning each category a unique integer value is called Label Encoding.", "Like 0 for \u2018comedy\u2019, 1 for \u2018horror\u2019, 2 for \u2018romantic \u2019 randomly. But assigning so may lead to giving unnecessary ordinality to the categories.", "This technique can be used when the categories are ordinal (specific order) like 3 for \u2018excellent\u2019, 2 for \u2018good\u2019 and 1 for \u2018bad\u2019. In such cases, giving an order to categories is useful. And the values assigned need not be sequential.", "Here is the code snippet, to implement Label encoder,", "An opposite situation, occurring less frequently in practice, is when we have a numerical feature but we need to convert it into a categorical one. Binning(also called bucketing)is the process of converting a continuous feature into multiple binary features called bins or buckets, typically based on value range.", "The main motivation of binning is to make the model more robust and prevent overfitting, however, it has a cost to the performance. Every time we bin, we sacrifice some information.", "Normalization (also called, Min-Max normalization) is a scaling technique such that when it is applied the features will be rescaled so that the data will fall in the range of [0,1]", "Normalized form of each feature can be calculated as follows:", "Here \u2018x\u2019 is the original value and \u2018x`\u2019 is the normalized value.", "In the raw data, feature alcohol lies in [11,15] and, feature malic lies in [0,6]. In the normalized data, feature alcohol lies in [0,1] and, feature malic lies in [0,1]", "Standardization (also called, Z-score normalization) is a scaling technique such that when it is applied the features will be rescaled so that they\u2019ll have the properties of a standard normal distribution with mean,\u03bc=0 and standard deviation, \u03c3=1; where \u03bc is the mean (average) and \u03c3 is the standard deviation from the mean.", "Standard scores (also called z scores) of the samples are calculated as follows:", "This scales the features in a way that they range between [-1,1]", "In the raw data, feature alcohol lies in [11,15] and, feature malic lies in [0,6]. In the standardized data, feature alcohol and malic are centered at 0.", "To know more about feature scaling using normalization and standardization, check my article.", "The dataset may contain a few missing values. This may be while entering the data or due to privacy concerns. Whatever the reason may be, understanding how to lessen the impact of it on the results is essential. Here is how missing values can be handled,", "Data imputation is simply replacing the missing values with a value that wouldn't affect the results.", "For numerical features, the missing values can be replaced by,", "For categorical features, the missing values can be replaced by,", "In this article, we understood the basic feature engineering techniques which are widely used. We can create new features based on data and applications. However, if the data is small and soiled, these might not be useful.", "Thanks for the read.
