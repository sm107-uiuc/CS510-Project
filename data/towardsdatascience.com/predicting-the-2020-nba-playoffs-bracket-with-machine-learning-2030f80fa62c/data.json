All he had to do was to eat food from one of two boxes, identical in all aspects except for the flag of the contending national teams. As many regard octopuses as the closest to alien intelligence on Earth, one may wonder if the German invertebrate (no offence intended) knew some secret about football that presumably smarter hairless apes (a.k.a. humans) in fact didn\u2019t.", "The history of computer-based predictions of the outcome of sport events is long. A good account is told in Nate Silver\u2019s The Signal and Noise, a must-read for those who are interested in the subject. The book also reminds the reader that most of such predictions fails. However, especially since the advent of Deep Learning, applications of advanced statistical methods to sport events has become more and more important, leading for example to scouting of young players in baseball or to improved training e.g. to shoot 3-pointers in basketball. It is almost natural at this point in history to ask ourselves how much better than us artificial intelligence can be at making predictions about sports by exploiting historical data. In this post, we\u2019ll explore the possibility to predict the NBA playoff bracket and, who knows, perhaps even winning 1 million dollars.", "This year, the National Basketball Association (NBA) launched a challenge to encourage people to predict the outcome of all playoffs series (plus a tie-breaker) called the NBA Bracket challenge. Although the window to join the challenge is now closed and by the time of writing some results are already in, it is interesting to see in general how a machine learning system can be arranged to make such predictions. This is of course a rather simplified approach, although more advanced examples have been proposed in the past e.g. based on the principle of maximum entropy. I prepared a Google Colab notebook which you can use to play around. You also need input data which you can copy from this shared folder.", "To start with, we collect data from the Basketball reference website. Conveniently, one can download statistics about both regular season and playoff games. Here we restrict to years 1990\u20132019, and we\u2019ll use regular season data for 2020 to predict the 2020 bracket.", "For each team, and for each year, the following \u201cclassical\u201d features are available (per-game averaged):", "One can download all this data in CSV format, which can be easily manipulated as a Pandas dataframe.", "Not surprisingly, there are correlations among these features. To reduce the number of input features and to remove correlations as much as possible, it is customary to standardize (i.e. remove mean and scale the variance) and then apply a Principal Component Analysis decomposition to the inputs.", "To train the machine learning model, in this example just a shallow neural network, we assume that the regular season data contain enough information to predict the outcome of playoff matchups, which is a bit of a stretch but not too crazy either.", "From a technical perspective, one has to create an array of input examples and the corresponding labels. Naively, one may think the most obvious way to predict the results of the matchup is to ask the model to output the number of games won by each team, e.g. 4\u20131, 2\u20134, etc. As a matter of fact, this sort of multi-dimensional prediction is not necessary and in general can give rise to impossible results such as 3\u20133, 1\u20133, etc. The problem can be simplified significantly by realizing that the number of possible outcomes is finite. For example, since each series has to end at the best-of-seven (or best-of-five in the first round until 2005), only the following ones are allowed and hence can be encoded in a map:", "This way, we can ask the network to output the softmax probability of each of the 14 possible outcomes. This way, no impossible results can be obtained as output. The loss function in this case is sparse_categorical_crossentropy, which is basically a categorical_crossentropy which does not need to represent the labels as one-hot vectors but just as integer numbers, in this case corresponding to the index of the valid games results.", "The network can be trained for a few tens of epochs and small batch size. The key feature in this kind of plots is the necessary agreement between the training and the validation losses.", "To get the final results, the trained network is called multiple times, one for each matchup. To start with, it is necessary to define the names of the teams confronting each other. Each name is converted to a integer representing an index, which in turn is used to get the input features for a given team and for a given year (in this case 2020).", "The program then calculates the outcome of the first round, and based on the results, creates a similar list for the Conference Semifinals, then Conference Finals, and the Finals.", "So is this really the year of Giannis Antetokounmpo?", "Your home for data science.
