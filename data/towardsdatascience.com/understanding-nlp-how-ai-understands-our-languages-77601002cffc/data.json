We will first go through a brief history of NLP before machine learning. After that, we will go into the advancement of neural networks and their applications in the field of NLP, especially the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In the end, we will go into the SOTA models such as Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).", "\u201cLearning another language is not only learning different words for the same things, but learning another way to think about things.\u201d", "One of the first ideas in the field of NLP could be as early as in the 17th century.

Other languages such as Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic are totally different stories. Different from English, which can be described by a set of simple rules, Chinese grammar is extremely complex and sometimes too blurry to be defined with logical elements.", "The complexity of Chinese grammar and the fact modern machines are based on logic circuits, maybe the reason why popular programming languages are often in English.

Please refer to a more professional documentation if you seriously wanted to know how exactly compilers work.", "The compiler uses a CFG to interpret code written in human-readable programming languages. It will break down the logic of the code and interpret the recursive logic out from it. To understand how the code is broken down into recursive logic, it is better to represent the process as an AST. Below is an illustration of an AST constructed out from the code.", "CFG is used to describe the rules converting between the input language and the output tokens. Inside the file that defines the compiler, it is usually written in the way shown below:", "These CFG basically define the rules on how if and condition statements can look like. For example, a condition statement can be multiple condition statements (\u201cexpr\u201d means itself, which is \u201ccond_stm\u201d in this case) linked with and statements (\u201cand_stm\u201d, which is represented as \u201c&&\u201d in the code), or simple numerical connected by comparators such as \u201c>\u201d or \u201c<\u201d. The compiler will iterate through the code and see if it matches the rule defined by its CFG, and then extract the recursive reasoning then try to convert it to machine code.

These models based on how neuroscientists think our brain works have shown some competitive performance in recent years.", "Neural networks, as well as other machine learning models, generally takes inputs in the form of numerical vectors. But our English words are not numerical. That is why we have word embeddings. Word embeddings refer to language modeling and feature learning techniques converting words and phrases from the vocabulary into numerical vectors. One example may be running through thousands of paragraphs with a neural network to collect which words are more often seen with another, thus giving them closer values.", "One famous collection of word embedding models maybe Word2vect. The model is based on a shallow neural network and assumes words that are close to each other inside paragraphs also share similar semantic values. Below is a video explaining it.", "RNN is a variation of the neural networks, best at processing sequential data. Data such as sound waves, stock histories and natural languages are considered sequential. RNN is a neural network where the output is fed back into the network during the process of sequential data, allowing it to also take consideration of past states.", "In our natural languages, the context of a sentence is not always represented by the context in the words. The sentence \u201cOther reviewers think the food was great but I think it was not good\u201d for example, has 2 words that have a positive meaning (great and good).

This is exactly why we needed LSTM. LSTM introduces a \u201cforget layer\u201d that decides the information that should be kept or forget, making the model easier to train under large amounts of data. LSTM has 3 cell states, the forget state, the update state, and the output state, each serves different purposes.", "During the forget state, LSTM will retrieve information from the input and the previous state. A sigmoid function \u03c3 is then used to decide whether the previous state should be forgotten. The sigmoid function will output a value between 0 and 1. By multiplying it with the output from the previous state it will decide how much of the previous state should be forgotten.", "During the update state, LSTM will try to update state value. A hyper tangent function tanh will softly force the value to lie between 0 and 1 so it does not accumulate into some crazy numbers. Another sigmoid function is used to determine how much of that will be added into the cell state.", "Finally, the cell state will be processed by another hyper tangent function. Then a sigmoid function is used to determine how much of it will be feed into the output.", "More on LSTM and its training with detailed explanations in math can be found here.", "Congratulations! We have finally made it to the point where we can go into the SOTA models such as HAN and BERT. We are going over HAN first not because one model is superior to the other, simply because HAN is easier to understand and may help with the understanding of BERT.

One letter falls, and the entire language falters.\u201d \u2014 Vera Nazarian", "It is difficult for conventional RNN and LSTM to interpret large amounts of text where some of the keywords are wide-separated from each other. This is why the attention mechanism in HAN generates an importance weight \u03b1 from the context vector u. This importance weight is then used to selectively filter out the output that is worth the attention.", "HAN utilizes 2 main layers to classify texts \u2014 the word layer and the sentence layer. The word vectors are first fed into encoders consist of bidirectional GRUs. Bidirectional GRU is just GRUs with opposite directions stacked on top of each other. The output is then used to calculate the attention along with the context vector, and the output will be feed into the encoders in the sentence layer to go through a similar process. The final output vector will be summed up and feed into a softmax layer.", "For a detailed explanation of HAN, its mathematical details and its performance on Yelp reviews, please refer to the original paper.", "And finally, we have made it to what the title suggests. In order to understand this section fully, we may have to understand extensive mathematical reasonings. These can be found in the original paper for the Transformer and BERT. In this article, we will only be going over the basic architectures.", "First, let us take a look at the encoder-decoder architecture. In machine translation, the encoder-decoder architecture is used quite often because the source text and the target text does not always have a one to one matching. An encoder is first used to produce an output value from the input message, and it will be taken by the decoder to generate the output message.", "\u2014 Title of the original paper of Transformer", "In 2017, researchers from Google proposed an architecture solely based on self-attention. Self-attention means that instead of taking the attention score externally, the model decides the attention on its own by interpreting the input.", "There are 3 different types of vectors, the query vector Q, the key vector K, and the value vector V. These vectors can be understood as a data search mechanism.", "The Scaled Dot-Product Attention first multiplies Q and K, then multiplies it with V after some conversion shown in the diagram. The Multi-Head Attention concatenates the heads retrieved from the Scaled Dot-Product Attention. Mask is used to filter out some of the values. The mechanism is a bit complicated to explain shortly, here is an article that offers a more detailed explanation of the attention mechanism.", "The Transformer is an encoder-decoder architecture based on Multi-Head Attention. Since the Transformer uses a simplified model and no longer consider positional information like RNN, both Input Embedding and Positional Embeddings are applied to the inputs to ensure the model also catches positional information.
