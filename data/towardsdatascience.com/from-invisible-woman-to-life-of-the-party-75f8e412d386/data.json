Pretty interesting, right? Not in San Francisco it seems.", "In Australia, my group of friends had diverse backgrounds and occupations. I liked how we all had different points of view. It makes conversations so much more interesting when you can hear from people whose opinions and experience differ from your own. Amongst my friends there were lawyers, teachers, accountants, nurses, beauticians and many more different professions.", "Not only is it helpful to know people with all of these different expertise, but it kept life from getting boring. I don\u2019t know about you but when I leave work I don\u2019t want to keep talking about my work during my time with friends. That would be extremely monotonous. Instead I like my conversations with friends to give me new ideas on how to approach things.", "My work is only one part of who I am.", "I need my friendships to nurture my whole self, not just the professional part of me. So I like to surround myself with people who share some of my values and interests but that also differ from me.", "When completing my PhD I had a tendency to become tunnel visioned. My research would always be ticking away in the back of my mind. So it was important to spend time with people outside of science to give my brain a breather. It kept me from getting too wrapped up in my own work.", "I am a firm believer that people\u2019s jobs can be interesting, but they are rarely the most interesting thing about a person. I enjoy hearing about people\u2019s passions. For example I have friends in Adelaide who enjoy downhill dirt bike riding, crochet, studying ancient Egypt, ballet, bellydancing, swing dancing and performing in a choir.", "Moving to the other side of the world was hard, I left my friends and family behind to pursue my career as researcher. I made an active effort to meet new people and make a new friend group. However, I found my reception at tech heavy gatherings less than welcoming.", "Social gatherings were often less about being social and more about gaining an edge. The bay area is very transient. People tend to come to mecca of tech to do tech. Everyone is looking to make contacts which makes it harder to make real friends. You know the kind you can have a real conversation with. Just hang out and have a cup of tea rather than having to plan exciting outings.", "People seemed completely uninterested in hearing about me, once they found out that I didn\u2019t work in tech. Have you ever had someone ghost you mid conversation? Seeing the change in their eyes as they go from assessing your potential to ignoring you to scan the room for another prospect, it leaves quite an impression.", "All that changed once I got my first data science job in a San Francisco startup. I suddenly became one of the cool kids, people wanted to hear all about me. It was disconcerting how much my perceived value was tied to my profession.", "You want to know why tech has an inclusivity problem? Tech doesn\u2019t value people who are not in tech.", "My research aimed to help people with brain tumours or prevent them from growing in the first place. Most people outside of San Francisco found it interesting.", "Let me give you the high level pitch.", "Cancer treatments have gotten better in recent years. With earlier detection and these new treatments, more people are surviving their primary cancer. Today many cancer fatalities are due to cancer spreading to other parts of the body. These secondary cancers can be very difficult to treat.", "Breast cancer often spreads to the brain. The blood brain barrier should stop the cancer cells getting from the blood circulation into the brain, but for some reason it doesn\u2019t. Scientists don\u2019t know why the cancer cells can get through. My Phd research investigated how cancer cells get past the blood-brain barrier into the brain. Kind of interesting right?", "In my post doc I was looking at how normal cells turn into cancerous ones in the brain. Most of the cells in the brain are highly specialised and so don\u2019t divide anymore. Generally it is the cells that divide the most frequently that gain genetic mutations which cause cancer. Stem cells are one of the few cell types in the brain that still divide. The lab I was in investigated if neural stem cells are the cells of origin for brain cancer.", "If we were right, this would mean that we might be able to develop an early intervention or medication to prevent brain tumours forming in the first place. The only thing better than a cure is prevention when it comes to cancer.", "Before I moved to San Francisco, people I met were interested to learn more about how the brain works and why there is no cure for cancer. However all that changed when I was living in Silicon Valley.", "I moved to San Francisco with my boyfriend who worked for a tech startup. We went to a lot of tech parties and startup launches. I was attending these parties and mixers with the aim of meeting new people and making friends. I didn\u2019t want to feel lonely living in a new place. So it was disheartening to find out that people were less than interested in making my acquaintance.", "Being a woman in tech is hard, being a woman not in tech can make you invisible.", "Tech parties felt cliquey and I was not part of the crew, not yet anyway. In tech you make friends at work. They were interested only in networking, fundraising and recruiting for their startups.", "When my boyfriend would introduce me to people at these events, they would initially ask me what I did. When I would tell them about my research I got a very different response to what I got in Australia. People in San Francisco seem to be way more obsessed with people\u2019s jobs than Aussies are.", "Their eyes would glaze over and slide past me onto the next person. Or they would start looking over my shoulder to see who else was there. In one instance a guy even did a comical about-face and walked away in the other direction like he was in a drill team.", "Their behaviour seemed pretty rude to me. They could not even feign interest to be polite. People were looking to get something from the people they met, if I couldn\u2019t help them, then they needed to move on fast.", "There were a few exceptions, but I was largely ignored. People in the startup world did not seem at all interested in me or what I did.", "It seemed like once they realised that I had no immediate value to impart to their budding startup businesses, they wanted to move on as quickly as possible. These people were hardcore networkers and had quickly decided there was nothing they could gain from knowing me. Thus, they did not want to waste their time making polite chit chat.", "It did make me wonder if San Francisco was the place for me. These were people that I didn\u2019t know from a bar of soap. So if they were not interested in talking to me, I could get over it? But then it kept happening.", "After a few very boring evenings, it made me wonder if I would ever make friends in Silicon Valley if I didn\u2019t have a tech job. I would stand awkwardly in a group of people listening and not contributing much to the conversation.", "I felt quite out of place at most of these parties. They were predominantly frequented by white males in their 20s or 30s . I was one of the few women there and one of the few people who were not working in tech.", "I also wonder if part of the unenthusiastic response that I received could be due to the type of people who are often attracted to a career in technology. It is possible that some of the people that I met lacked confidence talking to people who are not in tech. Perhaps they did not value small talk and struggled with communication that is not related to technology.", "Whilst living in San Francisco, I decided to trade cancer research for data science. The lure of the tech scene was too much for me. If you would like to read more about how I made this career change you can find details in some of my previous stories like \u2018How I went from zero coding skills to data scientist in 6 months\u2019.", "The lure of better pay, better conditions and more immediate impact led me to get a data science job at a Silicon Valley healthcare startup. I started to work on analysing huge quantities of healthcare claims data to help Americans make better healthcare decisions.", "So I had entered the hallowed startup sphere, not only is the grass greener but there is a gardener to take care of it for you. Working in tech completely changed how people looked at me.", "I suddenly became popular. People I met at tech events wanted to pitch me their ideas. Sometimes in hopes that I would introduce them to people that I knew. Other times they wanted me to join their team.", "They asked me about the team I worked on, how the flow of work was, what I liked, what I didn\u2019t and lots of follow up questions.", "It was such a strange feeling to go from social outcast to being one of the popular kids. Even though people were literally hanging on my every word, like I was about to reveal the secrets of life, it felt hollow. I could always feel the ask coming, where they would inevitably want something, something they thought I could bring to their own endeavours.", "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of another, always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means.", "I certainly got the impression that I was more of a \u2018means to an end\u2019 rather than an end in itself. I guess that my previous experience being ignored made me cynical and suspicious. Which are not qualities that I found attractive in myself. So I worked to try to change my attitude and look at each new interaction with fresh eyes.", "I guess it is not so bad that people were doing their best to get their startups off the ground and make what connections they could. It just would have been nice if they didn\u2019t make me feel judged in the process. I also think that they would have had more success in finding what they wanted from people if they were more genuinely interested in them and what they had to say. But that is just my humble opinion.", "Parts of the tech industry can be very cliquey and elitist even when you are on the inside. So many of the friends that I initially made in San Francisco were not from the world of tech.", "I made friends through my post doc with my coworkers. The other avenue that I found useful for meeting people was through my hobbies. Whilst living in the Bay Area I took a lot of circus classes. I tried out flying trapeze, aerial silks, lyra and acrobatics, all of which attracts a weird but wonderful crowd.", "Ultimately once I was a data scientist at a San Francisco healthcare startup I made great friends with many of my coworkers. Interestingly these were tech people who had a vast array of outside interests. Two were authors, one created a tech magazine, one used to be a monk, one was in a band that played at Bottle Rock, one was a qualified skydive instructor, one was an awesome guitar player, one creates stunning light art installations. I could go on but you get the idea.", "So in the end I found my tribe within the tech industry. I felt like these friends approached me as a whole person, rather than just a collection of skills and connections. It made such a difference to have a circle of people I could be completely myself with.", "Finding my people within the tech sphere also helped me to enjoy all the adventures that San Francisco has to offer. With my colleagues I had the chance to go sailing on the bay, see Alameda\u2019s got talent before a movie screening, attend Bottle Rock a music festival where my friend was on the bill, see classical guitarists I had never herd of at Yoshis in Oakland, go skiing in Taho, attend Hardly Strictly Bluegrass and many many more. I never would have found out about all these things without the people I met there.", "So once I had these supportive people around me the bay area felt much more like a second home.", "In addition to data, my other passion is painting. You can find my wildlife art at www.katemarielewis.com", "Big data geek, neuroscientist and artist."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
