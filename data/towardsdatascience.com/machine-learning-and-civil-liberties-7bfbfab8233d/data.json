Loomis denied participating in the shooting, but plead guilty to two of the charges: attempting to evade a traffic officer and operating a vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent.", "During the sentencing phase, Loomis provided information to the court which which was to perform a COMPAS risk assessment scoring that was requested by the court.", "COMPAS is a predictive analytics tool that estimates the risk of recidivism \u2014 that is committing additional crimes in the future \u2014 using information provided by the offender and information from the individuals\u2019 criminal history to categorize their profile against that of the profiles that the predictive analytic algorithm was trained on.", "Based on information from the case and the COMPAS risk assessment score, the court sentenced Loomis to the maximum of six in prison and five years of extended supervision \u2014 nearly the maximum sentence for the two crimes he plead guilty to. Apparently the COMPAS score categorized Loomis as a high risk for recidivism, and this was factored into the judges sentencing decision.", "Perhaps because of the seemingly disproportionate sentence for the two crimes, Loomis appealed the sentencing on the basis that the court relied on the COMPAS risk assessment score. By doing so, he argued that it infringed on his \u201cright to be sentenced individually and to be sentenced based on accurate information.\u201d He further argued that he was unconstitutionally sentenced on gender as the COMPAS algorithm took gender into account.", "These arguments stemmed from the fact that COMPAS was provided to the government of Wisconsin by a private company, Equivant. Because of this arrangement the COMPAS algorithm is proprietary and confidential information of the company. Neither the government of Wisconsin nor the defendant have access to information about how the model was trained, which inputs are weighted in any particular way, and how the individual in question compares specifically to the training data used.", "The Wisconsin Supreme court upheld the sentencing, dismissing the due process concerns. The Court found that the COMPAS tool only used publicly available information and information provided by the individual, so Loomis could have verified the accuracy of it. Additionally, the appellate court found that the lower court did provide an individual sentencing because even though the score was aggregate compared to broad group of similarly situated individuals, the court had discretion in the ultimate decision and could have disagreed with the COMPAS assessment.", "This is the common fear or complaint about the \u201cblack box\u201d nature of machine learning predictive analytics, especially those employed by more sophisticated models. There has been substantial coverage and reporting on the risks associated with machine learning programs currently being used in the realm of criminal justice in the United States and other countries. However, these concerns should apply to all areas where machine learning is integrated into Government decisions.", "The Black Box of machine Learning. In a now famous analogy, machine learning, especially more sophisticated techniques such as neural nets and deep learning have created a black box where outputs of models cannot be reversed engineered in a way where parties can know the specifics of an individual result. This has been well documented, and continues to be vigorously debated in machine learning ethics forum.", "Many decisions made about an individual have the prospect of being significant and life-altering. For instance, the decision of financial institutions regarding the extension or credit or a loan will directly impact someone\u2019s ability to buy a house or start a business. Similarly, decisions made by health care providers and insurance companies can directly impact an individual\u2019s health or life expectancy.", "Decisions made by government agencies and administrators can be just as life-changing, if not more so. This is because the government is uniquely positioned to make decisions about a person in ways that private entities cannot. Examples are a person\u2019s citizenship status, decisions about their financial obligations to the country (taxes), decisions about their civil liberties (being arrested or imprisoned), and decisions about their children (social services).", "Because of the expansive authority of the government over our lives, we have created procedural checks and balances in the United States to ensure that citizens and individuals have clarity on their personal rights versus the governments rights, as well as clear guidelines regarding how decisions will be made, and mechanisms by which they can interact with the government and request review of these decisions.", "The basis for many of these is the constitution, but there are also many laws and regulations allowing for transparency of government decisions, mechanisms to appeal decisions, and judicial review of decisions.", "In criminal justice context, like the case of Loomis, the fourth and fifth amendments to the constitution is the foundation rights for individuals in the United States which tried to balance individual and government rights and authorities. These amendments combine to protect against \u201cunreasonable\u201d privacy infringements and searches without due process.", "There is considerable research about how new technologies have impacted how the courts in the United States have applied Fourth amendment protections. Most notably, there has been a trend away from merely interpreting them to apply to protections against unreasonable search of a person\u2019s property to protecting a their privacy, or what could reasonably be expected to remain private in our society.", "The courts dealt with many changes in how this appears. From having to worry about a person physically listening outside on your window to wiretaps of public pay phone booths (which was ruled to be reasonably considered to be a private space). Recently the Supreme Court came closer to addressing big data privacy concerns against fourth amendment protections.", "This landmark case is United States v. Jones, which was an appeal of a conviction of a man for trafficking drugs which relied on data obtained via a GPS tracker on his car for a month. While the court overturned the conviction on a technical breach of the search warrant obtained for the tracking, the judges focused heavily on the fourth amendment protections which they believe were infringed based on the sheer amount of data collected.", "This was a new twist from prior rulings which upheld the citizens have no right to privacy for actions carried out in public. Driving your car is in public, therefore the fourth amendment does not protect tracking your driving. However, in this instance the judges made the differentiation that it was unreasonable for an average citizen to expect that all of their driving for a month period would be tracked and cataloged, therefore this GPS search violated Jones\u2019 rights against unreasonably search. This has since been termed the \u201cmosaic effect\u201d, where greater levels of publicly available information can be compiled and combined in ways that potentially violate a persons privacy.", "From GPS to big data. Similarly to GPS providing new ways for law enforcement to track potential suspects, big data and machine learning have also been implemented by government agencies in order to target police patrols, to categorize risk of individuals interacting with police, to quantify and predict where crimes will occur, and as we saw with Loomis to inform sentencing based on risk of re-offending.", "Many of these machine learning programs are created by private companies for the government. Therefore, like with COMPAS, the details of how they are designed, trained, and maintained are not know by the government of the citizens they effect. Since the Loomis case there has been extensive coverage of COMPAS purporting to show that it is biased and its predictions are not very accurate.", "Beyond these very real concerns, there also are concerns about the extent to which the government can use these technologies to create profiles and amass information about citizens without specific fourth amendment and privacy controls. Under the mosaic effect this public information can be used to profile citizens in ways that the government could potentially know information that would reasonably expected to be private.", "Under the current construction of the fourth amendment, this should trigger a prohibition against the government using this information or compiling information under these ways which out a specific enumerated concerns which is reviewed and approved by an independent entity.", "In Jones, the Supreme Court stopped short of requiring this prohibition and process, but arguably our government will have to deal with the reality of machine learning and predictive analytics in a number of different contexts where the government is encouraged to exploit every advantage they can; such as policing, criminal justice, intelligence, and other areas where there is tension between enforcing laws and protecting individual privacy and providing due process.", "We do not have a great track record in the United States of proactively resolving theses issues. More likely, we will have to wait until there is a judicial situation which forces the court to make a legal ruling to better define where these lines should be drawn. Just as likely is that a similar situation will enter the country\u2019s political and media awareness in a way that focuses public attention which forces legislative action that better defines these lines and requirements.", "In either situation though, the trigger will ultimately be a situation where many reasonable citizens believe that the government has used these technologies in a way that infringes on our opinions of our privacy rights and which threatens a \u201csurveillance state\u201d\u2014 bringing with it chilling effects on other rights such as freedom of speech and expression.", "My personal hope though, is that citizens, corporations, and politicians can begin to discuss these considerations in effective ways to lay the groundwork for laws, policies, and procedures to allow the government to benefit from these technologies in ways which benefit our country without negatively impacting the rights that are the foundation of our national and society culture.", "Your home for data science.
