More specifically it was about data extraction. Based on some predefined topics, my task was to automate information extraction from text data. While doing research and checking for the best ways to solve this problem, I found out that Hugging Face NLP supports zero-shot text classification.", "What is zero-shot text classification? Check this post \u2014 Zero-Shot Learning in Modern NLP. There is a live demo from Hugging Face team, along with a sample Colab notebook. In simple words, zero-shot model allows us to classify data, which wasn\u2019t used to build a model. What I mean here \u2014 the model was built by someone else, we are using it to run against our data.", "I thought it would be a useful example, where I fetch Twitter messages and run classification to group messages into topics. This can be used as a starting point for more complex use cases.", "I\u2019m using GetOldTweets3 library to scrap Twitter messages. Zero-shot classification with transformers is straightforward, I was following Colab example provided by Hugging Face.", "I scrape 500 latest messages from Twitter, based on a predefined query \u2014 \u201cclimate fight\u201d. We are going to fetch messages related to climate change fight into Pandas data frame and then try to split them into topics using zero-shot classification:", "In zero-shot classification, you can define your own labels and then run classifier to assign a probability to each label. There is an option to do multi-class classification too, in this case, the scores will be independent, each will fall between 0 and 1. I\u2019m going to use the default option, when the pipeline assumes that only one of the candidate labels is true, returning a list of scores for each label which adds up to 1.", "Candidate labels for topics \u2014 this would allow us to understand what are people actually talking about climate change fight. Some messages are simple adverts, we would like to ignore them. Zero-shot classification is able to detect adverts pretty well, this helps to clean the data:", "I\u2019m going in the loop and classifying each message:", "Then I\u2019m checking the classification result. It is enough to check the first label, as I\u2019m using the default option when pipeline assumes only one of the candidate labels is true. If the classification score is greater than 0.5, I\u2019m logging it for further processing:", "From the result, we can see that political topic dominates climate change fight discussion, perhaps as expected. Topics related to emission and emergency are close to each other by popularity. There were around 20 cases of adverts from scrapped 500 messages:", "Let\u2019s see some examples, for each topic.", "Classification results are very good, I think Hugging Face zero-shot model does a really good job. Sample sentences from above didn't have direct mention of the topic label and still, they were classified correctly.", "Unsupervised text classification with zero-shot model allows us to solve text sentiment detection tasks when you don\u2019t have training data to train the model. Instead, you rely on a large trained model from transformers. For specialized use cases, when text is based on specific words or terms \u2014 is better to go with a supervised classification model, based on the training set. But for general topics, zero-shot model works amazingly well.", "Your home for data science.
