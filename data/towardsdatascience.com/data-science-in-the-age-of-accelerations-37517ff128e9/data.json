As a data scientist in 2013, my company paid for me to take a course on MapReduce. But by 2014, Google had abandoned MapReduce as its primary processing model for large data, leading to questions like, is MapReduce already obsolete or outdated? Is there any benefit of using it over newer alternatives? Is there still a future for MapReduce?", "In only 7 years as a data scientist, I\u2019ve watched many technologies come and go. Some, like MapReduce, I got to on their decay into obsolescence. Others, like computational notebooks, I caught on as a practitioner and continue using to this day. Yet for new ones, like deep learning frameworks, it\u2019s the data scientists I manage who have had the time and exposure to master them while I only offer strategic advice on their design and use.", "Part of the accelerated lifecycle of these technologies is due to the infancy of data science and my progression into management, but much of it reflects a radical, structural shift in how our world works. As Thomas Friedman argues in Thank You for Being Late: An Optimist\u2019s Guide to Thriving in the Age of Accelerations, the world is experiencing a series of accelerations \u2014 across technology, globalization, and climate change \u2014 that require people to adapt more and faster as the world changes across many domains.", "And data science as a profession is no exception.", "The accelerating treadmill of data science as a profession has significant implications for how data scientists work and how their managers and executives hire, mentor, and retain them. Specifically, they require each of these groups to optimize for learning.", "My first job out of graduate school was as a data scientist at The Walt Disney Company. It required me to program in SAS, build production-level machine learning models, and consult with clients. On my first day at work, I\u2019d never coded in SAS, worked as a consultant, or built such models.", "Things didn\u2019t change as my career progressed. Before my second job as a senior data scientist, I\u2019d never led a digital analytics team. Before my next job as a principal data scientist, I\u2019d never built fraud models for a bank. Before my last job as head of data science, I\u2019d never grown and headed a data science practice. And before my current job managing a data science team focused on legal economics, I hadn\u2019t worked with lawyers or in economics.", "Throughout, I had to optimize for learning: directly and indirectly absorbing know-how from more senior colleagues and direct managers, teaching myself online from question-and-answer sites like StackOverflow and learning platforms like Coursera, reading technical books, and attending data science Meetup events and conferences.", "I didn\u2019t learn all I should as quickly as I could have, but I learned enough to grow as a data scientist and, eventually, into a data science manager. I made many mistakes along the way, but I learned lessons from each one and didn\u2019t repeat them over time. It wasn\u2019t always easy or simple, but optimizing for learning helped me stay afloat as a data scientist.", "Every time I was hired as a data scientist, I lacked a critical role- or domain-specific expertise that the position would require from me to be successful. As a hiring manager, I\u2019ve also interviewed and hired data scientists who didn\u2019t have all of the required experience for the job that they would do on my team. And the job descriptions that I write and interview processes I create with my teams anticipate this.", "I can\u2019t always hire someone who\u2019s already done the same work before \u2014 sometimes, the type of work is too new for someone to have already done it. I also can\u2019t always hire someone with the perfect credentials \u2014 most professional data scientists don\u2019t have degrees in data science, which are a relatively new phenomenon.", "Even if I found a data scientist who has done identical work before or has a data science degree tailored to the job, the role I\u2019m hiring them for is likely to be different a year from now: it will require novel skills, use new technologies, and involve solving different problems.", "My goal as a hiring manager is to find and hire curious tinkerers: data scientists with the intellectual curiosity and the general aptitude \u2014 technical and otherwise \u2014 to identify the skills their work requires and the enthusiasm and ability to pick them up quickly and well enough.", "I try to extend optimization for learning beyond hiring and into mentoring: offering data scientists on my team the time, space, and resources to satisfy their curiosity for tinkering. I expect to be less proficient than them in the technical details of their work, the background they bring to their role, and the new skills they pick up on the job. But I aim to guide them on the questions they ask, what learning they prioritize, how they apply their knowledge, and how they communicate their work.", "Miles Davis famously said, \u201cIt\u2019s not the notes you play, it\u2019s the notes you don\u2019t play.\u201d Likewise, as a data science manager, I often need to figure out when the data scientists on my team know more or better than me so I can get out of their way.", "As a data scientist at Disney, I was fortunate to have a manager and an executive leader who understood the importance of optimizing for learning. They paid for technical courses I took and gave me time to tinker with programming languages that were new to their teams, eventually agreeing with me that my work should incorporate these different languages.", "At Capital One and Uber, executive leadership invested in access to enterprise versions of online learning platforms for data scientists like me to learn and upskill. These companies also offered me stipends to attend and present at data science conferences where I can keep up to date on best practices and learn from other data scientists.", "Executives with data scientists on their teams or organizations optimize for learning by making available resources and establishing processes that institutionalize and encourage learning on the job. This lets the work product of data scientists keep pace with the accelerating change in their profession, making them more effective and efficient over time.", "But this also becomes a competitive advantage in hiring and retaining data scientists. If you hired or are hiring the right people, data scientists will be enthused to learn on the job and won\u2019t want to stop growing.", "I\u2019ve experienced it first hand in my career and seen it in the careers of my colleagues and the data scientists on my teams. We evolve \u2014 and quickly \u2014 or we get left behind. I\u2019ve been fortunate to have benefitted from colleagues and managers who have mentored me and employers that respect and recognize that change in data science is constant.", "This feature of data science is not unique to the profession, but it\u2019s important to recognize it and respect it in how data scientists work and how their managers and executives hire, mentor, and retain them.", "Data science won\u2019t stop gaining speed. Adapt quickly, keep running, and try not to fall off.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Bolivian-American trained in cognitive neuroscience but working in applied science. Retired bassist and aspiring essayist.
