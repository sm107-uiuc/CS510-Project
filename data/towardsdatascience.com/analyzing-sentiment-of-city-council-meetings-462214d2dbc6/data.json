It\u2019s currently live for Seattle here. Seattle does not provide text transcripts of their meetings (only video records) and the Council Data Project automatically creates text transcripts, indexes them, and then makes them available online. I\u2019ve been wanting to explore sentiment analysis and thought this was a perfect opportunity to do so!", "Sentiment analysis is \u201ccontextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material.\u201d\u00b9 Specifically, for our purposes, I wanted to explore the sentiment of each speaker, and see if changes in sentiment, or overall high/low periods of sentiment, indicated if there were interesting parts or periods of debate amongst speakers.", "In its current form, the text transcript data is unlabeled, meaning that the data is just text with no classifiers attached to it. This limits what models we can use to unsupervised models. I identified two models to try \u2014 NLTK\u2019s VADER and TextBlob. There is also IBM\u2019s Watson, but that has a price tag and would not scale well. In this example, I am just going to use VADER, but I would like to try it out with TextBlog soon. VADER is pre-trained on social media, so it is not the perfect tool for this scenario.", "Let\u2019s look at the transcripts! First, we need to import all of the modules we will use and download the data from CDP:", "Each time someone speaks it lists each sentence they say, with start and stop times. It currently does not know who is actually speaking (which is why speaker is an empty string). I wrote a function to parse this JSON and store each speaker and their sentences in a list of lists. Now let\u2019s look at that sentiment!", "The scores can range from -1 to 1, indicating the polarity for that score. 1 being positive, -1 being negative (just to be clear). So for my purposes, we really just need the compound score, so I rewrote the above function to just output the compound score. Here is an in-depth article on how VADER computes the scores if you are interested in learning more.", "I originally computed the sentiment for each sentence, the resulting graph was very noisy.", "Next, I plotted the average sentiment of each speaker\u2019s sentences. This proved to be much more useful. Please note the visualizations are from separate meetings.", "Seeing that huge downward spike got us so excited \u2014 this was it! Now let\u2019s look at the speaker block that provided that result:", "\u201cAnd you can get bullied from landlords. I\u2019ve gotten bullied from my landlord. We\u2019ve gotten bullied from our landlord.\u201d", "The result makes sense, though, considering how the model operates. Bullying is bad (and it was mentioned three times) so the model will reflect that, but it is not really useful for our purposes.", "Overall the sentiment is always high, in general, when you look at many meetings. This makes sense, as council members are usually cordial and professional and parliamentary procedure enforces this.", "VADER proved to not be too useful for our purposes because of this. I\u2019d like to try TextBlob\u2019s sentiment analysis package, but I am not hopeful that it will be any more useful. A model not exposed to the unique language of city council meetings will not be able to properly analyze the language.", "Going forward, the next steps I see for exploring this would be to manually label transcripts for points of argument or debate and then use supervised learning techniques.
