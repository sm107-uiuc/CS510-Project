Despite being considered one of the more racially tolerant countries in the world, racial segregation has been very indicative of how deep the divide is.", "In 2009, radical cartographer (I admit these 2 words don\u2019t come easily together for me) Bill Rankin came up with a startling map that showed how racially segregated Chicago is.", "His work amazed and subsequently inspired quite a few people. This include Eric Fisher who soon after came up with a photoset of many other US cities that showed Chicago wasn\u2019t so unique after all.", "This has obviously been going on for some time and shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone, though the visualization is quite startling. With such sharp segregation, it\u2019s no wonder eventually something will blow up.", "But is it only something in US? Actually no, this really isn\u2019t unique to US after all, here\u2019s a similar map done by Andrew Whitby for London (UK, except Scotland actually).", "And here\u2019s another for what is considered the most multi-cultural city in the world, Toronto.", "And if the most multi-cultural city in the world is just as segregated, what hope is there?", "As I stay hunkered down at home, I remembered a paper I read some time ago, by the famous American economist Thomas Schelling. The paper, titled Dynamic Models of Segregation talked about racial segregation in US and created some models to describe it. I remembered that quite vividly and even gave a couple of talks using a particular model because I thought there were some interesting real-life points in it. It\u2019s been a while so I dug up the paper again and also my old notes.", "I implemented a simulation of the simplified version of Schelling\u2019s spatial proximity model previously for my talks. Now that I had some time (and also a new simulation framework), I re-implemented a more complete model.", "Schelling\u2019s spatial proximity model described 2 different races, black and white, that occupy a particular territory. Everyone has a place on the territory at any moment, and is free to move to any other space that is empty. In this model, there are 5 parameter:", "Schelling\u2019s models were run by hand, that is, he drew # and 0 on a piece of grid paper and worked it through. Obviously I\u2019m not doing this, instead I\u2019ll be using Petri, my Go cellular automation framework to try to reproduce Schelling\u2019s model.", "My parameters are almost the same as Schelling\u2019s:", "The simulation is a cellular automaton. We build a grid and populate it randomly with units of different races, each unit occupying a different cell. Not all cells will be filled, there is a certain percentage of the grid that will be empty.", "As time passes, each unit can decide to move to another cell or continue staying in the same cell, depending on the rules, which primarily depends on the units around itself.", "To implement this, I used Petri, my Go cellular automation framework. You can get a quick primer on how to use Petri for creating simulations from this post.", "Neighbourhood size is already one of the few parameters in Petri, so we don\u2019t need to implement that. What we need to add as our perimeters are the following:", "The coverage parameter is straightforward, it\u2019s just a percentage, described as a floating number (default is 0.7 or 70%). The raceRatio parameter is the ratio of population sizes between the races, defaulted to 2 races, with 50% each, so the ratio string to use is 1:1. If we have 3 races, say the first with 50%, and the next 2 with 25% each, then the ratio string to use is 2:1:1.", "The minList parameter is the demanded percentage of one\u2019s own race. It corresponding matches to the raceRatio parameter in its position. The number signifies the minimum number of neighbours of the same race that is acceptable. For example, if the number is 2, then there must be at least 3 neighbours that are of the same race.", "The minList is positional and matches that of the race ratio, that is, given the raceRatio of 2:1:1 and minList of 2:3:2 this means, the first race with 50% of the population, have a minimum number of acceptable neighbours of same race to be 3 and above. The second race with 25% of the population must have 4 and above neighbours of its same race, and the last race, also with 25% must have 3 and above neighbours of the same race.", "The maxList is the reverse of the minList. The number signifies the capped maximum number of neighbours of the same race. How would this happen? In some countries, for example in Singapore, there are policies that ensure a certain mix of ethnic groups in housing estates. This has the stated reason to prevent racial enclaves and segregation. In many other multi-cultural countries there certain policies and laws that serves the same anti-segregation purpose.", "Using Petri for this simulation is quite straightforward. There are just 2 steps. First, you need to create a struct that implements the Simulator interface. We don\u2019t need to implement all the methods, we can fall back on the ones already created by Petri, by including petri.Sim as a variable in our struct.", "Then you simply create a main function and run the instance of the struct you created.", "The bulk of the logic is in the 2 methods that we implement. The first is the Init method which initialises the grid.", "Most of the action is in figuring out how to deal with the race ratio and the percentage of the grid to be populated. The second is quite easy, just randomly create a floating point number between 0 and 1 and then compare it with the coverage parameter, if it\u2019s below, then it should be populated.", "The first is about which race it should be. To do this, I create a function calc that creates a function that determines which race it should be. The code is straightforward and should be self-explanatory.", "The second method to implement for the Simulator interface is the Process method, which processes grid and determines if the units should move to another cell or not.", "That\u2019s it! You can find the rest of the code at https://github.com/sausheong/segregation.", "Now let\u2019s start with basic parameters. The defaults are 0.7 for the coverage (70% of grid is occupied), 1:1 for the race ratio, meaning there are 2 races, with 50% each, 2:2 for the min list, meaning both races need at least 3 neighbours of the same race, and 8:8 for the max list. Since there are only 8 neighbours for each cell anyway, 8 here means there is no cap.", "As you can see, there is already some level of segregation though it\u2019s quite mild. Let\u2019s increase the number of races to 3, but retain the same minimum and ratio.", "It doesn\u2019t look too bad. But remember, this is still quite tolerant, as long as there are 3 of my neighbours who are of the same race (37.5%), there is no movement.", "Let\u2019s step back a little and think of an ideal world and assume that everyone is ok if there is at least 1 other neighbour who is of the same race (12.5%).", "This looks pretty random and distributed, which is what it is because the units are randomly place. Now let\u2019s move it up a few of notches by setting the the minimum acceptable number of neighbours to 5 or more (62.5%)", "With just this change and nothing else, we can see how much more segregated the grid becomes.", "Now let\u2019s tweak the race ratio a bit. According to the 2019 US Census Bureau estimates, whites are 76.5%, Hispanic and Latino Americans of any race are 18.3 and Blacks are 13.4% of the population. We\u2019ll set the first race (Deep Pink) to 76, second race (Lawn Green) to 18 and third race (Deep Sky Blue) to 13 and re-run the simulation.", "I sped up the video for this 8x but you can see how Deep Pink stabilises quickly (because of its population, but the other 2 races slowly grew its own enclaves between the existing ones. Deep Pink is pretty much stable and clustered while the other 2 races takes a pretty long time to build up.", "The previous simulations assume all 3 races have the same minimum number of neighbours of the same race. What if they are different? What happens if the majority race is more demanding than the minority races?", "We see a different picture now. The simulation stabilises quickly and the other 2 less demanding races find themselves less clustered together in large enclaves.", "How about the reverse \u2014 if 1 of the minority race is is more demanding that the majority race and the other minority race?", "The more demanding minority race, Deep Sky Blue, never stabilises because everywhere it goes it will always move, while Deep Pink and Lawn Green which are both less demanding stablises and are pretty much well distributed.", "So far, we\u2019re only looked at the minimum number of neighbours of the same race. What if we impose some policies to prevent racial enclaves? Meaning we have a cap of the number of neighbours of the same race.", "Remember earlier, we had this situation, given the race ratio is the all equal and all the races are more demanding, we have these clusters of segregated races?", "What if we impose a cap and if a unit has more than 6 neighbours, it has to move away again?", "Well it doesn\u2019t work, because the only stable configuration is if the unit has exactly 5 neighbours of the same race, and there is too much movement for it to come to a stable steady state.", "What if only 1 of the races is imposed that particular policy?", "In this case because the Lawn Green and Deep Sky Blue races are given free reign, they form their usual enclaves but because Deep Sky Pink was imposed a policy, it grew holes in their community! This is because none of the other races will live in those places, and those places can\u2019t be occupied either because of the policy.", "But wait, that\u2019s because they have a choice. So what if they don\u2019t have a choice because there\u2019s simply no space? Remember that the coverage parameter allows us to specify how well populated the simulation grid will be. By default it\u2019s 70% but what if it\u2019s set at 99%? (It can\u2019t be 100% else no one can move).", "As it turns out, it does get move into some level of segregation but the units keep moving and it never reaches a stable state.", "Doing and writing about technology is how I deal with things, exploring and trying to understand the world around me. Schelling was a brilliant economist who come up with great insights on a number of things. Re-implementing some of these ideas helps to understand the world a little bit better.", "Racism and racial segregation are ugly facts of the current world, but if we open up our hearts and minds to welcome people who are different from us, things can change for the better.", "You can find all the code in this post here \u2014 https://github.com/sausheong/segregation.", "Your home for data science.
