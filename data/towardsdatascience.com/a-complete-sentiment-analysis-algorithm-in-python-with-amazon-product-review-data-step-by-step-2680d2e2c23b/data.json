Classifying tweets, Facebook comments or product reviews using an automated system can save a lot of time and money. At the same time, the probability of error is lower. In this article, I will explain a sentiment analysis task using the amazon product review dataset.", "I am going to use python and a few libraries of python. Even if you haven\u2019t used these libraries before, you should be able to understand it well. If this is new to you, please copy each step of code to your notebook and see the output for better understanding.", "I am going to use a product review dataset as I mentioned earlier. The dataset contains Amazon baby product reviews.", "Please download the dataset for yourself from this link if you want to practice with it.", "It has three columns: name, review, and rating. Reviews are text data and ratings are numbering from 1 to 5 where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best review.", "Our job is to analyze the reviews as positive and negative reviews. Let\u2019s have a look at the dataset. Here we used the first five entries to examine the data.", "In real life, data scientists rarely get data that are very clean and already prepared for machine learning models. For almost every project, you have to spend time cleaning and process the data. So, let\u2019s clean the dataset first.", "One important data cleaning process is to get rid of null values. Let\u2019s check how many null values we have in the dataset.", "In this dataset, we have to work on these three columns and all three of them are crucial. If the data is not available in any row in a column that row is unnecessary.", "We have null values in 1147 rows. Now, check how much total data we have.", "We have a total of 183531 data. So, if we delete all the null values, we will still have a sizable data to train an algorithm. So, let\u2019s drop the null values.", "We need to have all the string data in the review column. If there is any data that has other types, it will cause trouble in later steps.", "Now, we will check the datatype of the review data of every row. If there is any row having data in any other type than string we will change that to a string.", "As we are doing sentiment analysis, it is important to tell our model what is positive sentiment and what is a negative sentiment.", "In our rating column, we have ratings from 1 to 5. We can define 1 and 2 as bad reviews and 4 and 5 as good reviews.", "3 is in the middle. It\u2019s neither good nor bad. Just average. But we want to classify good or bad reviews. So, I decided to get rid of all the 3\u2019s.", "It depends on the employer or your ideas of good or bad. If you think you will put 3 in the good review slot, just do it. But I am getting rid of them.", "We will denote positive sentiments as 1 and negative sentiments as 0. Let\u2019s write a function \u2018sentiment\u2019 that returns 1 if the rating is 4 or more else return 0. Then, apply the function sentiment and create a new column that will represent the positive and negative sentiment as 1 or 0.", "Look, we have the \u2018sentiment\u2019 column added at the end now!", "First, we need to prepare the training features. Combine both \u2018name\u2019 and \u2018review\u2019 columns and make one single column. First, write a function \u2018combined_features\u2019 that will combine both the columns. Then, apply the function and create a new column \u2018all_features\u2019 that will contain the strings from both name and review columns.", "You can see the \u2018all_features\u2019 column at the end. Now, we are ready to develop the sentiment classifier!", "Here is the process step by step.", "We need to define the input variable X and the output variable y.", "X should be the \u2018all_features\u2019 column and y should be our \u2018sentiment\u2019 column", "We need to split the dataset so that there is a training set and a test set.", "The \u2018train_test_split\u2019 function from the scikit-learn library is helpful. The model will be trained using the training dataset and the performance of the model can be tested using the test dataset.", "\u2018train_test_split\u2019 automatically splits the data in 75/25 proportion. 75% for the training and 25% for the testing. If you want the proportion to be different, you need to define that.", "I am going to use \u2018CountVectorizer\u2019 from the scikit-learn library. CountVectorizer develops a vector of all the words in the string. Import CountVectorizer and fit both our training, testing data into it.", "Let\u2019s dive into the original model part. This is the most fun part. We will use the Logistic Regression as this is a binary classification. Let\u2019s do the necessary imports and fit our training data in the model.", "The logistic regression model is trained with the training data.", "Use the trained model above to predict the sentiments for the test data. If we pass the test features, it will predict the output y that is the sentiment data.", "Here is the output for the test data. As you remember, we used 1 for good reviews and 0 for a bad review.", "Use the accuracy_score function to get the accuracy_score of the test data. So, it will compare the predicted \u2018sentiment\u2019 with the original \u2018sentiment\u2019 data to calculate the percentage of accuracy.", "The accuracy score I got for this data on the test set is 84%, which is very good.", "This simple sentiment analysis classifier can be useful in many other types of datasets. It can be used in real-world projects and businesses as well. The dataset we used here resembles a real business dataset. Please try this technique with some other dataset.", "Feel free to follow me on Twitter and like my Facebook page.", "Your home for data science.
