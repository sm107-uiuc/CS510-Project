Collins, Ichsani Wheeler and Robert A. MacMillan", "Since 2004, OpenStreetMap has been the main platform for building an Open Map of the world. More recently, the concept of building geo-information through distributed work and common ownership has led to several inspiring businesses; for example, Mapillary \u2014 a street-level imagery platform. However, currently both OpenStreetMap and Mapillary focus only on cities and urban areas. What about the rest of the planet? What about making open global maps of environmental variables such as land cover, land use, climate, soils, vegetation and biodiversity? Several for-profit and not-for-profit organizations have started doing just that, providing platforms to map world land use (https://osmlanduse.org), land cover (https://geo-wiki.org), biodiversity (https://gbif.org), forest dynamics (https://globalforestwatch.org), weather (https://openweathermap.org), and relief/topography (https://opentopography.org), to mention a few. These open data sources are awesome but scattered. Such information could be even more effective if combined into a complete and consistent \u201cOpenLandMap\u201d-type system of the world\u2019s environment. If realized, such a system could be \u201cthe place\u201d where anyone could, with Wikipedia-like confidence, track current status and changes in our environment. To contribute to this idea, OpenGeoHub foundation has recently launched a web-mapping app and a data service called \u201cLandGIS\u201d.", "How can we judge today if we don\u2019t know what happened yesterday? For anyone to be able to understand ecosystem services and the value they represent to the environment, they must first have insight into past environmental conditions. Some selected point in the past (often referred to in environmental sciences as a \u201cbaseline\u201d) is the ultimate reference that allows us to quantify the scale of environmental degradation/restoration and the potential costs/benefits involved. One typical, and widely recognized example of tracking environmental history is the changing status of global annual land surface temperatures (see Fig. 1).", "If we focus on the last few hundred years on the graph above, we can notice that the planet should have probably been cooling down not warming up. There is a distinct difference between the expected (\u201cnatural\u201d) trend and the \u201chuman-induced\u201d global annual temperature. In this case it is the global warming effect, which we now know is mainly due to fossil CO2 emissions (fossil fuel industry, transportation, agriculture). Ricke et al. (2018) estimated that the social cost of each additional fossil carbon emission (\u201cthe complete economic cost associated with climate damage that results from the emission of an additional tonne of carbon dioxide\u201d) is, on average, US$417 per tCO2e emitted. We still emitted about 4.9 tCO2 per capita in 2017 (15.7 tCO2 in USA; 3.8 tCO2 in other G20 countries; based on Olivier and Peters, (2018)), which means that total social costs of CO2 emission for the year 2017 are about US$15.4 trillion! Even if the number estimated by Ricke et al. (2018) is replaced by the conservative number used by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US$40), we can see that CO2 emissions have serious economic consequences. Thus, environmental management and accounting for the social costs of environmental damage may well become a major economic activity (that is, if the current economic system run by our global civilization is to survive).", "The previous example demonstrates how physical variables, such as surface temperature, can be related to measurements of CO2 emissions, which can then be assessed in terms of economic costs. But our planet comes with a diversity of landscapes, climate zones and geological materials, and these different parts of the planet react differently to global events and processes. To better display the geographical distribution of these processes, scientists generate global maps at various spatial resolutions. Using these maps means that we know not only a single value for average change per physical variable, but also where that change is most significant and often also what is driving it (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, when documenting and quantifying global dynamics of the environment, scientists document the dynamics of specific scientifically accepted rigorous variables, which we can refer to as land management indicators (Fig. 2b).", "Here, not all land management indicators are equally important. Some variables are direct indicators for quality of human life and can be valued in billions or even trillions of dollars when used to predict potential future natural hazards, gains or losses of ecosystem services and so on (see previous example with CO2 emissions). The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has, for example, selected the following three key indicators of land degradation:", "Keeping each of the three constant, or at least not significantly worse, is a step towards Land Degradation Neutrality.", "When it comes to land management indicators, it is now increasingly important to be able to \u201cmap the past\u201d and \u201cpredict the future\u201d i.e. to produce maps of land management indicators for various periods while maintaining the same spatial reference. One example of a complete global data set documenting land use changes over the last 10,000 years \u2014 basically documenting the evolution of world agriculture \u2014 is the HYDE data set (Klein Goldewijk et al. 2011) which comprises a time-series of images of percent of coverage for 10 main land use types, population density and urban and rural areas \u2014 produced and distributed by the Dutch Environmental Agency (PBL). One can quickly observe that most such historical time-series maps suffer from the same problem, which is their proportionally lower certainty about events and conditions that happened further in the past. For that reason HYDE is only available at a relatively coarse spatial resolution of 10 km and the reliability of spatial patterns drops drastically as we move back into pre-industrial times. In 2019 we can map almost all world forests and canopy heights at fine spatial resolution. But where the forests of 100 years ago were located (let alone 2000 years ago) is much more difficult to reconstruct.", "The spatial resolution of maps often defines most of the technical specifications of a system and the usability of maps (Hengl and MacMillan, 2019). From a management point of view, the Earth\u2019s land mass can be divided into discrete spatial units, or pixels, ideally corresponding to equal area blocks of the earth\u2019s surface. The What3Words company (Fig. 3), for example, has assigned to each 3\u2a093m pixel a unique combination of three common words (total land area is estimated at 148,939,063 km-square, so over 1.65\u2a0910^13 unique pixels!). By using What3Words you can connect with other people within 3\u2a093m spatial blocks. We could now also attach values for all key land management indicators to each of these unique pixels and then track their changes through time. This type of fine-grain management of land, when applied to agricultural land, is referred to as \u201cPrecision Agriculture\u201d. Mapping the Earth\u2019s land mass at 1\u20135 m resolution in 2019, as we will see in later sections, is certainly feasible, but will also demand massive computing infrastructures.", "Thus far, we think that the most important types of global land variables to monitor are land cover, land use, temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure deficit, air-borne particulates, fires, above and below ground biomass, emissions of gases, effective photosynthesis, flora and fauna types and their characteristics, soil water and soil macro and micro-flora and fauna. Variations of these variable types can be further interpreted to derive land management indicators, which can then be used to track performance and to estimate potential financial losses or gains. By monitoring these indicators through time, and by modeling their precise spatial distribution, we can assess various potential states of the environment, predict future states, and use this information to continually improve and optimize land management.", "As in many scientific fields, one way to reduce political bias, or controversy, around quantifying land degradation is to rely on robust technology and objective measurements. From the 1960\u2019s it has been evident that the most efficient way to track the status of global vegetation is by using satellite-based Remote Sensing systems (RS) as a basis for continuous Earth Observation (EO). Beginning in 2008, NASA and USGS made all Landsat imagery \u201cFree and Open\u201d symbolically starting a new era of RS data (Zhu et al. 2019). Opening of RS data by national agencies has proven to generate financial benefits as well. Zhu et al. (2019) estimated that use of Landsat data lead to productivity savings for the year 2011 of $1.70 billion for U.S. users only plus $400M for additional international users, which is almost enough to pay for the whole program\u2019s history (from profits in 2011 alone)! Applications that support improved resource management will inevitably result in EO applications growing exponentially and these trends will remain positive for decades (Ouma, 2016; Kwok, 2018). Having Open EO data is especially important for nature conservation and land restoration projects (Turner et al. 2014; Gibbs & Salmon, 2015). NASA and USGS have been maintaining and sharing time-series of land products derived from their MODIS imagery for now almost 20 years; Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS; hosted by VITO NV) provides similar list of land management indicators including vegetation indices, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) and dry matter productivity. EO-based environmental monitoring projects have boomed following the recent launching of the European Union funded Copernicus Sentinels and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA\u2019s) Advanced Land Observing Satellites (ALOS). In addition to multispectral imagery, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) TANDEM-x project has now produced probably the most accurate global land surface model (including a global map of forest canopy heights) at 12 m spatial resolution and at unprecedented vertical accuracy (Martone et al. 2018). The 100 m resolution version of this data set has recently been freely released for research and education uses. The DLR\u2019s next generation topographic/elevation mapping will focus on even finer resolutions (5 m) and faster revisit times (<1 month) so that we will increasingly be able to track all fine grained changes in land surface elevations or volumetric displacements. The following three trends now apply universally to all EO projects (Ouma, 2016; Herold et al. 2016):", "It is now increasingly more difficult to conceal poor land management or air or water pollution. The spatial resolution of publicly (or cheaply) available imagery is now rapidly progressing towards sub-meter accuracy. Already in 2019 Planet Labs have created an image fusion system that supports derivation of daily Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) at 3 m spatial resolution (Houborg and McCabe, 2018). The OneSoil company has likewise automated extraction of farm borders and crop status (for the present just in Europe and USA) from Sentinel-2 and LandSat7/8 imagery, so that even smaller-size farms and their vegetation indices can be tracked on a field-by-field basis. These systems are moving from having just raw images to having pre-processed estimates of land management indicators by land management units (e.g. fields). We anticipate that in the coming years it will become increasingly difficult to conceal any deforestation (even loss of a few trees?), loss of biomass (Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel 2), loss of soil, CO2 emissions (Sentinel 5), and even smaller size waste dumps (Planet Labs) anywhere on the planet. We see these as good trends, and also believe that it is good that such awareness continues seamlessly across country borders i.e. that it gives us the power to identify poor land managers or environmental polluters irrespective of borders. People have a right to know about the status of our global land commons in the past, now and into the future. Such global environmental awareness may well be one of the most positive aspects of globalization.", "In previous sections we discussed how RS imagery is directly and objectively measuring the status of the environment, how it is now becoming ever more accessible and how, in consequence, the number of applications and the overall market for RS data are likely to grow exponentially. But most countries and businesses are not set up to handle such data volumes, let alone exploit the new types of information that they will convey. For instance, to archive all LandSat scenes you would need Petabytes of storage, not to mention massive infrastructures to process this data. For illustration, Planet Labs claims to acquire 50 Terapixels of new data every single day. To address such massive data challenges Google has developed a cloud-solution for processing all of NASA\u2019s, ESA\u2019s and JAXA\u2019s imagery and all other publicly available imagery: Google Earth Engine (GEE) (Gorelick et al. 2017). Several research groups have used the GEE infrastructure to derive global maps of deforestation / forest cover changes (Hansen et al. 2013), surface water dynamics (Pekel et al. 2016), land cover (Song et al. 2018) and cropland distribution (Xiong et al. 2017), to mention just a few most known. The recent special issue on GEE in the Remote Sensing journal lists even more applications of GEE.", "GEE literally enabled under-graduate students to map the world at 30 m resolution without having any research budget. Should GEE become an universal solution for deriving, storing and distributing land management indicators? It sounds like a perfect option. Having many copies of the same original RS data would certainly be inefficient. Google also thoughtfully pays for the processing costs, which are (in relative terms) considering the size of their infrastructures probably minor. But GEE does come at a cost. First, uploading and downloading larger data sets to GEE includes an expectation that a user will need to increase the capacity of their Google Drive or Google Cloud storage. A second, more serious, limitation is that Google\u2019s terms of use indicate, among others that:", "5. Deprecation of Services. Google may discontinue any Services or any portion or feature for any reason at any time without liability to Customer.", "In other words, a corporation like Google could discontinue GEE at any moment and legally face no consequences because these are the terms of use that all GEE users have accepted at the start of their service. Another issue is: can we trust Google? What if Google developers make a mistake in their code? Although many algorithms used within the GEE are based on Open Source software, understanding what happens on Google\u2019s servers before an image of Earth is generated is not trivial. A European Union-funded project OpenEO (Open Earth Observation) now looks at ensuring \u201ccross cloud backend reproducibility\u201d. It develops a language (API) that can be used to ask questions to different cloud back-ends, including GEE. By that, it aims to make it relatively trivial to compare and verify their results, but also to find e.g. the cheapest options for doing particular types of computations. The O2R project has many practical tips on how to back-up and share code and data and enable computational reproducibility at relatively low cost.", "EO is a basis of objectivised monitoring of land dynamics, but not all land management indicators can be mapped directly using RS technology alone. Some land management indicators need to be estimated by interpolating sampled (i.e. observed/measured) values at point locations, or by using predictive mapping approaches. Some variables are simply more complex and can\u2019t be mapped using spectral reflectances only. For example, no EO system can (yet) be used to directly estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) density. Technology simply does not yet exist to do this and, therefore, we need to use point samples and Predictive Mapping to try to estimate SOC at each pixel. Luckily, there is now also ever more point data with environmental variables being made available across borders via Open Data licenses and through international initiatives. Established field observation compilations include: the Global Biodiversity Information Facilities observations, Global Historical Climatology Network station data, WoSIS Soil Profile Database points, sPlot global plant database, BirdLife, to mention just a few of the most widely known. Increasingly more and more point data measurements and observations today are also contributed through Citizen science and crowdsourcing projects such as iNaturalist (Fig. 4), Geo-wiki, Citizen Weather Observer Program, and similar (Irwin, 2018). Even commercial companies are now open to sharing their proprietary data and using it for global data mining projects (provided that their users agree of course). For example, continuous measurements of temperature, pressure, noise levels etc. from the Netatmo weather stations (estimated over 150k devices sold worldwide). Many users are also open to sharing weather measurements from their mobile phone devices. Plantix app is currently producing a global database of photographs of plant diseases and growth aberrations. We mention here only a few major global or continental data repositories and initiatives. There are, of course, many more repositories available in local languages and for local areas.", "As global compilations of ground observations and measurements become larger and more consistent, there is an increasing need to extract value-added global maps from them. There is now a burgeoning interest in using exascale high-performance computing to process emerging novel, in-situ observation networks to transform the quality and cost-effectiveness of high-resolution weather forecasting, agricultural management and Earth system modeling in general. An especially exciting development in the years to come will likely be a hybrid process-based modeling + machine learning approach which combines the best of data and the best of our geophysical/geochemical knowledge (Reichstein et al. 2019).", "To summarize, the most promising path to building trust in data seems to be by achieving computational reproducibility (documenting all processing steps and providing all relevant metadata required to reproduce exactly the same results). There are now increasingly more robust ways to achieve reproducibility, even for projects that are relatively computationally heavy. Due to increasing provision of free RS data associated with the launch of new EO satellites, it seems that the mainstream data analytics will be moving from local networks to (virtual) clouds and Big Earth Data cubes i.e. data analysis through web-based workflows (Sudmanns et al. 2019). In that context, GEE will remain a valuable and (hopefully) increasingly trustworthy place to process global public RS data and produce new valuable maps of the status of our environment. But society also needs more Open and not-for-profit infrastructures such as OpenStreetMap to ensure longevity. Global field observation repositories, Citizen Science and Machine Learning will, in any case, play an increasing role in generating more reliable maps of more holistic land management indicators.", "We (the OpenGeoHub foundation) have recently started providing hosting and data science services to help produce and share the most up-to-date, fully documented (potentially to the level of fully reproducibility) data sets on the actual and potential status of multiple environmental measures through a system we call \u201cLandGIS\u201d and which is available via https://openlandmap.org (Fig. 5). Initially, LandGIS provides access to new and existing data on soil properties/classes, relief, geology, land cover/use/degradation, climate, current and potential vegetation, through a simple web-mapping interface allowing for interactive queries and overlays. This is a genuine Open Land Data and Services system where anyone can contribute and share global maps and make them accessible to hundreds of thousands of researchers and businesses.", "LandGIS is based on the following six main pillars:", "We contribute to LandGIS results of our own data mining and spatial prediction processes including mapping of potential natural vegetation (e.g. Hengl et al. 2018) and 3D mapping of soil properties and classes. However, we also host maps contributed by others, especially if the data are already peer-reviewed and fully documented.", "To illustrate our general approach to producing usable information to improve global land management, consider the example of soil type mapping. USDA and USGS have invested decades, and possibly billions of dollars, to collect data on soils and produce and maintain knowledge about soils, mainly through the soil classification system \u201cUSDA Soil Taxonomy\u201d. As a result of decades of field work and laboratory analysis of thousands of soil samples, USDA and USGS produced a repository of over 350,000 field observations of soil types (in this case we focus on soil great groups). We combined these point data with other national and international compilations to produce the world\u2019s most consistent and complete training data set of USDA soil great groups. We then overlaid these points over some 300 global covariate layers which represent soil forming factors, and then fitted spatial prediction models using Random Forest (Hengl et al. 2017). Although we achieved only limited classification accuracy outside the USA (where a majority of the training points are located), having a large-enough training data set allows us to produce initial maps of soil types (at relatively fine resolution of 250 m) also for countries where we basically had no training points at all (Fig. 6). Because we have fully automated overlay, modeling and spatial prediction, as soon as we obtain more contributed observations of soil types, we can update these initial predictions and gradually produce better and more usable / useful maps.", "Other LandGIS functionalities in development include:", "So, in summary, there is still a need for an OpenStreetMap-type system to allow for archiving and sharing environmental variables and land management indicators. With LandGIS\u00a0and\u00a0OpenLandMap.org, we have shown that new, value-added, information can be produced immediately and affordably using \u201cold legacy data\u201d. We have demonstrated a technology and knowledge transfer opportunities (from data-rich countries to data-poor countries), which we believe is a win-win scenario. We release all code used to generate LandGIS layers as open source, allowing full replicability of state-of-the-art spatial analytics by anyone, including as a basis for commercial services. We have released all our data as open data, allowing anyone, including businesses, to build upon this soils and other environmental data\u200a\u2014\u200ahopefully in ways we can\u2019t even imagine.", "Co-founder of the OpenGeoHub foundation and EnvirometriX Ltd.
