Traditionally, Machine Learning resources like books, courses, videos, and articles lack a clear way to bridge this gap between technical and business knowledge.", "Moreover, as Data Maturity grows in organizations it is becoming of paramount importance to have strong knowledge in how to correctly implement Data Science solutions. Because, as we can see in the image below, the more advanced the Data Analysis technique to be applied is the greater the value that it provides, but also the greater its complexity.", "Therefore, it is increasingly necessary the rise of both, leaders with strong analytical knowledge, and developers capable of understanding the business rules and be able to adapt their analytical skills to the context of the organization.", "And it is on this subject that we will dive into in today\u2019s article.

Study of some popular algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines.", "Overfitting and its Avoidance: Introduces the concept of generalization, what fitting and overfitting are, and how to avoid the latter through Complexity Control.

As I experienced myself as an Engineer and Data Scientist, it is very common for us, technical people, to focus so much on the details of the tasks we are dealing with that we lose the big picture.", "Data Science for Business does a great job of never losing sight of the goal of bringing these two worlds together, business and data science.", "Also, it is very well written, in an easy and digestible way, so its reading is quite light and, although it covers a lot of concepts, its reading is a true delight for those used to much more technical resources and won\u2019t scare those managers or leader who aren\u2019t as technical.", "After reading it for the first time, it is a great tool to have at the side and I encourage you to come back to it and refresh the related concepts every time that you face a Data Science challenge.", "Like always, I hope that you have enjoyed the post and that you will give a try to this amazing book.
