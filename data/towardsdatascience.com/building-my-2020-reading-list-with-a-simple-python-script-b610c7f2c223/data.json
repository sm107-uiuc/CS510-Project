With MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) evolution started in 2012, I spent most of my spare time across Coursera, edX, and LinkedIn Learning. Many contents on MOOC illustrate knowledge (e.g. programming techniques, statistics concepts, etc) very well, these greatly help with my early career growth; however, I always feel something is missing with using only MOOC, but I could not tell what it is.", "Today, at the end of 2019, after finish reading \u201cDrive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\u201d and started enjoying \u201cThe Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers\u201d, it is quite amazing (for me) that reading books, physical holding them on hand, can trigger lots of reflection and also help connect many random thoughts. These mental activities enforce the understanding and lead one\u2019s thoughts to go much deeper beyond the text itself. This is such a unique experience that I did not understand in the past with any MOOC platform! So I made up my mind to set one new year resolution: read 12 books in 2020.", "Which books should I prioritize then? Given my specific field and career direction, I like to focus more on the business and leadership side in my first \u201creading year\u201d. Besides a few great recommendations (e.g. \u201cThe Hard Thing About Hard Things\u201d, \u201cTrillion Dollar Coach\u201d) from knowledgable friends, I am still short of great business & leadership related books. So I turned to the famous \u201cNew York Times Best Seller\u201d for help: if a book sells so well to be qualified for the list, it must have some insights worth reading.", "After I opened the most recent business list in the New York Times (link), it shows 10 book titles, and every month the list could change! This is great if I already read most of them and just take the list for an incremental selection, but clearly that\u2019s not my case, so how to prioritize a few out of all historic \u201cBest Sellers\u201d? I tried to search in Google for something like \u201call-time NY Times Best Sellers\u201d, but it returns no meaningful results: maybe no one has a special need as mine. I am trying to use historic data to support curating my first-year reading list, while others may read most of them already :(", "Still, I don\u2019t want to give up, and just randomly pick a few out of the most recent list is definitely not my style: I want to use hard-core data to support my choice, I want to know the most popular books in NY Times Best Seller List history; however, the data is scattered across multiple web pages and not handy to read. Facing such a challenge, what a Data Scientist would do? Well, he/she is going to write some code. My goal is clear, get all historic NY Times Best Seller lists (Business topic), and then assess the books to build my 2020 reading list.", "My workflow is very straightforward and simple; it has three steps.", "For the New York Times website, all the URL has the structure like https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2019/08/01/business-books/, with the year and month being the only variable. Checked!", "For the web element, the top 10 list for each month is organized inside an ordered list (\u201col\u201d) with class name \u201ccss-12yzwg4\u201d. The contents are saved inside the division (\u201cdiv\u201d) with class name \u201ccss-xe4cfy\u201d, and each book is one item of the contents. The book title has \u201ch3\u201d tag with class name \u201ccss-5pe77f\u201d, and book author has \u201cp\u201d tag with class name \u201ccss-hjukut\u201d. Checked!", "Now we get all the key elements layout and they are all consistent across the URLs, this is good news for continuing to the next step.", "I have not been using Requests/BeautifulSoup for a while, so it is nice to take a reference from other\u2019s work. With a search on \u201cpython requests beautifulsoup\u201d, I found one nice article to reference: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-work-with-web-data-using-requests-and-beautiful-soup-with-python-3.", "My code flow is very simple:", "Now we have all the Best Sellers (Business) title data saved in the Dataframe, I did some quick exploration to find the following facts:", "Note. There is no data for Aug 2015 on the NY Times website, and I think this should be a bug that they need to fix.", "The above stats provide great insights, and then I looked through their respective reviews to understand the high-level concept. Although I think all the books are great in their ways, given my limited time, I added the following 6 titles in my 2020 reading list:", "This is a simple demonstration of using Python to solve a real problem. The coding work takes me around one hour, while, writing this article takes much longer \u2026 here are a few things you may find helpful:", "Enjoy reading and wish you a happy new year!", "Your home for data science.
