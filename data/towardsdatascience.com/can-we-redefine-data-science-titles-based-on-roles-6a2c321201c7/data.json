I expanded this by collecting data science postings for various cities in North America. I wanted to focus in on the job descriptions, job titles given, and whether the descriptions matched the titles.", "Here, I\u2019m going to apply some techniques to try to better differentiate between these positions. First I took the data from the job postings and extracted the presence or absence of key data science terms that I would think would be relevant. I sorted these into whether they were listed as \u2018requirements\u2019 for the position or as \u2018assets\u2019 (or nice-to-haves).", "All job titles were assigned a \u2018job type\u2019 based on whether the title contained keywords such as \u2018analyst\u2019, \u2018scientist\u2019, \u2018engineer\u2019, or \u2018manager\u2019. I started with these as some version of these are often accepted as the \u2018types\u2019 of data science jobs out there. I started with ~6000 job postings and filtered out roughly 1000 whose title I couldn\u2019t sort into these \u2018types\u2019 (such as \u2018VP of workforce planning\u2019 or positions without a title given).", "For this dataset, we have 50 dimensions of skills, programming languages, and software knowledge that companies are looking for as either a \u2018requirement\u2019 or an \u2018asset\u2019. I ran this through a first PCA with a maximum likelihood estimator to determine the number of components to identify and dropped any components that explained less than 5% of the variance leaving 5 meaningful components. I then re-ran the PCA with 5 components and here are the results, coloured by the described position type:", "This is a pretty big mess with job type not giving a clear delineation between the spread of data here. So, I ran a k-means clustering with 5 clusters. I then re-produced the above figure changing the colour from the described position type to the k-mean label identified cluster.", "There is still some overlap and especially in clusters 0 and 2, and there is still some large spread in some clusters, but these k-mean determined labels seem to better describe the variance in the positions than the title.", "But what do these k-means labels mean?", "On there own, they don\u2019t really mean anything except that they\u2019ve identified and classified different clusters. So let\u2019s focus on the greatest difference between these clusters for different required and nice-to-have skills and attributes. For the heatmap below, we want to focus on the darkest colours (deepest reds and blues) as these are the skills that explain the greatest variance for that cluster. In addition, reading the chart along the \u2018columns\u2019, we can see which attributes account for the greatest variation between clusters such as python_requirements with variations between most of the clusters, or graduateEducation_requirements with a large variation between clusters 0 and 1, and between these ones and the rest of the clusters.", "Next, we turn to how often these skills appear in the job postings for different clusters. First, we subset out those with a greater than 40% difference between the K-means labeled clusters for whether that skill or attribute was required or not. Cluster 2 is often the highest or listings lots of requirements/assets that other postings aren\u2019t listing. Other major differences emerge with clusters 1 and 4 putting lower emphasis on university education (notice \u2018university\u2019, \u2018master\u2019, and \u2018phd\u2019 panels). You can also see an emphasis on some machine learning in cluster 0, 2, and 4 (e.g., python, machine learning, and spark).", "If we zoom out to all requirements, we again see that Cluster 2 places a strong importance on education with graduate education being required for 100% of posts, and a PhD listed as a requirement for over 50% of these jobs. This also has some related keywords that would fit with our understanding of this cluster as highly educated with keywords like computer science and statistics (e.g., as in \u2018PhD or Master\u2019s in computer science or statistics\u2019)", "But are these clusters meaningful? Looking, at the job requirements for the fourth cluster they are almost equally likely to include Hadoop and Tableau. These would seem to be at different spectrums of data science work of data engineer versus more analytics roles using dashboards and visualizations. That SQL is the second most common requirement for this role could be evidence in either direction for these roles.", "Another of the determined clusters was around positions with little requirements given. My explanation for this is that the job posting describes the position without listing a lot of requirements or assets and these are being clustered together as some kind of \u2018null\u2019 position. This isn\u2019t really useful for us to understand these positions then.", "If we come back to Randy\u2019s \u2018optimistic result\u2019 of coming up with better role definitions, I don\u2019t think we achieved this. The data is likely complicated and noisy due to data science positions often being written in a laundry list style or looking for their data scientist unicorn. The other related caveat around this is whether these differences are actually attributable to the difference in the role, or if some companies or people write descriptions in different ways. Some might write postings that go heavy on listing requirements and assets, whereas others might just generally describe the position without the keywords I was searching for here. So while it would be nice if we could get to a clearer understanding of different data science positions and their requirements and roles, I wasn\u2019t able to get there with this line of analysis.", "If you have ideas on how to improve this or other questions, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn or Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
