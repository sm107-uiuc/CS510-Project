Primarily, the article seeks to help companies that can not afford to have many a big team of Data Scientists and want to optimize their investment.", "I am lucky to work with a great team of Data Scientists from different countries and backgrounds. We are all Data scientists, though, with different mindsets and specializations.", "Mathematicians, physicists, statisticians, economists, and computer scientists. My team is composed of these different backgrounds with different levels of academic degrees: bachelor's, MSc, and PhDs.", "Okay, so then\u2026 how do I find the proper Data Scientist? Let's first try to define them.", "Every Data Scientist should be analytical. However, the Pure Analytical Data Scientist is a numbers cruncher. Linear Algebra and Statistics are the core of its solutions.", "Typical backgrounds for this kind of Data Scientist are mathematics, statistics, physicists, and even economics. Frequently, these profiles are proficient with numbers but less experienced with complex software and data pipelines. But, give them the data and the problem, and they will decode it. Or even better, let them define the problem!", "When do I need a Pure Analytical Data Scientist? You may require this kind of profile when the core solution of your problem is based on statistics and maths. Commonly, the software requirements of your project should be either met already by another team or very light.", "So what does an Analytical Data Scientist deliver? The complex analysis includes reports, conclusions, and suggestions for decisions.", "What tools do they usually use? R, SAS, Python, MATLAB, Excel, ...", "When should you not look for this profile? Online end-to-end models, Big Data (when your data does not fit in RAM), your company does not need to solve challenging analytical solutions, etc.", "The Data Scientist likes to work close to IT. These profiles are Unix users and do not like complex GUIs. They probably know a bit about Docker and even Kubernetes.", "Typical backgrounds are Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Information Systems, etc. So, what to expect from them? They are capable of being integrated into an IT team. Therefore, they can develop end-to-end Machine Learning models or data systems with the IT and/or BI team. It would help if you did not try to leave these guys aside from IT.", "So what does a Hacker Data Scientist deliver? End-to-end prototype APIs, Machine Learning Models, Python libraries, etc.", "What tools do they usually use? Python (scikit-learn, pandas, Keras, seaborn, Flask, etc.), PySpark, SQL (essential), Unix systems, Docker, Cloud Computing (AWS/GCP/Azure), Git, etc.", "When do you not need this profile? When your company uses Windows, the candidate may immediately give up. In those cases where you do not need to deliver online systems, technology and innovation are not a priority, etc.", "Finally, we could not forget the Research Data Scientist. These profiles work in laboratory environments and are far from production systems. They are building new state-of-the-art algorithms that will disrupt the industry. They publish papers at significant conferences, spend time reading research papers and probably hold a Ph.D. or high academic degree.", "Some well-known companies with these profiles are Google DeepMind, Zalando AI, OpenAI, etc. In these cases, the job offers might not come by the name of Data Scientist but rather the specialization they are looking for. However, not only top companies with strong Research Teams can have these specialized roles; your company might want them too!", "Let's put some examples of where a company would be interested in this kind of profile:", "So what does a Research Data Scientist deliver? State-of-the-art algorithms and solutions, conference papers, research, etc.", "What tools do they normally use? It depends on the case. However, most scientific libraries are in Python and MATLAB. Deep Learning low-level frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc., are well-known in the AI community.", "When do you not need this profile? When you want a solution that can be solved cheaper and more straightforward with Amazon Rekognition, Google Vision API, or other SaaS providers. And when you do not want to invest in pure innovation and research.", "These Data Scientist Profiles are not rigid and disjoint definitions. In most cases, you can find Data Scientists that are some mixture of these types. However, depending on how deep or wide your requirements are, you may look for a more generalist or specialized profile. Also, one must take these real-world examples as just that, examples. A Data Scientist should be domain agnostic as long as you have a problem that can be formulated as a mathematical one.", "If what you would like to have is someone who can crack everything at once, then I suggest you read my other article: https://medium.com/@joelqv8/the-data-scientist-unicorn-8c86cb712dde", "This last profile, the Data Scientist Unicorn, never fails to disappoint you.", "Your home for data science.
