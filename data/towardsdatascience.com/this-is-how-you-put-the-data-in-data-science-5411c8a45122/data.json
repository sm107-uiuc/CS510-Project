Faster analytics! Dataset Search represents an incredible speed boost for all you professional analysts and data scientists out there. (But do remember to follow up more carefully with a statistical approach if you\u2019re in danger of taking your inspiration seriously.)", "If you grew up in a world where datasets were rare, precious, and often curated by professors or by data providers \u2014 as most of us did! \u2014 you might have a touch of unconscious bias: you assume that whoever is giving you the data takes responsibility for its quality (and probably has a PhD or two tucked away somewhere). If you mostly worked with datasets in a learning or scientific context, you might have formed the impression that datasets are lovingly massaged before they get to you.", "Real life data science is a jungle, not a sacred space curated by your professors.", "Set that bias aside for a moment and consider a different one: the toxic effect of data worship among laypeople.

You might have that habit without realizing it. Don\u2019t treat data as something capital-D sacred. Reorient toward your streetwise web habits, the ones you always use while searching Google Images or the web at large. You know Google doesn\u2019t own or edit those cat pics or the invisibility potion recipe it serves up when you ask nicely. (You know those invisibility potions don\u2019t work, right?) You know that quality varies and it\u2019s up to you to think critically about the source before you believe everything you read. You know there\u2019s all kinds of stuff out there on the interwebs and you\u2019re long past gullibility. Well, mostly.

Don\u2019t believe everything you read.", "The idea for schema.org was birthed in 2011 by a consortium drawn from the usual suspects: Google, Bing, Yandex, Microsoft, and Yahoo. They were tired of guessing the contents of scraped web pages, so they decided to create a common vocabulary that providers could use to tell them what was what. This vocabulary gets embedded in HTML to indicate which bits describe an event, an address, a recipe, and so forth. It\u2019s a little schema (hence the name!) that describes different types of information. When you choose to add schema.org to your page and tell it the page has a dataset, that dataset becomes eligible to show up in the Dataset Search results.", "Data providers use schema.org to tell us there\u2019s a dataset on their page and describe some metadata about it.", "This isn\u2019t some Google-specific magic; it\u2019s an open community standard that anyone can contribute to. Many companies have been using it behind the scenes for years. The Google-specific bit is your new ability to search those datasets with Dataset Search. We let data providers use schema.org to tell us there\u2019s a dataset on their page and describe some metadata about it. Dataset Search is a lot like regular search, but the results are limited to pages that claim to have a dataset on them. Simple and useful.", "When data came exclusively from a few large providers who took responsibility for curating each one carefully (such as governments and universities), smaller players lacked an avenue to share theirs.", "Imagine this scenario: A group of high school girls is working on an extracurricular robotics project. They\u2019re collecting plenty of data that might be handy for people with similar hobbies. They\u2019re even willing to share it (how nice of them). They\u2019ve put a link to it on their high school\u2019s website. Their data just so happen to be exactly what you need to help your prototyping along. What now?", "If their dataset isn\u2019t searchable, you\u2019ll never find it. If their data must be hosted by a curator (like a government) to be accessible, they\u2019ll be told to get in line\u2026 and they\u2019ll probably never get to the front. Providers who spend scarce resources on heavy curation only have time and attention a limited set of priority sources. The upshot? You\u2019ll never know what you missed out on.", "That\u2019s why I find this whole dataset search paradigm so pretty. Sharing data (without an intermediary telling you to get lost) means that people can find and provide great resources even if they\u2019ve got niche tastes\u2026 or obscure high school websites.", "To participate in sharing searchable data:", "I hope it doesn\u2019t surprise you that the propensity to meet both of these conditions varies from field to field. Governments were among the first to index their datasets, so the kind of datasets they tend to collect (weather data, anyone?) are great candidates for your feeding frenzy, while proprietary data that\u2019s expensive to collect will be sparsely available. That said, more data is being added every day and the search serves up doors to free and paid data alike. (A bit like those watermarked proprietary images in Google Images.) It\u2019s up to you to pick which doors you\u2019d like to go through and whether the toll is worth it.", "A large user base for something like Dataset Search is a symbol of humanity\u2019s evolution with respect to data science and data literacy. We are growing up as a species and extending the way that we can deploy our senses and the way that we communicate with information.", "Data analytics is becoming everyone\u2019s game.", "We used to be impressed by the ability to open a single page on the internet, then by the ability to open 50 tabs in our browsers \u2014 one per datapoint \u2014 to eyeball that mess for patterns. Now we\u2019re hungry for more. We want datasets we can shape and summarize quickly with code tools (like Python and R) built for the job. The data-fluent community has critical mass now; enough of us have skills to understand data and we\u2019re no longer content with picture-covered written pages. (Of the kind you\u2019re staring at right now. Hah.)", "To consume information from sources like the one you\u2019re reading right at this veeery moment, you need a particular kind of literacy. Your mind needs to be able to wrap itself around the written word. That\u2019s a skill you take for granted. If very few people had the skill, this blog post wouldn\u2019t exist. Google probably wouldn\u2019t exist either.", "Dataset Search represents a rising tide in the democratization of data literacy.", "In the same way, Dataset Search represents a rising tide in the democratization of data literacy. This whole development is a way of clambering to the top of the mountain and yodeling, \u201cWorking with data isn\u2019t a completely niche skill anymore!\u201d It\u2019s no longer limited to a few scribes chiseling hieroglyphics into clay tablets.
