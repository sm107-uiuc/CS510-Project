The javascript functionality determines which animal appears in the generated story and then reconstructs an illustration from the trained sketch RNN model using P5.JS.

In future versions I intend to improve this method and incorporate real musical data or maybe some sort of model that would have better results conveying emotions for that would accompany the story\u2019s message or main characters in a more suitable way.", "This is an ongoing projects I intend to work on in the next couple of months, hopefully it will become my thesis project in ITP-NYU.
