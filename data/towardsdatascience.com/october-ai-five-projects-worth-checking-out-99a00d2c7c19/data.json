It becomes very hard for AI enthusiasts and learners to keep abreast of meaningful advances in the field. Applications, Research & Development, individual projects, proprietary software \u2014 every sector is applying DS and AI in its own remarkable way.", "There are two main reasons I am starting this monthly AI webcast:", "But why only five projects, you\u2019d ask\u2026", "Well, I want to keep it concise, useful, and diverse so that we cover all the important sectors without being overwhelmed with a massive list of projects.", "How are these useful? I will try my best to give you action items for each project on the list given that the project is publicly available and not proprietary.", "So, here\u2019s the list of five cool projects that I found worth checking out:", "Open-source enthusiasts from all over the world have been working on new, enhanced, and deprecated features for the past year. Though the beta versions were being rolled out for quite some time, the official release of Python 3.9.0 happened on October 5, 2020.", "The official documentation contains all the details of the latest features and changelog. Following is the list of features that may come in handy for our day-to-day programming tasks:", "There have been many recurring issues reported across all the major forums(like StackOverflow) around lstrip() and rstrip() methods.", "I\u2019ve also covered all the major updates in greater detail here in my blog:", "CNN Explainer is a browser-based visual illustration of a Convolution Neural Network. It\u2019s intriguing how in a few lines of code, using libraries like Keras or fastai, we can create a state of the art CNN that classifies objects, but understanding the mechanics of how the CNN processes an image to obtain the final output is crucial. This is where the CNN Explainer comes in. If you have ever struggled to fully understand what goes on in a CNN or if you just require a clearer refresher, both from a mathematical and visual standpoint, this tool is perfect for you.", "The project uses TensorFlow.js, an in-browser GPU-accelerated deep learning library to load the pre-trained model for visualization. The entire interactive system is written in Javascript using Svelte as a framework and D3.js for visualizations. You only need a web browser to get started learning CNNs today!", "This was created by Jay Wang, Robert Turko, Omar Shaikh, Haekyu Park, Nilaksh Das, Fred Hohman, Minsuk Kahng, and Polo Chau, which was the result of a research collaboration between Georgia Tech and Oregon State.", "Prerequisites to fully understand this tool:", "If you have not done either of the above two, it is recommended to learn about the basics of neural networks and convolution neural networks before using the tool.", "CNN Explainer uses a very simple CNN called the TinyVGG which comprises just three convolution layers, a couple of max-pool layers and a flatten layer to classify an image into one of 10 classes \u2014 a lifeboat, a ladybug, a pizza and 7 other classes.", "You can use one of their images or upload your own image to view how the image traverses across the neural network and how the neural network captures certain features of the image.", "But visualizing how the images appear in different layers is just the tip of the iceberg. By using the tool, you can also understand how the following play a part in CNN:", "Try to answer these sample questions to test your understanding of CNNs demonstrated in the project", "It is a python library (pip install tensor-sensor) created with the purpose of handling exceptions when building neural networks (or even just simple matrix-based calculations like a dot product) using NumPy, Tensorflow, or PyTorch. Usually when using these three libraries, if we were to make an error in say, the dimension of the matrix when computing a matrix multiplication, the interpreter will throw an error without stating much of the specifics, making it all the more difficult to debug \u2014 usually resulting in the coder writing some explicit print statements to see what went wrong. TensorSenor aims to fix this issue by doing two things -", "In TensorSensor, there are primarily two types of Context Managers used:", "This is used for the sole purpose of handling exceptions. It can be used on pre-built Keras objects or even for our own custom created definitions.", "Instead of handling exceptions, we may just want to observe the matrix dimensions for a clearer understanding.", "We can also extend these context managers for 3D tensors where the first dimension could be batches or even a 4D tensor.", "There is one more function present, tsensor.astviz(), which is used to create an Abstract Tree Syntax, like the following:", "This is a proprietary project on the list. So, Nvidia recently announced that their AI experts are working on this cloud-AI video-streaming platform that will use GANs to boost bandwidth performance.", "The platform uses a neural network in place of the standard software called video codec which is typically used to compress and decompress video for transmission over the internet.", "Their work enables a video call with one-tenth the network bandwidth users typically need.", "A sender first transmits a reference image of the caller. Then, rather than sending a fat stream of pixel-packed images, it sends data on the locations of a few key points around the user\u2019s eyes, nose, and mouth.", "A generative adversarial network on the receiver\u2019s side uses the initial image and the facial key points to reconstruct subsequent images on a local GPU. As a result, much less data is sent over the network", "The technique works even when callers are wearing a hat, glasses, headphones, or a mask.", "A more serious feature in the works uses a neural network to align the position of users\u2019 faces for a more natural experience. Callers watch their video feeds, but they appear to be looking directly at their cameras, enhancing the feeling of a face-to-face connection.", "Tone Transfer is a Google Research project that transforms everyday sounds into musical instruments.", "Tone Transfer was born from a collaboration between two teams within Google Research: Magenta and AIUX", "Tone Transfer is built on a technology Magenta open-sourced earlier this year called Differentiable Digital Signal Processing or DDSP.", "At the beginning of this project, the team was using this Colab Notebook to demonstrate their work. After multiple iterations of design explorations and user research, the AIUX team came up with this platform that made it super fun to play with the DDSP model on an application level.", "They do this by training machine learning models to distill what makes an instrument sound like that particular instrument. It picks up the pitch, octave, loudness, along with a number of other features, and remolds everyday sounds into musical instruments.", "To extract pitch from audio, another model developed by Google Research, SPICE is used.", "Upcoming releases will enable you to easily train your own DDSP models and deploy them everywhere: a phone, an audio plugin or a website.", "If you want to watch me review all of these projects, here is the video version of this blog with walkthroughs and coding screencasts.", "With this channel, I am planning to roll out a couple of series covering the entire data science space.
