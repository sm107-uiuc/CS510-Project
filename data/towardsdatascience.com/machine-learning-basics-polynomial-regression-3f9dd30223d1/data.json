In this article, we will go through the program for building a Polynomial Regression model based on the non-linear data.", "In the previous examples of Linear Regression, when the data is plotted on the graph, there was a linear relationship between both the dependent and independent variables. Thus, it was more suitable to build a linear model to get accurate predictions. What if the data points had the following non-linearity making the linear model giving an error in predictions due to non-linearity?", "In this case, we have to build a polynomial relationship which will accurately fit the data points in the given plot. This is called Polynomial Regression. The formula for a Polynomial Regression curve is given as y=w1x+w2x\u00b2+..+b", "Below are the GIFs of fitting both a Linear Regression model and a Polynomial Regression model on a non-linear data.", "As we can see, the Linear regression always tends to make an error however hard it tries to fit in the data. On the other hand, the Polynomial Regression graph manages to fit the data points onto the line more accurately.", "In this example, we will go through the implementation of Polynomial Regression, in which we will predict the Salary of a new employee based on his position level in his previous company from the salary data for the same position levels in the new company.", "In this data, we have the two independent variables namely, Position and Level. There is one independent variable i.e., Salary. So, in this problem we have to train a Polynomial Regression model with this data to understand the correlation between the Level and Salary of the employee data in the company and be able to predict the salary for the new employee based on this data.", "In this first step, we will be importing the libraries required to build the ML model. The NumPy library and the matplotlib are imported. Additionally, we have imported the Pandas library for data analysis.", "In this step, we shall use pandas to store the data obtained from my github repository and store it as a Pandas DataFrame using the function \u201cpd.read_csv\u201d.", "We go through our dataset and assign the independent variable (x) to the second column with the column name \u201cLevel\u201d and the dependent variable (y) to the last column, which is the \u201cSalary\u201d to be predicted.", "We use the corresponding .iloc function to slice the DataFrame to assign these indexes to X and Y. In this, the Level is taken as the independent variable and is assigned to X. The dependent variable that is to be predicted is the last column (-1) which is Salary and it is assigned to y. We print the DataFrame \u201cdataset\u201d to see if we have got the correct columns for our training data.", "The dataset on which we are using has very few number of rows and hence we train the entire dataset for building the Polynomial Regression model. In this the \u201cPolynomialFeatures\u201d function is used to assign the degree of the polynomial line that we are going to plot. In this, the degree is set as 4.", "The independent variable X is then fitted with the PolynomialFeatures class and is converted to a new variable X_poly. In this, the variable X is converted to a new matrix X_Poly which consists of all the polynomial combinations of features with degree=4.", "The class \u201cLinearRegression\u201d is also imported and is assigned to the variable \u201clin_reg\u201d which is fitted with the X_poly and y for building the model.", "In this step, we are going to predict the values Salary based on the Polynomial Regression model built. The \u201cregressor.predict\u201d function is used to predict the values for our independent variable, X_poly. We assign the predicted values as y_pred. We now have two data, y(real values) and y_pred (predicted values).", "In this step , we shall print both the values of y as Real Values and y_pred values as Predicted Values of each X_test in a Pandas DataFrame.", "We can see that the model has done a great job in fitting the data and predicting the salary of the employee based on the position level.", "In this last step, we shall visualize the polynomial model that was built using the given data and plot the values of \u201cy\u201d and \u201cy_pred\u201d on the graph and analyze the results", "In this graph, the Real values are plotted in \u201cRed\u201d color and the Predicted values are plotted in \u201cGreen\u201d color. The Polynomial Regression line that is generated is drawn in \u201cBlack\u201d color.", "I am attaching a link of my github repository where you can find the Google Colab notebook and the data files for your reference.", "Hope I have been able to clearly explain the program for building a Polynomial Regression model.", "You can also find the explanation of the program for other Regression models below:", "We will come across the more complex models of Regression, Classification and Clustering in the upcoming articles.
