It is not a trivial matter and is far from exhausted.In this series of posts we\u2019ll start with the simplest statistical models and how we model even the most sophisticated ensemble and deep learning models trying to figure out the whys of a prediction.", "The initial suggestion for the content of this series will be as follows:", "Part 0\u2014 What is the scope of data sciencePart 1 \u2014 Introduction to Interpreting ML(This Post)Part 2 \u2014 Interpreting models of high bias and low variance. Part 3 \u2014 Interpreting models of low bias and high variance.Part 4 \u2014 Is it possible to solve the trade-off between bias and variance?Part 5 \u2014 Local Methods of Interpretability.Part 6 \u2014 Global Methods of Interpretability.", "To understand how to interpret machine learning algorithms, let\u2019s first understand what a machine learning algorithm is.", "Quite generally, for us Machine Learning Algorithms (hereinafter only ML) are a paradigm shift from \u201ctraditional programming\u201d where we need to explicitly pass all heuristics to a new concept, where instead of writing every action that the algorithm must perform, We just go through several examples and let ML learn what are the \u201cbest\u201d (lowest cost) decisions.", "That is, algorithms that receive inputs and can transform outputs without being explicitly programmable, for us, will be ML algorithms. Interpreting ML algorithms is understood how they can transform inputs into outputs.", "If ML is just a way of mapping inputs to outputs in a (sometimes) quite clever way, it seems like a good idea to understand how it can do this magic, right?", "An example: Bank fraud detection algorithms.We map a behavior, collect the data, train a model and you\u2019re done! We have a very clever way of detecting future fraud. And now? What is this algorithm doing? If just by curiosity it would no longer make sense to understand it here are some more practical reasons:", "Even in this very simple example, we have identified several good reasons for understanding what the algorithm does inside.", "If you are still not convinced of the importance, there is a very strong trend starting in Europe where companies are already forced to explain the reasons for a decision such as refusing credit, insurance, job vacancy, etc. makes a lot of sense, so it should not be long before this is a daily concern when using predictive models.", "There are hundreds of posts talking about the trade-off between bias and variance and the goal here is not to re-explain all the concepts, just to use them as language for the next posts to come. So without theoretical formalism, we can divide the prediction error (y-yhat) of any model into 3 distinct components.", "We discussed in the previous post that Machine Learning may differ from Statistics because the former is concerned with inference, causality, exogeneity, etc. and the latter is concerned almost exclusively with improving predictions. So we can take the same function, for example a logistic regression and statistical analysis, which would interpret if betas are significant, if the waste has a normal distribution or Machine Learning analysis, how is the relationship between Precision and Recall, what is the AUC of the model, etc.", "So, because statistics are interested in understanding data, you create models for it, these models need to be highly interpretable! For them to be interpretable, the models must be Simple! But if the models are simple, as we have seen, they are highly skewed.", "ML models have the exact opposite, as we are not originally concerned with interpreting them, they are very biased, in our concept, they have few prerequisites, and the cost of this is lack of interpretability, this series of posts try to bring these two worlds together. High metrics with high interpretability.", "A simple example is linear regression, one of the oldest and simplest algorithms, highly interpretable, very low variance (we hardly need to separate data in test training), but highly biased. As biases here are the simplifications for the model to work well, below some of these pre-Requirements to use this approach:", "We\u2019ll look at these and other prerequisites as well as how to interpret them in the next post.", "To put it all together, let\u2019s use a new term to describe this new way of separating / classifying ML algorithms. On the one hand we have the most traditional algorithms, born in statistics and econometrics, with some prerequisites to work and highly interpretable, there would be no modern science without them, and their interpretation is that of the scientific character for data science, are the \u201cWhite Box\u201d algorithms.", "And at the other extreme, we have those ML algorithms that we know work very well, because their metrics are great, they can work with millions of variables at the same time, they can make representations of complex vector spaces in smaller dimensions, with very few prerequisites (low bias),can even generate images and text, at the cost that we do not have so much control over what he does inside, we call these algorithms \u201cBlack Box\u201d.", "In the next posts our goal will be to combine the good side of these two extremes, high interpretability with high predictive ability.", "Next post: Part 2 \u2014 Interpreting high bias and low variance models.", "Your home for data science.
