Globally tech giants like Google, Amazon Facebook, etc are trying to leverage the power of Machine Learning in their products. Though the opportunities for aspiring data scientists are growing exponentially still a large group of people are not clear about what machine learning is.", "And that is exactly why I am here to help you. This article will be the first in a series of articles named Machine Learning Recipes wherein we will take a look into every aspect of machine learning, first theoretically, then mathematically, and finally practically.", "In this article, I would be trying to give you an intuition not only about what machine learning is but also its different types, the recent developments, and the best resources to get started with machine learning.", "Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides a computer or any machine the ability to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The aim behind Machine Learning is to make machines do things by their own without being explicitly programmed.", "The reason behind making machines do things is the high accuracy of results that they deliver without getting exhausted. The quality of the outcome of a task performed by a human may vary and at times can be exhausting too but machines can do high-frequency repetitive tasks with high accuracy without any fatigue or getting bored.", "Since the inception of the internet, the amount of data generation has been increasing significantly. Whenever we take any action on a website or an application, we are generating data. Alongside the development of cloud computing, the cost of storing the data has also reduced significantly paving the way for further growth in ML and related field.", "One of the biggest confusions that beginners in the field face are the difference between Artificial Intelligence(AI), Machine Learning(ML), and Deep Learning(DL).", "Artificial Intelligence is a technique that enables machines to mimic human behavior. The ultimate aim of AI is to make intelligent machines that can perform human tasks and take their own smart decisions.", "Machine Learning is a sub-part of AI that uses statistical methods that enable machines to improve with experience without being explicitly programmed.", "Deep Learning is a sub-part of ML that make use of Neural Networks (similar to neurons in human being) to simulate human brain like behavior. Deep Learning comes into action when the dataset consists of a huge number of observations or data points.", "Another important term that is usually confused with machine learning is Data Science. Data science is the analysis of data that we generate for various insights that can potentially serve a multitude of business purposes.", "There are several tools and languages that can be used for performing Machine Learning. The exact choice of the tools may differ and the tools to be used depends on the need and scale of operation.", "Python and R are the most preferred choice of programming languages for Machine Learning. The data is generally stored in CSV format files, though excel sheets can also be used. Apart from this basic knowledge of statistics is necessary for understanding the machine learning algorithms.", "There are various kinds of machine learning algorithms that may be used in various different situations. Generally, there are three different types of machine learning algorithms namely Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.", "Supervised Machine Learning: Supervised machine learning problems are problems where we want to make predictions based on a set of examples.", "Unsupervised Machine Learning: Unsupervised machine learning problems are problems where our data does not have a set of a defined set of categories, but instead we are looking for machine learning algorithms to help us organize the data.", "Examples of unsupervised machine learning problems could be genomics. In genomics we provide an algorithm with thousands of different genes and the algorithm will then cluster the genes into groups of related genes. This could be genes related to lifespan, hair color, etc. The outcome is typically obtained by clustering or segmentation.", "The various algorithms for unsupervised learning include k means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, and Neural Network.", "Another type of machine learning study that has been gaining spark recently is Reinforcement Learning. It is often regarded as the hope of true artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.", "The quantity of data for training an ML model depends on the problem we are trying to solve. There are various online repositories where you can find datasets for training and building your machine learning model.", "Some of the most popular sites to get data for your model are Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, and Google Dataset Search.", "Data is available in large quantities these days. From logs on websites and smartphones to health devices \u2014 we are in a constant process of creating data.", "Data can broadly be classified into two types:", "Machine Learning models can work on both Structured as well as Unstructured Data. However, before actually building the Machine Learning model we need to convert unstructured data into structured data first.", "The first step in building a machine learning model is Data Collection. Data collection refers to the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established system.", "Then comes cleaning and manipulating the data for our model. Data Exploration and cleaning help us to remove outliers, and missing values and transform the data into the required format.", "Once our data has been prepared, we train the model over the training data followed by testing it over the test data. Our final step is improving our model to yield even better accuracy.", "This is just a brief introduction to give you an intuition of the steps involved in building and deploying machine learning models. We will be discussing in detail about these steps in the upcoming articles.", "Some of the best resources for practicing machine learning are:", "As mentioned multiple times \u2014 Machine Learning is a very active field of research. From Andrew Ng to Peter Norvig, the contributions of top experts and researchers cannot be spoken about enough.", "You\u2019ve chosen the right career at exactly the right time. Happy learning!", "Your home for data science.
