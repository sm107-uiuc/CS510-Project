How does filmmakers\u2019 use of color change over time? Can we guess who is the director of a film just by looking at its color palette?", "In filmmaking, color is one of the most powerful means of conveying information to the audience. Mastering colors is indeed crucial, and many of the greatest directors and cinematographers have an extensive background in visual arts.", "Color can affect us psychologically and emotionally without us even becoming aware. Different colors can be used to create harmony either tension within a scene, to reinforce an idea the director is trying to convey to the spectators, to bring attention to a key visual theme, to show a character\u2019s journey, and more.", "Depending on the plot, the main topic, the target audience or even just the director\u2019s preferences, films can be aggressively colorful, deeply exploring the entire color wheel, or they can be monochromatic and gentle, following a completely different aesthetic.", "These and many other perspectives of chromatic storytelling will be explored here using a data-driven approach and building appropriate data-viz tools, starting from the next chapter. On our colorful journey, we will explore some interesting examples picked up from famous movies, trying to guess the reasons behind directors\u2019 choices and scratching the surface of what can be done through R scripting.", "Note: technical sections have been marked with \u201c \u2447 \u201d. Feel free to skip them if you want to follow the main flow of the article without being involved in the geeky coding part!", "Videos are just collections of consecutive images (i.e. frames) that give the impression of motion when reproduced at a suitable speed. Each video can be formally represented as a 4th-order tensor.", "An image is digitally defined as a 3rd-order tensor, where each layer is a two-dimensional array of numbers representing a different color channel. The color of an image is hence defined by the combination of these channels.", "Depending on the encoding, each unit of the tensor (i.e. pixels) can be a real number (HSL, HSB/HSV, normalized RGB), or an integer (RGB). For a better explaination of color models, have a look at this. Let\u2019s stick with the RGB encoding for now, the most intuitive one. RGB is an additive color model, where frames are represented by the superimposition of three color channels: Red (R), Green (G) and Blue (B). Each unit of the channel is an integer numeber whithin the 0-255 intensity range (i.e. 8 bit).", "The data we have to work on are tensors. Retrieving the tensorial components of a video source is a bit tricky in R; therefore, in this intial phase we\u2019ll work in Matlab, using the VideoReader object.", "The script above inspects the video source frame by frame. Each frame is a Height \u00d7Width \u00d73 tensor. Since we are mostly interested in exploring the color trend over the entire clip rather than focusing on the palette of a single frame at this point, the only information we need to extract here is the average color (i.e RGB triplet) of each frame.", "Running this preprocessing pipeline takes some time. Movies are usually displayed at 24 fps (i.e. frames per second), which means we have to process more than twenty images for each second of video. Assuming an input resolution of 720p, to get the average color of a single frame we must compute the mean of 1280 \u22c5720 =921600 pixels \u2243 1 Mp three times (one per channel). Therefore, the amount of bytes to be processed to get one second of video is 0.92 Mpixel \u22c524 frames\u22c5 8 bit\u22c5 3 channels \u2243 66 Mb! This is basically the reason why video sources are so heavy, by the way.", "Once the processing pipeline has run, we end up with a comma-separated values file of three columns (i.e. RGB average values) and N rows, one for each frame of the input video source. Now we are ready to go!", "Since our input is basically just a temporal sequence of colors, the very first thing one might plot is a color timeline. All the colorful barcodes we\u2019re going to create from now on will be referred as framelines. Beautiful pieces of art based on movie framelines can be found here (many thanks to Charlie Clark for the inspiration!) and here.This is an example of what we\u2019ll be able to build at the end of this chapter:", "Each line represents the average color of a consecutive set of frames, starting from time 0 (left) to the end of the movie (right). The last tile is the average tone of the entire movie. The thickness of tiles depends on the time window we want to average. If the time window is too wide, meaningful color information can be lost in the averaging process; if we pick a very short time window instead, overfitting will make the frameline quite difficult to interpret. If we juxtapose the framelines of Miyazaki\u2019s Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa, we can clearly see how the most interesting color variations are washed out when the sampling window is too wide.", "Let\u2019s see how to implement all of this in R now. We already have a .csv file with the average RGB value of each frame, so the data import is pretty much done.", "Now that we have a proper input data frame, we will use the ggplot2 package to draw our first colorful frameline. Ggplot is probably the most powerful and popular data viz package on R. Plotting complex framelines requires a bit of mastering with ggplot and fall ouside the purpose of this first article. Anyway, here is a simplified but fully-functioning script to plot your first framelines:", "Color averages usually appear to be very dark/desaturated. This is quite physiological, as scenes are often played on neutral shades of grey and dark tones, and today\u2019s movies tend to be a bit colorless. We can help our brain and eyeballs in dinstinguish colors with a little vividness boost. This can be easily done switching from the RGB color model to the Hue-Saturation-Lightness model (HSL) and turning up the last 2 components. We will spend some words about HSL later. For now, let\u2019s just say that the modCol function in plotwidgets package makes the vividness boost implementation very straight-forward.", "Now, let\u2019s make things more interesting by inspecting the colors of the Star Wars universe. With a slight modification of the previous script, we can easily build a visual map like this one:", "Apart from being a piece of art I would proudly hang above my bed, this collection of framelines discloses a significant amount of information about George Lucas\u2019 use of color in his epic space opera. Let\u2019s focus for instance on the episode with the more atypical palette: The Empire Strikes Back (2nd row).", "In this episode of the Skywalkers\u2019 odissey, our heroes cross the galaxy landing on three different locations: Hoth, Dagobah and Cloud City. Here George Lucas sapiently associates different dominant colors to each location: Yale blue for the icy Hoth, a dark seaweed green for the swampy Dagobah and a pastel violet for Cloud City. Different colors help to show the spatial transition along the story, but they also set the tone of each section tweaking with saturation and brightness: Luke\u2019s introspective moment on the swamps of Dagobah is less saturated then the sorrounding sections, and every time the Dark Side of the Force rises, dark tones become dominant. These patterns can be observed several times along the entire saga, giving it some color consistency.", "Color consistency can be observed whithin each trilogy as well: dominant hues are cold in the Original Trilogy, switching to a much more warm tone in the Prequel Trilogy where the climax peaks on an intense fire red during the famous duel on Mustafar. Let\u2019s try to visualize these trends.", "Few sections above, we mentioned that RGB isn\u2019t the only color model around, neither the most interesting one for our purposes. It\u2019s just easy and intuitive. To inspect interesting color trends, it may be a good idea to switch from RGB to the HSL model. Hue (H), Lightness (L) and Saturation (S) are in fact some of the most important properties of color when we speak of chromatic storytelling.", "The HSL color space can be seen as a bicone, where each point (i.e. color) is expressed in a cylindrical-coordinates system whit S \u2208 [0,1], L \u2208 [0, 1] and H \u2208 [0\u00b0, 360\u00b0]. While we all know what saturation and brightness mean, the definition of hue may be a bit ambiguous. The International Commission of Illumination (CIE) defines hue as the degree to which a stimulus can be described as similar to or different from stimuli that are described as red, green, blue and yellow. We can basically refer to it as the color shade.", "Each of these three channels/properties can be isolated setting the others to a fixed value: for instance, we can inspect the average saturation value of each episode by setting the brightness channel to 0.5 (half intensity) and the hue channel to 0\u00b0 (i.e. pure red). Brightness and saturation channel might be re-scaled to exhalt the differences between movies. Such inspection can be visualized in form of summary tiles, where each square represents a different episode.", "The above shown summary tiles confirm what we said above about hues. Moreover, we can clearly see that the Prequel Trilogy appears to be less dark and highly saturated compared to both the first and the latter one. On the contrary, the first two episodes of the Sequel Trilogy are the darkest and less saturated chapters of the entire saga, with Episode VII: The Force Awakens winning the first prize in both the categories. HSL channels trend over time can be better inspected merging together all the framelines and smoothing the resulting time series.", "At this point, it could be funny to start guessing how the next episode will be. Considering that the 1st and 3rd chapters of each trilogy have always been less saturated than the 2nd, we could expect from Episode IX a lower level of saturation. Concerning hues, the color tiles matrix is pretty much symmetrical, therefore it\u2019s hard to tell what the temperature of the movie will be; considering the overall tone of the saga, we can speculate on a not-so-warm red-ish overall tone. Place your bet and see you at the end of December to know who\u2019s the winner!", "Now that we know how to collect the hints that might lay within the color of a movie, let\u2019s have a look on the work of some of the most iconic directors and their movies. Many filmmakers have developed a distinct aesthetic style that is easily recognizable through the use of color palettes in their works. Among recent movie directors, one of the most noticeable color palette belongs to Wes Anderson and his extravagant stories.", "With a great love for pastel tones, Anderson puts these kinds of colours into almost every element of the scenery. This allows him a complete monopoly over the meaning and subtext of his films.", "There are many conscious and unconscious bias that lead a director to choose similar palettes over his/her career. For instance, nature and ecology are the milestones of Miyazaki\u2019s mindset, and this is clearly reflected in the color palette he uses in the vast majority of his masterpieces.", "Similarly to what happens with directors, a particular color palette might characterize movies and tv shows as well; some films play on specific colors so much that they end up identifying themselves with the colors in question. Let\u2019s think about green, for instance. What is the first movie you associate with green? And why is it The Matrix?", "The Matrix is probably one of the most obvious and famous case of color association in cinematography, as every scene that takes place inside the virtual world is tinted green, taking inspiration from the phosphorous green of old monitors. Color symbolism is strong and evident in Wachowskis\u2019 work; in fact, green isn\u2019t the only main color we see: when the scene moves from the Matrix to the real world, green tints are entirely replaced by a dark blue palette.", "The reason behind this choice is not random of course: in color psychology, the yellow-ish green is associated to nausea and sickness, while the blue tone should make the audience feel more comfortable. In this sense, by setting up Neo\u2019s normal existence as a sick, claustrophobic green, we can appreciate the freshness the real world offers with its blue tints. Brightness contrast, instead, is used to remind the audience how dramatic reality is compared to the fake and controlled environment of the Matrix.", "Speaking of green: have you ever noticed how green-ish the latest Harry Potter\u2019s movies are? Well, it didn\u2019t start exactly like that.", "Actually, Harry Potter sums up pretty well all the things we said about color until now. Characters and locations are clearly defined by the sapient use of different tints: think about the four houses of Hogwarts, the spells and teachers\u2019 offices, for instance. During the saga, directors explore the entire color spectrum, slowly fading from a bright, warm, red-brown set to a dark, aseptic and cold green, crossing through some blue tints in the middle of the saga. In this sense, it\u2019s interesting to see how color evolves together with the characters, getting colder and darker while following the course of events.", "JK Rowling started it all with a book for children, with kids running and screaming around in a magic world. To capture this athmosphere, Chris Columbus, previously known for directing Home Alone, decided to use a warm and bright color palette. As for the books, the story quickly grew and matured, becoming more and more complex and tragic as Harry grew up and became an adult. This is clearly reflected in the chromatic choices of the succeeding directors, as pointed out by the monotonic descent trend of the lightness component over the saga.", "Here is where the first part of our chromatic exploration ends. We saw that there are many ways to use color in film, and many different techniques can be developed to explore these approaches. In order to collect all the functions used along this project and make them easily accessible in the R environment, I\u2019ve built a R package called chromaR.
