She left academia a few years ago for the private sector. Having worked in both academic research and business consulting, she tells me there\u2019s a big difference between what academia wants and what business wants from data science.", "\u201cA lot of organizations will just use very basic descriptive statistics to understand performance,\u201d she told me.", "Like many of the young talent in the growing profession, she understands what better predictive modeling can do for decision making.", "The only problem, though, is it\u2019s a challenge to make that clear to the business stakeholders.", "\u201cOftentimes the metrics they want are going to be something like \u2018Group A performed 60% or 20% better,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how they\u2019re gonna make a decision.\u201d", "While that type of information is certainly handy to know, it means that many businesses are not fully utilizing the data they have, much less the advanced skills of data scientists.", "\u201cDescriptive statistics are not for decision making,\u201d said Jasmine. \u201cThey\u2019re not inferential. That\u2019s something I wish more people widely understood.\u201d", "This is part of the growing pains the new data science profession is experiencing as it is embraced by businesses that haven\u2019t historically used statistical modeling.", "\u201cI think we have a pretty big problem within the space of data,\u201d said Jasmine. \u201cEvery organization wants to be data-centric, but organizations don\u2019t necessarily know how to do that. From a leadership perspective, they don\u2019t understand the data and they don\u2019t know how to monetize it.\u201d", "Academia, insurance, finance, and pharmaceuticals have relied on statistical modeling for much longer than most industries. They have developed a shared vocabulary and understanding for what researchers, actuaries, economists, and biostatisticians actually do for their organizations.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a great thing about academia and research,\u201d said Jasmine. \u201cYou\u2019re working with people with the same mental models and generally the same skill set. I\u2019ve never had to break down a model, because they understand what it is and what it does.\u201d", "Other businesses have not developed that shared understanding yet.", "\u201cWhen I\u2019m running any type of testing, I try to get away from the words hypothesis testing,\u201d said Jasmine. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think people understand that or it ends up becoming a little too academic for that environment.\u201d", "While many companies proudly state they\u2019re investing in data and predictive analytics, many still focus on what Jasmine referred to as \u201cdescriptive statistics.\u201d", "Descriptive statistics usually show up in organizations as key performance indicators (KPI), which is what most organizations think of when they think of data. Most KPIs are unique to an industry, but they usually include simple calculations like average, total, median, etc.", "KPIs are important to a business. They are a good way to rally teams behind a shared business strategy, but there\u2019s a point where creating new KPIs has a diminishing rate of return for businesses.", "Predictive analytics offers more precision and insights for improving businesses once they reach peak effectiveness for KPI reporting.", "Data scientists know this. Like Jasmine though, they\u2019re having to adapt their language to help stakeholders see this value.", "\u201cI think that anyone that\u2019s a data scientist or a data analyst is going to struggle with is trying to communicate any test they\u2019ve run to stakeholders,\u201d said Jasmine. \u201cI think the biggest thing is being able to not only explain what happened but explain what didn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "How can data scientists learn to better explain this stuff?", "One answer might be better data storytelling.", "If you follow data science closely, you\u2019ve probably heard of the term data storytelling. Data storytelling is something of a buzzword nowadays. But like most buzzwords, there is value hidden beneath the surface.", "I spoke with Brent Dykes, who authored the book Effective Data Storytelling: How to Drive Change with Data, Narrative, and Visuals, and he explained to me why data science professionals often ignore this skill set.", "\u201cI think there\u2019s some hesitancy from data people to be persuasive with their information and I think that\u2019s a mistake,\u201d said Brent. \u201cYou can\u2019t be completely objective, especially if we want people to take action on the data. I think we need to guide audiences down a certain path and interpret the information in a certain way.\u201d", "Some data scientists may not like this advice. It can sound like manipulation, which is certainly a valid concern. There\u2019s no shortage of instances where people have phrased data in a way to give false information to the general public.", "But according to Brent, being good at telling a story does not mean manipulating the audience.", "\u201cIn Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a group of people that did some research into the benefits of eating chocolate. They ran a bunch of tests to see how chocolate affected the health of these individuals that consume the chocolate and then published their findings in a reputable health scientific journal in Europe.\u201d", "He was referring to an intentionally bogus study about how chocolate would help you lose weight. This study was published in a respected journal and was shared by respectable news outlets all over the world.", "\u201cThe research was really bad science,\u201d said Brent. \u201c[The researchers] wanted to show how people latch onto these facts and figures that come out of these studies. That\u2019s an example of what looks like a data story on the surface, but it\u2019s actually not a data story because it\u2019s not built on a solid data foundation.\u201d", "In other words, good data storytelling will never be good if it didn\u2019t start with good analysis in the first place. A data scientist who uses good methodology and doesn\u2019t use data storytelling as a shortcut to a good narrative isn\u2019t being manipulative at all. Both are required, according to Brent.", "\u201cObviously, we have their best interest at hand,\u201d said Brent. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to deceive or manipulate [stakeholders] in any way. We\u2019re just trying to show them the insights that they need to pay attention to and the consequences of those insights. Otherwise, what are we doing?\u201d", "Even though stakeholders are used to thinking in terms of KPIs, they probably would appreciate the insights from predictive analytics. We just have to learn how to sell those benefits.", "That helps explain the problem that Jasmine, the data scientist, highlighted earlier. Most data scientists understand predictive analytics, but the stakeholder seems to want only descriptive statistics.", "Why? It\u2019s far easier for stakeholders to find a story in descriptive statistics than predictive analytics.", "An analyst who states \u201cGroup A did 60% better than Group B\u201d does more to tell a narrative than a data scientist who focuses on telling how they reduced false positives in their model.", "As Brent told me, \u201c[a good] data storyteller understands the audience, they understand the data, and they\u2019re able to communicate in an effective way using a narrative structure.\u201d", "If you noticed though, Brent didn\u2019t just advise focusing on a good narrative structure \u2014 you also have to consider the audience too.", "Something data scientists may want to ask themselves is whether their audience really needs predictive analytics at all? Maybe descriptive statistics tell all the data stories their industry will ever need.", "The hard truth may be that the audience just doesn\u2019t need the story we\u2019re trying to tell.", "Brent Dykes provides great advice on data storytelling in his book, which you can find on Amazon here. I also provide some tips in my article on presenting analyses here.", "Your home for data science.
