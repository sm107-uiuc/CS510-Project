But the flu, just like COVID-19, is a contagious viral infection with significant similarities and it is the most broadly studied relative to COVID-19 that we can look at. By comparing the spread and the death toll of COVID-19 to influenza in Europe, we can learn something about what might be ahead and how we can place this pandemic in the bigger scheme of things.", "I also looked a bit closer to the predictability of the spread of COVID-19 by probabilistic modelling.", "It is good to start looking at the obvious: people die of the seasonal flu. In Europe for instance, the flu season leads to a significant increase in \u201cexcess deaths\u201d, with a significant variation from one winter to the next. Nielsen et al. provide a good overview of the excess mortality for 2014\u20132018. EuroMOMO updates this mortality data on a weekly basis. The latest figures are given below. Some observations:", "Although it is still early to make hard conclusions on these graphs, one possible hypothesis could be that there might well be some beneficial counteracting phenomena at play, reducing deaths in the current COVID-19 period. Maybe the measures and social awareness lead to less spread of other deceases for instance.", "The big take-away here is however that the seasonal flu can lead to significant and quickly occurring peaks in excess death, for instance in the 2016/2017 flu season. It remains interesting to see that the biggest spike, in Italy and Spain, are reaching a peak about as high as a severe flu season. This is aligned to for instance the hypothesis of Fauci et al., which states that COVID-19 might turn out similar to a severe flu season, considering the large underestimation of overall number of (mild and asymptomatic) cases.", "Let\u2019s look a bit closer to the progression of a bad flu season as mapped by Nielsen et al. It is worthwhile to reproduce the full figure of mortality attributable to influenza below. In total, severe flu seasons lead to about 28 deaths attributable to influenza per 100,000 people in Europa. At the moment, COVID-19 is approaching this death toll in Spain (28.3), Italy (27.3), New York (24.3). Next countries are Belgium (14.1) and France (13.7).", "Now, we can transform these cumulative figures in daily figures and compare it to the trend of daily cases and deaths of COVID-19. I have applied a growth model to evaluate the trend, and used Markov Chain Monte Carlo to fit the model. The daily confirmed cases and deaths are shown for a few European countries with relatively wide variation in measures as well as the U.S. It can be seen that, over the last 2 weeks, the daily cases stagnate: first in Italy, then in Belgium and Germany and now also in the U.S. Many factors play a role here, not in the least the amount of testing (in my other post I look at this a bit more closely). However, it is interesting to see that the fatalities follow the trend of the cases by a few days (3 to 5), although the ratio varies a lot (about 10% for Italy and Belgium and 1.2% for Germany, where testing is done more broadly). This makes sense if you assume that the testing procedure remains constant over time (e.g. only testing critical cases) and that the ratio of critical cases remains largely constant over time.", "The daily deaths of the flu season of 2016/2017 is given in the figure as well. You can see that the daily deaths increase more slowly for influenza (likely linked to the lower R\u2080) but stagnate at about the same level as observed in Belgium and Italy, slightly above the current daily level of Sweden and significantly above the level of Germany. Looking at the trend of the confirmed cases in the U.S., about the same daily deaths can be expected in the coming days, stagnating at around the same level. It will be an interesting (and probably never finished) exercise to evaluate how much of this stagnation is attributable to soft/targeted measures (contact tracing and quarantine), social awareness, hard measures (lock-downs), seasonal change and natural progression of the epidemic. The latter is surely depends on the portion of asymptomatic cases which probably amounts to over 50% and mild cases, probably taking up 40% (i.e. 80% of the cases with symptoms).", "The daily deaths caused by flu increase more slowly over time, but also go down quite slowly over time. If we use the same growth model for COVID-19 and influenza, but with different R\u2080, then we can expect a faster decrease. I have added two extremes: the normal growth model which should translate in a consistent decrease of daily cases of deaths (which we start to see in Italy and Spain) and a model with a secular growth at the tail end, due to slower spreading caused by measures and awareness. If there is some secular growth (observed in South Korea and Singapore, with about 50 to 100 cases/day), the cases will keep increasing steadily over time, while the number of active cases will stabilize or start to drop, relieving the pressure on hospitals. In the coming week we should be able to observe if this secular growth is a factor under current conditions in Europe.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
