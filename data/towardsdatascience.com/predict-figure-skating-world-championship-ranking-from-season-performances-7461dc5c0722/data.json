The main strategy is to separate the skater effect, the intrinsic ability of each skater, from the event effect, the influence of an event on a skater\u2019s performance, so that a more accurate ranking could be built.", "Specifically, in part 3 of the project, each skater is represented by multiple latent factors (see first 4 columns in the accompanying diagram). Then, in part 4, a logistic regression model is used to combine the latent scores for each skater, and rank the skaters by these combined scores (last column in the diagram). The model was evaluated using 2-fold cross validation: it is trained on 5 seasons, and evaluated on 5 other seasons.", "With the multi-factor model used to learn the latent scores of skaters, and the logistic regression model used to predict skaters\u2019 ranking, we tried to improve on those two models by:", "The latter two early stopping strategies aim to prevent the models from overfitting the season scores (for the multi-factor model) or the world championship ranking (for the logistic algorithm model), so that they could predict well on seasons that they were not trained on.", "However, a curious result was obtained when we check which stopping iterations for these two models give the greatest improvement in Kendall\u2019s tau in the validation set (compared to baseline model):", "From the above table, it can be seen that for most number of factors (except 2), the highest improvement in Kendall\u2019s tau occurs when the logistic regression runs for 0 iteration. This means using logistic regression is worse than not using it at all!", "Why does logistic regression does such a lousy job in combining the latent scores? My hypothesis is that the latent scores that learned in part 3 are no good in the first place. More specifically, they are completely arbitrary and do not truly capture the latent abilities of each skater.", "To see why, let\u2019s revisit the formula for the multi-factor model (as outlined in part 3):", "From the above formula, we see that the latent scores are learned only to approximate the season scores as well as possible, and nothing else. Therefore:", "These weaknesses of the latent-factor model can be demonstrated when plotting the latent scores of a 2-factor model for two different seasons (2005 and 2017). Moreover, for each season, the latent scores at the start of gradient descent are initialized with two different random seeds (42 and 24):", "From the above graph, it can be seen that:", "Therefore, we need to overhaul the latent-factor model to prioritize some factors over others, and to make sure that the same factor is consistent between season.", "One obvious fix for the current latent-factor model is to only update the latent scores of one factor until the RMSE has plateaued. Then, we start to update the next factor, and so on, in hopes that the RMSE will be further reduced.", "This can be done by modifying the gradient-descent algorithm of the multi-factor model so that it updates the factors one at a time. However, a much more convenient way to achieve this is:", "Given that we have already gone through the code for the gradient descent algorithm for the single-factor model in part 2, the code block below shows how can simply modify the existing code to train multiple factors in sequence.", "The major modifications are highlighted in bold, and consist of:", "Let\u2019s revisit the 2-factor example earlier for 2 different seasons, each with two different seeds. The difference is that now we train the 2 latent factors sequentially instead of simultaneously like before.", "From the result shown above, we can see that:", "These results confirm that we should learn the latent factors sequentially. However, once these factors are learned, we can use logistic regression to combine them and rank the skaters exactly as before (see part 4 for how this was done).", "To visualize more clearly how the sequential multi-factor model works, we can monitor its performance across iterations of gradient descent. Each factor is trained for 1000 iterations, and the result at each 100 iterations are shown in the familiar animated dashboard below (for male skaters in the 2017 season):", "The above dashboard clearly shows when one factor has finished training, and what\u2019s left of the season scores afterward is used to train the next factor. This is evidenced both by the distinct \u201csteps\u201d in the RMSE decline, as well as the sudden reduction in residuals in the heat map when a new factor begins training.", "To improve on the sequential multi-factor model so that it can rank skaters better \u2014 when coupled with the logistic regression model \u2014 we use the same strategies for the original multi-factor model in part 4: increasing the number of factors, and early stopping.", "Using the same 2-fold cross-validation plan, we train the sequential multi-factor model at different numbers of factors (at \u03b1=0.005 and 1000 iterations), and after that train a logistic regression model on the latent scores (also at \u03b1=0.005 and 1000 iterations). For each number of factor, we then obtain the average train and validation improvements in Kendall\u2019s tau from the baseline model.", "The result when the number of factors increase by factors of 2 (from 2 all the way to 128 factors) are shown in the above graph. From this graph, we can see that:", "Similar to part 4, we can prematurely stop gradient descent of the sequential multi-factor model, as well as gradient ascent of the logistic regression model that follows it. By preventing these algorithms to fully converge, we might not get the best training performance, but hopefully these models will be less overfit to the training data and generalize better.", "As a result, we can vary the 3 hyper-parameters of the two models:", "For each combination of these 3 hyper-parameters, we record its average train and validation improvement in Kendall\u2019s tau compared to the baseline model. These results are plotted below for:", "The result above largely mirrors that of the original multi-factor model, namely:", "This can also be seen when, for each number of factor, we note the stopping iteration for both models that give the highest improvement in Kendall\u2019s tau in the validation set compared to the baseline model:", "From the above table, we see that at 4 factors, 35 iterations per factor for the sequential multi-factor model, and 30 iterations for the logistic regression model after that, the predicted rankings have the highest average Kendall\u2019s tau in the validation set relative to the other hyper-parameter combinations. Note, however, that this is only a meager improvement of 0.009 compared to the baseline model of season averages.", "Repeating the same analysis for female skaters, we see that the interplay of the 3 model hyper-parameters are largely the same:", "However, for female skaters, the best combination of hyper-parameters is 2 factors, 65 iterations per factor for the sequential model, and 5 iterations for the logistic regression model. This leads to a slightly higher average improvement in Kendall\u2019s tau of 0.015 over the baseline model in the validation set.", "Using these fine-tuned hyper-parameters above, we can find the model coefficients and combined scores from logistic regression for male skaters in the 2017 season:", "As a result, when aggregating over all seasons, we can see that the multi-factor model offers only slight improvements to the single-factor model with early stopping that was developed in part 2:", "Even so, the multi-factor model still could not outperform the baseline model of season averages, as the 95% confidence interval of its Kendall\u2019s tau improvement (on the validation set) still encompasses the horizontal line at zero. Furthermore, since we have already used the world championship rankings of all 10 seasons to tune the model hyper-parameters, the result above is most likely too optimistic.", "Therefore, in the next and last part of the project, I will try combine all the existing models into one to see if that last ditch effort could improve on the predicted rankings. Then, I will use the remaining 4 seasons that have yet been analyzed to benchmark all the ranking models developed since the start of the project.", "As discussed at the end of part 3, finding latent scores for events and skaters is nothing but factorizing the event-skater matrix of season scores into a skater-specific matrix and event-specific matrix, which can then multiply together to approximate the original season score matrix.", "In fact, the gradient descent algorithm used to train the multi-factor model is almost identical to that of the famous FunkSVD matrix factorization used in the Netflix challenge to recommend movies to users (based on the ratings that they left on each movie). In this case, user=skater, movie=event, and rating=season score.", "However, little did I know that the original Mr Funk also trained his latent features one at a time! In fact, at the end of his blog post, the RMSE plot of his model has the same step-like shape as in my animated dashboard. I guess I should have read his post a little more closely at the start.", "Your home for data science.
