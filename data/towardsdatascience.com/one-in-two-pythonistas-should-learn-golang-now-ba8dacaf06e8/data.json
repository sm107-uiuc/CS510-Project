Married, even.", "But not those at Google, Uber, Dropbox, Soundcloud, Slack, and Medium. The programmers at top corporations have long fallen for the language with the cute mascot.", "That\u2019s not to say that Python is no good. It\u2019s great!", "But whether it\u2019s for APIs, web services, or data processing \u2014 while most developers are still using Python, top-performers are adopting Golang, or Go, more and more. Because it rocks.", "Go was invented by an all-star trio at Google: Robert Griesemer was one of the heads behind Google\u2019s V8 JavaScript machine and a main developer for Sawzall, another language invented by Google. Rob Pike co-developed the Unix environment and co-created the Limbo programming language. With Ken Thompson, the team had the inventor of Unix and the creator of the B language \u2014 the predecessor of C \u2014 on board.", "Google was originally written in Python \u2014 yes, Python is still cool \u2014 but around 2007, engineers were searching for a better language to perform typical tasks at Google. They were encountering problems like these, according to a talk by Rob Pike in 2012:", "So the trio set out to design a language that was clean, simple, and readable. A language that would eliminate, or at least ease, these all-too-common problems in software engineering.", "The root of many of these common problems is the complexity of modern languages. Think of Python or C \u2014 have you ever tried to read the whole documentation? Good luck with that.", "In contrast, the greatest feature of Go is its simplicity. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t build complicated code with it. But Go is very deliberate about not having features that bring more complexity without solving the problem.", "For example, Go doesn\u2019t have classes like other object-oriented languages. A much-used feature of other languages, classes are great to make one object inherit the properties of another object. The problem is that if you try to change the structure of one object without changing that of the others, you\u2019ll break the code. Go has an alternative, called struct, that favors composition over inheritance.", "Other key features of Go are:", "All this might sound boring and uncreative. And in a sense that\u2019s true \u2014 this is no language with funky features that you could use to impress others, plethora of ways to solve a problem, no freedom without limits. Go is no language that is there to explore, to do research with.", "But it\u2019s amazing when you\u2019re trying to build something that works. When you\u2019re on a team with lots of different people from different backgrounds working on the same code. When you\u2019re tired of all of the mess that you encounter with other languages.", "Because of its simplicity, Go is one of the most collaborative languages that exist these days. The times are over when programmers used to sit in their little cubicles and never meet others.", "Now, we have StackExchange to solve all our coding problems. And we have Slack, Zoom, Google Meet, and more to stay in touch with our team. But modern languages are still tailored to the little nerd in the cubicle.", "Go changes that. Despite being twenty years younger than Python, it has a vibrant community.", "So it comes as no surprise that they put respect, openness, and friendliness atop of their code of conduct. While other languages, like Python or C, also have comparable community statements, there is less emphasis on these basic values.", "So it\u2019s no surprise that the community plays an explicit role in the annual Go surveys \u2014 unlike in many other languages.", "According to the 2019 Go survey, Google\u2019s language is most used for web development, network and systems programming. The landscape for Python looks pretty similar:", "The only striking difference is how much Python is used for data analysis and machine learning. And on these domains, other hot new languages are emerging.", "Apart from that, you can see that many of Python\u2019s usages could be replaced by Go. That includes the 46% in web development, the 37% in system administration and DevOps, and 19% in network programming. Even if you assume that many developers do all three of these jobs, you can safely assume that half the Pythonistas are doing things that they could do in Go.", "Indeed, developers are aware of the huge potential that Go offers. According to Hackerrank, about a third of all programmers wanted to learn Go in 2019.", "The trend is real \u2014 and since Go is dead easy to learn, we should see a shift from Python to Go in the next few years. For most companies \u2014 especially those that are not as big and well-funded as Dropbox or Medium \u2014 rewriting all their code to Go will be too expensive. But for new projects, you should at least try it.", "At the biggest companies, developers are already building their success with Go. When will you?", "Your home for data science.
