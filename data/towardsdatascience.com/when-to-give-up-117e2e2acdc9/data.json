Ibaka had been a pivotal player for the Thunder for seven years but was largely on the decline, whereas Oladipo was theoretically the future for the Magic. Oladipo was selected 2nd overall in the 2013 NBA draft and was a solid player in his first year in the league, posting a 13.6 player efficiency rating, with a 51.4% true shooting percentage and a usage rate of 24.4%. Oladipo was also a monster on defense that season, creating 2.8 defensive win shares and a DRAYMOND rating of 1.71.", "In short, Oladipo was on the right track. He was producing the way you\u2019d hope your rookie lottery pick would. So why just two years later would the Magic send him packing for big man who couldn\u2019t shoot from the outside and wasn\u2019t producing at the level he was 22, 23, and 24?", "I won\u2019t presume to know the whole reason that the Magic gave up on Oladipo, but I\u2019ll guess that, as Oladipo was ready to enter his fourth season in the league, there was some belief that Oladipo was already the player he was going to be; he had shown what he was capable of and there wasn\u2019t significant improvement on the horizon. Two years and another trade later, this time to the Indiana Pacers, Oladipo had a breakout season, making the 2018 All-Star team and leading the Pacers to the playoffs.", "Of course, not every pick makes this type of jump, and the job of an NBA front office is to correctly evaluate who will make those leaps more times than not. But how do we make that determination? Is a former first round pick in his second year in the NBA more likely to make a future leap than a second round pick? How about a top 10 overall pick? Are the very highest picks more likely to make a future leap than someone picked in the mid to late first round? We all assume we know these answers, but do the data back up our beliefs?", "When a player is drafted, his pick is essentially an evaluation of his likelihood to succeed in the NBA; higher picks are deemed to have a higher likelihood of success than lower picks. This by and large is true. If you look at the distribution of PER (for players playing over 1000 minutes) broken out by draft pick; it\u2019s clear that there is a relationship between production and draft status.", "The question is, once a player has spent time in the league and has been consistent, regardless of level of performance, is there a way to predict future growth? Could we have known that Oladipo was someone who would make a massive jump in performance? The Magic recently traded for former number 1 pick Markelle Fultz. Is there a way to determine if Fultz can make a comeback? If so, how? Do the clues lie in his age, draft position, statistical performance data, the team he plays for? People assume that it\u2019s better to continue to invest in a guy who was drafted in the top 10, but perhaps okay to move on from guys drafted in the 20s or 30s. Are they correct? Let\u2019s dig into the data a little bit more.", "Above you can take a look at the distribution of WS/48 (win shares per 48 minutes) of every NBA player drafted since 2006 with a minimum of 500 minutes played. These are violin plots that express the distribution of WS/48, where the blue half of each plot shows players picked in the first round (top 30) of the draft and the orange half shows players picked in the second round (picks 31\u201360) of the draft. Each violin represents a year with the first chart showing the 2006\u20132011 draft classes and the second chart showing the 2012\u20132018 draft classes. The white points inside the violins each represents one player. If you look closely you can see there are three dashed lines within each violin. The middle line represents the median WS/48 for that particular draft class, while the upper and lower dashed lines give the bounds of the interquartile range for the data of that particular draft year. These graphs may seem unusual or intimidating at first, but if you were to flip these plots on their side they might look a bit more familiar, like a probability distribution.", "What jumps out? First, for more recent drafts the distributions of WS/48 are decreasing. This means that less experienced players are producing fewer WS. Not surprising. However, it is noteworthy that as we get farther away from 2006 and closer to 2018 the share of the distribution owned by the second round picks increases. This is something that we can dig into in the future. To look more closely check out the table below:", "In the 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018 drafts, second round picks have a 25\u201335% share of the distribution, meaning that more of them are playing, contributing and being given opportunities. Furthermore, in terms of WS/48, second round picks are performing almost as well as first rounders over the last three years. There are obviously some issues with this interpretation. The sample size is very small, and a few outliers such as Mitchell Robinson of the Knicks are having a significant impact on the data. But there are always going to be limitations when looking at any single year of draft data, so for now we\u2019ll just look at the data for what they are.", "If you take a look all the way back to 2006\u20132010, you\u2019ll notice that on average, WS/48 for second round picks is about the same as first round picks. However, there are far more first round picks in the sample, about five times as many. Perhaps second round picks are only kept if they produce, whereas first round picks are given a longer leash because of the perceived promise of a future return? Indeed, drafts from the aughts have a much lower standard deviation of WS/48 among second round picks as compared to first rounders, and as we get into the teen drafts that relationship reverses with the second round picks displaying more variance in their performance.", "But this is just the beginning. These figures give you a glimpse at how organizations might evaluate their players, who they view as assets worth giving more time to develop and who they deem not worthy of future roster spots. I am interested to find out how much factors like age, draft position and team play a role in the future success of a current NBA player. Do these factors have any predictive power relative to improvement? If so, how much?", "This is part I in a series of posts that will look deeper into the question of when NBA teams should continue to invest and when they should move on from players on their rosters. Hopefully these posts can shed light on how to better evaluate talent and make better decisions when resigning, trading, and cutting players.", "Next time we\u2019ll take a look at which teams are getting the most production from their young talent, as the chart below highlights for 2019 second year players.", "Feel free to look at the data for this blog, located on GitHub.", "Your home for data science.
