I\u2019m not here to hash out its pros and cons. I\u2019m here to disseminate a useful cheat sheet.", "My use cases for working remotely have shifted and evolved over time. In short, I\u2019ve worked remotely as an adjunct professor, as a researcher, as a data scientist, and as an independent consultant. At the very end of this article I elaborate further on my use cases.", "Sometimes working remotely is referred to ask \u201cworking from home\u201d or the jargony \u201cwfh.\u201d In my view, wfh is a misnomer. Working remote, working remotely, or working away are my preferences. Working away is my favorite. Working away is the simplest and most inclusive turn of phrase. Not everyone working remotely works from home.", "This distinction is important. I observed a subunit of a large organization implement a \u201cwork from home\u201d policy. Other subunits complained that the \u201cwork from home\u201d policy wasn\u2019t equally available to everyone. Simultaneously, another subunit at the same organization implemented a \u201cwork away\u201d policy. The two policies were substantively the same. Under pressure from senior management that felt the \u201cwork from home\u201d policy did not spin well, the \u201cwork away\u201d policy survived while the \u201cwork from home\u201d policy ended.", "On many views, working away requires more of the worker than what might be required of the same worker, working for the same organization, in an office setting. I have found that working away requires more professionalism, more communication, more dedication, more motivation, more skill, more more more.", "Working away isn\u2019t a solution that is guaranteed to improve productivity or worker satisfaction. The deepest core drivers of productivity and worker satisfaction are not the workplaces. Workplace matters, but other factors are more central. The deepest core drivers of productivity and worker satisfaction are professionalism, communication, dedication, motivation, or skill.", "That is to say, switching from an office setting to a remote setting won\u2019t improve productivity or working satisfaction without a commensurate dose of professionalism, communication, dedication, motivation, and skill.", "If you do work away, the following are strategies that have enabled me to leverage my professionalism, communication, dedication, motivation, and skill.", "I routinely set high and lofty goals. High goals keep me motivated. I write my goals down. I share my goals with family, friends, supervisor(s), and others at work. I review the goals on a regular basis. If you need help writing your goals (Pro tip: search online for \u201csmart goals\u201d).", "When I am fortunate enough to have earned the trust of others such that they share their goals with me, I check in to see how they are doing. I appreciate when others do the same for me.", "Plan the week ahead of time.", "At the beginning of every week. For me the beginning of the week is Sunday. I spend time (sometimes an hour or more) just planning my week. Planning my week involves making lists, reviewing my calendar, adjusting the calendar, deciding what I can move to the car so it is there when I need it on the go. I also pack my gym bag and plan my meals.", "This review makes sure I have sufficient travel time between commitments. This process helps me make sure I am not over committed \u2014 that I have time to work.", "Planning ahead helps me be strategic. For example, I might decide that on Tuesday morning it makes sense to work at the coworking shared office space downtown because I have two meetings with others in the neighborhood.", "Another example might be that I have one meeting only far across town on Thursday. Seeing that on Sunday helps me decide if I can move the meeting to a more convenient location. Or if I can postpone the meeting a day.", "For every minute of planning time on Sunday I figure I save 5\u201310 minutes through the week.", "Share your calendar with those you trust and those that rely or depend on you. Because you don\u2019t have a shared workspace with associates they are unable to personally see you come and go from the office. Sharing your calendar builds trust.", "Sharing your calendar also helps those that rely and depend on you find you when they need to. I let those that rely or depend on me edit my calendar directly. Save us both time to not have to coordinate a meeting time.", "Use your calendar as a journal.", "At the end of the day, or at the end of the week, I adjust my calendar so it reflects exactly what I did. If a meeting was canceled or postponed, I edit its title with a note that shows \u201cCANCELED\u201d or \u201cPOSTPONED.\u201d That way I have a record of how I was supposed to spend my time. Next to it I\u2019ll add an event that describes how I actually spent my time.", "Journaling in your calendar again builds trust and promotes transparency. When you need to document your work, the journal will help you with that.", "I\u2019m a scientist. Lab books are scientists best friends (for many scientists lab books are dreaded companions). I make lab books into my friend. A lab book is really just a notebook you write notes in.", "I use paper lab books. As of late, I use steno books. Steno books are small and easy to write in. I keep a steno book for every major project. I date the top of every page so I can look back for notes and easily cross-reference with my journaled calendar.", "Keeping a lab book helps you remember what you did, how you did it, and why. Whenever I am short on inspiration or motivation, I look back through my lab books. Without fail, looking back through my lab books is one of the best ways to refresh and update my to-do list.", "If I am ever short on ideas for next steps, the lab book will rescue me.", "If it is 3am and inspiration for work arrives I get out of bed, go to the computer, or to my notebooks and write the ideas out. I\u2019ve written pages at a time in the middle of the night. I\u2019ve written hundreds of lines of code. Conversely, I\u2019ve refactored hundreds of lines of code in the middle of the night.", "Inspiration is precious, seize it. Likewise if I\u2019m just getting back from work at 1pm and the inspiration isn\u2019t there I go for a walk, revisit my notebooks, or read a book relevant to my current projects. In other words, I don\u2019t force it.", "This spot of advice is common in articles about working away. For me, I have advice that somewhat runs counter to what many consider the greatest advantage of working away (that you can work where you like). I sacrifice the option to work anywhere I like for the option to have a dedicated workspace where I do the majority of my work.", "For me, the definitive feature (tool) that I must have at my dedicated workspace is a large whiteboard. If I had my way, every wall would be a massive whiteboard.", "The whiteboard is a place to take notes, draw diagrams, develop ideas, make lists, etc. This works for me because I am a visual learning. Putting my ideas on a whiteboard literally lets me see the ideas. I can think more clearly when I can see the ideas in an unbounded and unrestricted space.", "Thus, setting aside a dedicated workspace (with one or two definitive tools that you use the most) are helpful strategies that will improve your experience working away. For some, a dedicated workspace could be a backpack.", "Spend time working in new places.", "I recommend spending time working in new places. For me, I know I need a dedicated workspace. However, I also benefit from exploring and finding new places to work. Sometimes that will be a coffee shop. Other times it\u2019ll be a co-workspace. Some co-workspaces are free to use (some conditions apply).", "Clean the dedicated workspace frequently. Make sure that papers are filed away (or scanned and in the cloud). Keep the surface of that workspace visible. If there are piles of paper, books, or other items \u2014 put them away. I find it easier to start working when the workspace is tidy and uncluttered.", "Share your mobile phone with everyone.", "Just as I make my calendar open to those I trust and to those that rely or depend on me, I share my mobile phone with almost everyone. When I teach, I put it on my syllabus. Hardly anyone ever calls me anymore. But, having my mobile number can help others feel connected.", "Make yourself available to others by video.", "As the use of telephone has diminished, the availability and use of video chat services have inspired a renaissance in long-distance communication. I use a tablet, old phone, or spare laptop to keep an open video line that trusted associates can dial into whenever the like. It is as if they can virtually just stop by my desk.", "I extensively and liberally use autoresponders on my email. This helps others know where I am and what I am up to. For example, maybe the day is about to wrap up and it is around 7pm. I\u2019ll put an autoresponder on an email that explains:", "\u201cHi, thanks for the email. I left my workspace at 7pm today. I\u2019ll keep an eye on email while I\u2019m away. If you need me right away call my mobile (608\u2013555\u20135555). Otherwise, I\u2019ll respond soon after returning to my workspace tomorrow at 6am.\u201d", "To avoid working all of the time\u2026 there\u2019ll always be work. When your dedicated workspace is steps away it is often so easy to tell yourself \u201cI\u2019ll do one more quick email.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019ll just let myself do two more items on this list.\u201d", "To make sure I take breaks I leave the house for lunch. Use the gym at lunch. Do a walk around the block mid-afternoon.", "I\u2019ve worked away in multiple roles. This means I\u2019ve had multiple use cases.", "Teaching is one of my more frequent use cases. For multiple semseters, I\u2019ve taught college students. Sometimes those classes were classroom-based, others they were online. While teaching I worked away instead of at the office provided for me by the institution. While my dedicated workspace was at home, my escape from home would often be the library.", "I also worked away in a role that involved conducting research and outreach. About half of my job involved crunching data. The other half of my job was planning and delivering presentations or conducting training. For this dual/split use case, my employer provided an office, but I worked primarily away from the office (at the library, home, coffee shops, in conference hotels, etc.).", "In graduate school I founded and operated a boutique consulting firm (now closed). In these use cases, I used most of all the above strategies.", "These strategies have been useful for me, I hope others will also find them useful.", "Send me your thoughts and ideas. You can write just to say hey. And if you really need to tell me how I got it wrong I look forward to chatting soon.
