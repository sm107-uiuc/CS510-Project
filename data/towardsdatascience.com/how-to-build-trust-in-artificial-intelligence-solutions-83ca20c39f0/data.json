She is also a corporate researcher at scip AG, a technology and cybersecurity company based in Zurich. And she is the Women in AI Ambassador for Switzerland.", "Please describe who you are in 2\u20133 sentences.", "Currently, I am focusing on trust in AI, Autonomous Weapons Systems, and our AIQ project, which is a psychometric method to measure the skills of digital assistants (conversational AI), like Siri or Alexa.", "So, obviously, I\u2019m a researcher, but I\u2019m also a mother of two toddlers, a wife, a daughter, a sister, a volleyball player, hopefully, a fun friend to be with, an activist, an idealist, a collaborator, and a semi-professional Sherpa (I love hiking in the Swiss Alps and therefore have to carry my kids on my back!).", "Let us start with understanding trust better. What is trust and why is it important, especially in the context of AI?", "In the context of AI, there is a critical underlying assumption: \u201cNo trust, No Use\u201d. Since AI holds great promises (as well as dangers), tech-companies and AI enthusiasts are especially concerned about how to build trust in AI to foster adoption or usage.", "Trust seems like the lasting, kind of mysterious, competitive edge.", "Without trust, there would be no family, no houses, no markets, no religion, no politics, no rocket science.", "According to trust researcher Rachel Botsman,", "Trust is the social glue that enables humankind to progress through interaction with each other and the environment, including technology.", "Trust can be seen as a psychological mechanism to cope with uncertainty and is located somewhere between the known and the unknown.", "Trust is deeply ingrained in our personality. We are basically born with a tendency to trust or distrust people (or animals or any other things).", "Take for example this random picture of a woman: Do you trust her? Please rate below.", "We, humans, have the unique capacity to tell in a snapshot if we trust this person or not. We look at the facial expression, body posture, or the context (background, surroundings, etc.). We compare it with memories or past experiences in split seconds, such as \u201cshe reminds me of my grandmother.\u201d", "Generally speaking, what we know is that we tend to trust people more, who are more like ourselves. One reason is, that it is easier for us to predict future behavior or reactions of persons who are alike, which lowers the emotional risk for us of being hurt.", "What we do not know is, how accurate our intuition is. Did you trust this woman above? Maybe yes, because she is smiling, relaxed. Maybe no, because you are already expecting some kind of trick here, as I am a psychologist.", "This woman is not very trustworthy. She died several years ago in prison as one of the most famous female serial killers.", "In the context of AI, if you ask the question can we trust in AI as a technology, then compared to other technologies, it is decisive to understand that often AI (for example Machine Learning, let\u2019s say image classification), does not behave exactly the way it is intended, makes mistakes, or performs unethically. For example, when black people are classified as gorillas or birds as missiles.", "So far, research has agreed upon three main pillars that need to be answered to build trust,", "1.) Performance: Does it perform well? Is it safe? Is it built correctly?", "2.) Process: Does it perform the way we intended? Can we predict the outcome?", "3.) Purpose: Do I have a good feeling about the intent of the program and the provider? Does it adhere to ethical standards? Is it trustworthy?", "It is often said, that AI positively transforms almost every sector from medicine to urban planning, but very importantly, it also brings questionable or even dangerous implications with it. From super-precise hacking of data platforms to the surveillance state and loss of privacy without opportunities for public consent. So next to technical issues like a lack of predictability and explainability, the notion of negative outcomes, hype, complexity, and disagreement within definitions and applications, leads to skepticism and distrust.", "How should non-experts and business owners, etc. approach this topic?", "AI is already part of our daily lives, it is already increasingly being used in decision-making when it comes to education, police, justice, recruitment, or health.", "I do not have a tech-background as well, I am a psychologist so I see things from a different perspective, and it may be easier for me to feel empathy with the majority of people, who have no idea how to code or what an algorithm is.", "What fascinates me most and drives my research, is the question, how trust is established in the first place. You don\u2019t really know the person or the product, its values or competencies. This first little glimpse of saying \u201cyes, I\u2019ll go for it\u201d.", "It is still a little mysterious, how this trust develops in the first place.", "How can we best cope with it? I think it is all about education, communication, and critical thinking. But there is something restricting these skills or our will to engage in discussions about AI.", "From a psychological perspective, this is one of the big problems: we are lacking cognitive freedom of choice. What concerns me, is that we are moving towards a do-or-die relationship with AI. It will be almost impossible to get away from AI, as much as we cannot get away from climate change.", "The fact that we are forced or threatened, like the threatening terminator images or the constant man losing against machine news, leads to resistance, denial, cynicism, and downplay. This is called reactance, a psychological phenomenon. When reactance occurs \u2014 we choose these behaviors \u2014 even if they are totally irrational \u2014 to simply restore our cognitive freedom of choice and take back our sense of control.", "This can be a big challenge, especially in consumer psychology when you aim to convince customers to buy your products, whether it\u2019s a car or a robotic vacuum cleaner.", "That is why management often applies bottom-up approaches within their company, rather than top-down decisions.", "Through this participative way of decision making, you aim to have all people aboard and share your vision and goals.", "Right now, one of the key issues is to change the way we talk about AI. I think we massively have to change the tone of the conversation about AI. We must move away from the hype, threat, and fear towards clear facts, vision, and why to create our own relationship with AI, and thus a new level of trust.", "This is also my vision as the ambassador for the Women in AI network, a nonprofit working towards a gender-inclusive AI that benefits global society.", "Imagine a company is building a Machine Learning based product and just started prototyping. What steps would you suggest from a trust-building perspective?", "What I learned from a philosopher is to always ask why, from the beginning to the very end, and continuously at all milestones of the project.", "What are the intended consequences and speculate about all possible unintended consequences?", "From the design perspective, it is all about aligning your design to at least minimal ethical standards, to make sure you are building a trustworthy product. However, keeping in mind that technical performance (quality), security and safety, are all indispensable prerequisites.", "Going back to the beginning it is having the three pillars process, performance, purpose constantly in mind. Ethics in AI is all about integrity and authenticity.", "In the end, the task is to build a great, safe, and ethically correct product. The focus naturally is at building a good product first, then comes security and this ethical stuff.", "It is natural to focus on the technical requirements first, whilst counterintuitively, the latter should rather be looked at first. Two years ago, when we started our trust research, our idea was to have like a proof of quality to signal users or customers, that this is a trustworthy product. That is why we invented the AIQ, a psychometric measurement method to state, compare, and track the skills of digital assistants. However, we were a bit too fast as the market is still in a development phase rather than actually improving existing conversational AI. We too, focused on the technical skillsets at first, rather than the actual decisive soft factors of how trust is built and developed.", "Here is a podcast episode that talks about the topic in more detail.", "Now we are stepping back and focus on the less obvious factors that influence trust-building in the context of AI. These are the fine influencing factors on a micro level of perception, from personality traits to bias, to past experiences, to socialization and upbringing. We are just gathering data to explore these antecedents of trust in AI through associations, qualitative and quantitative methods.", "Is it possible to change the image of AI or influence consumer behavior after product launch?", "If you want to explore your trust image, you need to look at questions and definitions from various perspectives: you may want to look at the individual person (like characteristics of your target group or employees), you can look at the process from building, maintaining, and developing trust from a consumer perspective, as well as destroying and regaining trust. You have to be clear of the actors and roles (who is to be trusted?) and the situation: is it a high-risk situation like for example self-driving cars, or are we talking about an AI-driven chatbot in customer service?", "In the end, the answer is yes, however, in both directions, for better or worse. We have to be very sensitive, neutral, or as Hans Roslin says \u201cfactful\u201d, when we talk about AI. Research is pretty clear on what to do to sustain a relationship or how to act, if you have broken a trust relationship, I am not sure if AI is then any different than other technologies. A breach is a breach, whether it is Facebook\u2019s data breach or a misguided missile.", "If there was a trust breach you must communicate instantly, directly, clearly what happened, explain yourself without being defensive, be authentic, truthful, and ask for what is needed to get another chance.", "What books and other resources would you recommend for a business owner or product manager to learn about trust-building in AI?", "I would suggest checking the European High-Level Expert Group on AI. They just released a framework for building trustworthy AI. The framework has three main pieces comprising lawful AI, Ethical AI, and Robust AI. The key points of the two latter are discussed in the report.", "Another great set of comprehensive, crowd-sourced standards comes from the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems, which is called Ethically Aligned Design.", "Rachel Botsman: Who can you trust? She writes about how trust is built, lost, and restored in the digital age, she also has several highly recommended TED Talks.", "This interview was done with Michael Burkhardt from Omdena \u2014 an innovation platform where AI engineers and domain experts collaborate to build solutions to real-world problems.", "Your home for data science.
