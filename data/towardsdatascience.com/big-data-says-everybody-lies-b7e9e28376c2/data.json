Why Big Data Matters and Why You Should\u2026 | by Costas Andreou | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Big Data Says Everybody Lies", "description": "Throughout our daily lives and away from high tech, the vast majority of people make decisions and dish out advice based on their gut.

Over their lives, they have assimilated a humongous amount of data that is safely kept in their brain, allowing them to draw conclusions to problems.", "Take, for example, basketball. You might have heard that a growing up poor assists in making you an excellent NBA star. There is a lot of success stories to prove that see LeBron James, so it must be true. But the stories you hear about are only the success ones (survivorship bias); you don\u2019t hear the rest.", "\u201cThe next Freud will be a data scientist. The next Marx will be a data scientist. The next Salk might very well be a data scientist.\u201d", "This is why Big Data is hugely beneficial and can help get to the bottom of answering interesting questions. Big data can take data from across the country and see whether or not growing up poor or middle class has any impact on your NBA dream. It turns out it does. You are a lot more likely to get into the NBA if you are NOT growing up poor.", "Unless you have been hiding under a rock for the past decade, you would have certainly heard about Big Data. It is a topic that has grown immensely in popularity. It is so prevalent that a book about Big Data has made the New York Best Seller list!", "The book in question is called \u201cEverybody Lies: What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are\u201d by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz.", "Well, I read the book, all 300 or so pages, and I found it fascinating. To save you having to read it too, I have attempted to distill the book\u2019s message in this blog. I hope you find it interesting.", "In general, the book paints a picture of what Big Data is and how it can be used to identify certain previously unknown truths. It exemplifies how useful it can be, how it can be misconstrued either wilfully or unknowingly if you don\u2019t pay the due attention.", "Throughout the book, Seth gives examples of big data and the truths it unveils while giving you exciting anecdotes to follow, much like Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt\u2019s Freakonomics (another bestseller).", "\u201cData science takes a natural and intuitive human process \u2014 spotting patterns and making sense of them \u2014 and injects it with steroids\u201d", "In more specificity, the book explores many data sets, including data from Google Trends and PornHub. In doing so, it calls attention to topics such as politics (elections, speeches, and effects to racism, etc.), hunting for an edge in finance or horse racing, and human sexuality.", "Without focusing too much on the specifics and ruining the book for you should you decide to read it, here are the key takeaways!", "The Big Data revolution is less about collecting more and more data. It is about collecting the right data.", "Since the beginning of the millennium, we have seen a dramatic expansion in data generation and availability. It doesn\u2019t matter what sort of data you\u2019re after; it most likely exists!", "It is thought that within the next five years, we will be generating around 500 exabytes of data each day! To put that into scale, 1 exabyte equals 1,000,000 terabytes.", "People are doing all sorts of crazy experiments, shifting through extraordinary amounts of data to find something that will provide them with an edge in their industry or line of work.", "Time and time again, it has been observed that people tend to lie when they think they are being watched. According to Seth, lying is widespread.", "\u201cEverything is data! And with all this new data, we can finally see through people\u2019s lies.\u201d", "People lie to their friends, to social media, to surveys. On some level, they may also lie to themselves. It is only when you zoom in on people\u2019s actions and focus on their real questions when they think nobody is watching (See google searches) that you can start to see the truth from the lies.", "Netflix learned a similar lesson early on in its life cycle: don\u2019t trust what people tell you; trust what they do.", "Using data from public surveys, one can quickly build a picture of how much safe sex Americans are having. However, comparing that data to condom sales, it appears that there is a considerable gap. Bringing in another dimension to this search by looking into Google Trends data, one can discern a large number of searches for \u201csexless marriages/relationships.\u201d", "The same logic can be applied in reviewing the Trump election. While America was celebrating its post-racial era success, Trump was voted in office. Once again, Seth\u2019s Google Trends analysis sheds light on some very worrying-some results.", "There have always been large data sets available that researchers and institutions had been collecting. Having large data sets is nothing new. The idea behind Big Data is the depth and breadth of this data. You can collect data on an unprecedented level and detail. People will actually hand it over for free!", "\u201cBig Data allows us to meaningfully zoom in on small segments of a dataset to gain new insights on who we are.\u201d", "With the new levels of data available, data scientists can zoom in and out in terms of the micro and macro level to understand more and more. They can start from a country-level analysis and then move down to states, cities, towns, villages, even neighborhoods.", "Given that everybody lies, one has to wonder what the value of surveys is. Firms have forever been using focus groups to determine what people like or dislike about a product, but have been more selective about using A/B testing as it tended to be more expensive.", "A/B testing is the process of applying randomized experiments to understand the impact a change of a variable will have. As you can imagine, with infinite amounts of variables and variable values, firms would need to allocate a considerable amount of resources to this process.", "In the era of the internet and software, however, the game changes completely. Firms can push different content, modified only slightly between different groups of the population, and observe how they interact with it. This could include the color of some text, the phrasing, the font, the positioning; it could be anything.", "\u201cIn 2011, Google engineers ran seven thousand A/B tests. And this number is only rising.\u201d", "This process is used by politicians, software companies, and pretty much anyone who aims to gain an advantage over you. They don\u2019t care why your subconscious likes that phrasing or why your brain lights up and interacts with it when you see it \u2014 only that you do.", "\u201cIn 2009, one frustrated designer quit after Google went through forty-one marginally different shades of blue in A/B testing. But this designer\u2019s stand in favor of art over obsessive market research has done little to stop the spread of the methodology.\u201d", "As with anything, when working with big data and statistics, there are a few pitfalls to be aware of. There are some common errors that you can succumb to, so it is worth double-checking your results.", "It also goes without saying that you should undoubtedly double-check other people\u2019s claims of specific results.", "Repeat an experiment with random variables enough times, and sure enough, you\u2019ll find some correlation. Just because you\u2019ve found a relationship, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s there, however.", "In other words, with a higher level of data dimensions, you require an even more significant number of observations to support your analysis. That\u2019s right; Your big data might not be big enough!", "Simply because you were able to find some relationship between two variables in your data set, it doesn\u2019t mean that one causes the other. Take, for instance, that your research led you to the fact that \u201cAll humans who drink water die.\u201d It\u2019s a factually correct statement, but if you were to say that death is caused by drinking water, you\u2019d be making a mistake.", "This phenomenon is known as \u2018reverse causation,\u2019 and it is essential to note that not correlation implies causation.", "Big Data is so powerful that it could be applied to all sorts of different aspects of life. This raises the question of the morality of using such a practice.", "Take, for instance, that a particular action is a statistically significant predictor of what you\u2019ll do next. Should measures be put in place by corporations or the government anticipating that? What about the percentage of people who would be doing the first action but not the predicted second one?", "Or consider the implications of answering certain types of questions, which should potentially be left unanswered.", "All in all, I found the book quite interesting. There are a lot of good points and a way of thinking which can be gained from this book. In conclusion, the author says he hopes this book is on par with Freakonomics or surpasses it. I would say that it was a good attempt, but not quite at the same level.", "If you liked this book overview, maybe you\u2019d also like my review for \u201cWhy We Sleep\u201d:", "Your home for data science.
