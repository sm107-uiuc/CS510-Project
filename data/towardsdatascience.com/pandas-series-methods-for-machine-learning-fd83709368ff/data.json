That in itself is a very vast topic to cover in an article. For that, I would recommend you to read a book or Pandas documentation. But, I can tell you this much that this article will lift you off the ground in the journey of learning Machine Learning.", "In this post, we are going to talk about some of the methods offered in Pandas.series, what to keep in mind while using them and how to use them efficiently. A Series object has many attributes and methods that are useful for Data Analysis. In general, the methods return a new Series object but most of the methods returning a new instance also have an inplace or copy parameter. This is because the default behaviour in Pandas tends towards immutability and these optional parameters default to False and True respectively. We will use the following example Series in this post.", "\u2192 Iteration over a Series iterates over the values:", "\u2192 There is an .iteritems method to loop over the index, value pairs:", "\u2192 A .keys method is provided as a shortcut to the index as well:", "\u2192 Unlike the .keys method of a Python dictionary, the result is ordered.", "The list below contains overloaded operations for a Series object. The operations behave in a special way for pandas objects that might be different than other Python objects respond to these operations:", "The common arithmetic operations for a series are overloaded to work with both scalars and other series objects. Addition with a scalar (assuming numeric values in the series) simply adds the scalar value to the values of the series. Adding a scalar to a series is called broadcasting:", "Note: Broadcasting is a NumPy and pandas feature. A normal Python list supports some of the operations listed in the prior table, but not in the element wise manner that NumPy and pandas objects do. When you multiply a Python list by two, the result is a new list with the elements repeated, not each element multiplied by two:", "\u2192 When you are adding two Series objects, only those items will add whose index occurs in both the Series otherwise NaN will be inserted for indexes found only in one of the Series.", "Here, \u201cRingo\u201d appears in both but have a value of NaN in songs_66, so the result will also be NaN.", "\u2192 The above case can be a bit problematic, should the count of \u201cRingo songs\u201d be unknown. To solve this issue, we can use .fillna() method to replace NaN with 0 and get a proper and better answer.", "The other arithmetic operations behave similarly for -, *, and /.", "The series object allows for access to values by index operations (with .loc and .iloc) and convenience methods. The methods for getting and setting values are as follows:", "Now, lets see these methods in action:", "Note: Valid attribute names are names that begin with letters, and contain alphanumerics or underscores. If an index name contains spaces, you couldn\u2019t use dotted attribute access to read it, but index access would work fine.", "The .get_value() method raises an Exception if the index value is not found.", "Note: If you have non-unique indexes and only want to update one of the values for a repeated index, this cannot be done via .set_value. In such a case update should be performed using the position that is using .iloc.", "Depending on the context of the problem, it can be useful to change the values of the index. We will have a look at few of the methods to reset the index, change which index labels are present, and rename the labels of the index. The first, .reset_index, will reset the index to monotonically increasing integers starting from zero. By default, the .reset_index method will return a new data frame (not a series). It moves the current index values to a column named index.", "\u2192 In order to get a Series output, pass True to the drop parameter, which will drop the index column.", "\u2192 If a specific index order is desired, it may be passed to the .reindex method. New index values will have a value of the optional parameter fill_value (which defaults to NaN).", "\u2192 Alternatively, the values of the index can be updated with the .rename method. This method accepts either a dictionary mapping index labels to new labels, or a function that accepts a label and returns a new one.", "Here we will talk about how to get the overview of the data found in a Series. For this particular section we will use the following two series.", "\u2192 .count() provides the counts of the entries, how many are unique and how many are duplicated. This method returns the number of non-null items. In scores_2 series, there are 5 entries but .count() only returns 4.", "\u2192 Histogram tables are easy to generate in pandas. If you think of a series as an ordered mapping of index keys to values, .value_counts returns a mapping of those values to their counts, ordered by frequency:", "\u2192 To get the unique values or the count of non-NaN items use the .unique and .nunique methods respectively. Note that .unique includes the nan value, but .nunique does not count it.", "\u2192 To drop duplicate values use the .drop_duplicates method. Since Billy has the same score as Paul, he will get dropped.", "\u2192 To retrieve a series with boolean values indicating whether its value was repeated, use the .duplicated method.", "\u2192 To drop duplicate index entries requires a little more effort. Let\u2019s create a series, scores_3, that has 'Paul' in the index twice. If we use the .groupby method, and group by the index, we can then take the first or last item from the values for each index label.", "\u2192 There are many basic statistical measures in a series object\u2019s methods. One of the most basic is sum of values in a series:", "\u2192 Most of the methods that perform a calculation ignore NaN. Some also provide an optional parameter \u2014 skipna \u2014 to change that behavior. But in practice if you do not ignore NaN, the result is nan.", "\u2192 Calculating the mean, median and quantile of a Series.", "\u2192 To get a good overall feel for the series, the .describe method presents a good number of summary statistics and returns the result as a series. It includes the count of values, their mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, and the 25%, 50%, and 75% quantiles. You can pass in specific percentiles if you so desire with the percentiles parameter.", "\u2192 The series also has methods to find the minimum and maximum for the values, .min and .max. There are methods to get the index location of the minimum and maximum index labels, .idxmin and .idxmax.", "\u2192 Variance as a spread measure can be found using .var and standard deviation using .std. For dispersion, mean absolute deviation can be found using .mad.", "The series object has the ability to tweak its values. The numerical values in a series can be rounded up by .round method. The .astype method attempts to convert values to the type passed in. But, if a method is invoked on the converted string values, the result might not be the desired output. In this case .max now returns the lexicographic maximum.", "By default, the to_* functions will raise an error if they cannot coerce. In the case below, the to_numeric function cannot convert nan to a float.", "The NaN value is usually disregarded in calculations. Sometimes, it is useful to fill them in with another value. The .fillna method will replace them with a given value, -1 in this case. NaN values can be dropped from the series using .dropna.", "Another way to get the non-NaN values is use to a boolean mask. The .notnull method gives us the boolean mask. To get a mask for NaN values we can use .isnull method.", "Note: We can flip a boolean mask by applying the not operator (~).", "Computing the dot product is available through the .dot method. But, this method fails if NaN is part of the series. Removing NaN will give a value for .dot. A series also has a .transpose (or .T) method.", "To concatenate two series together, simply use the .append method. This takes another series as a parameter. This method creates duplicate indexes by default. But, an optional parameter verify_integrity when set to True will complain if index values are duplicated.", "To perform element-wise operations on series, use the .combine method. It takes another series, and a function as its\u2019 parameters.", "To update values from one series, use the .update method.", "The .repeat method simply repeats every item a desired amount.", "\u2192 .sort_values \u2014 This method returns a new Series sorted on the values. This method also supports the ascending parameter that flips the order of the sort.", "\u2192 A similar method .sort_index can be used to sort the indexes of the Series. It also offers the similar ascending parameter.", "\u2192 Another useful sorting related method is .rank. This method ranks the index by the values of the entries. It assigns equal weights for ties. It also supports the ascending parameter to reverse the order.", "To alter, clean, check or to apply an arbitrary function to a Series, we can use .map that takes a function/dictionary/series as a parameter and apply that to each element of the Series just like Python.", "Note: There is also an .apply method on the series object. It behaves very similar to .map, but it only works with functions (not with series nor dictionaries).", "A series that has string data can be manipulated by vectorized string operations. To invoke the string operations, simply invoke them on the .str attribute of the series.", "The following vectorized string methods are available and should be familiar to anyone with experience with the methods of native Python strings.", "I am giving away a free eBook on Consistency.
