Being curious on how they make the judgement, I take a look of the World Bank\u2019s official website here.", "Basically, the World Bank classifies the world\u2019s economies into four income groups \u2014 high, upper-middle, lower-middle and low by considering Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (current US$).", "Undoubtedly, the indicator is a great one representing the average income level of residents essentially living in the economy territory, which in turn captures the overall economic development level of the country. Nonetheless, I believe the picture should be more than that since countries within the same income group may still vary a lot in different aspects.", "Therefore, based on a group of interesting indicators selected from the World Bank database, I first try to apply factor analysis to see what dimension these indicators could represent, followed by cluster analysis to re-classify the economies. Hopefully, this article would help us understand the world in a better way. For the codes of this article, you can refer to the Github link here.", "First of all, 29 indicators in different aspects are selected for this work. To prevent some potential bias caused by numerical indicators with significant scale difference, such as Gross Domestic Products (GDP) or Population size, I have mainly chosen ratio or growth indicators, with some non-traditional ones included, such as diabetes prevalence and mobile cellular subscriptions.", "From the above list, you may notice that the year for indicators are not the same due to data availability. And I believe this is one of the major reasons why the World bank uses single indicator (GNI per capita) for economies classification.", "The best we can do is to pick the indicators with a reasonable amount of countries provided the data (> 140 economies), and then choose the most recent year. After filtering, there are totally 159 countries included in this exercise.", "Now, let\u2019s take a look of the relationships between the indicators by plotting a correlation matrix using the following codes.", "From the correlation matrix, we can observe some interesting but reasonable relationships. For example,", "(a) Positive relationship between access to electricity (% of population) and percentage of people using at least basic drinking water services \u2014 Electricity and drinking water are basic services in the society. Both should be developed simultaneously in similar stage, and hence have similar level of accessibility within a country.", "(b) Positive relationship between vulnerable employment (% of total employment) and employment in agriculture (% of total employment) \u2014 Compared to employment in industrial and services sector, employment in agriculture should be more vulnerable.", "(c) Negative relationship between rural population (% of population) and individuals using the Internet (% of population) \u2014 Higher proportion of rural population in total, less developed the economy may be. So the proportion of rural population is negatively correlated with the percentage of individuals with access to the Internet, which represents the technological development of an economy.", "In fact, there are many other interesting relationships among the variables. In order to understand the whole picture in a faster and better way, we can apply factor analysis to reduce the 29 indicators into fewer numbers of factors.", "But how many factors should be reduced to ? We can get an idea by plotting a scree plot with number of factors in the x-axis, and the eigenvalue in the y-axis. Generally, if a factor\u2019s eigenvalue is greater than or close to one, we would include that. The scree plot below shows that there could be 7 factors.", "For the concepts behind factor analysis, this article gives a good explanation.", "The selection of 7 factors has explained 71% of total variance of the 29 indicators. The higher the percentage, the better the model is.", "Next, we take a look of the heatmap of factor loading, which is basically the correlation coefficient for the variable and factor. It shows the variance explained by the variable on that particular factor.", "Let\u2019s investigate in-depth of the 7 factors\u2019 meaning, and see which variables have high correlation with each factor. Please note that the below interpretation is subjective.", "Factor 0 \u2014 Access to essential services in society (Access to electricity for rural / urban population, individuals using the Internet and people using at least basic drinking water services, mobile cellular subscriptions)", "Factor 1 \u2014 Youth employment situation (Employment to population ratios, ages 15\u201324, labor force participation ratio for ages 15\u201324, female / male)", "Factor 2 \u2014 Overall economic growth (GDP growth rate and GDP per capita growth rate)", "Factor 3 \u2014 Industrial development (Value added of industry (including construction) and CO2 emissions)", "Factor 4 \u2014 Health situation (Diabetes prevalence and PM2.5 air pollution) Many studies have solidified the link between particulates from cars and diabetes. If you are interested, this article is a good one.", "Factor 5 \u2014 Capability in manufacturing & trade of manufactured goods (Employment in industry, merchandise trade and value added of manufacturing)", "Factor 6 \u2014 Professional services development (Trade in services, value added of services and secure internet servers)", "Now, we know that the 7 factors are representing seven completely different aspects of an economy. However, a few indicators have very low correlation with all 7 factors, i.e. birth rate, death rate and infant mortality rate. Such low correlation may make sense as these indicators are more like the end-products of many elements in the economy. Thus, it is difficult to group them into any factors mentioned above.", "Next, we will apply cluster analysis to classify the economies. In the followings, we would apply one of the most commonly used method \u2014 hierarchical clustering, with bottom up approach, Euclidean distance and Ward\u2019s method to calculate the similarity. For detailed explanation of hierarchical clustering, this article gives a very good lesson.", "Each indicator has its own scale. For example, the proportion of rural population in total is always higher than GDP growth rate. To prevent such scale difference leading to unparalleled weights and unreliable conclusion, we have to first standardize the data.", "After standardizing the data, we can perform clustering using a library called AgglomerativeClustering.", "And to visualize the clustering result, Dendrogram, a tree-like diagram that records the sequences of merges or splits, is applied. However, please note that the number of cluster finally formed is completely based on your judgement. If there are too many clusters, the classification may be too detailed. If too few, the economies may not be well classified.", "From the dendrogram plot, there could be 12 clusters. And based on this choice, we next apply the function AgglomerativeClustering on the datasets, by setting n_clusters as 12, affinity as euclidean distance, and linkage as Ward\u2019s method.", "The clustering result is shown in the form of a country list in the followings.", "After grouping the 159 countries into 12 clusters, the most important is to understand the characteristics of each cluster, and investigate why the countries are grouped together. So let\u2019s take a look of the heatmap below. I have extracted the 20 variables having high correlation with the 7 factors, and sorted by factor groups, i.e. first five rows represent Factor 0 \u2014 Access to essential services in society.", "Based on the clusters\u2019 characteristics, I try to further group the 12 clusters into 4 big categories (Most developed, more developed, less developed and least developed economies). However, even within the big group, clusters\u2019 characteristics still vary a bit. Please refer to the detailed descriptions below.", "Common characteristics: Excellent accessibility to essential services in society, good industrial development and relatively good health situation", "Cluster 0 (United States, United Kingdom and Japan) \u2014 high youth labor force participation level but slow economic growth", "Cluster 2 (France, Italy and Spain) \u2014 Great capability in trading manufactured goods but low youth labor force participation level", "Cluster 7 (Ireland and Luxembourg) \u2014 very fast economic growth and excellent professional services development but relatively weak capability in manufacturing", "Common characteristics: Good accessibility to essential services but relatively lower level in both youth labor force participation and professional services development", "Cluster 1 (Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay) \u2014 Poor industrial development and weak capability in manufacturing and trade of manufactured goods", "Cluster 5 (Qatar and Saudi Arabia) \u2014 Excellent industrial development but very poor health situation", "Cluster 8 (China, Korea and South Africa) \u2014 Good industrial development and manufacturing capability with moderate economic growth", "Common characteristics: Moderate capability in manufacturing and trade of manufactured goods but low level in professional services development and poor accessibility to essential services in society", "Cluster 6 (India, Egypt and Bangladesh) \u2014 great industrial development but very low level in youth labor force participation and poor health situation", "Cluster 9 (Vietnam and Cambodia) \u2014 very high level in youth labor force participation and very fast economic growth", "Cluster 11 (Mexico, Indonesia and Philippines) \u2014 average industrial development and economic growth", "Common characteristics: Moderate economic growth but very poor industrial development and accessibility to essential services in society", "Cluster 3 (Afghanistan, Pakistan and Cameroon) \u2014 very weak capability in manufacturing and trade of manufactured goods and relatively poorer health situation", "Cluster 4 (Zimbabwe and Uganda) \u2014 very high youth labor force participation level but poor professional services development and very weak capability in manufacturing and trade of manufactured goods", "Cluster 10 (Djibouti and Namibia) \u2014 Above average capability in manufacturing and trade of manufactured goods but low youth labor force participation level", "To summarize, please refer to the below heatmap. The number inside the box is the cluster\u2019s ranking among all in that aspect (factor). The smaller the number, the better performance of the cluster in that aspect.", "Last but not least, it would be interesting to compare our classification (Most developed, more developed, less developed and least developed) with the World Bank\u2019s (high, upper-middle, lower-middle and low income).", "Based on the comparison table, 55% of the countries are classified into same group under the two classification methods. Surprisingly, a matching probability of 70% and 94% is attained for high income and low income group respectively. In contrast, the matching probability is relatively low (<40%) for the two middle income groups.", "The above result has indicated that the Gross National Income (GNI) per capita may have only shown half of the picture. There are many other stories beyond that, especially for the middle income group / developing economies. The economic models and social situation for these countries could differentiate a lot even they may have similar level of GNI per capita.", "This article has made use of two popular statistical methods \u2014 Factor analysis and Cluster analysis to help us understand the economies from different dimensions and classify the countries. I hope this would raise your interests to analyze the world\u2019s economies in more dimensions and have a deeper thought beyond the official classification.", "Thank you very much, and see you next time.", "If you are interested to know about application of cluster analysis on stock selection, you may take a look of another article below.
