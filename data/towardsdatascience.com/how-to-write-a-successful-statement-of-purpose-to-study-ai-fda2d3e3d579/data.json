Graduating from the first cohort of a brand new Bachelor\u2019s program in France, having little research or industry experience, and no publications, I was more determined than ever to produce a statement of purpose (SoP) that will help me stand out from the pool of brilliant applicants.", "Few months later, I was delighted to receive admission from all my top choices! Though at first, I had no idea what an SoP was, I must have done something right to have convinced people from all these prestigious universities. To give back to the community, I thought I\u2019d share a few tips I learned or found useful during my SoP writing :)", "For those interested, I\u2019ll also include my stats during the time of application, programs I was accepted to, programs I was rejected from, and which program I chose at the end of this post.", "Disclaimer: I am just a recent graduate who likes machine learning and blogging and blogging about machine learning, I am by no means qualified to teach how to write essays. The following tips merely reflect my personal experience applying to US Master\u2019s degrees in CS and may not always be generalizable.", "Yes, I am well aware of a student\u2019s superhuman productivity in producing pages of an essay they left to do last-minute. But trust me, I strongly encourage you to start thinking about your SoP well before your application deadlines.", "Here is what my timeline looked like:", "Start September \u2014 I googled \u201chow to write statement of purpose\u201d and created my SoP.docx file", "Start October \u2014 I had my first draft ready to ask others to proofread", "Start November \u2014 I revised my first draft to ask others to proofread a second time", "End November \u2014 I had a \u201cgeneral\u201d SoP ready, which I still had to \u201cfine-tune\u201d for each program I was considering", "December-January \u2014 For each program, I finalized each SoP before submitting my application", "February 3 \u2014 I received my first response: accepted to my dream program!", "For me, it took 3 months of planning and writing my SoP. Some might need more time or less. My point is, it\u2019s not an essay that can or should be rushed, it\u2019s good to give yourself time to think about what you want to say, get feedback from others, and re-write it several times.", "If you feel lost on how to get started, my advice is to create that document anyways and jot down any ideas you have, even the silly ones. From there, you\u2019ll be able to start stringing these ideas into a flow of text, or come up with new ideas when you didn\u2019t expect it.", "Unlike the personal statement for my undergraduate application, most graduate schools do not give clear prompts or questions you need to answer. A common mistake is thinking the graduate SoP is like a \u201cpersonal statement with more experience\u201d.", "A Personal Statement is personal, you should write who you are.", "A Statement of Purpose, on the other hand, should center around what you plan to achieve.", "In general, the important questions you should answer in your SoP are:", "Keep in mind that the reviewer is essentially looking for potential as a successful graduate student in your essay, so your main goal is to convince you are skilled and motivated to undertake your graduate studies.", "You want your SoP to be pleasant for your reviewer to read. It\u2019s important that your ideas are structured and flows nicely, so that the reviewer doesn\u2019t need to guess what you\u2019re trying to convey or jump between ideas.", "Here is how I structured my essay:", "Yours might not look like mine, but the general takeaway is to have a clear message/purpose for each paragraph/section.", "A good rule of thumb is to keep your essay under 2 pages long. Though you might have lots to say, it\u2019s important to be selective of details you want to include, since reviewers probably have hundreds of essays to get to.", "What worked for me was to write everything I wanted at first, and from there reformulate wordy phrases and omitting unnecessary detail. Make sure that everything you say is a crucial detail for why you are the ideal graduate candidate.", "Also, ask yourself \u201cwhat message do I want to convey with this?\u201d for each sentence. Don\u2019t just describe what you did in your project, make sure to state what you learned, what this proves about you:", "In my first programming project, I lead a team of 8 to build a LSTM neural network in C++ for music composition. I had no machine learning experience at the start of the project, and in 4 months, I assimilated the technical skills and machine learning notions needed to build and train the neural network. I also learned to design a machine learning project, from data retrieval and embedding to user interface for the model demo, and distribute these tasks within a team efficiently.", "The ideal essay captures the reader\u2019s attention right from the start and guides them through your ideas until the end. Don\u2019t go for a generic introduction and be creative!", "Instead of starting your essay with \u201cMy goal is to study Artificial Intelligence and develop technologies that help people\u201d \u2014 which really won\u2019t make your intro memorable or captivating \u2014 think of an anecdote, a reference, or even a joke that helps you ease into your main message.", "Here\u2019s how I started mine before moving on to explain my research goals:", "When my mother first started using a smartphone, she only used it to call. She wouldn\u2019t use other functionalities, such as looking up directions, until I taught her to orally ask the virtual assistant what she needs. This lead me to believe Natural Language Processing will bridge the gap between humans and modern technology.", "Admissions are looking for evidence you are the best fit for their program. Anyone can say \u201cI am very determined, hardworking and also I\u2019m a very quick learner\u201d but it won\u2019t make you stand out.", "A stronger message is to cite an example, in work or class or outside, that illustrates the quality you claim to have. For example, here\u2019s what I said instead of \u201cI am very determined, hardworking\u201d:", "With minimal experience in AI, I secured my NLP internship after attending 4 networking events, distributing 50 resumes and having 10 interviews.", "Unlike undergraduate studies, graduate admissions are looking for students who will work closely with them in the program\u2019s study area. You are their potential research assistants, teaching assistants, PhD students\u2026", "You need to show you know what kind of work they\u2019re doing and you have the specific skills that fit into their area of expertise. Don\u2019t hesitate to use technical terms when describing your experience!", "After becoming familiar with language modeling and self-attention, I built on recent research where I used cloze translation to synthesize question answering data. I also learned to code BiDAF and BERT models in PyTorch and perform cloud computing.", "Also, it\u2019s good to stalk some faculty and activities of your program, and show it\u2019s not just any program, but this specific program you desire. You can cite papers you found interesting or courses you\u2019d like to take:", "I am particularly determined to join the [university NLP lab] and research NLP for social good under the guidance of [really cool Prof #1], multilingual language analysis tools and reading comprehension with [really cool Prof #2]. I also want to incorporate [really cool Prof #3]\u2019s work in [really cool paper] to my research on unsupervised question answering for adversarial training of robust unsupervised QA systems.", "I usually kept the same first 1.5 pages for all my applications and catered the last 0.5 page to each specific program.", "An important step of SoP writing for me was getting feedback from different people, and reworking my essay over and over again.", "Examples of people you can ask to read over your essay are:", "I spent most of my time editing every detail of my essay until I had nothing else to change. Also, my first draft looks nothing like my final draft. This is why I highly encourage to start working on your SoP soon, to leave time for others to read it and give you multiple feedback :)", "The SoP may seem daunting at first, and it did take lots of work, but I still had lots of fun writing mine! It was a great exercise to formulate my specific interests, structure my experiences, and extract lessons I learned from them.", "It also forced me to reflect precisely on my motivations and even helped me understand what I was really looking for in my graduate studies. There were even programs I was preparing to apply, where I even obtained recommendation letters for, but while writing my SoP I realized it wasn\u2019t what I wanted, and I ended up discarding my application.", "I had good academic records, but I was mostly intimidated by my lack of work/research experience. I think my SoP and my recommendation letters helped overcome this by showing I have the potential and passion for graduate studies!", "Please let me know if I missed any tips, and you\u2019re welcome to reach out on Twitter or LinkedIn if you have any questions :)", "P.S. I committed to Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Master in Language Technologies where I will be working on multilingual NLP research!", "Your home for data science.
